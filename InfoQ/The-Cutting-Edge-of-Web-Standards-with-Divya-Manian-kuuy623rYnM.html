to give a little bit story of how I came
to be here talking in front of you guys
about contributing to web standards so
it all starts in 2003 when I was shown a
blog and a very well-designed blog at
that and I was like oh I want that like
I want that to describe who I am online
and I was told the only way to do that
would be to either create a livejournal
account or a blogger account and at the
time they both were really ugly looking
and I had to learn HTML CSS and all that
to create my site or my blog so um I had
to pick up this book and I'm sure you
all know what this book is and I started
learning HTML and CSS I was studying
Computer Engineering then and I started
understanding this and then I created
this atrocious website which actually
was really more atrocious with the
graphics which you can't see because
archived at all didn't save it but it
was my site I liked pink at the time
unfortunately but um so I created this
website and it was the beginning and
then actually a finish compare
engineering degree and then I started
working as a device driver developer at
Motorola writing embedded c++ and I lost
it five months in it and then I'm like
no this is not what I wanted to I want
to be a designer developer and then I
started freelancing and then I moved to
the u.s. to walk as a designer developer
for a design agency so you can expect
that I was feeling pretty smug like it's
a mission accomplished kind of thing I
was like I know everything that is to be
no one about HTML CSS I can create a
site in maybe half an hour what else is
there like I know everything I was even
considering a career change I was like
this is boring and then I was like maybe
I shouldn't you know come to such quick
conclusions i should actually look at my
core and see if I actually know verify
the so-called ex-partners that i think i
have so i have my own i I still had my
website so i opened the core of my
website and i started looking into it so
the first line that you have is it meant
which is okay HTML comment no big deal
and then the second line has a doctype
so that less than symbol the exclamation
marks and all those weird characters
afterwards and so I asked myself what a
doctype was so and I didn't know what
the answer was other than somebody said
I should use the doctype and I didn't
know why and then I started googling for
answers and I you know you go through
the first place it's all w3schools and
then that doesn't give you good answers
so you go through other pages and then
start finding out an actual spec which
is shocking because you don't till that
time I didn't realize it was a spec and
I also didn't realize people were the
spec authors had blogs and they wrote
about these things and I started
understanding what these dark times were
and it started documenting this in my
blog like I finally realized there is
something more to it than what I thought
I'd new and even going through the rest
of it like I didn't know why I was using
the HTML tag or the title tag was that
really necessary and I didn't know that
and the more I started looking at my
code the more I realized that I actually
didn't know all of these things that I
claimed I knew but once they started
researching these things I also was able
to talk to these speculators like I
figured out there's the IRC channel and
then I started asking questions they're
asking for clarifications and these
people are very helpful and it's not
like they're like they think there are
some big people creating these they're
like God's creating something
extraordinary and they can't talk to
humans nothing like that they're very
very humble and very very generous with
their time and that's when I started
understanding a lot more about what it
is to actually write for the web so with
all that that I gained I was able to
like spend much lesser time debugging
like for you know why doesn't something
work for ie why doesn't something work
for Firefox or whatever I understood how
browsers understand CSS HTML SVG and how
they render and because of that I was
able to spend significantly less time
trying to debug why some part of my code
was not working
and then I was also able to better
evaluate frameworks so for example if
you were you know people keep
recommending free books all the time on
Twitter or some blog or some influential
person tells you have to use this
framework and then you need to know
immediately whether that framework is
something you should use now or not and
for example let's take the example of
CSS spy css3 pie and that's something
that is claimed that will help you bring
these three features to IE but if you
start looking you wouldn't realize that
uses filters and it if you start
applying those filters to a large number
of elements it'll slow down the
scrolling of your page it's not quite as
useful at its claim to be so instead of
spending time you know having to face
this trouble at the end I was able to
evaluate these frameworks beforehand
rather than doing it afterwards but more
than all of his more than evaluating
frameworks more than learning to be a
better tellapur I also was very happy to
be able to influence web standards like
I didn't realize this would happen I
didn't realize what I had to say or the
feedback I had to give would be
considered relevant or useful by these
standards people but it was and I even
have an acknowledgment in the html5 spec
but it's it's it's not something that is
special anyone can do it and doing it
gives you makes you feel honored or I
don't know why there's a different way
to approach the web once you start
contributing back to it that then what
it was before so um there are different
reasons why you should be contributing
to web standards so the first thing is
the more you are vocal about the
feedback that you have to give the
faster the specifications will move so
if you have feedback about waterways or
flexbox or whatever start giving them so
people so the speculators can know what
they need to fix and so you can also
stop others from making the same
mistakes like if they find a you know if
you step into a problem and if you
document what the problem was then the
others can make sure that they don't
four star fall into that same pit wall
and make the same mistake and then maybe
these spec authors don't know what are
the problems that you face you know or
maybe you have written a lot of websites
that are huge and that have a lot of
problems that you face and you require a
certain feature to deal with those
problems Wow okay that you can't that
they don't know about so bring that to
their attention so they can do something
about it and write tests so because
right now we have so many new features
coming in every week so it's it's almost
impossible to make sure that the
browsers render these features
consistently as soon as they start
claiming they support this particular
feature so the more tests we write the
better we can ensure that the browsers
are consistent in their support of a
certain feature or API and so on and
then if you are interested in the
particular feature maybe you want to
write polyfills and extensions so that
people can start using that feature
already so people can give feedback on
if that syntax is appropriate of that
api is correct or maybe to return
something something else has a value
maybe you should take in an argument
that's differently so all of that would
help in moving the web forward so
ultimately the reason you want to
contribute to web standards is making
the web easier for you so if you want to
be a lazy developer you should be
slightly more active in the web standard
space than before so I keep talking
about specifications but what are these
standards what are these specifications
so everything that you are dealing with
is all documented in this URL called
platform that h2o faded org so it lists
all the specifications that impact you
as a web developer or designer so if you
are interested in any one of them just
go to that side and start you know
looking at the specifications and seeing
which one you're interested in
contributing to so any specification is
basically a bunch of content that is
there is nothing else to it it's just a
bunch of text and it is written for two
kinds of audiences one is for
implementers like browsers
it could be like people who are creating
apps that have a browser view or the
other audience is you web developers
designers whoever will be using that
feature to create code that will be
understood by these applications to be
browsers or anything so when you see the
specification typically you'll hear the
world complaints so there are two kinds
of compliance one is that browsers
comply to specifications and the other
is you write valid code as it is
mentioned in the specification and the
way you know that that's a browsers you
to comply but the specification is that
there's the word called normative so in
the specification you would see there is
each section starts with this section is
normative or this section is
non-normative so when it says it is
normative it means that section must be
implemented by the browser so when it
says this section is non-normative it
means the section exists to help you
understand what the other sections are
trying to do and once you have these
things there's also something known as
confirm ends requirements so that
implies that if you have a feature
that's being described then there is a
set of values that it can take and there
are certain values are invalid and
that's the conformance requirement but
there is two kinds of conformance
requirements one is implemented
conformance requirements and one is
author of conformance requirements so
for you as an author which means you web
developers designers you need to make
sure you're using only the valid value
for that particular property and/or use
it in the right syntax but the problem
is that a lot of you know the web that
is out there is written by people who
don't quite understand this so for
example you will see in CSS I have seen
this many times where you have
properties like border radius call in
none or you'll have border radius call
in black like what do people what do the
browser's do when they come across such
properties how do they make sure that
they break consistently so that is also
documented in these specifications to
make sure that browsers do not do their
own thing and users do not try to make a
take advantage of these invalid
behaviors and create hacks and so on so
so the specifications have to be written
such that they account for all of these
cases so these specs seem like it
requires a lot of heroic effort and it
does and these specs are written by what
is known as working groups and so you
have HTML working group there is a CSS
working group there's a hair SVG working
group and there's a group called tc39
that is working on xbox akma script
which is basically what eventually goes
for javascript and most of these working
groups are comprised of people who
represent companies who are interested
in these technologies so like a jobby
Google Facebook Twitter you know our
prom is hella all of these are members
of these working groups and they have
people represent them and their views on
these working groups but sometimes it
happens that you maybe you may see
people known as invited experts and who
they are are people who have been
actively giving feedback on a particular
technology or a particular specification
and then the working group considers
their view valuable enough to make them
officially a member of the working group
and all of this activity about the
working group the specification all
happens online like it's all documented
there is nothing that's behind closed
doors nothing of that happens so it
typically happens on mailing lists IRC
channels and then you have weekly
teleconferences which are also minuted
in the same IRC channel and then there
is quality face-to-face conversations
that happen as well and there was
actually one going to happen next the
week after next week in Leon in France
and it's going to be a gathering of all
WC representatives of different
companies and have conversations about
the standards so because it happens in
the open everyone can give feedback and
you can read all of these emails you're
welcome to hang out in the IRC Channel
especially the water the GRS SNL's
pretty noisy and active and then your
opinion is typically valued like you
need to express it in the right way but
i'll get to it a little bit later
so given that this is how specs walk
maybe you want to know how Venice pack
is ready to use so officially aspect is
ready to use when it is called a
recommendation and you know this because
when you go to a specification it'll say
a recommendation and there is nothing
else to it and then you'll have the spec
itself so the process is specification
takes to become a recommendation is kind
of a long one so the first thing that
happens is people interested in making
this specification propose to have a
specification to the walking group and
then if the working group is interested
or thinks it's worth pursuing this then
they will say go ahead and start working
on a draft and then the people who
express interest in this specification
would you know appoint editors and then
start working on the draft and then
it'll become editors draft and that's
where the latest activity or the
opinions of the raters are reflected all
the time and then it comes to the
working group and then the working group
decides if it should be published as a
working draft and then it gets published
as a working draft and then it becomes
the first published working draft and
then this circle keeps going on and on
until there's a time where it is you
know the working group thinks the spec
is more or less stable where you
typically will not be hearing like there
is not much more conversation going on
in the mailing list and so on and they
think it's all more or less ready in
which case they make this last call for
commence in which case that's the last
time you can make comments on that
particular specification it's getting
serious he's almost going to be a
recommendation and then there's it then
it becomes a candidate recommendation so
once it's a candidate recommendation the
only way it can become a proposed
recommendation is to have two or more
browsers implementing that and then once
that happens then you have becomes a
proposed recommendation and at that
point it's more or less done so unless
you have some really compelling
arguments why it shouldn't be a
recommendation it will go forward and
the only way to escape from proposed
recommendation to a recommendation is to
have two or more browsers the pass tests
associated with that specification so
the more robust the test they are the
better these
no browsers will be for that particular
spec and then it becomes a
recommendation so if you think this is a
long process it is actually because if
you look at the past timeline these are
all css3 specs so called and the average
time seems to be about eleven point five
years and but you know it is kind of odd
but but it gets better these days and
all of the newer specs that have been
proposed we have seen implementations
almost immediately so recently we have
seen turnaround times of three years or
less hopefully it will be lesser but
unofficially in my view aspect I would
think is ready to use when it has a
stable syntax and for example if you see
if you've worked with gradients you know
we have had at least four I trations of
the syntax until we settled on what we
have right now and say Matt flexbox
which had like million or alterations of
Cinda example we have settled on
something final now and then you need
stable implementations and in my view
three or more rendering engines and not
just browsers because you want it in not
just WebKit but also in IM trident for
IE and then get home make sure you have
as many rendering engines as possible
and that it that would imply that's more
or less stable to use and then it also
needs consistent behavior in all of them
so it can't be like if wine brown one
browser it does something in one other
browser does something else and then you
should have a you know a fallback story
that's good enough and for example if
you're using flexbox yea though in
browsers that do not support flexbox it
just looks completely unreadable like
people cannot even use your website if
you're using flexbox on those browsers
now that's not good so you should
ideally not be using flexbox until
there's a stable implementation in
multiple browsers so in my or if you
think this is all too much for you you
can just go to html5 please calm that I
created with a bunch of other people and
I maintain a where we have an open ated
list of features that we think are ready
to use and we outlined why we think it's
ready to use and how you should be using
them with polyphenols or
fall back and whatnot so if you are
interested in participating are two ways
to participate the first basic the
baseline is you have to be reading the
specifications and then asking questions
and then once you understand and learn
something more contribute back to the
documentation and make sure you document
what you've learned so I had a hard time
knowing where these specifications were
because there are different kinds of
specifications and the specifications
you that you are interested in are
typically editors drops and for CSS
those drops are located here and there's
a mailing list which is very very high
frequency mailing list so beware and
there's IRC channel which is usually
pretty quiet for HTML there are two
kinds of specification one is a stable
spec that said the which we see and then
there's the latest leading-edge version
or HTML next whatever you want to call
it that's on the what WG you are also
the IRC channel is pretty active very
active I rather have if you have
questions just ask on IRC channels
typically you'll get a response earlier
than on a mailing list and the mailing
list there are two mailing lists again
the public iphone HTML one you can only
read not subscribe but the word wg1 you
can subscribe so that's great and it's
also pretty that's where most of the
activity happens with HTML next stuff
anyway and for javascript that is the
ACMA script wiki page which outlines es6
whatever is happening and then there's a
mailing list as well and there's a
guideline on how to review yes six
drafts that i think is very useful if
you are interested in the next stage of
javascript so SVG there is work on going
on creating SVG to specification and
this also has a mailing list an IRC
channel which is also pretty quiet so
there are different ways you can give
feedback on specifications the first is
as a web developer and the easiest way
to give feedback is if you don't
understand what the specification is
dense or you know you don't understand
what it means so all these
specifications are not written to as a
cure for insomnia they are supposed to
be something that are readable and
understandable by you so if if you don't
under
stand and you should make sure you ask
questions in the appropriate forums that
I just mentioned and make sure you
clarify it so that other people who come
after you can understand this so there's
a the other one is if you find something
hard to use typically there are so many
features that are hard to use so maybe
you find multiple walk shadows hard to
use or something like that so give
feedback on those things so that they
can make it easier for you and maybe
there's an obvious use case for
something that's not been covered so
maybe there's a use case for instant box
shadow on images that is not being
covered and that you want to mention it
to this mailing list so mention it and
make sure that people know what that use
cases that aren't powering so maybe
there are some features that are in the
spec and they don't work as intended so
maybe we are trying it out on browsers
and you see that the browsers are not
doing the right thing and in which case
you would have to start filing bugs
maybe it's a specification blog or a
browser box so start doing that as well
and then there's a lot of people who are
coming to HTML these days who have been
doing programming on maybe C C++ or Java
or Ruby and whatnot and then they are
now forced to write HTML because that's
what their boss is still them and so
when they come to HTML and they start
looking at a cheval this is the first
reaction which is that the API socks
this CSS sucks everything sucks and
whatnot but you need to understand that
HTML CSS JavaScript has all been written
for making sure the content don't break
on the web so anyone we know your father
your grandfather your grandmother can go
to any website and make sure that they
can see and understand what those
websites say irrespective of how
terrible the web developer of that
website was so the HTML design
principles outlined a lot other
philosophies behind why HTML api's are
what they are and how they should be now
if you still think that this API could
be improved then go ahead and you know
find suggestions on how that can be
improved and maybe this is the second
common also this does not have an API
usually you have all these CSS
animations that are lacking in evens you
know there's not sufficient events being
fired maybe you should give feedback and
say this is not this is not happening
and you want this to happen and so on
and maybe there's a syntax that you
think is completely wrong and maybe
should give feedback on that so I really
think the CSS variables syntax is sucky
but i have given as much feedback as I
could I don't think I could improve it
but I mean if you think so then go ahead
and we woke up about it so at least they
know that it's not something that is
accepted by the community so there is a
way to give feedback there's no one
general mailing list well not quite for
most of these specifications so each of
these specifications has a area where it
tells you where to give feedbacks for
example in this exclusion spec you have
this heading called discussion and it
tells you what's the mailing list and
what's subject flying to use because
these editors get a lot of emails they
get more than fine our emails a day and
they need to filter these emails to make
sure that we respond to the appropriate
feedback and so you need to use the
appropriate subject line and then
there's a way to ask I mentioned that if
you ask in a way you would get a
response and you would your European
will be valued so there is a way to ask
that would give you a response and I
think this applies in general not just
to mailing lists for standards so the
first thing to do is should you even ask
so you need to search the mailing list
and find out if this question has been
asked before and a lot of times the
border radius or the box yet all the
examples that are just gave you have
already been asked and if you ask the
same question again people are just
going to ignore you they are not going
to reply because it's questions that
have they have repeatedly tried to
answer and respond so search the mailing
list and if there's something that has
been talked about and you still have
some concern that is different from what
has been asked then make sure you
reference those emails and tell the
people that hey my concern is different
so this is why you should be attention
and then right in plain text because
these people who are contributing to the
specs they get a lot of emails and they
have their own way
is of dealing with it so they may use
command line clients and whatnot so you
need to make sure that you reach as big
an audience as possible so right in
plain text and then in when you're
responding to some monies commence make
sure that you're responding in contact
so people know what you're responding to
so in line coat your response as a
snippet for example this is an example
of how that would look like so Boris is
responding two tabs comments and he just
snipped the particular line that he's
responding to so people know exactly
what your response is about and then
make sure that you cite references
because a lot of times if you don't cite
references it becomes into a troll
trolling you know match and everyone
starts having these emotional
conversations that just is not healthy
so every time you meet you you are
stating some facts make sure you back it
up and you have references to it so this
is an example from the avenue to this
mailing it to the CSS mailing list and
she has all these references in brackets
so people know exactly what it is being
responded to what's the context so they
can do this appropriately respond back
and then ask specific questions like you
can't just say oh this API Sox or the
syntax ox or I spent so many hours
debugging it's not working that no one's
going to respond to that like they don't
know what to react to so maybe you want
to say this syntax is not appropriate
these are the reasons this is my
suggestion what do you think so people
know whether to say yes or no and they
know what specific action to take and
then um basically whatever never you
write an email make sure you have done
the work so people know that I put an
effort to identify not just the problem
but also a solution and they know how
you failed so they can put in extra work
to make sure that they respond to you
and help you not fail so people do that
in the mailing lists all the time but
they just need to know that you've done
the effort and until you express that in
an email they will not be able to do
that
so there are lots of times you'll find
bugs and the first thing to do is that
you need to isolate the bug and you can
do that by going to any of these sites
tablet code pen and all of that and
create a simple task is that would
trigger the bug and chris squire has
written a great article how to create
test cases a reduced test case and once
you find about you need to figure out if
it's a specification Bob or it's a
browser bar and the way you would know
it's a specification bug is when it
every browser breaks randomly like it
has completely a different effect on
each browser you don't know what's the
right behavior now if it's just a
browser but you know that there's just
one browser that is not behaving as its
intended to be so it should likely be a
browser Bob but then again it's not so
clear but if once you start filing bugs
people will tell you if it's a browser
bug or a specification bug and you can
file appropriately the right bug and
before you even file a bug you need to
find out if this bug has been reported
because filing duplicate bugs is just
annoying so look for it and then see if
it's been reported if it has not been
reported and file a bug and now there is
also a good way to find a box so that it
gets resolved and I think this again
leah has written a great post on that
and reading and understanding and
knowing how to file a good bug it's not
just useful for the web it's also useful
in your own work and you know you may
have to file tickets for open source
projects and so on so that's going to
help you so once you start contributing
to the web you will find out that your
time is just slipping away from your
fingers it's just like very overwhelming
it's just you may want to just step back
and whatnot so you should make sure that
you preemptively schedule your time and
the way you would do that is first
filter all your emails because you're
going to get at least thousand emails a
day and that's not what you want make
sure you filter it to different folders
and you only look at it at a certain
aspect of the day so schedule your time
make sure you only look at them once a
week or twice a week or maybe an hour
every day and then maybe you want to
schedule weekly goals so I to Edward
O'Connor who now represents Apple at WPC
had these as a weekly
all except for the last one and for him
the goal was to always find a file a bug
or write a test case for any
specification or give feedback on a
future spec and i added the last one on
document a property or an API on the
platform the rod because it's simple to
do at least for the basic ones and you
can start doing it at any time you just
need to sign up on web platform org so
maybe your noodle are not interested in
weekly stuff then maybe you want to
participate in events so you have
hackathons there's something that's
coming up that pitch was going to talk
to you soon about and you also have we
organized esta web forward about a few
months ago in San Francisco where we had
web developers inators come together and
write tests for specifications and it
may seem like it's a very boring
activity but luckily it was actually
pretty good one and I participated and I
didn't know what CSS object model was
even and then when I started writing
tests I understood what that was and I
understood how badly supported it was in
browsers and writing those texts help me
understand all of these at the api's
that are available and so on so i
recommend you parts but there's one
you're going to have two more tests away
for words once happening in two days in
beijing and one in Paris next week
hopefully we'll have more of it soon but
if you're interested just follow that
Twitter account to find out when the
next one is happening so maybe you have
features that you want to test like you
may want to find what's the state of
support or what's up with index DB and
maybe you spend like two R's
understanding it and once you do find
out about it make sure you contribute
back so submit a pull request to html5
please calm and with your resolution
statements on these features that you
have tested so you know more than
anything else there are a lot of form
elements there are new and html5 that
have not been documented correctly and
we'd love to the requests on vegetable
pie please pound for those things
especially I think input email and so on
there are different things that happen
they would like to catalog and then
again this is most passive thing you
could do is document the web it's not
that difficult it's slightly difficult
you have to
a little bit time researching things but
it's it's pretty interesting to do and
then so join the platform the dog and
start contributing if you have questions
then ask on the IRC channel it's pretty
healthy and active a lot of us hang out
there will be able to help you and
contributing and there are all the other
ideas a bunch of us created this site
called move the web forwarded org so
there are a lot more activities you
could do maybe just pick one up and
start doing that so in summary these are
the things that you could do you know
read the drafts read the specifications
ask questions give feedback write about
what you have learnt and then you know
write tests or participate in events
make sure that you keep creating stuff
for the web</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
