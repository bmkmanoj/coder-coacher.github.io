of Scala test that is coming out in
Scala test 30 call called a sink testing
and what I want to start with is talking
a little bit about the past that is the
way you handle get in the java servlet
api how many people here out of
curiosity have ever used like use that
api directly oh my god i didn't realize
there'd be so many old people here so
what the way this worked is you you
implement this method it takes a request
in a response object and the response
object is like a wrapper for a socket
that's directly connected to the client
so you look at what was in the request
and you send things to the client and
then you return the result type and
there was no result type its Java that
was void so when the method returned the
request response was finished right so
that wasn't very reactive and so one of
the things are our play and spray kind
of web frameworks did was allow you to
return a future response so you can also
just give a synchronous response in play
and it looks like this so here I if I
have some intensive computation that
comes back to me as a future I can block
on it with a wait but this is uncool
right I'm not supposed to do that but
what that a weight that result does is
you pass it a future and then if the
future completes within 30 seconds it
will actually return the result and then
what you did is block of the thread and
then when it's done it will return the
response so that's that's sort of the UH
needy ematic way to do things in play
what you should do is return a future
response so when i get my future integer
back I just map onto that to get a new
future of type response and I can return
that to play and what play does is it
puts that on a shelf and then when it
completes it has a side effect of
pleading the request response cycle and
the point of it is that that modern jvms
in practice you can create a few couple
thousand threads before it the context
switching starts to dominate and you
have to it degrades performance so let
you make more use out of your threads
when a thread is blocked is not being
used essentially right so this whole
async testing thing came it started with
an idea I had or almost a panic i had
when i was teaching the company for my
gnome as typesafe splay course it was in
palo alto about two years ago or two and
a half years ago and we uh you know we
say this that you should not block you
should in return the future to the web
framework but it the place that you
might block is in tests right so it's
generally accepted that it's okay to
block in tests so this is an example of
a test where I've grabbed a future I've
got a future int and I block on it until
then it comes back and then I perform an
assertion so it's kind of like the the
three rolls of reactive programming our
rule number one is never ever block and
I've seen folks from the company for a
light Bend have it on in big block
letters you know never ever block it's
sort of the mantra so rule number two is
never ever block right but rule number
three is well alright maybe it's okay
some civ blog in your test and and and
so I was sitting in this class because
dick My partner dick wall was teaching
and I was ignoring him looking at the
code the test code and thinking this is
kind of a wishy-washy right why is it
okay to block in your test and it's
could that be my fault right so that was
what I was thinking essentially if you
can return a future response to a web
framework why can't you return a future
assertion to a test framework that was
what occurred to me and so it would look
something like this would look similar
to the thing you give back to play if I
have a future in hand and my test I just
map an assertion onto it and return that
future assertion to the test frame right
so I thought well that's interesting why
don't I ask the aqha folks so I emailed
Roland kuhn and victor clang and yonas
and heiko infant and just said what the
set does that sound interesting to you
and they pasted yeah you know maybe they
were positive but they I didn't really
get the feeling there was a burning need
so one of the things I tried to do is
not just just because an idea pops into
my head I try not to just stick it in
because already skull test has grown
really too big and I don't want to have
anything in there that isn't really
needed so I didn't do too much but on a
train ride to Colorado from California I
had a day and i had and i actually just
coated up kind of a mock not a mock but
like I coated up to to see if it would
work and and I got it something to work
I found it like a way to to I thought it
could fit into Scala test to do
something like this but still pretty
pretty much wasn't sure I would put it
in because i thought you know there
really was in this burning need and it
would add surface area and then later we
decided to supports college is so that
you could run scala tests on JavaScript
as well as a JVM and that turned into i
call it a trojan yak because we thought
it would take nine days to do that and
then it's still not done over a year
later right it turned into this huge
project and half of it was a sink
testing and so what happened is that in
javascript we learned that you can't
block the way javascript works is they
just have one thread going around the
circle and there's a queue of events at
not advance queue of jobs to do and that
thread will pick up a job do it pick up
at monticello do it pick up not the job
and do it's just one through it's kind
of like the eighth of tea or swing event
queue
or cute a thread and one of the things
the job can do is stick more jobs at the
end of the the Q right so you can't
block if it's just one thread right so
we thought that after six months of
slogging that we had finally met you
know shaved completely the Yak and then
we got this I thought I was about to
release release candidate one of 30 and
I got this issue posted that this isn't
working on JavaScript and it's this
feature value is a it's like a weight
but it's a escala test thing where if
you have a future you can call that
future value on it and it will block and
it takes an implicit patients to decide
how long the block and if it you know
completes within the time frame
successfully then it just returns the
value and then you can do an assertion
on it so it's the same kind of blocking
first and then asserting and what it
turned out is that JavaScript can have
multiple threads going on because you
can call outside the JavaScript p.m. and
then there can be more threads out there
so there's just one JavaScript thread
but if one of the things that thread
does is call into an API that actually
goes into c or java right some land
where they have multiple threads that
stuff can do something that takes a
while and sometime later come back and
stick something on the bottom of the
javascript cube so you can actually have
things going on concurrently in your
JavaScript and that's what this sample I
mean this person sample service get data
was doing it was going outside and then
we of course would not wait so we would
finish too soon because you can't block
and what we did for future value is it
just doesn't block it as soon as the
futures finished and we did that
thinking that would be good to have the
same code running on the JVM and on
JavaScript and if you use the run now
execution context in JavaScript that
will work so anyway when I saw that I
knew that the only way to fix that was
to make support async testing because
he's got a future if you can just map
this assertion onto
value on to that future value and return
at the Scala test and then skeletons
even on JavaScript you can just have it
sitting there on a shelf when that
feature finally completes and the way go
complete is something will come from
outside six something on the JavaScript
think thank you and that thread will
eventually get to it and then the
computer will complete at that time
scholarships can send the Senate event
to the reporter which is kind of like
the web frameworks sending a response to
the client this is the test framework
extending an event to the reporter
that's going to say test fields that
succeeded right so that took another six
months and so to to give you a kind of
an idea of what that is I'm going to
back up again and explain a few concepts
one is this thing called outcome which I
introduced in 2 dot 0 which is just a
small ATT that models the outcome of a
test so a test can either succeed it can
fail it can be cancelled or it can be
pending and succeeded and pending or
just singleton objects failed and
canceled have an exception inside of
them so that's outcome and then there's
a whiff fixture method in suite that
takes a test function and the type of
the test function is it doesn't take any
parameters and it returns an outcome and
then what the with fix your method does
by default is it just invokes that test
font and that's how a test gets executed
and then it returns the outcome that
comes back so the test function what may
return succeeded may return pending
whatever does in this case by default it
just returns that and what this will be
invoked for every test so that you can
override with fixture in your own test
class and do something before and after
it's not actually before and after it's
at the beginning of the test and at the
end of the test so that the test has not
stuff has already started when with
fixture is invoked the test has not yet
completed when the test function returns
so you can do things like retry it or
change the outcome that sort of thing so
so anyway that's what you might do in
your sub class is do some setup and then
in a try invoke the test function
then in a finally do some cleanup right
except there's one thing that I
recommend people do which is delegate to
the superclass to invoke the test
function instead of invoking it directly
I recommend you do this which is super
duck with fixture test because at the
end of the chain it's going to do the
the one on top there the default one and
invoke the test function so these guys
actually stacks you can compose with
fixture methods as long as you call
super dog with fixture so anyway that
was a 20 and then one thing most the
time people did that just in their test
classes actually I think a lot of times
people use before and after because
they're used to it from j unit but that
you I'm making mix in a trade because
this was supposed to be the like the
default way to do it you don't have to
mix anything in its just in there it's
in sweet but most uses a whit fixture
we're in the test class because you just
make one and you use it in that test
class but if you're using the same with
fixture in several test classes then you
can pull that out into a mix in trait
that you then mix into those test
classes so just one with me with
whatever the name of your trade is you
get that with fixture override and that
looks like this step retract traces is
actually one in Scala test that does
this you extend sweet mix in you have a
self type of sweet and then you override
one of the lifecycle methods in this
case with fixture but this one does is
it for a test cancelled exception or
test failed exception it will actually
take off the top part of the stack trace
that is above exactly where the
assertion was that failed so it's
changing the outcome by if it's if it's
a stack depth exception it will truncate
chopped off part of the stack trace so
to summarize the past users can define
with fixture methods you can compose the
with fixture methods by stacking traits
and according to the types and this was
the issue if it the the test is already
completed what's the test
returns so it's kind of like the cert
circulate API in that if you just look
at the types it kind of forces you to
block because do get when it returns the
response has finished it has to have
finished because there's no way to sort
of continue it and so that was sort of
one of the what we had to work with to
add a sink testing so one of the first
things we did was like I struggle with a
future of what so I'm going to actually
just demo this one so i can write some
code assert one no no x equals 1 in 20
and earlier that return eat the unit
singleton and it still will do the same
thing if it fails it will throw an
exception because otherwise all the code
would break in the world so it still
does the same thing as it did before but
instead of returning the unit singleton
object it returns the succeeded
singleton I just reuse that and then I
made a type alias which is org Scala
Tessa search and that's just a type
alias for the type the singleton type of
succeeded type so it had so a cert has
to return a singleton object but it
doesn't have to because it fails if
there was an exception right and then
mattress also like say X should equal
one that returns has succeeded and if
you say to that that blows up with the
same exception so basically that was one
thing i did and the reason was is that I
didn't want it I didn't want the type of
test to be future any or future unit
because it said it just sounds wrong and
it seems very error-prone I wanted to be
able to say you return a future
assertion to scala test just like you
say you can return a future response and
play or spray right so what is assertion
well that's what it is it's actually
this succeeded object okay and then we
just did that so well we did it by
adding bloat and this was one of the
thrill struggles i had was trying to
like it was already really big and i
didn't want to make it bigger and that
was sort of why i was skeptic
adding this feature in the first place
but Scotty has actually provided the
burning need I had to do it if either I
don't support scout j/s or I add a sink
testing somehow right so the way we did
it is for every of the many style traits
there's now an async flavor so for words
back there's a sink words back and the
difference is that a sink respect the
result type of the test is future
assertion and there's also an implicit
conversion from assertion to future
assertion so that if you want to mix in
some secret asst tests in the middle of
also some ate a sink ones than you can
right but that's what it looks like in
that in fact that's that you know what
how I that person could rewrite the code
now the person who his name is code
actually KO de he this guy forget his
first name chandra sekhar code so here's
the one that found the problem so to
rewrite this now he would just extend a
cig fund so we cannot use scala futures
and just returned a future assertion
just map the assertion onto the existing
future so that worked but I had to
figure out what to do with this because
this you know the type say the test has
completed when the test function returns
and now when the test function returns
we have a feature something with a
future of search and to start with so
what I ended up finally doing is is
adding two more type so sweet now has a
two subtypes test suite and a sink test
weight and these are where the type of
the test function is defined there are a
lot of other ways that we you know we
thought of all different ways to try to
like make it as simple as possible and
this is what we ended up with so the e
old with fixture that you're used to is
now in test suite and there's a new and
and acing twist week where instead of
outcome its future outcome which is
actually a new type and what future
outcome is it's like a future square
brackets outcome but but with a nicer
API because the problem is
the future when you work with it you'll
get a try which is either a success or a
failure and then if it's an outcome
that's either a succeeded a fail to
cancel their pending so if you want to
actually map like deal with a failure
somehow you have to catch success
failure and I just let that would be
confusing to people because they're too
similar it they both handle exceptions
but in different ways so I just wrapped
it with something and now there's just
an API that is very much the Scala test
domain language it's like skeleton
terminology so that's called future
outcome so the test function in an async
style returns future outcome the with
fix your method returns future outcome
and the default implementation just
invokes a test function again so that i
may leave that as a breaking change i
think i can actually find a way to
deprecate it i think that may be
possible i will see and if so i can i
will but all you need to do to fix it is
just put the word test in front it so it
won't break any code where you just
overrode with fixture in the test class
because that is inherited from test
suite so that's fine but if you actually
pulled it out into a mixing trait an
overall width fixture of the mixin trait
you can over wide a bunch of different
life cycle methods if you actually over
with fixture then that will eventually
be broken and you need to put the word
test in front of sweet in those two
places and that's it so i think that's
not too bad because people didn't do
that that terribly often okay so so then
now basically you're in future space and
i think the thing about i mentioned
there's a different mindset you have to
do and it's really just the the monett
the Monad might set that what happens in
the Monad stays in the Monad basically
you don't ever want to block and pull
the thing out of it you want to just
keep sort of stay in future space right
so I a bunch of things didn't work
anymore one of them was try fine let me
back up and show you remind you try
finally again see if this tri finally
here where you try in calling the
delegating the invocation of the test
function and you do some setup you've
sort of invoke the test function in try
and then a final you do your cleanup
if what your test function is returning
is a future outcome then you don't want
to do clean up that same when you
actually want to wait until the feature
completes see the problem so what I
created instead of try file either is
complete lastly and that the very the
reason I picked that is because this is
not fixed width font but those in fixed
width font those two curly braces at the
end line up but it's like try finally
but for futures and it will work on
anything that I had to create a new type
class so it's called futuristic which I
thought was cool so it will work for any
type T where there is a futuristic of T
to find and I defined one for a future
outcome and any other kind of future so
it'll work in your test code on futures
also and what it will do is if that
blows up like if the code that produced
some futuristic thing blows up with an
exception that's so instead of try it's
complete complete the future if that
blows up with an exception because it
could it will actually execute the code
and lastly just like finally but if it
returns it's different than finally it
doesn't execute it at that point it just
registers a call back on that future to
execute when that feature completes and
it returns a new futuristic thing that
won't complete until the that callback
is completed so that that's the other
problem with like the futures API like
future square brackets outcome it didn't
quite fit because I always wanted to
give a new future back that even
complete until the cleanup happens the
callback finishes so there's a non on
success on failure and on complete that
won't wait I'll make you just they'll
just do it off to the side there's an
end then on future that will wait so it
gives you a new feature back that
doesn't complete till that thing
finishes so you can order your callbacks
but if that thing blows up with an
exception it just ignores it and I
didn't want that I wanted it to behave
the same as synchronous so if you know
and it's a complete lastly if if the
what's in lastly blows up with an
exception the future that complete
lastly returns will actually show that
exception so and because if the finally
blew up in
synchronous case that test would fail
with that exception right so that's
that's complete lastly so that's one
example of something new that we had to
invent to sort of support this another
one is now that there's a result type of
assertion some things wouldn't work
anymore and so like for example
intercept is a an assertion that will
make sure a exception is thrown by a bit
of code and then return it so you can
perform more assertions on it and so
people use that all over the place
including at the end of tests but that's
not type assertion that's type on this
case string index out of bounds
exception so that actually wouldn't
compile in an async sweet if that was at
the end of the test buddy so I created
an assert throws that does the same
thing but doesn't return the exception
so that's new so that you could stick at
the end of an async style test but if
you actually want to say that you expect
the future will fail with an exception
which is something you might want to say
in an async test now you got to stay in
future space neither of these work you
can't really map that future and then
add an assert throws because well first
of all there's nothing to put in those
dot and you know the dot dot there and
map won't even be invoked if the I mean
that test function won't be invoked if
the future fails and likewise if you put
assert throws around the future it
doesn't throw an exception I just fails
right so we had to create two new things
that are kind of like intercept and
assert throws but for futures and one of
them is recover two exceptions so the
future API calls it recovering if you
are like go from an exception back to
some kind of success so I had one called
add one called recover two exception if
illegal state exception so it's like
recover in future except it has to be
that exception recover will do it if any
kind of exception it will recover from
this one won't recover from the wrong
exception it'll give you a test failed
exception that that says hey I expected
this exception but I got that one
so when you put a future inside that and
then recover to succeeded is like a cert
throws it does the same thing make sure
that the future fails with that
exception but if it does it doesn't
return it returns succeeded singleton so
they can end up at the end of a test if
you want so that's recovered two and
there's actually a lot more to the story
what I thought I mean one of the
questions is like let me go back up to
the diagram here so imagine you've got
ten of these tests and they all return
the future assertion do they run in
parallel because it's kind of like the
idea of this stuff right that you might
expect they should and so I thought well
okay why not and then people said
actually can you make it not run in
parallel because they would put some
kind of fixture that they wanted all
their tests to share like a database and
they didn't want them to interact like
interfere with each other so by default
they don't run in parallel which is kind
of weird but they don't first that they
run asynchronously so it could be many
different threads potentially but the
first one finishes before the second one
begins and that one finishes before the
third one begins okay so that's one
thing and then whenever you do future
dot map you need an execution context
right and you there isn't one so I
actually at one point made you create
one but then I actually thought well
that's a lot best boilerplate why don't
we give people a default and the thing I
was worried about with the execution
context is like it's usually a thread
pool like it's multiple threads because
the whole idea is to use multiple
threads but that makes people reason
about like in test people will make
mutable fixtures and stuff up there that
is functional sometimes and so if you're
using mutable state you need to worry
about synchronizing access to shared
mutable state and it in a future if you
just do a linear transformation in
futures even if it's having side-effects
and mutating state it will actually work
because of the you know the what future
does it will synchronize it but it's
hard to know when you like don't follow
the rules and now you've got a
concurrency bug in your tests it's not
so terrible in your test but it could
end up with a flicker and be waste
people's time so so what we did for a
default execution context is made one
called serial execution context with
nobody can access but it it actually
just remembers what you asked it to do
it actually makes them on those old job
queues so that the test the thread that
goes and execute your tests body and
returns a future result anytime at need
an execution context it would remember
that thing to do and put it in a queue a
list of to-do list and then that same
thread is used to execute that Q so
that's the same thread sculpt thread
confinement so you don't have to worry
about synchronization it also means you
can't block because like JavaScript
there's just one threat now so if you
actually use the default execution
context and do one of these blocking
things it will just hang forever which I
think eventually you'll figure it out
that one but I thought so we did that
but then it's like what about on
JavaScript so on JavaScript for a while
we we did not use that one but then we
started using it because we thought I
mean I wanted it to be consistent and I
think it's valuable that you write
people want to share code between the
JVM and JavaScript that's sort of the
point of Scala jayus i think is people
who are already using scala and they
have to make JavaScript if they can
actually share some code and you know
that's in knowledge so I just wanted as
much as possible to make it work the
same so that's what we now by default
even on on JavaScript the default is
serial execution context so if you
really want to do something
multi-threaded that's what I'm kind of
concerned about with JavaScript if you
want to do something multi-threaded you
gotta add different execution context
override this one with a new one and on
the JVM also because if you really want
of thread pool going then you just make
a new execution context so I did trike I
said try to make these two things
consistent to help people go back and
forth before and after work because any
kind of
after code is registered as you know on
a future like thing and the new thing
that comes back doesn't complete until
the after code finishes right so I still
recommend with fixture but if you use
before and after in future space it
actually works you're just doing side
effects at that point but they happen
when you think it would happen and
parallel test execution works too that's
how you do get parallel test execution
and what's weird which I didn't think
made sense but turned out actually did
is it works on JavaScript to and it's
like how can you have parallel test
execution being a valuable at have any
value at all if you just have one thread
right and the reason is is imagine you
have those 10 tests and each one calls
into one of those AP is that does
something for 30 seconds and then later
comes back and stick something at the
end of the JavaScript q it'd be nice to
get them all started because it really
is multi-threaded instead of taking 30
times 10 300 seconds it could take you
know closer to 30 seconds to finish that
suite of tests so my hope is and I
thought I was close to finishing this I
thought it was close to rc1 twice before
and I got one of these like issues that
took another so I probably shouldn't say
this but that last line I don't want to
attempt the universe with another you
know bold released but I think I think
we really are there hopefully so I just
want to leave some time for questions so
we have time for questions but before
that I did want to save it whoops went
backwards Nermin and Andrew who did this
puzzles book are here and we're going to
do a book signing after Christopher
stock and we're gonna get away three
copies and we usually throw out these
puzzles but we didn't get that organized
so we have my business card like out of
date business card and I put a puzzle on
back it's a really soft ball it's not a
trick question if you come over and
bring this and solve the puzzle we'll
give you a free copy but anyway we'll be
out there and the break but I like to
try to throw them but I don't want to
hit anybody the eyeball so everybody
wake up I'm going to go one in the
middle of what does 33 Rose is perfect
so way over there
I'm trying tried it oh wait wait wait
wait I was practice I hit my we needed a
dud I don't kill quit my day job yes all
right don't try that again huh oh there
you go look at that it just floated down
like snow those guys are really fighting
for you can see that they all right here
we go sorry I'm gonna have to get in the
back here because I'm not crumble it up
that's my business card oh well they
don't I'm sorry people in the back but
it's like the eager people in front get
the free copy and the other thing is of
course other thing as free as these
stickers if you want any scholar
stickers you made some of those but i'll
have my on the table but anyway i have
five minutes for questions if somebody
has questions yes oh we get my glasses
yes go ahead i not being deprecated so
the question was we've been using when
ready which is also in that that scholar
features thing which get where the
example was when I said future value I
think it was actually in his code yeah i
was in coats code where his coats good
somewhere here it is so this not future
value another another contract in scala
futures is when when this future is
ready you know it'll pass it in and you
can do an assertion so that's blocking
don't work on JavaScript but it works
fine on Java and the other thing that's
a little weird is usually this stuff's
about never ever block right so that's
blocking but it's not necessarily bad in
a test now i sound like being wish you
watch again but the reason is is because
one of the other reasons we have this
serial execution context is that if if
it's really doing something asynchronous
then what could happen is that the queue
empties there's no more jobs to do but
the test hasn't finished so what we do
in that case is we block so we actually
block by default with the serial
execution context and the reason is is
if I
do that if you lenders if you always use
the glow like the global execution
context is the default or something you
could get a situation where 500 tests
start at once because there's nothing
throttling them and then they you get so
many going that they timeout right so
that's I don't so block so even if you
use this it still might be blocking a
little bit behind the scenes to throttle
how many tests are running at the same
time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
