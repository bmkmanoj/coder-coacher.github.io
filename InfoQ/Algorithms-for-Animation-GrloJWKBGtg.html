flattered and awesome to have you all
here so we're gonna talk about math for
40 minutes okay that's the total lie
we're not gonna talk about math for 40
minutes but we are gonna talk about
animation and motion and we're gonna get
into the nitty-gritty of the details of
the math behind it
so hi my name is Courtney hampel I work
at carbon 5 I'm a partner in a tech lead
there if you're one of those people that
love Twitter love Twitter love me on
Twitter I would love to meet you guys if
you're not a Twitter person then you can
email me I am going to briefly talk
about motion and really humans
perception of motion and why it's
important then I'm gonna talk about
animations in interface design so this
is something that is actually being used
more and more both in sort of the mobile
iOS world as well as web interfaces and
so why it's important and how it really
helps us to understand what interfaces
can do for us and Intuit what we need to
be doing in an interface and it'll go a
little bit into the frameworks briefly
I'm not going to dive in really deeply
but kind of the trade-offs of each one
of them and what situations are good for
which frameworks so that's sort of the
general gist of the talk and really my
objective with this talk is kind of
twofold actually part of it is to give
people that foundational knowledge of
math that backs up animations and more
so for the fact you know Christian kind
of brought this up in his keynote
knowing kind of the underpinnings of all
of those frameworks that are stacked on
top of it will allow you when you run
into these situations to really figure
out how you need to fix it and how you
need to tweak it to get what you want
out of it and to really be able to play
around with animations in JavaScript and
CSS in a way that will inform you and
allow you to sort of flex and expand
that knowledge without diving straight
into a framework the meta purpose for
this talk is really kind of bridging
that gap between designers and
developers I think that you know
designers have so much power with you
know Dobby After Effects in these motion
programs but then translating that into
the web unless they've got you know
crazy Rockstar developer at their side
can be sort of difficult and it's
they're very different domains the
performance is different you know how
things interact with one another they're
very different
web versus our sorry desktop versus
mobile very very different
so having designer sort of have an
understanding of the the nature of what
they could do potentially actually doing
their animations testing them out
designing them on a browser versus doing
it in something like After Effects I
think could be really powerful and
equivalently I think developers honestly
by nature they get animation I mean we
all move we all see cartoons we all sort
of know what animation is being able to
have developers understand a little bit
about the basics of animation so sort of
bridging that gap and on that note I'm
kind of curious who the heck I'm talking
to how many people are here are straight
up developers just do development so
it's totally the majority how many of
you are designers just designers you
feel like you only design suite that's
awesome
unicorns whatever share your horns
people that kind of do both like you
feel like you've got come on developers
you guys you yeah thank you okay so you
know I'm traditionally trained as a
developer yet I feel like I actually
like being an interface a little bit and
like being able to feel like I can
design things and I think all of us if
you're partnered with a talented
designer
you can actually have a lot to say about
what the way in which things work the
way in which things can be intuitive the
way in which they can feel right or not
feel right so sort of bridging that gap
is something that I think is you know we
don't feel comfortable doing like you
have a designer but you do have an eye
for design even if you're a developer
all right so this is gurdy this is the
character that was created by Winsor
McCay he was one of the first animators
at Disney and Gerti was the prototype
let's say for Disney's foray into motion
animation so right now we're looking at
Gertie and Gerdes you know kind of cute
we don't know a lot about Gertie but if
we put Gertie into motion
slow Wi-Fi wait for it wait for it wait
a little longer for it yikes this is the
speaker Wi-Fi to you so here's our
little Friday Friday morning get your
fruit
all right so that's Gerty so close out
of that
so Gerty just got a lot more interesting
I mean that's no NEMA this is not you
know DreamWorks or Pixar but that little
bit of motion made Gerty a lot more
interesting a lot more entertaining to
us you know backed with music obviously
if that becomes really fun so Disney
what they ended up doing was figuring
out all right if we take each frame of
an animation and we create movement
between those frames and then we just
take pictures and stack them on top of
each other and this is a flipbook right
this is your most basic animation frame
by frame so eventually what they
established was this way where they
would get their senior designers to come
up with key frames and then they would
have sort of you know the grunt work
being done by these people called The
Inbetweeners so they were the people
that would take one key frame and look
at the next one and they would create
all the key animations that go would go
between those key frames sorry all the
frame animations that would go between
those key frame animations and that now
is done by software and the interesting
thing is if you were to think about a
human they're going to be able to sort
of naturally know if Gerdes head should
move in a certain way versus another way
because they know how naturally that
should go but interestingly enough math
and physics can do can go very far away
in mimicking those natural movements so
it's kind of what we're gonna be talking
about today first off though I wanted
briefly to go into how animations are
being used in interfaces today and why
they're important so animations serve as
being cognitive aides there's a book by
Don Norman called the design of everyday
things and in it he talks about
affordances so affordances this idea of
if you look at a chair you kind of have
some knowledge about this chair before
you ever even touch it
you can kind of afford a use case for it
you can also afford dynamics about it
you know if you pick it up from one
handle it's going to swing in a certain
way you know if you sit down at it it's
going to probably take your weight and
you'll not fall over on it so these are
things where physical objects can have
affordances there really it's a
desirable property and you can actually
take this and translate it to user
interfaces and in that case he calls
them either perceived affordances or
signifiers but one example of a
signifier is when you have the button on
the bottom of the old iOS
and it it was a camera but it had the
camera had little ridges surrounding it
and it was sort of this indication it
was a signifier that you could maybe use
that as a button and slide it up and
down and then once you actually did that
it sort of jumped right you had a little
animation that also signified oh there's
something underneath there and when you
sort of did a little bit more of a swipe
then you saw that the camera would
appear from your lock screen so these
are things where you can you can train
your users and trains may be a bad word
but you can educate your users on what
you want to have happen in an interface
by subtle motions so that's why motion
is powerful and that's why we can use it
as both developers and designers to sort
of add information to an interface in a
lot of different ways so humans are
actually interestingly enough kind of
crap at peripheral vision elements we're
really good at seeing motion in the
periphery but we're really bad at seeing
color changes in periphery or even a
shape sort of shifts if it's motion
that's moving we can sort of sense it
but if it's other things we can kind of
do a good job of ignoring it because
innately we've just evolved to do that
so an example of using motion and
interfaces to allow us to know really
what's going on is I'm sure you guys all
know sort of the Pinterest style
progressive loading so this is something
where you know it's a very subtle
animation there's not a lot going on
there but your eyes are drawn to the new
content that's coming in and you're not
looking behind you you kind of get what
was past you get what's future and your
attention is continually being drawn
additionally we can give a lot of
information so here's two buttons
they're both pretty similar one you know
okay it's wrong we totally get that a
lot of information has been translated
into us this one sort of not that we
know a lot more about it but sort of the
playfulness of it and sort of that
mimicking of the shaking of a head it
allows us to honestly be a little bit
more familiar with the interface at this
point so really subtle things can
actually do a lot for our interfaces I
mean that button takes like 0.2 seconds
to create and CSS and it adds so much to
someone's experience of what you're
presenting to them so another thing is
that our ability to see navigation and
to understand sort of the map of a
landscape is definitely tethered to
animation if you can see too
when you've got menus that slide in from
the left slide in from the right slide
top bottom when you're seeing these
things happen if something slides in and
out you sort of have this map of the
environment in which you can manipulate
things and you know that this menu is
sort of existing on the side and there's
a map to it on the side so parallax
scrolling probably overused at this
point but to great effect you know we
don't have to wait for loading of pages
if you're jumping between portions of
that scrolling page it's really jarring
you actually you kind of get what's
happening but at the same time you're
like it's you're taking somewhere and
you're not really ready to go or you
don't really know where you're going and
what the context is if you do a very
subtle animation to that this is what
you know scrolling parallax does is you
now have an understanding of exactly
where things to live on the page and you
can sort of take control at that point
you can scroll back to the About section
you know what's going on another thing
is progressive disclosure you know we
don't really want to know all the
information we want to know the
information that's relevant to us so we
can do a lot with animation to sort of
progressively disclose things to people
in a manner in which is very fun it's
very easy we're sort of getting guided
through it we can kind of become again
more familiar with an interface so
really simple animations can go a long
way to have us be using interfaces in a
way where we don't have to read a bunch
of content about how we need to use the
interface we can kind of be guided
through it so I mean this is sort of an
example from ages ago but Twitter was
the first one to come up with this like
scroll to refresh really nice to not
have to hit a button to refresh things
it's you know people were so happy to
have this and it did a couple things
that you knew something was loading you
knew something was coming we were
anticipating and then you knew where
that content was gonna go and if that
content didn't show up you knew that
there was no new content to live so
super easy way to tell people a lot of
what was happening without needing to
change or do a screen refresh or
whatever it was just a small animation
and people kind of got it so this sort
of goes back to the thing how do you
communicate animation ideas if you're a
designer how do you do it in a way do
you vocalize it do you present something
that's a movie that was done in After
Effects
can you play around with things in a
browser I think that what I'm trying to
describe today are ways
that you simply can figure out ways to
communicate and play around easily in
the browser with different ways to
animate things that are exist on your
interface so we're gonna dive now into a
little bit of math so I will absolutely
say that I am NOT a math wizard by any
stretch of the imagination my math
skills are probably along the lines of
my French skills which is to say poor
however even with my minimal set of math
skills I feel like I can do a lot with
animation so I'm gonna walk you guys
through my you know simple knowledge of
math and then if anyone asks me a hard
question I'm just going to defer okay so
moving pixels this is back to sort of
the Disney style animation frame by
frame by frame
we're just taking really stupidly this
little pill from the left side to the
right side so this totally works right
this is animation this is traditional
flip style animation frame by frame by
frame by frame the only bummer about it
is that okay it's a little bit boring
that's one thing but it really only
works well when you know sort of exactly
where you started exactly where you want
to go and time has no consideration in
this so if you wanted to extend this if
you wanted to get really sophisticated
with this using just this formula just
this sort of iteration over frames
you're gonna have a hard time right
there's no room in this function for you
to do anything cool so what we want to
do is cool stuff and the basic
foundation of that is this linear
interpolation function so it's really
actually quite simple and if you look at
it you can kind of even break it down
pretty well what we're trying to get
with interpolation is a mapping and it's
mapping everything that you're thinking
about with animation to some number
between 0 and 1 so you want to know that
there's time that's gonna happen kind of
percent complete between 0 &amp;amp; 1 there's
also going to be whatever it is that
you're animating whatever percent it is
through that animation so trying to get
everything to get between the 0 &amp;amp; 1 it
does a lot of things it gives you a lot
of power right between 0 &amp;amp; 1 you can
then start to do a lot of powerful
things with easing functions with that
number additionally if you think about
it if you take a number between 0 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp;
you take another number between 0 &amp;amp; 1
and you multiply them together you still
get a number tween 0 &amp;amp; 1
so this ends up allowing you to use a
lot of math and a lot of physics to do
some really cool animations so what I'm
trying to get is for everyone to think
about things in terms of really
percentages percent complete percent
done and really the beginning of this
equation that end minus the start if you
start at zero and you win at nine
hundred this equation becomes even more
simple I mean you really at that point
in time you have your end and then
you're chained your percent complete so
this equation is actually very
simplistic and we're just gonna look at
that time divided by duration that's the
really interesting bit and that's where
we can start to create some fun stuff so
this is an identical animation that
we've already seen so now we're looking
at though is that we have context of
time we have context of percent complete
we could swap out pixels for opacity or
shape changes or whatever it is so all
of a sudden now we have the capability
of getting a little bit more powerful
with this function so this is still
interpolation it's just a linear
interpolation it's consistent unvarying
progress from 0 to 1 so what we want to
do is add some variety into this because
nothing in our world actually moves
linearly so this is kind of a fun quote
that I love this is one of the one of
the physicists who that was on the
Manhattan Project but he he was one of
the I guess forefathers of the nonlinear
science movement and he has this great
term which is or quote using a term like
nonlinear science is like referring to
the bulk of Zoology is the study of non
elephant animals so this is really the
idea that we live in a very natural
world we live in a world that is just
seeped in physics and math and whether
or not we sort of see that visually we
feel that very intrinsically and we're
gonna respond in kind so natural
movement is something that we find very
comforting you know if we drop a ball on
the floor it sort of has this like
bounce squeeze stretch effect if we roll
it across the floor we expect it not to
come directly to a stop and if it did
we'd freak out probably and run out of
the room and be like what the heck just
happened so we sort of expect things to
act in a way and when you're designing
for interfaces and when you're thinking
about animations you have to sort of
consider those things too if you stop
something too abruptly you've maybe lost
all your use
so thinking about things in that term is
something that can be really powerful
and this is where easing functions come
in so in this function we are still
really going from zero to one all we're
doing is going from zero to run in a
very different rate so at some point in
time here our rate is going to vary more
quickly than then at another time and
this is where the power comes in to sort
of make make the movements make the
animations that you have on your screens
feel more natural so the eases the
easing functions are really kind of what
I was saying before your you're getting
them the time of her duration your zero
to one number this is where you insert
your easing functions this is where you
start to get to manipulate things the
rate at which you're going from zero to
one is what matters
you're still gonna start at zero you're
still going to go to one but it's the
rate at which you're doing so so the
easiest easing function if I don't
repeat myself there is the power
function so this is you know we all sort
of went and did you know multiply one
thing times itself and that is to a
power of two right so it's really easy
to conceive of these easing functions in
terms of power in terms of power
functions because all you're doing is
that you're rapidly accelerating
something you're exponentially
increasing the rate at which something
is being attained right so it's going
from zero to one but it's going to go
from zero to one quicker and quicker as
the as the animation gets applied so
this is sort of the Ferrari effect you
and again not the most exciting of
animations in this world but it does
allow you to see we're now getting
something that feels a little bit more
interesting to us easing out is
something that you see a little bit more
used in interfaces and part of this is
you kind of have things slide in and
naturally stop so this is very much if
you've ever heard of Disney's 12
principles of animation design one of
them is this it's the idea that things
that move from your peripheral vision
into your center plane of field they
they start at velocity so you're
expecting things actually when they come
in from your peripheral visions to
actually move really really quickly and
then as they reach sort of your center
of vision they're going to slow down so
this is just the easing function that we
saw before it's just to a power but
you're just inversing it
so it's starting really fast and then it
slows down so again really simple
function the math here is pretty
straightforward you just got you know
your percent change here time over
duration and you're just exponentially
increasing it and then your inversing it
to get the ease out so let's think about
trigonometry a little bit not something
that I love but really powerful in the
world of animation this is when subtlety
really becomes important so again you
know if you have the Ferrari effect on
something's moving at lightning speed
very very different than if you have
something that feels like it's eased in
quite naturally you're just like oh look
it's arrived so this is where when
you're doing lots of animations on a
page that effect doesn't seem like it
changed that much but if you've got a
lot of things moving around the way in
which they interplay is where you can
things have things feel a little bit
more organic or feel a little bit more
drawing so this is where you can start
to get trigonometry in to make your
easing functions feel a little bit more
natural so I was talking a lot about 0
to 1 we want everything between 0 &amp;amp; 1
keep your stuff ok total lie you can
actually get things outside of that
bracket of 0 to 1 and when you do that
it's called follow-through also called
elasticity so this is an animation
technique when you want to have
something kind of go beyond its final
resting point and then snap back into
place
so it's definitely kind of a fun effect
at you know the rubberband effect it's
something that we absolutely see in the
real world quite often and it's
something that people absolutely use in
interfaces so what you're trying to do
here is introduce a function to where
you can kind of have something have a
little playful snap effect so this is
the elasticity function and just a
reminder all of these functions are
available in a ton of different
frameworks so if you need to know the
actual function for the ease or whatever
it is that you want to do they're very
easy to look up and all you have to do
is remember you're just swapping
whatever that function is in here so I
will fully admit that you know the basic
underlying tenants of this function and
what's happening I don't dive into that
right but I know that I can go look up
elasticity function and I can plug it
into here and I can play with it and I
can play with the numbers that are
relevant right so s is just sort of a
multiplier times this power function
right we're just the K value is the time
divided by duration so that's our
percent complete and I
tweek around those to make sure that
whatever animation I'm getting here sort
of that bounce effect is the balanced
effect I want do I want it to go faster
do one when I got slower that s number
is the one that I can tweak so playing
around with this stuff allows you to
just let yourself have more knowledge
about what the heck is going on so you
can look up these functions you can plug
them in and you can play with them and
that it'll give you the foundational
knowledge to where you can be like okay
I get it now I can move on to using
frameworks but then when your frameworks
not doing what you want it's gonna let
you dive in deeper and make those
changes that you want to change so the
last one I'll go around is bounce bounce
is fun it's a lot better than blank we
see it used a lot and it is way more fun
and just kind of a little bit of
playfulness for an interface so again
this using function all of a sudden got
kinda gnarly if you start to walk
through it you realize mathematically
it's not that big it's just it's almost
saying you know if it's in this value do
this you know have it kind of bounce
when it hits this value so you can
understand these functions pretty
implicitly and then again once again you
can change the numbers as you want to so
tweak them to get the exact animation
that you want to use so all of these
things are really fun however putting
them all together is where it really
gets interesting so this is an animation
that was done by one of the developers
at carbon 5 he has two little girls so
for fun at night he'll sit down and
he'll create just straight-up HTML pages
with some nutty animations and in order
to do this when he actually went through
this kind of fun exercise that he was
describing to us he filmed his hand
moving around a screen or moving around
in front of the video camera and he was
trying to mimic sort of the pattern of a
bird and what he was doing was he would
take that video and he would sort of
like pretend like his hand was a bird
and then he would stop the video frame
by frame by frame and what he was doing
was he was trying to figure out which
functions which Easons he could use to
mimic how birds would sort of react and
so then he ended up creating this
animation based on these specific
customized easing functions to have sort
of this dynamic nosov you know what do
the birds do when they kind of stop do
they like they don't stop suddenly
obviously what happens when they all hit
the wire together you know what happens
when they're they're close to one
another do they you know sort of what is
that animation look so anyhow this this
is where you can get kind of powerful in
animations and playing around with them
and this is Alex Cruikshank you
the one of the developers at kerbin 5 so
finally I wanted to talk about tools I
just went through kind of how you can do
this pretty simply with some simple
functions however to get really complex
oftentimes you do want to resort to
tools you don't want to really custom
roll your own parallax scrolling that
would be such a pain in the ass there's
no reason to do it that's a solved
paradigm so I wanted to talk a bit about
the tools which ones are worth it not
which ones are worth it but the specific
situations in which some of these tool
sets can be used and what the trade-offs
are so now that you guys know sort of
what's happening under the hood you can
also dive into these frameworks and sort
of investigate them a little bit more so
software is something that's I've never
used it's used often by the designers
that I work with these are the ones that
I've seen and heard them use that's
totally i totally use keynote but not
for animation anyhow these are great
they're incredibly powerful you can do
nutty animations with them they're
really performant animations translating
animations from this sort of domain onto
the web and even more so on to mobile
way way trickier so it's really you know
if you want to do animations for
something that's gonna be you know a
game design or something along those
lines starting at this point and then
doing the translation might make sense
doing something that's a really simple
kind of natural like inspection of user
interface it might make more sense to
actually start in the browser so if
you're gonna start in the browser one
place to start are some of these
JavaScript frameworks so framer J is in
between J s both are really good at
doing pretty simple animations another
one that is based off green sock green
sock has a lot to do with some of the
parallax frameworks that you've probably
seen gzip is there sort of punch at
doing animations and overall sort of
just JavaScript interactions it's pretty
powerful because it's pretty performant
it's about 20 times as performant as
jQuery jQuery I throw in there because
it's something that people use a time
jQuery is definitely not the most
performant if you're doing a ton of
animations and when I say a ton I mean
literally like you're spinning hundreds
of balls out of your user you know in an
animated way at a time that's where
you're gonna see performance constraints
if you're doing something like just
moving a div in jQuery animate is going
to be just fine so def
before you start to bag on one framework
over another just consider what it is
that you're doing you know if you're
already using jQuery and you just need
animation use jQuery if you need really
performant animations that are going to
be moving multiple elements at a time
and they're gonna have interactivity
then I think she's up SMO better idea so
CSS is is awesome now I mean being able
to play around with the animations with
CSS is fantastic you have to do a lot
less straight-up coding but you still
have to understand what keyframes are
and what some of these Bezier curves and
what some of these trig functions are so
animate CSS is a great one a lot of the
sass and less libraries have plugins the
the thing that CSS gets you that is
really powerful is performance so
something that gets brought up a lot and
argued about a lot is the whole Jas
versus CSS which is more performant and
I think that you know the answer is once
again it kind of depends on what you
want to use them for CSS is fantastic
and if you want to do an animation that
is based in you know something like
scale rotation opacity so it's basically
a transform that is where CSS can
actually take your animation and it can
elevate it to its own layer that's going
to be powered by the GPU so it's sort of
its own thread it's separate that's
really performant and it's something
that the browser's do really well so if
you're sort of working it within that
realm and you don't need a lot of
sophisticated interactivity CSS is a
great thing to use and css3 being able
to play around with it and like code pen
or something like that is super simple
you can do quite powerful animations if
you want to couple that with a lot of
other things that are happening on your
interface then perhaps jQuery might help
there is actually a way in jQuery that
you can harness that GPU optimization
and it's using transform 3d or matrix 3d
so there is still a potential to use the
GPU optimization of browsers in
JavaScript so if you are already
tethered to JavaScript and that's sort
of one option that you have so would
love to see you guys all go forth and
try out the animation you know I think
you all sort of have an eye for design
you all have a sense of what interfaces
could do so playing around with this a
little bit just opening up an HTML page
using animates that CSS or you know
been using some of those functions that
I was describing it's amazing how far
you can get with just a little and now
that you want to jump into frameworks
it's going to give you much more of a
capacity to understand what the
foundational layers are with those
frameworks so here are some references
one of them
Robert Penner has this great page that
really walks you through all of the easy
infections not only does it walk you
through them but it also gives you
examples of each one of those tween j/s
if you dive into the code you can just
cut and paste a ton of easing functions
from that and start to play around with
them and tweak them in addition I highly
recommend if you're a developer starting
to just get a knife or what does it mean
to kind of think about design and
animation Don Norman has a great book
called the design of everyday things and
in it he's talking about physical
objects but he's talking quite often
about sort of humans perceptions of the
way that things move the way that things
kind of feel sort of that idea of
affordances and signifiers
additionally Google has come out with
the Google material design handbook has
anyone heard of this yeah okay really
awesome sort of resource to go to and in
it they talked very much about animation
and they referenced in it sort of the
the 12 that Disney's 12 basic principles
of animation so there's a lot to be
considered that you know there's
thinking about squash and stretch and
bounce and you know movement in and out
of screens reading up a little bit on
that will have you feel a lot more
empowered as a developer to actually
have a voice as a designer in the room
there's a lot that you can do and play
around with given the knowledge that you
have in code and having that be sort of
bounced off designers can be really
powerful another one I would recommend
smashing magazines got a couple really
neat UX articles one is the new mobile
UX design material and it kind of goes
through animations like this another one
sort of references Saturday morning
cartoons and how animations from
Saturday morning cartoons can be taken
and put into the idea of designing
interfaces and then finally I just have
a link in here for birds on a wire so I
will put all of this up on the internet
and host it and if you have any
questions I can take them now
