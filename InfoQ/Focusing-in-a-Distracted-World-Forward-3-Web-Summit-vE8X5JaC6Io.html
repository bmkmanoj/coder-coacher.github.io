here for focus focusing in a distracted
world you're in the right place hello
for Jas my name is larry gordon I'm a
creative engineer I've had I have a
large passion for user experience and I
deal with distractions all the time
everyone deals with them but in my
particular case I do have ADHD I found
out a couple of years ago that I do have
this and when I found out about it it
really explained a lot of things in my
life that I thought were just like
eccentric or weird it turned out that
there was a reason for everything but
one of the interesting things about it
is that with distraction it actually
becomes a lot more difficult for me to
manage things and so the last couple
years I've spent a lot of time trying to
just kind of deal with these things so
there's a bunch of different types of
distractions there's a there's internal
and external distractions with internal
you have things like thoughts emotions
discomfort or pain that you may be
feeling hunger or you could just be
plain tired you know not sleeping enough
with external you've got digital
notifications that could be stuff coming
from like you're like phone calls
instant messages things like that with
OSX you've got like desktop
notifications and things emails people
people just coming up to you distracting
you clutter clutter on your desk clutter
on your computer your desktop maybe you
can't find things you know just
distractions some of you may think you
know it's like with all this stuff it's
like I don't think I can do it well you
know just when you think that you don't
think you can do it
solutions are within reach so like for
me to like really kind of get involved
in like just trying to figure out like
all these problems it really took a lot
of self-reflection and a lot of
mindfulness and so in order to kind of
like reframe this talk a little bit more
it's like I wanted to be like really
practical and take you through some of
the use cases of things that like I had
problems with and kind of like the steps
that I took to actually solve them
especially with the short amount of time
that we have and so identifying areas
that I would like to change you know one
of the ones that I picked was you know
what's the most important task that I
should be doing right now with getting
distracted like that usually just like
goes by the wayside pretty easily it's
like shiny ball pops up red balloon pops
up you're like oh you know you go start
chasing it later to realize it's like oh
wait I was supposed to be doing
something else knowing when to say no
and knowing how to follow through with
it was a really big important key skill
that ended up learning having trouble
getting to work at a consistent time
without feeling rushed you knows like I
you know live in the east bay and
commute over to San Francisco and
sometimes you know like ride my bike and
be all sweaty and just be flustered by
the time I get to work and really it's
like what I wanted was to just get to
work be relaxed be calm not sweaty just
like be able to just chill out and just
kind of get my work done and start my
day off right not letting social
networks suck up my time before social
networks came out and Facebook and all
that like things were really easy I just
did a bunch of other things but you know
now that you know everything's at your
fingertips like instant access it's
really difficult to kind of like push
that away and not get sucked into those
things building a better routine I think
I got through the majority of my life
having really good routine set up you
know like not losing my keys and things
like that it's like having a set routine
where like I knew that
no I could play something somewhere and
I was consistent about it and I didn't
have to think about it finding a quiet
time at work so with like open open
workspaces and everyone being like
really collaborative it's like it's it's
really difficult to actually find that
quiet time so that you can actually get
the chunk of time that you need to
concentrate to actually get the work
done that you need and one of the last
things was just kind of like like
rewarding myself often it turns out that
like you know you set big goals and
stuff like that and it's it's like
rewarding yourself often just kind of
helps reinforce and just help you I just
feel better about the things that you're
doing right and lastly just kind of like
finding out what makes me thrive you
know taking time over the years just
really honing down like what is it that
makes me happy in life you know so I'm
going to go into these a little bit more
in-depth Lee was the most important task
I should be doing right now using timers
to break myself out of what I'm doing so
controlled distractions so some people
will set like you know 30 minute timers
and this and that to basically just kind
of break themselves out of the context
of what it is that you're doing I've
been using a great app called do for iOS
and mac and one of the nice things about
is that you can set it to remind you but
it won't go away like it'll keep
reminding you like every minute until
you actually dismiss it which for me was
really helpful because a lot of times I
would see a notification and because it
just kind of blurs together with all the
other notifications it it it doesn't
become as important and because it just
kind of keeps going every minute then I
start to realize okay wait there's
there's really something else going on
here it's like I need to break out what
i'm doing and actually pay attention
which kind of goes with this it's like
you know once i actually break out of
that mode it's like you know stop what
I'm doing take a step back and ask
myself is this something that should be
really doing right now if not like
observe my feelings and surroundings and
understand why I'm actually doing this
time
cuz you know some things may be done
based out of like anxiety and like I
never knew like I really had anxiety I
just thought it was just energy you know
and like once I actually like took a
deeper understanding is like oh no wait
there's some tasks and I'm actually
doing they're actually anxiety driven
it's like I got to get this done right
now is like this this is the most
important thing is like I got to get
this done and and you feel this energy
to go and like complete this thing and
if you if you take a step back and try
to like observe your feelings and try to
actually really kind understand what
your body is trying to tell you you'll
tend to find that you're actually
learning a lot about why you're trying
to do something if the data is important
put it in my task manager you know it's
like so that I know that like it's
something that I should be doing find
the tasks i should be working on again
and be in and begin on it and so you
know if like if i did find myself being
distracted it's like okay well like set
that aside putting the task manager and
just like get back on task then rinse
and repeat just kind of keep doing this
process over and over again until you
until i start getting better at it
knowing when to say no and following
through with it that was always kind of
like a really big thing for me like i
really love being helpful I'm always
really helpful at work and sometimes
helping others can conflict with the
actual task that I'm trying to do but if
it's really important you know it's like
you know I need to discuss it with like
management or my supervisor or scrum
master or project manager whoever the
case might be because someone's still
expecting the task that I need to do to
still be done and so if another thing
comes in it's important discuss it and
then reprioritize the task against my
current list of things that I need to do
it's really important because you need
to set up expectations you know it's
like it's very easy to fall into a space
where it's like you could be doing a
bunch of things that are really useful
and really helpful but because other
people don't know about it you end up
looking bad and so it's it's almost kind
of like a cover-your-ass situation it's
kind of weird but like it really does
work you know is like you document
things use task managers like jira or
pivotal tracker or anything like that
use those things to your advantage
because they're there to help you and
protect you it's not also just about
saying no to other people it's also
about being able to say no to yourself
because distractions can come up and you
can like wander off to do something but
you know knowing when to actually just
take a moment step back and telling
yourself no you know what I shouldn't be
doing this right now is really valuable
so having trouble getting to work with
you know in a consistent time without
feeling rushed started the time myself
it turned out that i was actually losing
time I wasn't spatially aware of the
amount of time it was taking for me to
do like certain mundane tasks so you
know when you know when did I wake up
how long does it take me to get ready in
the morning how long does it take me to
leave my apartment grab my bike long as
it take me to ride my bike to Bart what
time do I get to bart how crowded is it
can I get my bike on bart at this
particular time and like I ended up
actually like building this huge list of
like like the length of trains the time
it showed up a show up at the bart
station and which train was full and
which train wasn't full i actually ended
up finding out that other people have
very similar patterns and certain trains
at certain times people like to get on
it like in a certain part of the train
and so I started noticing those patterns
I was able to kind of like trick the
system and figure out like oh you know
what I don't have to worry about getting
on this train I can just jump on the
next one and I can jump on the third
train from the front and know that I can
get on how long is my bart ride how long
is my bike bike ride to work from bart
and then also realizing through that
whole process getting to work and
getting home which is kind of like the
reverse strip actually doesn't equate to
each other it turned out that getting
work getting back home actually took an
extra 15 minutes longer and that ended
up being because you know what like
whenever i'm done at work I'm like hey
you know what I got to close my laptop
down I got packed
stuff up i got to go down and get my
bike i got to avoid any distractions
from people and things that come along
the way and it turned out that that was
actually taking extra 15 minutes so like
realizing those things like and actually
time tracking every single one of those
things really helped me kind of
understand and readjust my schedule so
that you know what like I'm showing up
just at the nick of time I want to show
up 30 minutes earlier now I know how to
adjust everything else and it can easily
tell like when I'm off schedule not
letting social networks suck up all my
time so this is a little video of stuff
that I do like in when I'm on the bart I
do certain things like social networks
as like micro tasks because i know that
i can go and do these things very
quickly and i have to get off the bart
train so i have to stop what I'm doing
so it's you know whether I'm waiting in
line or whether I'm just kind of like
doing something like really simple just
for a few minutes I do these things like
going going through my twitter feed I I
know that I don't necessarily have to
read everything but there's certain
things that I do want to read and in
order to kind of like quickly curate
those I send it over to pocket and i
have another a number of tags wait it's
not even showing oh that's a shame
that's a bummer
I guess that makes more sense now um so
uh so basically you know going to the
list and curating creating these tags
and stuff and just and and I started
actually saving more time because I had
so many tags as certain ones that I
noticed that I was doing more often I
put an underscore in front of those so
that they would be at the top of the
list I could just quickly hit those and
that actually ended up saved me like a
few seconds of time and that kind of
starts to add up after a while I won't
go through this whole thing but like
this this is basically just kind of like
going through that process of me just
kind of pruning and curating and how I
go through information like really super
quickly building a better routine was
like really crucial for me because
trying to build a routine and and
sticking to it is it is really crucial
like whenever you deal with distractions
so I used all the time tracking stuff
that I was taking all the notes and
stuff that I was taking and actually
like built it out like into my calendar
and actually put meeting events in my
calendar so that everything was
literally blocked off so every open free
time monday thru friday like had time
accounted for and if there wasn't time
accounted for it i would actually go and
block that time out i would block that
time out and actually use like work time
like I need to be coding during this
time so in the end is like I had
actually had no free time left so now
it's like I could easily look at my
calendar and no one I was off my routine
I could see if I was five minutes late
or ten minutes late I could easily
predict like if I was going to be late
to a meeting or late to work based off
of the the amount of time that it took
for me to like travel and I was actually
really spot-on with my estimates at that
point if if I if I noticed that I was
consistently off based off of a pattern
i would just readjust my calendar and
everything would be okay and then after
like rinsing and repeating it like it
actually ended up becoming a habit and
then I didn't have to really worry about
it anymore finding quiet time at work
can often be like something that's
really hard or difficult to try to like
just try to get a hold of like you know
you've got agile methodologies you've
got you know a bunch of meetings are
planned at the beginning and the end of
your sprint you've got like a backlog
grooming sprint pre-planning all this
stuff you have a lot of these meetings
and stuff that just kind of build up
over time and so I started to take some
observations about like well you know
what are some quiet times at work I
notice that people weren't really there
before eight-thirty of course and people
like and even though the office was
really busy after 4i got really quiet
adjusted my routines that I could get to
work earlier and leave work a little bit
earlier because I because being at work
at like 630 in the morning actually
allowed me to get a ton of stuff done
there's nobody there it was really
relaxing commuting actually got quicker
because there were less people involved
that I had to compete with and I need a
becoming super productive I made it a
rule to like you know what don't worry
about external distractions don't worry
about checking email or social networks
or web surfing in the morning and just
work on my toughest tasks that were
required in the morning because it
turned out that like you've got more
energy you've got more brain power in
the morning so that it's you would think
that like you know what I can plow
through a lot of the easy task force
it's actually better to actually plow
through the toughest tasks first when
you have the most energy and then kind
of worried about the rest of it later
because the easy stuff that stuff is
going to come easy you're going to want
to do those things those things are just
not a problem to do noise-cancelling
headphones started to help me out a lot
because I could actually block out
external conversations with especially
in open office work spaces that really
helped out a lot negotiating with my
manager on a better place to sit so
being a being a lead I was being asked
to do a lot of things and so because of
that like I was sitting in the middle of
this like like six different rows of
deaths and because I was like right in
the middle of it I was easily accessible
everyone knew I was there people were
constantly coming up to me asking me
little side questions all the time that
normally they probably wouldn't ask
so eventually I was able to negotiate
moving to to a corner seat a little bit
away half the time because i had my
monitors and I slink really low in my
seat no one knew I was in the office and
it turned out that it's like a lot of
those little conversations and questions
just kind of stopped or they would like
instant messaged me about it and so at
that point like I could then start to
control the flow of information right
it's like it was it was digital at that
point I could suck it in at certain
points and manage that a lot easier I
worked on getting recurring meetings
moves so that it doesn't break up the
day as much it really sucks is like you
go and you have like 30 minutes of
stand-ups that you have to be involved
in in the morning and then you get like
45 minute break and then you have a
meeting and you get like another like 30
to 45 minute break and you got lunch and
then you come back and you're like oh
I'm tired or whatever but like I got to
get some work done and you got like
about an hour so so you're trying to get
back into work and you got another
meeting you're great okay go to that
meeting and after that meeting is like
okay it's coffee time now and then after
you get some coffee and you ready to go
it's like four o'clock like it's almost
time to go home so like I was noticing
that that was happening a lot of work
pretty much almost every single day so
negotiated with my manager just like you
know what can we move the bulk of these
meetings to like just just this one day
and it turned out that it worked out
really well because everyone else hated
you know going to all those meetings so
I knew that like you know what Monday
this is like my Monday meaning day and
I'm not going to get Jack done it's like
I'm just going to sit in meetings all
day and participate in those those type
of things I also was able to kind of
like Institute you know what like
through the company it's like you know
what let's not actually have any
meetings on tuesdays or wednesdays
because it's not just me that has issues
right it's like all the other developers
are noticing productivity issues and it
was really helpful for them and for the
company didn't know it's like you know
what don't schedule meetings during
these days because these are the days
that were really heads down and we're
really trying to concentrate on trying
to like crank some stuff out and like i
said earlier you know blocked off the
rest of my free time on
calendar as like work time for myself
and what that allowed me to do was that
if someone really wanted to schedule
something with me they would have to
kind of come by and ask me first you
know because they would go and realize
it's like hey your calendars really
booked is you know can can we have a
meeting at this particular time and then
that way it's like it was easier for me
to push back and actually push a meeting
to a particular day or a particular time
so that my day wasn't quite broken up as
much and I can actually have longer
periods of time that I could concentrate
um rewarding myself often um trying to
create a new routine is really tough
making long-term goals is like really
awesome but sometimes it's really kind
of hard to achieve those deciding a
reward for when that larger goal is
complete is like really great whenever
in it when you're defining that
long-term goal so that you're like know
what to look forward to but also making
shorter term goals like taking the
larger thing and splitting up into
smaller smaller pieces and deciding on a
reward for those short term goals like
for me is like I love ice cream I love
like cake and cupcakes and stuff like
that so I would get like a like a like a
tougher task break it down the smaller
achievements and once I made those
achievements i reward myself for like
ten minutes and be like a I'm going to
eat some ice cream and you know take the
moment to take the time to like actually
reward yourself and make sure you enjoy
it because the great thing about that is
that those hard tasks that are difficult
to do like whenever you reward yourself
you're actually kind of like retraining
your brain to like enjoy that more and
you know the more that you kind of like
build those experiences the more that
just kind of like gets ingrained into
the way that you are and helps build up
a positive experience finding out what
makes me thrive like observing my
patterns for a while you know like i was
doing different types of jobs that i
didn't quite really like and I didn't
really understand like why it was until
I actually started looking at my pattern
over the years and trying to understand
like you know what it was that made me
energetic about things and what it was
that like you know brought me down and
I had a hard time struggling with you
know could I find a job doing that
particular thing that made me like
really energetic and that I thrived or
could I just make adjustments in my
current job to make me happy like
overall like you know change is
difficult and it won't be easy but I
kept telling myself like not to give up
like keep pushing forward like no matter
like what happens and you know over time
things start to get a lot easier i was
able to like take a look at all the hard
stuff that was really difficult for me
to do and really kind of focus on those
things too like really overcome them and
and help me exceed in excel and so
that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
