license plate
that's what I do so not to be confused
with this one that's also somewhere here
in the Bay Area I'm dead yeah yes
that's great finally you got to meet you
talk to me afterwards that's great
that's great so yeah so they're so work
at causing causing specializes in
WebSocket technology I'll just touch on
that a little bit later today this
mostly an overview of all of html5 and
that just makes up one small part of it
because then we also do html5 training
and we have a little booth out there if
you're interested in more information
just come and see us I also about a year
and a half ago start at the html5 the
San Francisco html5 user group how many
of you are members of the San Francisco
and web user group okay not not enough
if you're from from this area definitely
check us out it's SF html5 org it's a
meet-up we have great events that's all
free we have some of the top speakers
all of the events are videotaped for
example this week we have faruk attached
who created modernizer we have about I
think 300 people on the on the list for
poor daddy Benson really great events
all free cos Inc provides the pizza and
definitely check us out so I have a
little bit of a dilemma for this talk in
that last year but year and a half ago I
did sort of the initial talk for the
html5 user group in San Francisco and we
had very few members and the talk lasted
about two and a half hours then another
hour of questions and then today I was
asked to sort of repeat that and you
know at the time there wasn't a lot of
browser support for html5 and certainly
not as many features as there are today
so today the user group is up to 2,500
members we have a lot more feature
support we have incredible browser
uptake in the market and
I have one hour so I can either start
talking really fast or I can give you
the hundred thousand foot overview which
is a little bit even more higher level
and more distilled so if you're
interested in any of these items i'm not
going to be able to take a whole lot of
questions for this hour but i'm going to
be here for the rest of the day and i
will be at the COS in booth and there's
going to be a party after so i'll be
around so if you have any any questions
if it's something really quick great and
otherwise we'll take the questions after
so they keep moving all right so quick
overview of what we're going to talk
about so you know what is a 205 i'll
give you the two minutes history and
five reasons why you might care about
the HTML file and then i'll talk to you
about the different html5 features i'll
talk about sort of at the high level all
the different feature area and then i'll
finish it off with sort of you what sort
of tools do you need today to develop
good html5 applications what would what
sort of things should be in your in your
toolbox and then the Q&amp;amp;A will have our
much time we have left them alright so
what is html5 the their ask you know
three different people and you get three
different answers and some people are
you know you can argue about that all
day ultimately the way I look at it I
mean obviously the new major milestone
for HTML that was a long time coming but
it's primarily the initial the first
name for it was actually web
applications 1.0 and so there's a lot of
application detail in there and a web
application versus a website that's a
whole nother discussion that you know
gets pretty ultimately the files that
are used are the same but a web
application has a little bit more like
you're doing something with it as
opposed to your just browsing and to do
those kind of things you need
capabilities that up until recently were
only available in desktop applications
and these desktop applications have
local storage facilities they have
graphics API is they have connectivity
maybe using
socket connections or streaming
connections and the browser never had
that but html5 defines a whole lot of
new API is new technologies that will
make that work if you your if you
haven't heard of Newt yet that's because
it didn't really get so popular that was
actually the newt acronym was coined by
by Bruce Lawson who also wrote a book on
html5 new and exciting web technologies
that's what it stands for because in a
way I'm not here telling you that CSS
two or three are part of html5 there are
separate standards but the way I like to
look at it is like you need HTML CSS and
JavaScript to create a modern web
application that nobody will argue with
that so using them together and putting
them under the larger umbrella term up
html5 is I think reasonable now modern
browsers already have a lot of support
for it and there are some great websites
the first one being html5 test that
basically allows you to quickly run a
test in the browser that you're in that
you're accessing the site on if you
haven't checked this check it in
different browsers and you'll see
different scores and this is the chrome
developer channel probably the highest
score there's an inner website that can
tell you about this colt can I use com
this site was unfortunately compromised
over the weekend but its back up
fortunately this was a kind of lame so
if you want to check you know
geolocation okay well then you see that
it's in really in all the browsers today
and other features let's say I'm
interested in the you know the details
element then I can say well that's
actually only in Chrome so that's me
maybe something that I'm not quite ready
to use in my applications although there
are usually good polyfill zor emulation
products all right so I promise the very
condensed timeline I want to make a
whole history lesson out of this but
hTML 1.0 that was really the early 90s
and this
application the very first HTML tag
specification was only three pages long
then it rapidly evolved into HTML that
version 2 is really the first version
that anyone's really used and that was
in like mid 90s and then moved on the
specification chains to the w3c the
World Wide Web Consortium from the IETF
the internet Engineering Task Force and
that really where the major momentum
started building up and you know that
that sort of came to this like 800 for
sort of the final big version things
we're really moving along and that's
basically when the w3 started looking at
other technologies like XML based
technology XHTML SVG all of those
technologies started coming up and that
was seen as more the future of the web
and that the web became more popular and
things like web 20 and Ajax and they
started doing a lot of new stuff new
applications but the the browsers
weren't ready to that they didn't have
any new features for a while and so plug
in technology started bridging the gap
like flash and later Silverlight and so
on and this group within the w3c decided
to to push for improving HTML for web
applications specifically and they were
they it came to a vote and it was voted
down I believe it 15 28 voted against
improving HTML to enhance web
applications and that same group that
was voted down then promptly the next
day start at their own working group was
called the web hypertext application
technology working group that what week
for short and so they define web
applications 1.0 features were added and
and everything like there's a great new
all kinds of new different areas like a
canvas for graphics and storage and web
sockets and all of those things and so
html5 has that incredible promise it's a
it's a huge step forward it's it's been
a long time coming and it isn't it fixes
a lot of things that people were using
other technologies for and eventually
the w3c's sort of caught on and said
yeah okay we need to specify that that
was kind of a mistake to go to that pure
XHTML route and they dropped the work on
XHTML and a defined in the w3c the html5
specification as well so both standards
by the way are still are still alive so
html5 into w3c and HTML the living
standard in the what working group now
as much promise as html5 has it's not
completely done so we're completely
there's the working draft last call
there's a lot of features that are
already in browsers today but it's not
completely done and the aim is to have
it serve done in the candidate
recommendation phase 2012 in 2022 this
is a date you may have heard about for a
proposed recommendation what that really
means to give you an example of a
proposed recommendation that was
recently passed like in this summer like
anyone know what became a proposed
recommendation no not that bad anyone
yep see is a good number yeah
right so CSS too so did you wait till
this summer to start using CSS in your
application that's that's ludicrous
right so that it the same for html5 you
start using it really when the browser's
have full support for it and then once
the browser have picked it up the
candidate recognition is a good good
target all right so why would you even
care about html5 well first of all html5
solves common problems it what they call
paves the cow paths so an example of
that is a form a simple input type in a
form so in 804 you have a form you have
an input type and you have a type of
text that's there wasn't an email
recognition in the HTML for browsers so
then to figure out that that text field
is actually an email address you need to
write a whole bunch of JavaScript like
maybe a regular expression like that one
that is pretty error-prone or pull in an
ex like a jQuery library well doing that
has its problems because if you add a
library to your page that just slowed
your page down a lot and that libraries
probably has got more stuff than you
need it in it so a pain now 805 you know
paves that kalpa and says okay we have
no an email type right that's the
principle you'd say thai pickles email
you can even say required that's it now
your browser does the validation for you
if you don't enter an email address it
will warn you right right out of the box
so we'll talk a little bit more about
the form stuff the other a second reason
for that this html5 is really really
simple so one good reason for developing
html5 is it actually saves you time
right if you compare what you had to do
in the previous versions like the form
example is a great one if I told you
well write me an email routine like for
this regular expression you might be
here past five o'clock in the type
equals email that's all given to you so
it actually reduces the time
that you need to develop applications so
it's simpler and there's some examples
of that is the doctype there was every
page start with the doctype used to be
this long lengthy string I couldn't I
could never remember it so I would just
copy and paste something and instead now
you have doctype HTML notice it doesn't
have html5 so this will be valid for a
long time character said there's similar
kind of it is a very good example of how
HTML sort of just takes all the verbose
junk out of it and distills it to what's
really needed the markup you might find
pages in fact I got one one bad review
on my book on Amazon and the reason for
that was my code examples in the book
use this simplified perfectly legit
syntax and basically that oh well you're
missing HTML and body and head and so on
and you're not quoting your attributes
well I don't have to in HTML everything
is in a simpler more relaxed market but
there is such a thing as valid HTML but
this would be a perfectly valid page in
70 character so I can put you know to
complete HTML pages in a single tweet
and and that I mean just a good example
of how simple that is in reality I'll
warn you right now that fort for today's
browser applications for especially for
IE you probably want to keep some of
those body and then head and its home
but it is perfectly fine to use that and
the third reason is it's a universal
language right so even anyone would
agree with that and examples of that our
support now in html5 for additional East
Asian typography for accessibility right
that's not just sighted users looking at
pages but but everyone should be able to
use it and a great example of that is
the recent adoption of web video text
tracks which are webvtt for short which
is great you can simply go into your
your video element at a track element
pointed to a text file which is called
the webvtt file and by adding that
browsers that supported there's not a
whole lot of support for it yet so you
may need a polyfill and come back to
that you would get the sort of like
subtitle view in your browser so some
really cool stuff coming out for
accessibility some areas are still
lacking but but it's coming along nicely
so a fourth reason is really the the
plug-in free paradigm of html5 so native
support for graphics for graphics API is
44 socket connections for audio and
video just native ability to play that
makes things a lot simpler but also you
don't rely any more on a plugin to be in
salt right so plugins Bruce Lawson to
quote him again built-in is always
better than bolt-on right it's a great
way of also they obviously need to have
the feature support and html5 provides
that precise like all the gaps for one
thing flash they certainly had a lot of
things right because they they filled
every single gap that needed to be
filled from from video to graphics and
sockets and so on so but the problem is
that may not be installed right and you
know pretty soon in in the in what I'm
hearing from the about the Metro apps
the plugins won't be allowed not exactly
sure the details there but but just like
the iPad right there's no flash on the
iPad whenever a really good example was
in the WebSocket protocol proxy
poisoning attack was discovered like it
was possible that you exploit this issue
in web sockets and the reason why they
thought about that was because I knew
that it existed in flash and java had
never been fixed and then about six
months after it was discovered in a sort
of a theoretical lab it was fixed their
current protocol versions don't have
that vulnerability anymore so it's
really a great testament to how fast
html5 can really
the move things along with that
incredible momentum it has right now and
so a Steve Jobs said you know whenever a
Mac crashes more often than not is
because of flash so we did just things
like that they're just kidding it's a
mac so another another reason to use ATM
five actually as security is really
built in to the core specification so
html5 defines and concept of what's
called origin based security so every
every website you browse to has an
origin the scheme host port combination
you're browsing so http www mple calm
and then port 80 or 443 so that those
that that combination is your origin and
so if you store things in the browser
you will you will get it stored in it
sort of like a storage bucket for that
origin so a site on like yahoo.com
cannot see inside of that origins
storage area so it's safe from that
angle there's also a separate
specification called cross-origin
resource sharing so there's a it's a
common problem that may be on a website
you need to share content but to do it
sort of the wrong way would be using
something like JSONP where you're
actually opening up your site to have
scripts run inside of your script inside
of your page whereas now there's a new
standard called course or cross-origin
resource sharing it's very it's going to
be very important to to sort of have a
server opt-in to share resources with
other with other sites so a sort of a
proper mechanism as opposed to a bunch
of hacks so and finally it's just cool
right now let's talk about the html5
feature areas so to feature areas as
they're defined by the w3c and this can
you know not everyone agrees with this
right so you have css3 clearly its own
specification some things that are part
of graphics like SVG those are not
really part of the core specification
but if you group it together in these
different areas this is how you create a
modern web application and so the first
the top half is more of the visual part
right that is there the semantic markup
the CSS the styling of your pages the
multimedia the audio video and the
graphics those really are sort of very
much visible on the page where's the
bottom half is a lot more invisible and
so one thing definitely about html5 you
really need javascript like a lot of
these things like canvas it's a graphics
API but you need JavaScript to really do
something on your page and then a lot of
other sessions today we'll talking about
that of course so a device access
perform and storage all of those things
are AP is that are exposed to the
browser and and in your pages that you
can use in JavaScript to do really cool
things but so the second the bottom half
is a little bit less visible alright so
the look and I'm going to talk through
the features in in that same order and
so the first thing about the semantic
markup is one of make one sort of quick
comment is that of you see a lot of
sites that have like badges on the
bottom of them that's a valid XHTML
right but actually what most people
don't know is that XHTML needs to be
served with the right mime type it needs
to be served with the application / XH
developers xml mime type whereas because
because I e does not support that and
would prompt you for a download it
actually like 95 or plus percentage of
the world x html5 pages are served as
text HTML and then the browser just all
it sees is a is this a tag soup so it
starts to do all if it's error handling
it can to actually make sense out of
those pages so you're marking up XHTML
hasn't really solved anything it's just
created more browser error handling code
so html5 has a there is a valid markup
and there's validators like validator nu
and the w3c site that there isn't also
an XHTML flavor of that that's probably
not what you would be writing yourself
but maybe a machine would generate that
and it's backward it supports the
xml-based markup because one of the
design goals of html5 is that nothing
should break like the old content should
simply continue to work and that's
working quite well but in general just
look for valid html5 as opposed to valid
XHTML now html5 defines 27 27 or 28 new
html5 elements if you take a look at
this list you'll see some of them like
the audio and video and canvas those are
sort of hooks for that other content but
it also defines a lot of new semantic
markup things like section and article
and so on and then there's a few other
things too now there's also a bunch of
removed elements they're still going to
work in most browsers I mean they'll be
working for a while longer but they they
won't result in valid markup so you
should get rid of these anyway these are
pretty much like in line styling that
should have been done for a long time in
CSS anyway now this the semantic markup
came around after a lot of research was
on the Opera did a great study and and
Google they they looked what were the
most commonly used div IDs and classes
and so if you look at that the top div
ID in the past was that it was footer
and then header and so on so people were
marking up content on their pages with
divs and then gave it a class or an ID
to give it some meaning so if everyone
is doing that why don't we just create a
header or a footer element and that's
where all these elements came from and
really it's sure it's a nice
sir mark up it's simpler to read and
there's many benefits for a developer
there but the real benefit is not the
end user here it's not the developer
it's the machines that are reading your
pages right it's much easier since the
web is all about linking content
together it's much easier to take an
article from a site and that article
self-contained you can grab the entire
article suck it into your page without
you know looking for about div ID equals
you know and and you don't know what the
content is you don't know how it's
structured it's completely unstructured
versus a nice meaningful semantic markup
and so if you look at the page and html5
page and of course there's no single one
page that is that is an html5 page just
this an example that you have a header
defined at the top for the top section
you have a navigation or a nav element
that contains all the links in a side
section with related content and then a
section that actually spans both
articles and a section as like related
content in it and within that section I
have two articles and within the bottom
article can even have a figure elements
all of these new elements give you give
meaning to what you're wrapping right so
for example if you look at that the the
figure in the figure caption in the past
it was like a paragraph tag and an image
and then maybe there was another
paragraph tag below it and which one of
those was actually the texts that
describe the image as a site at end user
you might say oh it's of course is that
one is the italic paragraph but as a
machine or a screen reader that's much
much harder to do so giving that meaning
also helps accessibility and helps
search engines find your content and so
on sets it's good to use that and you
can you start using that today you can
use that today if you do there's going
to be one problem that's this one ie
less than nine is not going to be very
happy with that and fortunately there's
a great tiny little script that you
should and it's part of the tool said
I'll talk about later that
recently just fixes this it's a problem
with ie not being able to style things
elements that are not yet in its known
set of elements and so this this one
liner script quickly fixes that for you
and then your pages will look just just
like they did normally so you can really
use this markup today alright so then to
extend that even further the search
engine optimization for lick lick the
give meaning to your content there's a
separate center called micro data that
allows you to apply attributes to your
pages and give you an example of it is
here you take a section and you give it
an item scope pointing to a data
vocabulary so for example in this guy's
product would describe a product of like
training and html5 fast track training
then it has a description in a price and
in stock all of the things that you
would expect from a product can be
marked up literally just in line as
attributes in your pages so it's really
powerful again not really meant for the
end user they don't see anything of this
but search engines they can look at this
and there's there's data vocabularies
check it out for for products for person
for recipe you know all of the the kind
of structured syntaxes that you might
expect and the next areas that forms i
mentioned that that form as a way to
pave the cow paths and there's all these
new form input types the email as one of
them web address date you color all of
these new elements that you can use or
these new types that you can use that
the browser has a native understanding
of the these features degrade nicely
because the default type for any input
is text so people will at least still be
able to enter some text so it's not as
nice as an optimal user experience but
you're really upgrading the client site
so you don't have a lot of JavaScript to
write anymore imagine a date picker so
for example here I have a type equals
tell type of email type equals date type
equals color those are
inputs that I already had in normal
forme I just add that one type to it and
outcome you know validation like where
error messages just and then and by the
way all of these error messages one of
the big benefits you have is they're
going to come pre translate it in all
languages that your browser is already
translated into huge benefit the other
thing you get there in an email address
is virtual keyboarding right so on a
mobile device you will get instantly the
keyboard that you need to enter an email
that this handy right I wish they had
one for twitter with the hashtag i would
go like three levels deep so type equals
color gives you a native color picker
type it goes date gives you a native
date picker i mean that that saves you a
lot of time right and again they great
gracefully to text so then the css3 is
an area that you're going to be using
for styling up your pages you really
want to move that into the CSS files and
there css3 is sort of the next level
sort of like HTML 4 and 5 there CSS two
and three and there's almost 50 it's a
modular they've taken a very modular
approach it's something that we're
starting to see also in HTML because you
know one of the big problems with like
html5 is that it's like one giant spick
and it's sort of a take it or leave like
you have all of it implemented or you
don't and that model doesn't work very
well for you know then we may be 10
years from now we had this great period
at the end of like two thousand nine ten
eleven and we don't want it to wait
another ten years there to innovate in
new areas so you're starting to see
things that are looked very much like
browse or specific prefixes you're
starting to see those now in in AP is
for for HTML like JavaScript api's as
well like Moz web socket or things like
along those lines and CSS has this
concept already has always had it
because browsers can pick up a module
one module at a time so they can say
well I want to do border radius that
rounded corners or gradients but i'm not
going to tackle
reflection yet so they can they can pick
that up and until this speck is done
they can support it with their own
prefixes and finally they can roll that
out too with the proper standard so just
a couple of examples you can have some
CSS code that for example when you hover
over an image creates that border radius
of 10 pixels and gives it a nice rounded
corner again how would you do that in
the past right you would either have a
completely new image or you would have
four rounded corner images that you
would have to download as part of your
page additional script to run so that's
a great example of how simple html5 and
CSS are our css3 they make it just
simpler to do things that you already
probably were trying to do so scaling
this is a WebKit transform so I add the
dash WebKit they're just that's where
Chrome and Safari to say okay well in
that case scale it so when I hover over
the image it just gets a little bit
bigger and another example when I like
the linear gradient so linear gradients
so easy to put in now you have a
background image you set it to a
gradient that you built yourself you
just give it a color top color and a
bottom color and by the way I'm going to
post these slides so if you you can't
keep up with the well the code examples
don't worry I'm going to post them
somewhere on SlideShare and if you look
at what had to be done in the past to do
the same linear gradient I mean it's
amazing right you have to pull in an
image in IE you had to do all kinds of
special hacks with different color codes
and so on so it's all very very
problematic the new ways just say I want
a gradient browser just do it for me
it's many times it's much more optimized
because you're not running code on top
of your page it's actually handed off
right to the browser just do it for me
multi-column layout another great
example if you had to do this before
maybe you would parse the page all the
content do bunch of complex calculations
is where the content would go create a
number of divs slap it in their deaths
that's
of the past now you just say WebKit
column count or Moz column count three
and hand it off to the browsers just
create three columns for me from this
body of text it's a great stuff there
reflection this is not in so many
browsers yet but you can kind of see
where that's going the this will work on
even on videos you playback a video in
reflection it's really some some very
cool stuff coming out in the CSS arena
okay the next area I want to talk about
is the multimedia so multimedia consists
of that at this point the new audio and
video elements these are elements in
html5 that are kind of like an image
element you can embed video and audio
with the same ease that you can you can
plop a video or an image in your page
what's nice about that is you they are
really part of your page now it's not
like flash with a separate execution
content running on top of your page as a
black box but you can style it with CSS
you can control it with JavaScript all
with the same language everything very
very easy and the one downside of the
current status of html5 audio and video
is that there's the different browser
support different codecs and not going
to go into the complete details of that
but let's say some browser supports mp4
s and others aughh and web M h.264
versus the the more open source formats
and there's an easy way around that so
if you look at the code that you need to
include a video element the most basic
one is just you know video controls the
controls gives you the control bar where
you can click on play and the seekbar
and the volume and that's it right you
point to your file so that it's almost
like an image it's not a self-closing
element but it you do need to closing
video element but if you look at the
next one you'll see that at the bottom
actually included to source elements and
but simply having two versions of the
video that's the downside you can easily
tell the browser well play the first one
you can play and then all the
today we'll be able to to handle that so
that that's a very good good system this
is also where that track element goes
the one I mentioned in the in the
accessibility section now what you get
then is a simple video drops right into
your page and it's a part of the html5
page so if you have CSS effects they'll
take place immediately as you hover over
the video they'll play you can use
JavaScript right just inline JavaScript
disc play things like that that that
just can detect mouse movements and all
kinds of clever things menu there's a
whole API to back this up you can say
give me every five seconds give me a
frame and put it in a canvas and do
something crazy with it so that's that
and then to really fall back even for
browsers like older browsers like IE
that doesn't support video you can still
use the an embedded final sort of trip
will fall back so you have the web in
mp4 and finally you have your your your
flash fall back and that's a pretty box
except that thing most of old IE has a
pretty high flash penetration rate and
the VIP fee DT that is a simple standard
by by giving a text file with a specific
format basically here's my subtitles you
just link it directly to your page into
your video element not widely supported
yet but there's already some plugins
that that or some some JavaScript
libraries that can help pull this in in
the meantime alright so graphics and 3d
the next feature area that's another
area of a huge a huge hole in the
coverage of HTML in general so there was
not a graphics API now we have SVG
support so SP jusa is a xml based
language for graphics that can now be
natively part of HTML pages so you can
have a page that has an SVG element in
it and it just does make it does
everything that you would do in like a
standalone SVG so the kind of stuff that
you would use flash for or
or Silverlight and canvas that's a real
new html5 element that exposes a drawing
API is more like a bitmap graphic SVG
scalable vector graphics by the way and
canvas is more of a sort of a you could
think of it as a scripted scriptable
bitmap so you have an area on the page
and you can write to it you can draw
things on it you can create shapes and
of course then you start doing that in
loops with the requestanimationframe and
so on and that basically just starts
becoming very much alive animation pixel
data you have all of this power to do
things and canvas actually supports that
2d mode and a 3d the WebGL that you may
have already seen examples of and you
can get full access to the mouse
movement so for example in this example
here this one so I can actually detect
you know the mouse and change so I have
complete access to every pixels RGB and
a values in that canvas so I can
literally say get the image data for the
pixel that the mouse is on top of and
change it to something else so it's well
with a little bit of code it's actually
quite easy to do that there's libraries
of course higher level libraries that
you can then pull in like heat map j/s
just great for just doing this like you
you plug in your life data from web
server traffic and you it overlays on
top of a map canvas can sit on top of a
canvas campus it on top of other
elements there's a lot of different
things and a lot of sessions today will
no doubt focus heavily on the canvas
area there's other things you can do
this this one is a really good demo and
like i said i'll post the slides you can
click on this link every time zone
basically just a canvas animation of
where where you would be canvas demos
another gray say that Emily check it out
the amazing stuff people down to the
candidates so we're checking in in the
3d canvas people have build things like
quake games isn't around
google project for the bottome browser
all kinds of very very cool stuff
because this is the sort of the WebGL is
OpenGL forwarded to the browser so it
look at sort of the direct competitor
oolitic different ex technologies in it
up that it may have a really good hot
take or tradition so the device hash
this is another really don't get any
other more in the sort of the bottom
half of that earlier arafa cab or
invisible part and the base axes there's
a lot of expectation so it's already
completely gone like the audition other
things are not merely radius there's
things like speech input and in device
orientation and web it can or they get
user media with the access to your
webcam all those things are very
promising the de model is now in place I
think for a lot of you sitting for
example geolocation you you can go to a
page so we go to the geolocation page
and the browser will prompt me if I want
to share a location with its sake and
then first the occasion part this is
taking the geolocation data that
latitude and longitude of your location
and then overlaid on a google map using
the google the directions API this is
the exact directions to go back home so
that's that's pretty cool it's great
your browser the accelerometer support
is pretty amazing so here's
accelerometers were busy to the mac as a
building you know
as a built-in accelerometer is we see if
you drop your Mac it pretty hard right
from the basic law forbidding as we tap
into the same accelerometer and detect
movement of the first auditor on a
smaller tablet or something together and
all the way a lot of these these the
device access items are very much they
it makes more sense on all of us you
know like a camera access or standing of
our code those are the things utility
negative an application for today but
that is set up just very rapidly
starting to come in today so I as well
and let us see this is really cool one
input this is this is waiting to see one
of those HTML browsers which is like a
creep in the experimental wet case
speech you can add to the page is going
to be imposed elements or text lost so
if you go to the google translate for
example here you can use this here so
html5 is the best thing i've ever seen
this idea in a co had wrong ok it is not
wearing it try it out it actually is it
a pretty cool than all those see this
forward html5 rock
what I really I was falling out of this
is where instead of a toi rock it's not
working at trying to develop and it's
beautiful to see into it and it actually
translated on to fly back to pretty
girls momentum up with it can surely
that's proved that it were at some point
all right so performance serious isn't
everyone right now that has a future
world when it workers in general and
helped you with a cici's how to talk on
performance basically all those things
that are you talking about our mosques I
think html5 performs is a big deal
because you starting to add a lot of new
features so it'd be very mindful and
performance in general but there is one
feature in web we're in html5 that
specifically gives a JavaScript way
basically a way to run JavaScript in the
background so you can run a long lasting
calculation it doesn't have to be the
classic example is always the prime
number calculator I think it's much more
interesting for let's say banking
applications that need to do a quick
calculation that might take oriole for
games that I think it's becoming more
popular that you don't block the
complete you I that javascript is single
threaded so if you need to run a two
second calculation you're you're you i
will be locked up for a while for as
long as that takes and so it's not not a
substitute for a poorly written code
it's just a way to sort of thread and
I've use threads in the browser it's
it's whether that's technically threads
is another discussion and there's
another big area under that html5 is
bringing in a ton of new features and
that's the offline and storage area so
any application that's running in your
desktop has a easy way to store data and
it will never had that I mean the only
thing ever
was cookies right so there was not a lot
of space that you didn't have a lot of
space in a cookie to store things and it
wasn't a great way to persist data and
now there's actually two different
things there's a file cache where you
can store a whole file CSS javascript
HTML and stores like data storage and
we'll talk about both of them so offline
web applications this is a feature that
you might have heard about it as
application cache is 1 i'm personally
really excited about it's a way to tag
your your site and say this is an
offline site when the loads in the
browser the browser instead of putting
it in the regular browser cache would
simply put it in an application cache so
not just the page that you're on
typically you'll find you're on a page
it goes into the browser cache so if you
ever come back to that page it may or
may not be served from the cash so
that's a benefit if you visited that
page but if I go to a page say haven't
visited yet and I'm offline then for
sure that page is not going to show up
and now with application cache you can
sort of say this is my site I'm going to
prefetch if you will the entire site and
so the next time you go from page a
two-page be it's already in the cache
and just load it super super fast so
it's a performance gain on top of the
nice fact that you can use the entire
site offline which is the first the main
benefit and the doodads you simply add
an app cache file you contain it
contains it's a simple text file I just
list out all the files you want to have
in your application again there's some
specific little things like the network
and fall back sections we're not going
to go into the details but you you
basically destroy the list of all the
files that are part of your app and then
your reference that file simply from the
HTML element so you give it manifest
equals and then point to the file it's
that simple running a page like this in
the browser will first load dead page
and then read that file and then load
everything into the application cache so
the other part and i mentioned how
cookie
we're the only other way you could store
data well now you've got what does main
term cookies on steroids you have a lot
of new data storage opportunity to
basically have like four api's there's
session storage local storage web sequel
database which is sort of on the way out
and an index DB which is sort of the new
database stored so these are simple text
storage area so web web storage contains
session stores and local source these
are ways to just push data like up to
like five megabytes by default you have
access to you can push that into the
browser's storage and rely on it later
so session storage is gone at the time
you close the browser but local stores
actually persists so you can put game
data and write it directly to disk if
you're offline maybe you can temporarily
serve push things into the local storage
when you're back online and you can
detect that with a whole bunch of new
html5 events you can then update the
server again and so there's a lot of lot
of powerful things that happens then you
have database storage you have web
sequel database index DVDs are in some
cases like relational databases where
you can actually write my objects and
binary data to like a whole blob of data
can be written the first one session
local by the way our text based only so
their key value pairs very simple
where's the database you can use
transactions to have a more businesslike
application so just another way that you
know you have the storage here and you
have the graphics all of these things
combined make for super powerful
applications that are going to be on par
with desktop applications the final area
is the connectivity in real time and in
that area there's also a whole bunch of
new stuff cross document messaging to
speak from let's say an iframe to a page
but that iframe can contain content from
a completely different domain xhr level
two servers and events WebSockets the
course standard is a part of the
standard that that allows you to share a
content across different origins
WebSocket really replay
comet and reverse Ajax hanging get long
polling all of those kind of techniques
basically those were all fake ways of
getting like real-time bi-directional
data and instead now WebSockets gives
you a new API and a new protocol that
you can speak in a browser basically the
Browns are going to open a TCP socket
with either text or binary data in it
and connect to back end message brokers
or databases or anything that that needs
bi-directional communication like chat
is a perfect example of it game
messaging game infrastructure messaging
is another great example so you have
that that full power in fact it the full
power of sockets but over port 80 so you
don't have to open a separate port on
the firewall which is a big big deal in
some cases kind of examples you can you
can build with that see
in the kind of demos you can build with
it are you know like this is an example
of another featured drag and drop
feature right that's here on the bottom
there's on the middle sorry is the the
charting the charting is done in html5
canvas and this data this fast moving
data you see here is actually WebSocket
based data is coming from a message
broker in it back in so all of these
things combined to really make for the
powerful for powerful applications and
so to wrap up with the final section the
what do you practically need to have in
your tool belt to to create these kind
of applications right it looks good but
what do you need and so the first thing
is take another look at your browser
development tools if you haven't looked
at these lately then you really owe it
to yourself to take a letter look at it
right the the kind of tools that are
built in for example the chrome
developer tools my personal favorite is
the you know there's all these shortcuts
you can you can turn him on right so
there's all these cool things like you
know you can figure out where exactly
parts of the page r &amp;amp; style them up you
can do in line styling you can actually
play around with all of the CSS you can
actually this has a feature in CSS in
the resources tab where you can look at
the CSS and literally save it in the
browser so it actually has like a little
subversion repository that keeps all of
the different thing it has ways to look
at the network traffic look at debugging
your scripts add-ons like page speed
that you need to run for performances
it's just an incredible amount of tool
to tool sets an application cache and
data views and you know scripts that is
normally the actus this is that sort of
minified script you can actually look at
it in in a pretty print view like this
so you can have a much easier way to
debug through even minified code and the
other thing is boilerplate so before
there were a whole bunch of things that
people needed as ways to to add things
their pages but boilerplate gives you a
great starting point if you need to
start a new project just use boilerplate
just download it it's written by Paul
Irish and a few other people great
resource that has basically everything
you need you get a complete labor a
complete starter package with CSS
JavaScript everything sort of handled
the right way and there's a lot of
things that don't won't work in in
browsers and just a few minutes to wrap
it up here so the boilerplate template
doesn't give you that but there's a
whole list of what are called polyfills
or emulations features so you might say
well I need the details element I'll use
it natively but i will use a jquery
details element polyfill so and can
detect that using which is also built
into moderniser i can detect that with
the modernizer library which is part of
boilerplate and you can build modernize
so moderniser as a whole comes with
html5 boilerplate and it comes with a
load script so you can actually run
tests to see whether a feature is
supported or not and then build your
emulations around that but you can also
go to the moderniser site now and it's
really cool you can just pick the
features you're interested in and build
a custom version of modernizing by the
way that the the creator of moderniser
will be at the html5 user group this
this thursday so check out the videos
for that after and chrome frame is
another way you can tell people here
just in your old version of IE just
embed the entire chrome browser and then
we we can use web kit from there on so
that that's really clear a couple of
free tools like paid speed wise slow and
speed tracer great tools that that are
free if you're not using them you know
why not right and I'm sure you've heard
from steve about that great tools that
just just to run in 10 seconds give you
a complete report card and that's it so
i know we're coming up on the time here
so i like i said i'll be around i'll
post the slides and SlideShare I will
stick around we'll probably have to make
way but i'll be in the
booth for any questions you might have
also pretty easy to find on Twitter
Linkedin and if you want my book is it's
called Pro html5 programming with this
coupon you can get fifty percent of the
e-book that's has a lot more details on
all the different ap is and a couple
more things that put in here and that's
it
