being here with me tonight so today
we're gonna talk about some kung-fu
thing so I'll start with the story a
long time ago I had the luxury of
getting to know and learn a lot from a
close family member a man with excellent
integrity he passed away years ago but I
could still remember all the fascinating
story that he told us how he drove my
parents to the hospital where I was born
with wonderful work to all his crazy
traveling because of his particular line
of work so in that line of work he also
needed to master several languages I'm
talking about human languages here not
computer languages everything from Dutch
to Japanese and Mandarin to Arabic these
days there are many different ways you
can use to measure your language skills
but back then when I was still alive I
asked about being able to have a good
command of a language and what he told
me is something that I will never forget
according to him there's a simple
yardstick that you can use to see
whether you're comfortable using a
language or not one you can tell joke in
the language and second if you're upset
with somebody you can express your anger
or disappointment to that person in that
language now it doesn't mean that you
have to be funny or angry all day long
however this simple yardstick is quite
literally simple and yet it's quite
powerful I think what we need in this
foreign world is some simple yardstick
like this to see after you become season
or experience from the front-end
developer what do you need to do how can
you know that you're faster from level
if you start any front-end project these
days there are a couple of steps that
are obvious to you first you need to
take a certain framework
it could be angular react ember your
favorite and then you need to come up
with the strategy for your testing take
a unit test framework come up with the
CI system put it in your built
environment all the usual steps and
maybe after that
you choose a way to analyze your Co
statically what is using Jesslyn or Jess
here yes Lee and Jess yes what have you
but after this what do you need to do
and looking around asking many people
about what they need to do I figure out
that there is no common answer there's
no clear path okay I pick my friend well
I've done my unit test I've done some
static analysis so what next
I mean we've been practicing TDD and BDD
for a while how many of you here
practice TDD BDD all right should we
become more pragmatic and practice
pragmatic driven development
okay PDD what we need to come up with
some sort of formulation that define the
path if you want to be running hero this
is what we need to do because you may
not admit it but we all like to be a
forum hero right
because you either die or escape hero
and anyone familiar with this type of
sentiments and the front end role you
want to tweet that go ahead don't wait
so for the rest of the talk I'll outline
five steps that allow you to move to the
next level and now this are not set in
stone meaning that you have to
completely follow this faithfully but
this sets an example or a guidelines as
to what you need to do in order to be
able to follow along at your convenient
time I create this simple project on
github go to github.com slice our ears
less from hero from zero to hero and
there is a modified version of the react
to do MVC nothing special about that I
just pick some sample app that has
enough code to be meaningful yet small
enough for everyone and I added some
tests into that app obviously because
strangely enough this to do
didn't come up with some include some
test so the test is using chai is the
assertion library and mocha is the test
library again you can use jasmine or
qunit or whatever you like and then in
that particular project I'm using karma
as the test runner karma will pick up
all the smoke up test and launch the
test in many different environment from
phantom J's headless browser to Chrome
Safari any kind of Brussels that you can
specify and then I added yes yes anyone
here using Jes yes well if you haven't
used that please check it out because
it's really cool it allows you to have a
uniform coding style across the project
so you can clone this project not not
right now letter and then you can see
some of the kung fu moves that I plan to
explain after this so if you type NPM
start after recording your you clone
that app obviously after npm install
then you can see that the it just serve
the content you can open it up in a web
browser and you'll see the familiar to
do MVC and nothing magical up to this
point so first step get hooks anyone
here is a big fan of other refreshment
control system then get any more crows
mercurial fanboys in the house Ashley
gone guys
fossil good subversion perforce
get has this powerful powerful hooks and
it is amazing how a lot of people after
using get for a while haven't discovered
this how many of you haven't use github
alright so the very least those who
haven't use get looks if you start using
it looks tomorrow or after we talk right
away you'll make me real really happy so
next time I'll show up at this meetup of
the everyone says yes I just get dogs
there are a couple of hooks define we'd
get but we can we can take a look at the
most common one so get pull there's
something called pre-commit Oh what it
does is a hook it's just a script and in
the context of pre-commit whole good
will one your pre cameto your script
before it tries to commit whatever you
have in your working directory and if
the exit code is zero I will continue
and do the commit as usual if it's not
zero then I'll stop your working
directory
it remains dirty essays is nothing will
be committed usually we don't realize
this because it happens behind the scene
and you notice this until you have to
connect up that's a similar thing we
push hook I don't write be familiar with
this scenarios but many many times I
pushed my future Prime's thinking that I
got everything already sorted out and
turn out there's a lot of bad commands
and stuff that I need to clean up it's
just embarrassment because once you push
it out there it's for everyone to see
pretty push works very similar to
pre-commit except that it does run your
hook right before the real push so if
your script your pre push hook fails in
other words it returns nonzero then it
won't because your branch will stay but
locally now this is powerful because
this is where you can put certain sanity
check a very popular way to create a
hook is just write a script and this is
if it's just copy and paste this three
lines so
you got a committal pre-commit hook that
says npm run jazz yes next time you try
to commit something it will be executed
but the gotcha hears that you have to
set the default in the executable hence
the change attribute to plus X if you
forgot to do the second part it will
lead to mysterious box that will waste
you hours so just copy and paste this
you'll get a very simple pre-commit hook
and you can put whatever you like
instead of NPM run yes yes maybe you
have grants scrip or glass or go to us
dead ones
I don't know just him for you here's an
example say I have created this on that
particular sample application and then I
tried to commit a fix but if I violate
the code style yes yes we'll compare
complainant by that virtue by the virtue
of that freaka me at all it will stop
the commit from from happening again
this indicates that I knew single quote
yes yes kindly point out that are you
single quote on that although my coding
style Mendez I use double quotes for
string in other words accidentally if I
introduce some new code that that
doesn't follow the existing coding style
GSEs will complain and I won't be able
to commit that at all any questions so
far
of course you can do the same with
pre-poo so now here's the trick
typically you don't want to want
something crazy in your pre committed if
it lounge
web server and talk to some back-end
database and spend five minutes doing
its check then you're not going to warm
it you want to choose something that is
very very simple that most of the time
you forgot to do that
NPM tasks if you have a reasonably fast
unipass that will be a suitable
candidate as well so choose wisely one a
basic sanity check and put that in your
pre-commit hook as well
pre-post folk so that was easy the
second one I'm gonna talk about code
complexity so code complexity is quite
complex pun intended
fortunately there's a website that
explain everything you need to know
about complexity just go to jazz
complexity complexity dot org then
there's there's a box there where you
can put your code and they'll show up
all the fancy metrics from cyclomatic
complexity to any other maintenance
factor so let's take a look at the
cyclomatic complexity not going to take
it into details but cyclomatic
complexity roughly proportional to the
amount of different code path that is
taken in your code so this one is very
simple but if you have something like
this so if brands and it goes the left
right up and down then your number will
go up so that's all you need to know
there's there's no scientific value in
the number itself it doesn't mean it
doesn't correlate to something physical
obviously you want to have as low
complexity as possible and this is where
the tools just complexity plays an
important role if you install the
package the node package then you can
also run or check for complexity in the
communal line it's called CR for a
complexity report and you'll get all
kind of report like this and second
metric complex is just one of the
metrics that you will be able to obtain
they're not that complexity a report
will scan your source code and analysis
statically and will come up with the
complexity per function and this is very
important so that you can come up with
an implementation of a certain function
and then as soon as it reached certain
certain threshold I don't know maybe 6
or 12 or use your best judgment then
that's an indication that you might want
to start to refactor that function split
it into small function simplify do
whatever necessary so that that function
that particular function doesn't have
tons of different combination of code
paths I'm sure in your life you've seen
this
huge 2,000 lines of function that is
impossible to debug let alone refactor
and we want to avoid to be in that state
and the best way to do that is to
prevent your code to turn into spaghetti
like that so that's about complexity I
believe is it easy or complex all right
the third one getting there we're half
way code coverage how many of you track
code coverage of your application Wow
again for the rest of you it's that easy
I'll show you the tricks here
the popular tools for code coverage is
called Istanbul and it works by having
two very important modules instrumental
and coverage and coverage analysis so
the for the first one instrumental is
very easy if you have a test and you
want to run the test against your
application library modules for code
coverage to work it needs to know which
part of your library module application
will be touched by that unit test and
therefore you don't want your unit test
against the original source you run it
against the instrumented version of the
source combine it with fast you'll get
coverage report this is the beauty of
using a test Runner such as karma
because you can use several plug-ins for
karma to perform unit tests so if you
already have karma configuration file
that looks like this all you need to do
is add a new karma DES coverage plugin
in the list of plugins and then run some
preprocessor and coverage there and
create the reporter and then choose the
type of report that you want to have
again this exists in the sample repo
that I've mentioned earlier if you do
that and you can open coverage report
it's a normal stem open in the browser
and you'll see something like this
remember earlier I mentioned that I
added some unit tests in the DEP to the
MVC but I wasn't finished
so there are some function that have no
corresponding unit that's wrong and we
discovered that right away because the
slimes on this function are highlighted
with very bright red
over there and that means that those are
uncovered JavaScript statements which
mean that no tests touched that
particular code or press differently
that function is not tested which is
pretty scary consider it's very
important functional subscribe and
informal
now the using this trick that means you
can take a look at your modules library
application what have you and discover
oh my unit test doesn't cover this part
my unit has completely ignore this part
and the worst possible scenarios is that
you have multiple branches using if
statement or other conditional and you
realize that you spend hours coming up
with unit tests that only worries about
one particular side of the code and
completely ignore dress will be nice if
the word can see your code coverage well
only if you have good coverage of course
otherwise it's sort of a public shaming
in this particular example I weren't up
code coverage dashboard service code
code
there are many service like this I pick
one and what you see when you won a
local coverage test is exactly what you
see on that dashboard so your teammates
the world can see that Michael my
coverage here is not pretty good because
one is 77 percent the other one is
ninety two is okay
how does it work well you have to
integrate it with your build system or
build environment so you have your code
repository and you build system in this
particular example I use traffic CI you
need to send your complex report to the
dashboard service in this case code
curve or you can also use coveralls
which is pretty cool even better if
someone come up with a pool requests
because they created the feature branch
that coverage check can be run in that
particular feature branch and in this
case code curve nicely or conveniently
tells you if coverage suddenly regresses
code coverage itself a symmetric is just
a percentage it's probably not so
meaningful obviously we've been
100% but 90% is also not so bad
80 percents probably okay but what you
want to watch is a regression if I my
project has a hundred percent coverage
and you are a new contributor and
suddenly you contribute a huge
improvement or bug fixes and suddenly
the code coverage regressed just 50%
then indicates that you forgot to
include some tests for all the new lines
of code that you just created and so
that the regression is the one that
matters not the absolute value it would
be nice if that regression is reported
in the poll requests here's an example
it says that well previously the code
coverage is hundred percent now it's
down to 80 percent because there are
some lines not covered by the test or
the test doesn't exist or the test is
not sufficient by catching it early on
then you we you you will not allow any
kind of code that there's a staff
performance test to enter your code
repository this also reduced the
personal aspect of the code review
because if you create the Porticus and I
tell you hey your code coverage sucks
you might be offended but this is the
this is a tool that tells you that your
efforts regress so what will you do you
can smash your laptop but not good for
you yes so this is fantastic code by
death glass he works for Yahoo if you
think just Lyndhurst you're feeling wet
until you system work for doing code
coverage because your heart will be
broken into pieces you think you're
doing a good job at building and
maintaining your unit tests until the
reality kicks in and realize that oh no
I'm not I'm not actually testing my
application if you are doing code
coverage for the first time I suggest
playing this in the background
because you will be miserable and sad
and unhappy so I think it fits your
situation there
this is Wham whew any Wham fans of the
house okay good all right so that's what
got coverage we're hoping they're
speaking about coverage number for
running your apps with evergreen browser
so every game browser is the browser
that is constantly updated to the latest
version you're familiar with Chrome and
Firefox and now Microsoft age on Windows
icicles also consider everything browser
it is very tempting to run your tests
and 300 different combination of browser
from browser on blackberry to I don't
the latest iPhone that is not out yet
but it's it's good however remember what
I mentioned earlier about pre-commit
hook on pre-parole
if possible one your apps can be
everything with with the African browser
as soon as possible because it's
supposed to be fast supposed to be cheap
and if it doesn't work already in the
latest version of Chrome and Firefox
why bother testing it on you know
blackberry and other devices by the time
all bets are probably all imagine you
build a an email application if someone
could not login if your login test
doesn't work in Chrome then forget about
the rest so the trick here is to be able
to have an environment where you can run
the latest version of the browser for
your application surprise there's these
things called act failure this is a CI
for C sharp and dotnet application any
shop dotnet fencin house and it's
probably wrong question for jobs give me
enough
this is however very popular in the
windows world because it says
essentially you can say this as a
traffic Zi for Windows you may dislike
Windows however there's one nice thing
about Windows it has a third-party
package manager surprise
who would thought that Windows its
package manager and that's a nice
wrapper around that called chocolaty so
you can just if after you install
chocolaty you can type choco install
Firefox and boom on your aura should I
say schedule since this cool thunderman
suddenly you have the latest version of
Firefox on your desktop same thing with
Chrome Google problem when you think
about Windows usually you think about
opening ie you go to google.com slash
Chrome and click on the link and then
you install it click make neck snacks
and then there you have a chrome that is
not Windows this day your information is
outdated but at least five years two
days you can have a package management
on Windows and this is very powerful
because only a virtualized environment
of Windows running on a player allows
you thin saw tons of Windows application
on your desktop and this is what we
leverage here if you create an affair
yamo file and put it in your project and
sign up with affair there's a free tier
for that and you run your apps suddenly
you can you can do this you can do this
magic remember this app is just known
and not one on Windows I feel like I'm
promoting Microsoft law here and if it
runs these steps then what happens is is
connect just a screenshot yeah if you if
you want to know what package is
available you can go to this website and
it even has a nice copy investible
one line that you can use to install
whatever package that you like here's
what happens in the built environment if
you do this joke a lot of our folks will
look up some registry somewhere and then
download it install it for you
and you can start using it same with
update Firefox sometimes it's necessary
to do install an update because you
don't know what what
packages already available in the system
if you do this what you have is the
latest version of Firefox in chrome and
it's dead easy any questions so far so
last but not least well there's
something called there's a concept
called the downstream project and this
is not so popular yet so I'm doing my
best here to campaign for this strategy
everyone here is probably building apps
with no and and one of the most of all
perhaps is Express but if you think
about all the stack that allows you an
express have to be used by your users
well Express is running or not so
obviously there's not there but no the
major chunk of notice just kept engine
v8 the same JavaScript engine that
powers Google Chrome what I mean by
downstream here is that expresses the
downstream project for not notice the
downstream project for VA and why is it
important to pay attention to this
because in today's world of complicated
and sophisticated web apps you may
accidentally break your downs from the
downstream dependency without realizing
it what if the next version of node
doesn't work with your your version of
Express you'll cry or what if Google
chains v8 so that note doesn't run
anymore obviously it won't happen but in
that hypothetical scenarios suddenly the
internet doesn't work anymore and you
can think of this as there's library and
the library builds a framework because
if you imagine that frameworks as it's a
collection of several libraries and then
there does your app so if you're an app
developer and you use a library from
your coworker then you should be nice to
them because they might not realize that
their libraries been used by you and
therefore if they introduced something
something that breaks your app that's
not good for you so in this spirit of
being nice to your downstream what you
have to do if you're a framework
developer
you will amber if you bill angular if
you bill it will react you need to find
out all the popular projects that use
your femoral and test it for every
updates that you have in your femoral so
it's a bit backward usually we worry
about that direction now we all put the
distraction so you care about your user
if I write library X and it's been used
by this person over here maybe it's been
popularly used by this person over there
then I try to come up with the way not
to break that particular use case
apparently to shift this is so easy that
it fits in an ice-cream oh by the way
this is my example to the MVC obviously
there's a trillion emphasis on backbone
backbone is underscore so if underscore
breaks backbone then many apps out there
that we lost some backbone won't work
anymore
so if you're an underscore developer you
should pay attention that backbone is
not broken by your updates same with
backbone into the MVC it's so easy to do
this that it fits in a slide this is a
concept of testing your downstream
project couple of stuff there you clone
that dancin project and then you install
it dependency I'm assuming this is just
normal node project and then we replace
your awesome library that is in the copy
of that downstream project we have your
fresh version and put it there and
launch that downstream project unit test
so essentially you're checking out the
downstream project and replace the
library your library with your own copy
and see if that works well this is very
simple and yet it's very powerful and if
you're crazy you want it for everything
or for requests and every single commit
so that you know you can give a heads up
to that well downstream project hey I'm
about to break your your apps they will
help you but they will help you less
compared to surprise your app won't work
anymore one once you publish your new
package any question what the downstream
project tests tomorrow
alright so bonus
now that you do all these things
checking code coverage checking code
complexity run the option project
something that came to my mind as I
tried to follow all these pathways turn
out that you don't need to do this
sequence e you can do this step by seven
check the code coverage Wow it's it's
good and then run cross browser test or
every game browser and then finally
check your grants from Project now you
don't need to follow this pattern you
can do everything at once like this who
said that you cannot check the
downstream project before you know that
your coverage it good so if all the
downstream project is good after your
update but your code coverage decreases
then you just need to fix that one this
also saves a lot of time because some
time running extensive tests such as
cross-browser testing is the most
expensive and the longest among my the
tests so rather than waiting 15 minutes
until you're 200 browser tests finis to
look at the code coverage you can do
that right away and to make things even
more amazing you can run do some
different service if you're using a
project one of them can run on traffic
the other can run on Jenkins and there's
too many free CI system these days so
why not leverage all of them so I hope
some of these steps some extra come few
moves that you learn today will allow
you to make a better foreign developers
and thank you very much for your
attention
