from Latvia I'm a background of graphic
design I'm a graphic designer and I'm
not a web designer another developer I
do both sometimes but I'm a graphic
designer and a CEO of the company and
founder as well print is a tool that
works in your browser and it helps you a
lot but I'll go first a little bit back
and explain why actually we're doing it
and where is the problem so there's one
thing I all never liked in web design is
the thing that I have this feeling that
I'm crippled that I have to do things in
Photoshop because I can't do them by
code so when I pass it over to somebody
else then they showed me how it will be
but it's already too late and print
world there are these things called the
dummies and mock-ups and prototypes and
also in product design like the real
product product design you always build
something so you see how it will work in
the real life so you tried to build a
thing as close to real as possible
because the process is going to drive
you with new ideas in web design for
some unknown reason it took like 30
years to figure it out we finally just
now talked about like this energy should
code that's a long way to go so I i
really like Bruce Mau the American
designer who made this manifesto and one
of the things there is make your own
tools so if you don't like something
create your own ones so I thought nobody
else is really fixing it in a way how I
believe it should be so okay then this
is me too
time so if you look at the tools of
developers those guys are lucky it like
and the reason is that can create their
own tools this is approximately the
timeline of cool things that happened
and for the lucky developers and and one
of the big things there is github we
change the way how people develop and
like it's very normal not to be open to
Roman to share and to give you time to
somebody else project designers yay
you're nineteen ninety or something it's
good and of course new tools are
emerging but i think is like if we could
say github is quite popular bootstrap is
quite popular this is the winner here
still a little bit awkward because
doesn't really work as it used to be
said and of course it's the reason is
that there there this history of design
where design was always handed over to
someone versus this new thing is you
actually design it and code it yourself
and then like just this developer fixes
the things you have no idea how to fix
anyways so of course designer should
learn code like really you want to do
browser compatibility things and solve
issues for like rendering speeds most
probably know and i think nobody
actually in the whole world should fix
those things like four or five guys
broke this thing and now every developer
and designer in the whole world for each
project is fixing them it's a little bit
like waste of time there are so many
better things to do so i would say the
problem is in technology really the
problem with them web design and why
it's still too much waste of time
involved in web design the problem is
mainly bad designed
this is the website that was just
launched recently called yeah and the
thing is websites aren't broken they
work like make one in plain HTML and it
will be super responsive it will be
lightweight you don't have to load like
jQuery for to make one animation what we
do we want to have one animation so we
load the called jQuery and we want to
have like fonts but maybe why not to
have like five and then maybe images
they should be big because it's
important if images should be big now so
what we actually want to do is to bring
back the design to web design does it
make sense to you it's a move back
actually about thinking more about the
design part and not about thinking
what's the newest thing in code but it
can use a new animation stuff and
parallax 5 and when I mean design and
when I mean good design so these are the
things actually I believe we designers
should worry about and that's first is
context like look at dribble or
basically start up a lot of startups who
look exactly the same so you would
change the name for the website and it's
still the same like you wouldn't even
recognize the see the difference and
there's layout performance is a big
thing so it makes no sense to load the
website full filled with stuff just to
have one nice animation which most
probably going to load slower and nobody
will see it anyways typography
accessibility which is responsive design
and that's why we're here and of course
there's somewhere there is style like
you can go flat you can go different and
if after all like conquering all these
things you still have time to learn code
like that's awesome fine please do so
I think there's no encode yes totally
you should be literate in code because
you consume it you should be able kind
of to frighten it but I don't think we
should take it too seriously and go too
far in design there is a lot of things
to learn anyways an example this is
squares product called Bay something I
don't know how it's called that's why I
pay my roommate the context is email
this thing doesn't even have interface
what they did they made one small thing
that going to be it doesn't even need to
be responsive because it fits in your
mobile screen anyways it's super simple
it has nothing else what it doesn't need
so this is where things like all the
dimensions before context layout
everything goes together and kind of
makes a great product so I I would say
as I mentioned the problem isn't
technical so I would say the problem is
in the workflow that we pay too much
attention maybe not do the right thing
so I'd say that actually we should use
the right tool for the right job and
don't mix them up coding is awesome
design is visual thinking about design
is easier if you use something that you
see right away why do have this
translation in the middle to make those
decisions then again coding sometimes
makes very lot of sense so what we are
bringing here or bringing to the table
is actually another approach to it to
web design and it will not solve all the
problems it will not do everything you
want to do but it going to give you
another way of designing a visual way so
what is it but its front I can maybe you
start that what it's not it's not a
content management system and it's not a
thing to build website that your mom
going to build websites now and you're
going to be out of your job most
probably not it's just a better way to
design in the browser and this is how it
looks it runs in a browser everything
happens there it feels like design
software at least we are working hard to
make it sir it's a its drag and drop so
you basically design things just by
moving them around because is because
it's in a browser you can see right away
how the funds are rendered correctly you
can open it up an Internet Explorer and
see that round corners are gone it's
fine that's how I water is going to see
it anyways but at least you know it you
don't dream that you're making this
perfect design that going to live in
this perfect world never going to be
implemented anyways the cool thing is
and why we are here it's responsive of
course so you can while building it you
can actually have multiple layouts for
the same project right away and it's not
just like mobile thing or desktop thing
you can have basically any size for your
break point like also you had a narrow
ones so you can have completely
different layouts for a different
content for different break points so
how can it be used it's at first is to
see for yourself will your design work
will it you can open you can share the
URL with your client you can open
yourself on a phone see you like is the
type size is right it's not like making
something in Photoshop scaling double up
like having the app which shows it on
the ipad and it's not moving there
anyways so you can actually test what
you're doing that's the whole thing but
there's a twist and that's why I had
this beginning and at the beginning I
was talking about the workflow the tool
itself is awesome but it's not helping
actually make better design decisions it
may be easier but so how actually do we
learn we learn by looking what others
did
how they solve it why this type works
where these colors look cool so that's
why all projects created in front are
public unless you pay and and that means
anybody can open up any project and any
project becomes a template so if you
like one part of your project somewhere
or some let's say menu or header or
layout you can just close it you clone
it and it becomes your yours and you can
edit it you can get inspired by it
eventually you can steal it which we
don't encourage but if we can live with
open source coding maybe there is a time
when we could live also it open sourced
web design okay so that's that's how we
believe we are changing workflow it's
like it's not you're just getting
inspired by the nice designs of
Photoshop and in triple trying to kind
of replicate them at home you have them
they're like you need a login thing
there it is it's coded all ready for you
like change the colors change everything
so you don't waste your time on things
you actually shouldn't because you're
copying it anywhere so anyway so let's
just make it easier and of course you
can test it and tell your developer like
look this is how it should be in the
small screen but this is how it should
be in the big screen you know like
nothing changes but that's changes that
part is fluid that part is static so you
have a better discussions you can
actually talk about more important
things maybe you are actually interested
about type pairings which funds won't
work together so yeah we have project
like that just check it out maybe it
works so now is the scariest part I'm
going to go into this demo mode
so it never ever worked in the world
like demo something on stage and that it
works flawless and we will see but one
thing I wanted to add is them yeah that
this simplicity and changes in the
workflow isn't just to make changes the
design currently is broken like the way
how much we waste time is broken so
let's see if we can now convince you
that we can fix it
ok now it's tiny do you see something
yeah I hardly see it myself right just a
second ok this is a this is my personal
project page in print sorry that I at
all tried to bleak somehow not turn the
back on you these are the projects I
made they are also featured projects lot
of them so you can actually have a look
and have a look at some basically any of
these projects are cloneable so let's
clone this one we still live in this
world where internet takes time to load
things so sorry about that this is a
huger bigger screen than it was a couple
of minutes ago so yeah and this is a
this is a layout for website for my
friend but it's very kind of simple and
let's see how that works so as we see
there is a multiple like different
layout and everything's kind of changing
although in a middle point like
something weird is happening so most
probably that should be fixed so what we
do here is we're not really telling you
how to design so that's another thing
what we're not we're not helping you
design like we want you to design we
allow you actually to break things as
well if you're going to let make this
box like super weird it's going to stay
like that we won't save you from
yourself so
at the same time I believe all the cool
things in the world at least design-wise
they are they start with something that
we consider a mistake or weird or ugly
say and the things that are beautiful
like they become pouring very soon so
that's why we have this freedom and that
would be aiming for actually you can do
whatever you like here in terms of
layout and design let's open another one
so yeah while we are here as I mentioned
you can preview it internally now that
means like this is a preview this is how
this website going to look like this is
all HTML and rendered CSS so the result
of tricks inside and if you share this
URL with your client or open it on your
phone it going to just work
yeah the login form i mentioned and here
I'd like to show actually a cool thing
with what we like a lot or SVG which
stands for vector graphics right and
they scalable so the cool thing of
course that you can scale them endlessly
and they're going to stay super sharp so
while you're designing it's kind of
handy the article thing about it is that
you can change the color while you're
actually making your designs it's also
kind of helpful so SVG's are super cool
but the word what's the word the word
they are they're a little tricky like if
you use them in production Google most
probably won't find them that easily
it's going to it won't show it and the
image results they're going to be super
fast but also Facebook will not really
show them when you're sending your page
to do to a friend so they cool and for
design process like the awesome for the
end result like you must know what you
do like in general about this via it's
not that our SVG is a better or worse
than others as long as I mentioned even
like with SVG's you can have likes a
different color and each break point and
it's just like if somebody can open this
up on a mobile phone it's going to be
green and the desktop it going to be red
so when we talk about is vgs we can talk
more about copy and pasting did it work
it works so this is this is part of the
work for what we are introducing here is
like just copy things and base things
you can copy and paste this whole thing
and then and it's there you can even
let's go back to this project and so
let's paste it here
well it work it works so there you have
two nice completely useless forms at
this point but the idea is that's how
you that's the word flow we imagine what
makes a little bit more sense while you
designing you just take parts and pieces
from other projects you like or you made
it's not like you have to take it from
somebody else of course you can be built
you can build up your own library with
items that you can store and reuse its
most probably anyways you like if you
interstar if your client are startups
it's a landing page with a nice computer
screen and a foul in a hand or something
like there are a lot of parts which we
are using buttons and styles and by the
way yeah okay let's talk about the funds
we just recently launched the full type
it library thanks Greg so which we are
pretty excited and this is one of the
features we really like because it's
does the whole essence of why we're
doing this you can use web funds and see
how they work like now not like load
them later to try them somewhere as I
said the internet but yeah they work
even like we're still thinking about but
even the width fonts usually work so
this is pretty cool at least I really
like it and of course for each break
point you can you can change the sizes
and then see it right away another cool
feature i'm going to show you is the
ability actually to copy styles not
using this picker thing that but so many
people are used to is simply common
shift + v yes there we go basically can
copy any style of anything and apply it
to something else that speeds things
simply up
you can use undo awesome as I mentioned
funds they are still tricky and they not
tricky technically the tricky because
you have to make the decision which one
to use and if we see the current
obsession with proxima nova like that's
the cool guy now well there are a lot of
them it's a it's scary that actually you
now you can choose any fun combination
you like you don't have to stick with
Helvetica and try to squeeze everything
out of it and that a thing is your
project must probably won't look like
bootstrap that easily then you will have
to really work hard to make it similar
and by the way that's also the one of
the differences of so we don't like
templates we don't like automated design
in general we believe coding should be
automated repetitive tasks encoding
especially but not the design it should
be guiding you helping you but not
automate things for you its design it's
human of course you scale it down it's
all responsive different sizes of funds
so this is another simple project this
time with the small interaction and
currently we are great to making layouts
we don't have the two things you most
probably would like to have like now one
is navigation so we don't have a like
concept of adding menus drop downs and
flying in menus from the left and flying
from the right not yet we want to make
it right so it's going to we're going to
make it right and so far you can't do a
lot of things but in that case you you
have to know a little coding it's not
like very different from the standard
coding so it's basically the same thing
except you've read it here so if you
wonder for whom is this thing like is it
for me so I'd say if you making layouts
on a daily basis on a weekly basis for
and if you consider yourself kind of web
designer related yes it could help
communicate better with your team with
developers and talking about the code
and developers of course you can export
the code in this case it warns you that
it uses Typekit fonts and this is the
whole CSS of the project this is the
whole HTML so you can you can actually
look through it you can if you don't
know the coding then actually you can
learn as well you can see why this box
works why it scales because it has
margins and percentages and has with
things in there but then at least you
can see you know and of course you can
download it as a zip so eventually you
can just download the whole thing
including all the scripts JavaScript all
the assets and post it on your server
wherever you like it's free crazy
so another thing what we are not we are
not a hosting providing service at least
not yet we encourage the design side of
things one more cool feature I like the
show we go to the cool thing called
Photoshop stay with me please day
somebody was so you guys are familiar
with this right oh no Photoshop has this
weird thing like the retina displays and
not the newest Photoshop and they don't
go well together so I decided not to
show that the thing which is there but
basically anyways I will show you you
know you in cs6 you can copy the code
copy the CSX of objects that means if
you create something and apply effects
on top of that like let's say gradients
let's say inner shadow outer shut our
stuff like that you can copy the CSS
code and what I'm doing now I'm copying
the CSS thing just a second
I know something like broke here as well
come on furniture Oh anyways what I'm
saying I what I one shot the thing is in
the same way as I showed how you can
paste things the same way you can paste
any CSS on top of that thing and it
going to restore it for you that's kind
of cool so that means you can use
anything music now and if you want to
show some CSS to someone else we can
render it for you we also support the
grids which is an interesting thing and
I can show you actually how things like
what do we mean like when we say design
stuff here by dragging and dropping this
let's create an let's add this these are
pure of my preset texts like I think
like the order should be by the way
around and it's almost time website this
is how I do things are we really like
recommend like we're not really saying
how things should be here like if you're
really like flexible to do things like
this which make no sense at this point
let's add more of those those things to
these are presets of images with a text
this is a logo let's see what else we
have here a background image so what we
provide it actually is just examples
what can you do and we encourage people
use it as a as a building blocks as
Legos where you simply like learn from
that if you like it you take it to the
next level and then
in your design so any questions so far
oh yes yeah yeah as i mentioned i'm a
designer so if i say something let the
letters that make no sense like just
blinker so it's it's built basically the
back end is very simple and it's in
python we use flask as a framework
instead of django which is like big and
fat we are like nice and agile then
there is whole the whole front end thing
which is like a lot and it holds
together by backbone and javascript and
then are like 10 years things like
somewhere in the middle like I don't
know really those names that's that's
all I can give Anna and actually another
one of the fancies things we have is
that also one of the weirdest are you
fronting their back-end developer
awesome sorry it's yeah the database we
using so it's what I actually didn't
mention so far is like we also have the
whole versioning built in so that means
you can have multiple versions of your
project and you can choose which version
of this thing you are showing to the
clients so you can show one and
meanwhile you can work on another one
you won't see but for that we use a
fancy solution with your lights so as a
small tiny databases for the project
which means every project is a small
anything we put somewhere and we just
take it when we need it and it's way
faster and cooler and
doing in so it's around the year thank
you do you hear everybody heard a
question heard the question should I
repeat it yes it's a like the question
is if in the back and you could add the
navigation and everything and have
multiple pages so it's kind of secret
but we're working on those things right
now so currently if you want to add
fancy stuff you can add JavaScript you
can add the HTML and CSS it's in line a
little bit ugly maybe but it will work
so to prove the concept to the client to
test it out for yourself into a work but
we are working on multiple pages and and
also also better things the navigation
is kind of they got together with
multiple pages the thing is at this
point there's a lot of questions what
what the navigation responsive design
should be like when you should be up
there now it should be the hamburger
icon and or should go downstairs now
like on the bottom it's like all these
theories and so it's a little tricky and
we want to provide a good solution at
least you had the same so it's like it's
a it's a question of 12 months so it's
not like in years and and that's not the
only only thing we're working on so it's
a there are other nice things we still
want to improve and I can say that we
most probably won't stop with that now
we have 100,000 and no wait five 1500
fonts more than that but we like to
actually have more a lot of nice
families are hope there how loan so we
want to get more options that relay like
that helps design
those that's important for us yeah Kevin
so if you're going to be copying and
pasting from one design that's not yours
into design that's yours you're copying
things in the dung of one thing and
those things have their own classes
already on them you're pasting that into
your potentially creating conflicts of
class names and things when you do that
how do you resolve those conflicts
automatically know if they can repeat
the question when the question basically
is like if you import another and paste
and other widgets we call all those
things widgets by the way if you paste
those things then then the structure of
classes classes and the class names get
damaged and how do we solve it so
currently support for classes is one of
the other features we're working on so a
better more control of our support for
classes so now the classes are applied
automatically but anyhow we know a lot
about all projects so that's partly the
secret now when can we solve things like
we know what which user is doing like
what's the structure of those names so
we can fix it for you and but it will be
interesting like the support for classes
in general like what I like about it is
like almost makes this thing like in
design in design is my favorite app
almost
and I always loved the flexibility and
the kind of control like what in design
gives and it makes so much sense when
you're making a book and the web design
currently it in my head at least it gets
closer to print design we worry way more
about the content about the structure
about the basic things and that's
awesome and and design is important like
finally again not like like in 90s but
like really important and by the way
this is the thing that in the panel you
see which looks like Photoshop layers
that is the dumb structure so yeah
that's kind of visual HTML you have to
do a little bit more to break it's so
yeah if you log in you're going to see
order all the example projects in couple
maybe next week maybe let's see but we
also launching more projects you can
search so at this point they are not
searchable so that means we're going to
start tagging things and providing you
just more and more options actually you
can choose from but yeah you can start
from scratch you can open a demo page
you can open a page from somebody else
yeah yeah yeah yeah you I can show you
so let's go to my projects so when you
log in you see these three things and
that means with this one you're going to
start that is written it's written there
blank page so you're going to start with
an empty project most probably you know
what to do like if you're doing this you
can start with a demo page we made just
to kind of get you started or you will
see all the featured projects all these
projects in your site so you can view
any of them and you can clone any of
them so wine yeah and then another cool
thing is like you can experiment with a
lot of CSS things here for example this
project is I tried all out the unit's V
all the fancy css3 units that allow you
to make cool things just to play with it
so there you can do things which you can
do normally as well it just takes way
more to time and this one yeah any more
questions yeah
yeah so well if the question is like can
can you automatically test it on
different browsers then the answer is no
not yet most probably we gonna hook it
together at some point with some
external service who provides it which
basically means you send a link and you
get back the all-night screenshots from
all the weird browsers you would never
use and that's kind of that's coming but
that's not the the upcoming very close
upcoming feature okay any oh yeah there
is one a little bit there's like old
blog post but like this guy coffee by
design and there's a Twitter or even
like every day so and I didn't though in
the developer world that's like you know
we copy go to all drivers that works so
and it seems like they got a kind of a
big idea here sort of this open source
design I just feel like coffee beans
though so I'm actually my question of
the cultural question you're pitching
this to designers have you had a lot of
backlash on that topic and how has the
reception vent the idea that ya gonna
put this up there may not get any
attribution and just live with it yeah
so I think the center's are ready to
share they naturally used to share it in
the way that somebody really takes it
they want to show off more than share
and that's and we can see the dribble
part like which is which is awesome but
at the same time we see the dribble
ization of the whole design it becomes
about style and nice looking flat things
so it's not really different from this
camera fishmen shiny things we now hate
so it's a little bit awkward but the
workflow is people like each other they
follow each other and they make
similar looking things later and as we
see it's like they gonna steal it anyway
so just let's make it easier so we get
kind of over that it's like and then we
can like because it's so easy most
probably they're going to save some time
so they can start thinking more I hope
and in making something that kind of
surprises themselves surprises the world
like we go back to credit with make the
whole world like dutch design maybe a
little bit where is way more kinda they
push it further and lot of ways so i
don't know but but there is this
question especially from people who are
not designers it's like you you mean
like somebody going to steal my website
had it had it like that's terrible like
websites in general are opens most open
source thing on earth web website design
sorry anybody can steal all the code you
have yet nobody's really doing it
because it's lame like why would you
have web site like somebody else it's
not perceived good that what I mean so I
believe people would do it it would be
simpler but it would save time that
people actually can focus on important
things talk with developers like hey
okay like design is done like in an hour
so how do we push the whole project
further how can we make it cooler how
can we make it more lightweight how can
make it load faster and work better to
those i believe i would like to that
those are become the normal discussions
and another thing is like the concepts
of web design currently those who are
older remember 90 something or twit 2000
when when we had this round menus
remember that was like in tables like
design things in tables and code in
tables that was the thing like that's
how you do that's her cool kid role it's
awesome so somebody was advocating all
those things i was too young to remember
who but but people were telling that the
way to do things semantic screw
semantics and now we're finally getting
back to that actually to the core yes
semantics kind of matter and i'm content
matters and that's one one more slide I
have so design should be your decision
should be kind of based on the on the
content you have and not on the devices
and that's why we give the freedom
instead of those three default break
points when you hope nobody could not
look in the middle and if they do then
they see a lot of new things and this is
basically the spectrum now it's not like
we have those three three things only
there is everything is covered by some
kind of with device even iphone has like
four sizes now like landscape portrait
by two so yeah so that that's why I
think it's like a lot of new things
should will be made like new decisions
how to design how to make a better
navigation how to make better layouts
how to make it faster a lot of cool
things are happening in the coding
coding part of the world or they make
bootstrap foundation a lot of new cool
tools are coming out you can now edit
almost everything but we are still crazy
about the workflow part improving the
workflow and making it better and in
your questions
yeah sir we are with time yeah of course
we also hiring I'm going to surprise but
the if you see that you can contribute
the division even as a designer in your
studio or startup or a developer and you
think like hey you can also design
something like yes try shrimp and share
with others like try it let's see what
happens nobody knows like will the world
say yes or will they say no so I believe
we could try it sounds like it couldn't
break it didn't break with coding it
became better but it wasn't that smooth
at first so yeah join us in one way or
another or let us know and talk to us
thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
