in browsers that's currently supported
in Chrome Safari and Firefox and there's
partial support in Internet Explorer
now we don't boo browser vendors we like
we want to support the wall make them
all awesome so the goal of content
security policy is to help mitigate
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities if
you've built a large website and had
mean people come to your site and try to
hack it you will be familiar with this
problem the general approach for content
security policy is a bit different from
other techniques for stopping cross-site
scripting so most previous techniques
either focused on like on server-side
frameworks or on like JavaScript
escaping techniques so content security
policy is a bit different in this model
what happens is the website declares to
the browser policy for where its scripts
and other resources are expected to come
from and if the website loads resources
or scripts from somewhere else the
browser blocks it so the idea is if the
attacker tries to load Z load his script
the script won't be on the websites
policy and the browser will stop it and
there'll be no no attack so in that
sense it's a white listing based
approach where you whitelist the scripts
and content that you know to be good in
the world and then things that aren't in
your whitelist
hopefully won't be running and things
that are in your whitelist will
hopefully not not hack you it's meant to
be a defense-in-depth technique so you
shouldn't rely on content security
policies your only line of defense you
should do everything you're doing today
to protect against cross-site scripting
you know input sanitization output
escaping all that kind of stuff this is
just another layer to help you secure
your website more so as for availability
1.0 Konda security 1.0 is available
today it's in most major browsers as I
said the support and Internet Explorer
is partial and we're hoping in Internet
eleven that they'll complete their
implementation there's a 1.1 version
which I'll talk about a little bit at
the end of the talk and that's under
active development right now
and so we're adding some features and
refining some things and if you have
feedback about content security policy
or things you'd like I think we could do
better or change that that's great to do
as part of the 1.1 effort to do the next
generation of this stuff so I wanted to
first start with an example of a policy
just to give you a feel for what this
kind of stuff looks like so the policy
is delivered in an HTTP header
so the browser requests your website you
send back the HTML then in a in a header
along with your HTML you supply the
policy so the reason the policy is
supplied in the header is because that's
hard for an attacker to forge it's sort
of a good trusted communication channel
to communicate the policy from the
server to the to the client and then you
can see that the policy here is a
sequence of directives so there's a
default source directive which is sort
of that's the default so here it says
self which means by defaults allow allow
me to load resources from my own origin
from my own website and then you for
different types of resources you can be
more specific or override the default
policy so here in this policy for images
I've said the the sources star which
means anything anything goes and I've
written this because images you know if
I load a malicious image into my page
it's not the end of the world like life
is not going to end it's part going to
be you know not ideal it could be like a
ugly picture that I don't like but it's
not going to steal my users data here
object this is like the object tag or
the embed tag that you use to load
plugins so here I've said that I can get
it from these two different media hosts
or from the CDN and then scripts I have
limited to just this trusted scripts com
domain and so no other scripts can load
in my page except if they come from from
this site does that kind of make sense
it like a high level yeah good yeah ah
yes you can actually specify a directory
and then it'll say only
from that directory you can also specify
a scheme or report or that kind of stuff
if you leave off the the scheme it sort
of picks a good one so if you're over
SSL or HTTPS it only allows HTTPS if
you're over HTTP it'll allow HTTP or
HTTPS but you can you can always qualify
it to be more specific if you want so
generally the different SRC directives
correspond to different HTML tags the
correspondence isn't perfectly like
one-to-one so like the object source
means like the object tag also counts
the embed tag because the embed tag in
the object tag are very similar so this
is really about like plugins plugins can
come from from these sources and like
image isn't just the image tag it also
includes like images that you load in
your CSS basically generally it's mostly
images but also other yeah that's a good
question so oh sorry the question is how
are all these rules process is it the
like most permissive one works is it the
last one that the browser sees so within
a given policy the default sets up the
default and then the more specific
directives override the default but you
can also if you were having fun you
could send many many policies so like
you can have six headers and have six
policies and then something is allowed
only if it's allowed by all the policies
so it's a way of tightening things down
the because this is a security feature
generally we err on the side of
defaulting towards security so if you're
setting multiple policies maybe your
server is making a mistake or something
and so we don't we don't want to maybe
one of the policies is coming from the
attacker or like something weird is
going on so we'd be concerned we're
conservative and we say well they all
have to be have to pass all the policies
does that answer your question
so these I mentioned you can control
different types of resources these are
all the different kinds of resources
that you can control I don't know why I
put a big picture of Yoda here oh I
think I was thinking about like use the
source but that doesn't really make a
lot of sense anyway I wanted to focus on
a script source for a moment because
that's that's the like key key directive
if you want to block cross-site
scripting
it's really about scripting the other
stuff is sort of allows you to fine-tune
if you're you're into into the details
so yeah the script source directive
controlling the source of script is
really the key to blocking cross-site
scripting if you think about it
cross-site scripting is really about
executing the attackers script there are
other sort of variations of in other
ways of thinking about it but in the end
what makes a cross-site scripting attack
and attack is that the attacker is
executing a script in your page and
causing your page to do things it
doesn't want to do you know potentially
leaking information or showing things to
the user that they shouldn't see or
things like that and so the script
source directive lets you whitelist
scripts so list out exactly where the
scripts can come from that are allowed
to execute and no other scripts are
allowed to execute and this so the idea
is you will say I want to get scripts
from my source maybe you like to use the
Ajax API so Google hosts for a jQuery or
something and maybe you have a CDN but
that's it so like for example you're
probably not going to put the attackers
website on your list I mean you could
yeah yes there's face delimited yeah the
directives are delimited by semicolons
but the individual values for a given
directive or just space delimited yeah
yeah picking the syntax was a little bit
hairy because you want it to like fit
well in an HTTP header as you and you
also want like fit well and like HTML
attributes so we're a little bit shy on
like punctuation yeah
yeah I mean it depends how worried you
are about the attacker injecting
different headers generally I don't
worry about that too much so it's not
super important
like what order you send your headers or
where in the header you put put these
things because generally generally I
would I would take the view that the
headers are going to get delivered find
most of your injection vulnerabilities
are going to be in your HTML or in the
body of your of your response well
generally HTTP headers get sent first
before like HTML tags so if you actually
load your scripts that comes in the body
of your response and so that comes after
these directives it is possible by the
way you don't have to supply it in a
header you can supply in a meta tag but
that's not as secure because you could
mess up before you put that meta tag
yeah I don't recommend using IP
addresses but you can I mean it's fine
you can also mix star and IP addresses
which will do weird things but you know
we support it why not yeah so like you
saw earlier that we can have like image
source star which said give me images or
anywhere well we let you say scripts or
star but you might not want to do that
that's probably that idea that says I'll
take scripts for anywhere it kind of
defeats the point yeah yeah so I would
say that our general philosophy on this
topic is something we call the priority
of constituencies so that means as a
browser vendor different people have
competing interests and the question is
how do we balance those competing
interests so like one person who has a
competing interest is the person who
develops deloused the browser so people
who make browsers and so we're pretty
low on the like the priority of
constituencies somebody like the author
so the person who makes the website or
the person who supplies the policies is
pretty high in that priority but even
above the author is the user the user is
actually using the browser so they have
the highest priority of constituency so
generally if a user wants to modify how
website works as a sort of philosophical
point of view because the user has a
higher priority of it as a constituent
we view that they should be allowed to
do that so this doesn't prevent users
from modifying scripts that websites
apply no sort of a long-winded answer to
your question yeah and related to that
so users also have extensions in their
browser so this we try really hard to
make it so that the websites policy
doesn't interfere with extensions we
don't always succeed and if you read
people who've given us feedback about
content security policy in the past
people written blog posts and such
you'll see that they were sad that they
deployed CSP on their website and then
people as extensions broke and so we
tried harder and now we're better at
having CSP not interfere with extensions
there was a question yeah
you can although our goal is that it
works automatically that the extension
author doesn't have to worry about it so
for example we automatically whitelist
resources loaded from extensions we
don't we allow those because we believe
that they're they reflect the users
intent these are good questions I'm very
excited about this questions ya know if
you have a header the meta tag is
ignored and if you have a meta tag the
first one is taken and then the rest
sort of signor so the the meta tag is
really for cases where you can't use the
header like in a file or something so
what happens when when say you try to
run a script that that isn't listed in
the policy
so the browser refuses it says I refuse
to load this script from evil calm
because it violates the you know
directive that said only load scripts
for myself and from like api's or
whatever there's also an event that gets
generated in the Dom so you can listen
for that event if you want to see and
then there's also a reporting mechanism
over that reports back to the server
that I'll explain later
why don't I put this here oh yes I
remember
so okay so this is a script that comes
from a URL right so it's like super
clear what the source of this script is
it's from my own website I decided to
use angular if I put self in my policy
it's clear that this script should
execute everyone's on board with that
what about this script where did this
script come from yeah so you said HTML
source you said no origin from what yeah
so these are all sort of good questions
so do you think that we should include
this in self do you think that's a good
idea
so what yeah yeah somebody can screw
with your HTML and inject script into
the HTML see
yeah exactly did everyone hear what he
said would you like me to repeat it I
repeated so what he said is is if you
recall earlier I said that we sent the
policy in the header because we had high
confidence that that data was really
coming from the server and reflected the
server's intent but once we're down here
in the like body of the document things
are a little bit more murky if there's
an attack going on and the attacker is
able to inject stuff into my page maybe
he's injected this so maybe this
reflects the attackers intent and not
the server's intent and so if we
whitelisted if if the server said self i
want to execute scripts that come from
me and then we get this we don't know
whether it really comes from the server
or maybe is coming from an attacker
who's injecting it that makes sense yes
good oh did someone have a question
ah yes so you can if you so there's a
separate
token oh I I tricked you because I put
it on the slide after you asked your
question yeah so there's a separate
token which says inline which means
allows scripts that are that are in line
but you might notice that we put the
word unsafe here in the front and that's
meant to be a hint to you as the
developer that maybe this is not the
most secure thing to do yeah so these
things that come in quote marks are key
words so as distinguished from things
that aren't coded which are like you
know host names so one of the things we
notice is that not a lot but a sizeable
fraction of extensions and cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities in them and
those are sort of pretty nasty
vulnerabilities because if you can
cross-site script into the extensions
context then you can do all the things
that the extension can do which is sort
of a lot so what we did is we actually
revved the extension system we went to
version 2 of the extension system and
then like we cleaned up a little like
odds and end but the main difference
between version 1 of Chrome extensions
in version 2 of Chrome extensions is
that in version 2 we actually enforce a
content security policy by default and
in particular we enforce one it's a
little bit long because it has a bunch
of details in it but it doesn't allow
cross-site scripting and then since
we've done that the incidence of
cross-site scripting in version 2
extensions it's like it's not zero
that's like still possible but like
close to zero yeah so generally I would
recommend that you I'm not like
performance experts so I you know police
take performance recommendations I'll
give you with a grain of salt but I
think it makes sense to combine your
scripts but you would have to do it as
it and out of line script not an inline
script
that's actually what most people do when
they do this stuff yeah haha you are you
guys are a great audience
so give me give me two slides okay
well give me two slides I'll get there
anyway so this is my sliding clay in
case nobody got the could this be from
the attacker you know so this is like
supposed to be like PHP where you're
just like echoing the users name into an
HTML context and I really enjoy this
xkcd comic about little bobby tables so
if you have a little bobby script tag or
something you could be in for a bad time
I think everybody should print out this
come back and like tape it to their
their monitor or something to remind
them of this yeah so what do you have so
what you have to do so really really
what's going on is you're separating
your code and your data so if you hang
out in security circles you'll find that
people repeat various phrases over and
over again like principle of least
privilege or separation of code and data
as like general like high-level security
principles and so really that's what's
going on here by moving your inline
script out of line you're separating
your code which is the script from your
data which is your Dom or your HTML okay
one more slice oh and you should do it a
sinker there's ways of loading scripts
as fast okay this is your question right
yeah yeah okay so what about these these
kinds of things so these are inline
event handlers so you can have a button
and you can say on click and you can
write some code here and this has the
same problem as a
inline script block in the sense that an
attacker could be writing this code
because it's part of the body of your
document so inline event handlers also
count as inline script and you you have
to remove them to use content security
policy
so generally frameworks help you do this
so for example this is how you might do
this in jQuery you would instead give
the button a class
you would select it and you'd bind a
click handler or listen for the click
event but yeah any kind of selector you
want yeah so the idea is that this this
is part of your script and this is your
data and they're separate and the
concerns have been separated post load
binding so jQuery is is does a nice job
with this I think other frameworks do as
well I just happened to my slides happen
to be jQuery base so what's cool about
jQuery is you can actually bind these
events before the elements exist so
that's what this live keyword means
instead of bind so you set up the query
and it says later on if someone happens
to create a button in the future that
happens to have this class and it
somebody happens to click on it please
call this motion and so generally you
can build an event map and then have the
Dom come and go and not have to worry
about actually finding the nodes and
poking at them other frameworks that are
more more modern than jQuery have like
even fancier ways of doing this I think
it's generally considered a good
practice these days to like not use
inline event handlers but to use some
more structured representation like a
class or an ID and a more structured
event map you might disagree that sort
of a matter of opinion but but yeah this
too is also in the sort of issue of
separating code and data generally if
people who've deployed CSP and work with
this stuff this hasn't been a big
sticking point for them this part has
been pretty easy removing all the inline
script has been more of a sticking point
and I'll talk a little bit about how
we're hoping to help that in in the
future so eval is also a way that you
can get cross-site scripted if you have
an untrusted string and you pass it to
eval now you could be running the
attackers code so set timeout also has
the same problem if you pass a string to
set timeout it gets eval essentially but
so instead of doing that you should just
pass a function and that doesn't get
eval that just gets called as
well function that's a very easy change
to make anyway so the eval thing is
optional it's disabled by default if you
are controlling scripts so if you have a
script directive but you can turn it
back on with unsafe eval I would say
that that unsafe inline is more unsafe
unsafe eval is not such a big deal if
you wanted to keep keep using eval in
your code but I'm keep in mind that it
is a vector where you could get
cross-site scripted yeah so here's my
four step program to mitigating
cross-site scripting move your scripts
out of line get rid of your inline event
handlers if you're feeling ambitious get
rid of eval if you're not feeling
ambitious you can skip that step and
then add a script source directive to
your content security policy easy right
we should all know maybe it's a little
bit work
so with you saw earlier there's a big
long list of directives if you were
feeling paranoid and you wanted to
control more than just script there are
lots of knobs you can turn to have more
control so there's a short section in my
talk where I tell you how to do that if
you're feeling ambitious so the default
source directive is the one that helps
you there so you're going to set default
source to none and now you have a very
secure website that would not have very
many features you probably wouldn't want
to use it but you can start with
something more sensible like by default
load things from myself and then refine
it over time as you find that your have
resources that are blocked so here's a
policy from a real real site this is a
garden Ematic website that I wrote a
little while ago so here I started with
with default source none because I was
feeling ambitious and figured I should
try this stuff out for myself and then
here are all the different like kinds of
resources and where they come from you
notice that I did use the unsafe inline
key word for style so I can I have a
style block that has stuff in it you
know maybe maybe that maybe that words
you maybe he doesn't depends on how
paranoid you are you have the ability to
control it to turn it on or off as you
choose yeah you can see that I use fonts
fancy fonts everyone should use fancy
fonts
so here's my cheat sheet that says what
each of the directives maps to so for
example media maps to both audio and
video because they're closely related
generally that's not worth controlling
them separately and that sort of funny
one is connect source so connect sources
like the grab bag of if you have a
JavaScript API that loads resources so
like XML HTTP request or WebSockets or
workers or whatever all that kind of
stuff those are all controlled by
connect source generally those are not
such a big deal but if you want to
control them the options there it's at
your at your choice okay someone asked
earlier what happens if there's oh did
you have a question Chrome extensions do
not allow you to have unsafe inline
scripts yeah
if they did then they would open they
would allow developers to open
themselves up so it's a yeah on the web
you have more choice if you want to be a
powerful extension in chrome we give you
a little bit less choice because we're
worried about you endangering users so I
mentioned that when your web site
violates a policy there's an event that
gets generated in the Dom that says you
this element try to load something that
violated your policy we also you can
also specify a report URI so there you
give a URL and then when there's a
violation the browser will send you this
JSON blob to that URL and tell you
something went wrong so it's like this
document that was referred to by
somebody trying to load this thing that
was blocked because it violated this
directive and then here's the whole
policy that wasn't being enforced and so
the idea is that you can use this to see
if you're causing trouble for your users
so you can get feedback about how well
your policy is working if there's some
corner of your site that like maybe you
don't have the policy quite right on or
maybe if you're being attacked maybe
that the reports will give you some sort
of early warning that there's an attack
going on and this speech feature is
actually very popular
this feature is so popular that there's
actually a report only mode which says
here's a policy please just tell me
reports about it I don't bother
blocking things yet and so that that's
you also have both you can have one
that's enforced and one that's being in
report only mode yeah yeah so it's good
for a honeypot it's also good for just
testing so suppose you were interested
in in CSP and you wanted to use it on
your website but you were afraid of
breaking your website then you could try
report only mode for a while and then
see how many reports you get and then if
that number gets low then you could turn
it on for real and you would sort of a
softer deployment path okay so this is
my summary of content security policy in
1.0 so its goal is to mitigate
cross-site scripting it does that by
white listing content especially script
to use it you have to do some work on
your site you can't just apply it as is
you have to really separate your code
and your data so that the browser can
tell where all the code is coming from
so that involves moving your inline
scripts out of line
removing the inline event handlers and
ideally removing eval but not not really
required and you have default source if
you really want to be secure by default
and go the like paranoid lockdown route
you can get violation reports which is
feedback from the field about how that
how well this is working and this is as
I said it's implemented in Chrome
Firefox in Safari there's a partial
implementation in Internet Explorer they
implement actually a directive that I
haven't even told you about yeah so I
think what you're referring to is some
people like the script tag but they
don't put script in it they put data in
it and so they'll specify a type like
type this is my data this is not script
and then the browser won't execute that
script it will just leave it there in
the Dom for something else to interact
with and that works fine so here because
the script is not executing it's not
going to run afoul of any policy it'll
just show up it'll be in line in order
they won't violate any policy it'll just
be fun so I have a couple more minutes
so I'd like to briefly talk about the
future of this stuff which is content
security policy 1.1 so the biggest piece
of feedback that we've gotten on 1.0 is
that people wish they could use inline
scripts and this requirement of like
getting all of your scripts out of line
is like really you know it's work like
it's doable like definitely people have
done it but it's work and so as an
example here's the Google Analytics
tippet they tell you to create this like
gaq object so that you can like call
functions before it's loaded it's like
some fancy thing but the point is if you
really want to do this the way it's
meant to be done you need to this inline
script so how can we solve this problem
so the approach that we are
experimenting with currently in one
point well one is to use a nonce so if
you're familiar with the idea of a nonce
it's just a random number that you made
up one day and you every day you wake up
or every time your website is fetched
you make up a new random number and the
idea is that it's known to you but
unpredictable to an attacker does that
make sense so you can include in your
policy that one of the places you can
get scripts from is from people who know
the knots and this is just some like
random number I don't know how many how
many how long it has to be that's like
up to you you get to decide like how
paranoid you are how how afraid you are
somebody guessing this random number you
made up probably if it's this long no
one's going to guess it and then what do
you yeah well make it longer
mm-hm yeah so what do you do with this
nonce well what you do is you take your
inline script and you say I know the
nonce here it is and this thing matches
this thing and then because the nonce is
here the browser can reason oh this must
not be the attacker supplying this data
because the attacker doesn't know the
nonce so given that the nonce has been
and associated with this script it's
okay to execute because that's what it
does that make sense yeah so this is
this feature of 1.1 is like very popular
people are very excited about this so
they're also new directives in 1.1 that
do various interesting things so like
before you can only control plugins by
URL and now you could you can control
plugins by type so you can say I want to
have PDF where I want to have flash but
I don't want Java or Skype or whatever
it is you like or don't like yeah yeah
so that's a good question so all of
sorry the question is I'm not sure I
100% understood the question but I think
the question was what is the scope of a
policy so when a site declares a policy
what does it affect does it affect an
individual page does it affect the whole
site was that your question
ah yes okay I understand the question so
let me first answer the simple version
that will answer the advanced version of
the question so the simple version is
the policy applies to a single document
so when you supply a policy with a HTTP
response it applies to the content in
that response and the advanced question
is maybe that's too coarse-grained maybe
I wish that different parts of my page
had a different policy so that's a
request that people have made and we
haven't figured out a good way of doing
that yet so if you have ideas for how
you think we should do that I would
encourage you to come to the w3c working
group and and present your ideas and try
to get people on board okay yeah so CSP
1.1 is under active development if
you're interested in this stuff and you
want to share your experiences with 1.1
and tell us what we did well or poorly
and what we should change in 1.1 this is
the mailing list of the w3c so it's the
web application security working group
we have a bunch of browser vendors there
we have much of website operators there
we would love to hear more feedback if
you want to play with a CSP 1.1 in
Chrome you can turn it on in in the
flags so you turn on experimental blank
features yeah but if you want to use 1.1
that's stable and like ready for use in
production thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
