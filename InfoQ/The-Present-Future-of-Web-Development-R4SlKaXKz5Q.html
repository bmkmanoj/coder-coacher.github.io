good so my name is Boone lemarchal's i'm
the CEO of montage video and going we
are going to talk about what we did
today in term of web development and
what we should be looking at doing in
the future but before we talk about the
future and the present how about we go
back memory lane so I had this exact
same slide I think last year slightly
different so do you guys know what that
is any any gas now it's too old that's
right it's not any next application it's
its world wide web app which was the
first application that teams Bernoulli
roads at CERN on the next cube where he
was able to crystallize the idea of what
the web could be 0 was was going to be
and timber says something that I could
do in a couple of months what we tell me
over like a year on others and if i
count correctly that's about sista six
times faster right so what what's
important here is that it turned out
that Tim had access to that specific
machine which was the first complete
ways to provide a complete
object-oriented approach to not only
development but also authoring with
interface builder and that made him
capable of expressing his ideas a lot a
lot faster it would have been able to do
the same thing on on windows or on on
unix most likely it will just have to
kim like six more six times longer you
may have given up you may have got
distracted all sidetracked so anyway so
that's what the power of platform is it
lets you do something faster that you
could redo otherwise but but do it
faster so if you look at what platform
we've been we've been living with the
first really two big one that we know in
the PC era where the Mac the Mac one
which today is inherited from from next
so you have you know of this platform
that we're going to go through you're
going to see 22 patterns there's a layer
of frameworks and then there's a layer
on top which is more in terms of
authoring what we call idea or this kind
of thing there are visual tools they are
software for us for developers so we can
work faster Microsoft's another big big
platform same thing you got dotnet and
you got this yo Co another one that was
very successful it's kind of like gone
now for practical purpose is adobe flash
you had the flash runtime extra
actionscript-3 and all that stuff and
then you had the flash professional
flight which used to be called flash
builder and that layer especially flash
is as far as I know the only platform
that was able when it was actually in
the work in action to bring designers
and developers together you could have
interactive designers working on the
same medium that the application will be
in and and that is unfortunately gone
and it's it's a big big mess we need we
need to get that back so why does it
matter these platforms lets you create
software and on the web on the way up
sorry on the web platform we are
focusing on the front end here us in
that room eyes I suppose so I'm sure
some of you do back in but here if we
focus on what we do inside inside the
browser these are meant to be used by
people I not buy services by other
classes by people so we we knew for a
long time but it's been restated very
clearly by by apple iphone success that
the way you interact with an app is
critical if your app is not easy to use
intuitive just by pure attention
disorder people will just move on and
try another one right so you guys we
have to pay attention to that and to do
the cheese that you need two things
like I said you need designer and
developer working very well with each
other to make sure that you get the best
option but you also need to be
performance if your UI slow if it's not
responsive he welcomed see but probably
executed is not it's not gonna work
either so let's focus on on the only on
a developer's any relationship it turned
out that i think the web platform is the
best to solve that prime why because we
naturally have CSS and it and that's for
more representation that's used by
designer we have javascript which is a
programming languages used to code the
logic of an application and there's the
magic college female in the in the
middle they actually bring them together
HTML combined with CSS is a presentation
HTML combined with javascript is for the
development but the problem is today
many solution that exists are favoring
one or favoring the other versus looking
at prime as a whole like you don't make
software with designers on one side and
and developer on yes I should do that it
doesn't work it costs a lot of money
from not much good results so so that's
that's the very interesting part getting
them together the other aspects is
performance so the web has not been
growing to what it is today which is
probably the biggest software platform
in the world by is excellence in user
experience unfortunately he has grown by
excellence in linking right you click on
something you load the page somewhere
else you're there instantly you don't
need to download anything there's
there's no friction you just navigate
around you can do that forever right
from until you die really and that what
has brought the web the web ecosystem to
worry is now there was an article
recently on the blog post from someone
from andreessen orbits that was claiming
and unfortunately what the numbers are
true which is the mobile web is
declining like more and more people
spend more and more time on native apps
versus mobile web whatever that mobile
web is whether it
it take the form of a what you think is
an application or whether it's site
optimized for mobile doesn't matter
people are spending more time in apps
why because it worked there for them I
suppose right people don't care what you
how make your app that's not that
product they just want to use it to
solve what the prime that right so how
can we how can we solve that so if you
look at client application Android or
iOS or same thing would be for cocoa or
desktop for the matter you have the
answer code of the application that runs
on a client all the SS starts from there
and then eventually if your application
has cloud components then the code has
all the logic then turned back to the
server and then and then took 2,000 get
data back one focus on is the same thing
is rich client applications where your
application instead of being built with
java and xml files or objective-c and
analyzed object is build with HTML
transient CSS other than that so this
asset will be served as on-demand all
wrapped into in the TPL if you want to
do it i braid that works fine and then
the whole logic is be coded with these
static assets and then same thing they
turned back and it goes to the back end
to get data after that point you're back
in the same kind of architecture of
other applications the problem is that
we don't have as much tool to help us do
that on the web so what can we do well
there have been a platform that's been
around for a very long time right 35
years in the making to go from next step
through web objects which was a the
first object oriented application server
in the world to Mac OS 10 and now to iOS
35 years of injuring on the same
codebase refined can you imagine that 35
years there's not a single stack out
there that has lived so long not even on
Microsoft sign they've done many
traditional visual basic that the ditch
windows with the early windows version
several times now dot net has been
stable for a while but it's not 35 years
select n right by the length doesn't
matter what matters is that through the
35 years millions of desktop web and
mobile applications we are built by
millions of developers right so which
tell me something if these guys were
able to ship that many iteration of
applications what they've been using and
I was one of them so I know from the
inside was really helpful otherwise that
would have fail and they would have to
use something else right so the question
is why why should we reinvent the wheel
we should just go and steal it so how
about we take all of that and take the
concepts that are coming from there and
look if they can be useful so well
objects had extremely well-designed of
components which was very well
obstructed very well design program many
times they have someplace in these
components Coco has something like the
drew loop which is something very
important to address to be able to paint
only as needed as frequently as you can
and that degrade gracefully when your
CPU or GPU is not as as quick as quick
as you would want but you still
repainting the last action from the user
that is a design that is critical it's
been and guess what it's been invented
on next step when it was on motor 6040
which were not the speed demons right so
so they had that Prime before on desktop
before we headed on mobile so all of
that on top of a Chanel 5 is is
something that what we decided to do is
take that and that we could we call that
montage yes but that that was the spirit
behind like still the good ideas make
sure they are we translate them we apply
good editorial appreciation to make that
non Coco like but more like web like but
take the key pattern that we need to
grow and do that so that's one piece of
the puzzle that's just it that's just a
layer now once you do that you have to
go and build the rest of a platform
which is growing up the stack and
offering what I would call a universal
is decay
consumer 5 universal just run is it away
we don't have it to do anything for it
and build another set of layer that
helps you work not just by hand coding
everything there's nothing wrong with
and cooling but there are they actually
are fast a way to work and then I'm
going to show you some so try to grow
the platform from the bottom up to have
something that is on par at some point
in the future with what the native
environments has to offer so now I'm
going to switch to to showing you demo
of what what that can be so this is
montage video so montage video is that
layer on top of montages trying to
provide a Inupiat environment that lets
you do things in a way that are more
efficient in southern ways it's not
about removing the coding necessary it's
just replacing some of the cooling with
you that's not very interesting or
productive and just doing doing it
slightly differently so montaggio sits
on top of get up so the I'm already
authenticated there I'm as myself so
what you see here are some of the
products that I have in my get in my
github account so we're going to take a
look at one demo that we show at jay's
conf and it's a it's a demo that uses
the rest api of WordPress which will be
standard in a call what WordPress later
this year and we just wanted to show
what what we could do with that so here
you see the other to me of montage do so
on the left side you have all the assets
of the project so one thing you should
realize here if you're in that ecosystem
is the node modules so montage is use
this command GS so we have here package
the audition that's what you would
expect except that we built a UI for it
so this is this is the only you I in the
world to make it to manage c'mon Jess
packages actually we did it for the
front end but you have here the the
basics the names version here the
dependencies and here this dirty wire to
NPM so if you want to assuming for
facebook for example it could search
that
see what so there's 20 packages you
could just do that and just add the
dependency if you want to i'm not going
to do that but you get you get the idea
so every motorized application starts by
a main component which by the way the
index is as simple as you can get you
got all the CSS you want this is old
boiler plate for the icons so you can
host that on on your home device on your
home screen if you want to and and the
the only object that we start with is
the loader you can customize your own
loader but this is a real web page so if
you have a first level of animation you
want brand your page this is just a web
page just go in and do that so the by
convention and again you can write that
is the main component we load this this
so you know what since the screen is
actually small I'm going to bring a
little helper here it's not huge but
that should that should do it ok so what
one thing we we offer is live preview so
this is the app itself that we could it
so it's we get all the i'll show you how
it works we'll get all the assets from
from the wordpress and we just render it
with a nice a nice car boot sale ok so
i'm going to use that URL and put it
inside the ipad so a.r.k are n dot
projects dots motor studio.net
okay so when I do that I'm being asked a
codes so for security don't want anybody
to snoop in so I'm going to punch in the
code it's a que si and KD CF right okay
you can you can join too if you want by
the way if you have a device and you
want to follow that'd be my guess so
that URL and once you get there anyone
want to try it's up to you i just need
to know so i switch i switch to the
other one or not so here's the here's
the app there is the app running on the
device okay right so let's go back to to
look at what we have here so the real
every component in montage leaves in a
folder which has a dull real extension
so it's a convention and if you put that
folder you're going to see it's all a
mini site so the templates of components
in montage are full html5 documents with
duct tape and all which means you can
give it to a web designer they have no
idea about montage and these are going
to write a page like you would write
otherwise with his own link CSS which is
that the CSS here that's the CSS of the
main component it's a CSS page and it's
linked through link as here as you would
expect right so that's all created by
default for you when you create a
complete a component and the reason why
it was designed that way was she
facilitates how web designers and web
developers work with each other there is
no templating language in montage yes
because we don't like that and it's
inefficient you have to learn it
and then you got logic that bleed into
your into your code is now standard you
can't you can view that by itself
without having the templating logic
running is there no we don't need that
so so in montage the way the templating
work is by associating a component which
is a montage objects to wait Dom element
once you've made that association that
component is taking over that piece of
the Dom as his own and if he has his own
template he's going to bring that from
his own home plate bringing it in and
replace the tag you gave him we assigned
to him with waiver he needs if you need
something you can just write code into
the durometer than just money insert
stuff there with no template you can you
can do that you so the whole point of
what else to do is so you have you don't
have to go down if you don't want to so
I'm going to close that and go back to
here so here you have a more highly
review of what's going on so the owner
how many of you are familiar with Coco
ok so the same concept exists in cocoa
in in in the neighbor where the owner is
a placeholder for the object that's
going to load that template so it's
going to be a component here so the
company is going to load that thing and
each component of that kind is going to
load that thing and each time a new
instance is going to be the owner the
placeholder right so the place order is
your component and here underneath that
indented to show that the relationship
you have all the objects that were
created for that to implement that main
component so you have a wordpress
connector which is a jacket object it's
more like a model layer that's clearly
talking rest to json to a tube WordPress
that's what the gas do the post
controller is a wrench controller so
it's going to get an array of JSON
objects it's going to manage that for
you dealing with the UI so he's going to
take solution it's going to take you can
you can change the range you want to
display stuff like that again similar to
what you find other places the header is
is is this the top with the WordPress
logo the title and thus about the bond
top then you got the post so the post is
what you get when you click on one so
that's the post that's the post
components right there we're going to in
detail and you get the flow so the flow
is a bit of a magical magical components
the flow is the one that does the kind
of 3d carousel effect and the flow is is
well one thing we believe a lot in is
composition so the flow lets you from
the outside tell what you want to flow
what kind of components so here we are
flowing the card right you can flow your
own thing if you want you so the card is
just that components here which is
basically which is basically showing
it's one of these right that that's a
card that's the crowd component and the
card components as is on real of course
what you have the text and you have the
image as you would expect this don't
image and text and so that's what there
is and if you look at how they're down
inside you want to go down to HTML you
got the CSS here and and the code is
simple you gotta give the data montage
ID is how we hook up the civilization of
objects to the DOM and then the rest is
just the card at the front of the car
the back of the card I mean it's where
organized and one of the benefits of
structuring an app like that is you can
have multiple people working all these
components at the same time they should
be designed so you can you can reuse
them in other places so they are all
self-contained right the gate data in
through the owner you pass data to that
and then the owner basically delegates
if you want to these data to sub
components
to do the rendering until you reach the
point where you need a complex widget
and then you can you're going to use a
component to implement a complex widget
as well like the flow for example easy
easy components down so let's go back to
let's go back to the main and I would
like to show you a little bit more of
what you can do with the flow so the
flow is a component that has so by the
way here let me finish the tour here you
have the tree of the body and it shows
you the blue show you that components
are assigned as which component are
assigned to it on the right side you
have the inspector so these are dynamic
properties that we have a system of
metadata so for example I can go on the
owner I can add a priority and say I
know it's going to be full and who would
be so here just created me an inspector
entry for full on the fly and if i tell
you that foo is a boolean is going to
turn into a checkbox so the more if all
you make to create semantic around your
objects the more we can help you to do
stuff like autocomplete when you do data
bindings and stuff so for example when
you when you do look at for example the
bindings that gets the contents inside
the controller that binding bind the
content property of the the range
controller to the source of the day I
which is the WordPress connector that
posts that's the array that you get so
if you if you provide metadata we know
how to type the path we know we can help
you navigate that more effectively so on
the right side here you have basically
the contents of the packages that you've
decided to use in your package manager
so here we have the app you let start
the app which means you see here all the
one that you see here so you can you can
reinstate that component you created in
other places in your app just once you
create it just become available
immediately to be reused down there you
see montage which is the base the base
from work and then there's digits
which is a said we just set design for
touch and then there another package
which is to get the word press on
specific information you also have
assets here oh there's not done here so
let's go back to the to the flow so the
flow is a complex subject where you can
have you can have elastic scoring so
let's take strongly let me show you so
if i remove that and you just crawl
right its linear if you add elastic
scoring however you're going to see the
count spread spreads together and then
they get closer together based on on the
speed of which you scroll but let's go
to the inspector of the flow so the flow
is a journey component where you can
offer the path of the objects that your
bond is it's like a list except that the
list is really a 3d busy curve so
instead of being linear vertical or
horizontal you can you can do pretty
much as much as I thing you want so to
to show you what what that mean I'm
going to try to do something acrobatic
which is I can change the curve here and
you can see in real time on your on your
device what what does it mean okay I can
change that here the other side make the
most AG turn around and you can you can
go on each not for example and you can
assign properties so let's say on this
one on the end we would like them to be
we want them to rotate as they go for
example so you could do a rotate y as
they move toward the end all right so
now when you scroll they rotate to the
left can accentuate that
oops sorry
and what's what's great is you can you
can do that on an iPad you can do that
on another device portrait you can do
that another one android and you can
share that with your team or your
customer wherever they are with these
all through the cloud and that's not
something that specific to the flow like
any components you add to your your
project or you remove or you tweak
you're going to benefit for the same
thing so you can especially when you
stop being able to reuse component that
way you can you're likely some of them
will be reused in several places in your
app they may be they may have different
sizes they may be visiting different
kind of data so you can put three
version of your app in different states
where the you exemplify this this
different places where the component is
used and get data right from you from
your cloud and then you can start making
changes you're going to see immediately
as you make changes high impacts the
three places where that component is
used so instead of like doing iterative
QA one or the other you can see it by
the way as you do it you have the right
information to make it into a decision
like oh no ok i just did a bit ly screw
up the android one ok i need to
something else you know you know you
know immediately so that's an example of
of what you can do with the flow let me
any question no
it doesn't feel too magic there's no
magic I mean let's talk about how it
happens the reason why we were so
network wise is all websocket right
there's no other way to do that on on
the website but what the reason why
we're able to do that is because the
design choices that we've made the way
these these reels are structured we have
a civilization of objects we know where
these are we know the entire trip ever
app because you told us it's like right
in their face it's not imperative code
that we can't read like when knob
there's no definition going on right we
if that was written by pure codes and
cutting everything you couldn't do
anything with it because you don't have
the information now we have a tree we
have a tree of component and each
component we have a tree we know which
objects are being instantiated of what
type they are what party they have so
when you change the parties here we know
where to poke them in each of the client
are connected to it and apply the very
same changes to the the distance sibling
all in the same place in the app same
for adding right when you're adding it
objects to to the real we know which
field you're adding into we are going to
add an object of the same type in in the
clients on the fly same when same when
you remove so it's really reaping the
benefits of and we did that for a reason
so we could just we could do stuff like
that but but the that there's no magic
in once you understand how it works it's
like da okay yeah sure but it's still
very very practical so let me yes
you mean you would yeah so so that's
based on the the database content of the
WordPress instance we're talking to so
in that case I'll mean he magically
stood to demo one right so if you had if
you had a large collection of data then
it's all a matter of managing the cursor
as you move the array and so this
Neutron segue to highlight that the fact
that the the flow component has frustum
culling so that means we like you could
have five thousand images we would only
display one two one two three four five
six like I said 10 of them I and not the
rest the the flow knows mathematically
speaking we analyze the busy curve we
know what's clipped and what isn't and
we only render what's visible so it's
like an infinite list it's what you want
with an engine plates right you only
render what you see and plus some buffer
around eventually and as you as you
scroll what we do internally is the
objects in the array are rebounded to
the one that are visible so the Dom
never changes like we don't destroy and
recreate the dumb that would not work at
all like you couldn't you couldn't get
that kind of frame rate if we're doing
that we're using the exact same dumb
structure we're just reacting new data
from the different object you're
scrolling through to them right so so
there's we haven't we haven't finished
the part where you can easily like from
the data are getting standpoint get data
stop use get the desktop use that is
you're on your own you want to do but
once you reach the UI layer is taken
care of that make sense so one thing
that we've also been looking at and I'm
going to sew clothes clothes that
projects get back to the other one we're
going to do some 3d
we've been looking at 3d as very excited
to see that with WebGL and we've been
investing on that for the past four past
three years now and we want to bring 3d
to the mainstream and not in a way
that's only what WebGL developer can can
do it we want to help package 3d in a
way that I don't know web dl I can't go
to WebGL I never run by you telling me
an object that's well packaged I pretty
will be able to do something with each
attorney which if you only have I don't
need to know the inside that's the whole
point we're trying to build a system
where you can reuse someone else's work
but you don't have to know the inside
because that's their prime that's not
yours you should just be enjoying it and
just using it right so we are also very
happy to see two or demos which on the
website the apartment demo on the
of your other featured by Apple at the
last WWDC in the WebGL session where
they've announced they were they were
spotting it so let me show you what
we're going to do so here it's a blank
blank apps there's men real that's what
if you create something from scratch
that's what you would see so what we're
going to do is launch the preview I'm
going to kill a guy and the preview is
empty because the epicenter so we have a
model here that's a model of a space
fighter so in order to make a model to
display i'm going to have we have a 3d
package here at the bottom so i'm going
to take a scene view first so the sims
you bring this is dave and the canvas
too bro and i'm going to add a scene so
the scene has a password you can set a
model so if we go to the asset library i
have a model here which is a colada
model so Dae file which we are
converting on the fly to GL Tia so GL GF
is a is a is going to be a standard this
year a ratified standard by Kronos that
we've initiated two years ago when i was
at motorola and and three years ago
actually now
so what GL TF does colada is if you know
families is the it's a standard file
format that takes the output of 3d
authoring tool like Maya 3ds max and
make it into a consistent XML so you can
reload it into another editor so maybe
there are better things than others so
it's to how you can exchange stuff so
it's all XML kissed was done like 15
years ago so what what is that as JSON
to be more efficient to process on
client side but also add features so you
can compress to get to your mobile
devices faster and also realign the data
so that it's friendly with WebGL which
the color standard is not so that's the
GL TF so it's basically 3d model as as
JSON to simplify so so now I need to add
so the sins you take the scenes I'm
going to grab the scene icon and the
sign it's here and we're going to give
it some some size so let's say screen
small so let's say 10 Reds by let's 800
okay so now here if we we should be
something sent here let me hear you so
here we have the desis 3d model I just I
just dumped okay so you come these on
materialize own lighting so how about we
I bet I would look better if he wasn't
in the dark if it is a space fighter so
we can go to the main real and change
the CSS and we are just going to do
background color black sorry i don't
have the stars but it's kind of dark
anyway so how about we do a stealth
space fighter so if we if we explore the
model a little bit more the scene has
like the flow a special special editor
which bring
us here where it's illegally you are
where you see the boundary the bounding
box right and if you look inside you can
see the nodes the 3d know the material
the light the camera which there's
nothing here but there are two materials
so why can you hear is take that
material and make it an object and once
I've done that now I have a material
object here so that material has two
properties image and an opacity so what
I would like to do is control the
opacity of that material so I'm going to
go back to my library now I'm going to
take a slider and I'm going to add the
slider at the bottom so everything works
as expected of course doesn't wear the
deaths let it go I did not want that to
be e
okay I mean you need that again recreate
it all right so slider okay so now we're
kind of clips let me add some some
padding sorry yes absolutely you should
de did you try to connect to it yeah
crap I think I just I just I just closed
the where is a pretty good
where you go
no and I've won already yeah sorry I
ditched it and then show how to get it
back I can we can try there so I'm gonna
add some padding by linked up it'll help
yeah there you go ok so now we have a
slider that doesn't do anything so what
we want to do is get the value out of
the slider and bind it to the opacity
priority of the material so we're going
to create a binding on the material so
as we type we know the metadata so
opacity is going to bounce to the slider
dot value no not any bones dot value
here we go so one way because we don't
we don't we don't care otherwise are
actually the slider max is 100 which is
not good for the opacity in CSS so what
we're going to do is we're going to redo
that and we're going to divide by 100 ok
which let me show you something is
montage bindings have a full language
logical language in them so you can
write expressions you can test you can
do MapReduce you can do logical
operations in there I won't recommend
that you call the entire app like that
you pray could cut a lot but it's really
meant to help keep ready you I rigid
code inside hair versus the in your
JavaScript components code which is here
so the main GS like anything you want
your owner to handle like tracking
events of the objects inside applying
logic game data are things someone else
that would be inside the main to jazz
but for for you I logic rated that that
does you know so now
if the binding work here we go we have
that guy disappearing except that guy
huh that's so much for stealth if your
cockpit is still visible so it turned
out that there are two there are two
materials in in in the model so if we go
back to the model 2 scene there's a
second you see their signal network
there you go there's certain material
here so we're going to take that one
essentially here promoted as an object
to use then we have that guy and we can
we can take that binding and duplicate
it as well this is the same object so it
might as well safe code so now if you go
here normally if we make the guy in the
front then the cockpit trees if you as
well there you go and again I we could
go and look at the WebGL as being
guaranteed or inside that space fighter
if I I'll help I invite you to do that
here I don't would you don't need to you
don't need to know that to make that to
make that useful so that was the whole
the whole point and this is obviously
not Richie to that model I mean we've
done the apartment demo I invite you to
look at we're working on a on the
medical application with a heart to as a
sales tool for example we've done the
car I mean there's many applications
where 3d is coming to the mainstream
that have nothing that are not 3d
high-end for shooter games and they are
very very useful I mean there's a lot of
potential in retail for example like
comparing shoes configuring shirts of
course there's all the 3d printing
movement does that that's also that's
also coming anyway so this is our
opinion of what a a platform with
authoring could be and is
for the web in a way that that brings
concept from existing environment that
prone to be very successful as much as
seeking to standards and trying to make
the most of what people learn and make
the most of what they really know we're
having to ask him to learn too much
another example of that is the event
system in montage yes the event system
is completely modeled on the dumb one so
we've implemented dispatch events add
event listener and remove event listener
which are the three basic and handle
events on montage objects so if your
montage objects and you want to dispatch
an event like for example the slider I
think sense and action events like a
button does you can track that the
adaptive event by doing my button i
dinna listener action this capture and
bubble and we implement in capture and
do all the same way the components
represent a tree which is kind of a
subset of of the Dom tree and you may
want your component and you decide right
when when you create your even whether
that even is going to bubble or not and
if you want that to go then you want
that to go up the chain of your
components the exact the exact same way
same simply I'm so we try to really
surgically add stuff where it made sense
you won't find any API in montage and
that's by design that avoid you to
notice yet you know CSS now we will help
developer with more advanced you I 20
for that but it's not through the API is
through a human interaction if you don't
know CSS you're not going to be happy
with no touch for sure so go find the
body that does know CSS or go do
something else or more bluntly gold
color is because it's worth it so let's
go back to the slides
and you're that we go so yep yep and it
took an exceedingly long time with the
spinning w I mean is there any way you
can tweak like progressive loading lazy
learning yes yes so montage is
completely modular right so there's a
desi a bootstrapping core like you would
get in any form arc after that you're
only going to get what you what you
basically put in your wheels so you only
load what you actually use right so
there's two a 12-8 to answer that first
you shouldn't take that long because my
didn't I don't wise was yours yet but
the consequence of being extremely
modular is you have a huge run afoul
right every model every component come
with HTML CSS JavaScript right so that's
a lot of moving parts so when you deploy
we have a process and it's like right
away inside the tools called mop and
which sent from montage optimizer that's
great that's going to do that's doing a
static analysis again we know the tree
right so we can wall the tree and we can
recombine all the HTML and Java skills
is unlit alas one file for your entire
app or you can do you can shot it
through six files if you want to make
use use of parallel request so the next
step which we haven't done yet is more
complicated this would be a CSS and as
much as it sounds logical that if you
were embedded 64 bits encoded images
inside CSS to reduce another request
work bearer sometimes it doesn't so it's
an exactly it's unfortunate but so so we
can do we can go and more that to
minimize the number of resources call
you could we could also embed the CSS
itself inside the HTML but we have to
reanalyze all the URL because they are
related to the CSS file and if you put
into a style embedded then things change
it so it's not impossible with what we
haven't done that so so that's the first
step is that you should never deploy
your motor job without moping it that
that's the UH be counterproductive which
is the case of what you're looking at
right the second aspect is which is much
more manual now but you can we have a
few components like one of them is a
substitution where you can like a
substation is like a like a tab view
logically speaking but without the UI
you so you can it's a component you can
tell okay it's when the stolen critter
is mad you're going to put that
component in it whenever one is matched
you can put dalchini so the these are
component helps you delay the the
decision of of what of what you use and
you can always for gotta create the
components at when only you know because
we have no idea and then you just insert
it when that happens and at that point
everything is loaded asynchronously
anyway so you have callback method to
know and the draw system is aware that
you may have assets that under there so
basically the components are not ready
to draw so nothing happens if you're
asking to draw a well just wait to get
his asset and then when they're here
then then think about kitchen so so it's
a I'm sure they're they're bugs in the
effort but it was it was designed to let
to let you do that yeah yes we have in
our team the author of Q so we've been
using promises since 2011 and and and i
can i can attest that we went from zero
to promises everywhere just organically
seeing the team embrace that pattern
yeah and he just it just came naturally
it wasn't I mean I when we are when I
hired Chris cabal was the author of Qi
he told me about his process was like
wait what I was like oh brain hurts and
then and then over time we got we got
used to it and and it turned out to be
very very effective at nights coming the
standard so it we've seen many things
like that like we we had bindings very
early the kind of becoming is not
rebinding will observe in coming in
standard we had rescue very early the
becoming a standard we had components
before anyone else not under the whole
community understanding we should be
going the direction though I'm I'm not
happy about the current spec but that
doesn't matter to another session I
suppose so so yeah we use promises yeah
it's everywhere yeah so I encourage you
to try we we put it out so let me talk
about the business model not not you may
care but we so weird company so we need
to make money like any other company is
nothing wrong with that I intend to make
a lot of money but we really want to
help people go beyond what they do today
so the whole platform because we know we
are on github we know exactly this week
either API whether your product is
public or is private so if it is public
you can use montaggio forever for free
there's no there's no cost whatsoever
and of course we hope that once we you
guys and really realize what you can do
you're going to want to use it for real
work and if that's the case then you're
going to need a subscription to access
private repo after a couple that we will
just let you do that but after a couple
then you'll need a subscription to to go
to go and use that so don't hesitate
just go use it no as the thoughts that
I'm see I'm the CEO so i can tell you
straight that i'm not going to revert
the decision I think unless I don't a
change someone make my channel my mind
for whatever reason but I just makes
sense right we're trying to build a
platform based on open source and that's
just the continuation of it is we want
people to use authoring visually without
second-guessing and his day
because it's just it just works more
efficiently for what it does well he
wants change the fact that you may want
to go back to your text editor and do a
bunch of stuff textually off get up and
then commit back and then go back in the
tool when you make sense and hopefully
over time we'll have more and more value
to the tools you will find yourself
spending more and more time there but
but we don't we have no intention of
doing anything that will lock you in
we're based on standards and you if
there are Bell tools for certain aspects
of the job or other people that don't
want you to know that you want to be in
then this should be in right and that's
all right that's that's where that's
where we are so the future of web
development what I care about about that
platform is that we deliver superior
cross screen user experience and to me
that to me that's the web killer app we
have to deliver the same kind of user
experience that people expect because if
we don't do that is going to get
marginalized and ostracize and its
market share gonna shrink and its impact
on the ecosystem is gonna is gonna
shrink and and I don't want that so
that's why that's why we're doing it I
think that's what we all need to think
about that otherwise web apps are going
to be restrained to admin kind of stuff
that we're hiding side firewalls and I
know I think we can do better the second
one is that for that you need to rely on
strong platform the standard themselves
are not enough they are stuff that they
need to do like hardware acceleration
then no way in just you could ever match
the hydroxylation work that has been
done in the browser it's just impossible
it's not going to happen but the the way
that the receipt said the way people
contribute to it and if you look at the
vested interest of the people are
contributing to it like try to make any
current of dotnet at the level of
standard trying to get people from
Microsoft Google and Apple together and
good luck with that I don't think well I
may see that in my in my lifetime I hope
to be wrong but the thing is a lot of
building blocks are here so we
or someone else can build a an opinion
in stack on top of what we have to go to
go faster and and waiver coming standard
will bring back like when when when
promises our index maxi of six enigmatic
UPS is everywhere what gets guys will
remove Hugh from motives and then what
will hit will solve that cost for you
same for the web component you can if
web components where everywhere which
are not there's no reason why you can
use the web components inside the
montage components that will work we'll
make it work another very important
thing is bringing web designers
developers together and that's taking a
higher view of okay tools for web
designers are great tools for what they
were pros are great but if they are
incompatible in terms of output with
each other when there's no point right
if you use if your web designer
interactive designer are using baza make
they spend six months doing a mock up in
the end you have a map as I meet movie
right then you have to go from scratch
and do implement that in wiper stack you
choose actually but it will be iOS and
rid of whatever it's just stupid right
on the web we can do better our goal is
much to do at some point is to have a
bath and making fermentation inside
montage video so that the interactive
designer interact directly mock up there
you why with real components they may
take shortcut and do he just think that
the developer will have his hair off not
me but then that's fine you can we can
undo that make it better it does have to
start from scratch every 10 by the way
the right way these guys were together
it iteratively at each iteration you pay
the price of there are tools not working
with the output you want which will give
me the final thing the product is gonna
begin it's just stupid we need we need
to fix that and and that means growing
from just coding everything by hand to
interactive all sighing like on the
native side people where hand coding in
terminals until the Mac came up and and
after that as well but they've stopped
doing that all the time why because it
turned out is more efficient as always
not a matter of opinion the facts that
the decay
decades of facts are there to prove it
the same is going to happen to us it's
just like the writing on the wall we
just have to look back and look around
and that's what's there the same is
going to hit us the web stack has grown
from learning from what was done before
as it should because there is some good
doesn't have to be straight taken
straight away again but yeah he has to
be he has to be looked at and real-time
preview so that's what I show you and
that's time by not using wheels like
when I I see people using a tool chain
that ask them to do it bill before they
can test what they are doing I'm like
what are you doing to just goodnight
even use a compiler that's what you need
that that's wrong right our commands
implementation doesn't require a bill
because because why like you have
something that you just reload which is
supposed to work that's how the platform
is built why would you hurt yourself by
injecting a roadblock in your own time
right it doesn't make any sense if you
can avoid it and so far especially with
I can tell you with a cloud setter that
we've set with we've said even running
mob for example which is a tool right
you have to run the comment line now you
don't have to remember the configuration
just click a button like mop prepare for
publish boom we do that for you on the
back end you just run anytime you put a
build in your face you just swing
yourself down so that's the same thing
as real-time preview why I have to wait
reload your page to see what you're done
iteratively on several devices when you
could avoid it right it's all part of
the same center of thought and well I
think we already started showing some of
the future we think we can we can we can
do so in the end I would like to finish
by saying that the chef's five is not a
buzzword that it's an amazing technology
it means even though it's not finished
by any mean they pray whatever video be
HTML six and seven and whatever and then
the stack will continue to grow I ID
space and no matter how fast
Google wish the world would go is going
to go at the pace is supposed to go we
should buy by agreements that's that's
how we got so far yes people are
frustrated because it's not super quick
but that's how he work so i encourage
you to just go and and try work with the
future thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
