asynchronous programming we're going to
talk about sequencing and forking and
testing it synchronously okay so there's
two points of this talk one is general
patterns around how to use scholar
futures and what those patterns are
named and functional programming those
patterns actually have far greater
impact than we're going to talk about
today we're going to just talk about
them in context of futures the testing
synchronously bit we might not get to so
Who am I already said that yay okay this
isn't a series of talks i like to call
the new web this is a these are like the
you know buzz word you're going to hear
okay today's talk talks about doing
event-driven asynchronous composition of
services all right the basic gist of
this talk is we have a we have a big
stack trace never mind okay that's
because my network I think this is I the
source code is under jay Surette / intro
to FP if you want to take a look the
source code is an application that goes
and grabs a bunch of data from github
we're aggregating a bunch of different
calls okay we have an asynchronous we're
using dispatch data binder dispatch by
Nathan one of the organizers of the
conference to asynchronously grab data
out of github and we make several calls
and we want to make a aggregate service
that is still a synchronous you know
that is still deferred in the future and
that's essentially what the source code
is doing we're going to go through the
patterns of how you a great other
asynchronous services to create a new
asynchronous flow all right what is a
synchronicity it's not as crazy as it
seems it's just a operation happens upon
receipt of an indication all right
there's nothing magic about asynchronous
code asynchronous you can have something
thats asynchronous and is terribly
unperformed asynchronous is not special
scaling sauce it's just after something
happens I do something else okay so for
example this is asynchronous I want the
data's I had my servlet thread that then
the user tells me he wants the data's I
go and make a JDBC call he hits the
database that comes back to the jdbc
connection thread and that comes back to
my server that thread and I tell the
user
I block two threads for a pretty long
time during this process but it's
asynchronous write the code runs on
receipt of some signal you know the
database was ready but I'm still
blocking the thread so that's bad what
we want to do in Scala is called
asynchronous and non blocking ok that's
the key is both of them we the
assumption is if I give up the thread
and let somebody else use it they're
going to make better use than me just
holding on to it because this query will
take a while ok it sits somewhere else
that's the general assumption in terms
of when this practice is good ok all
right those are the points in time where
somebody else can use my thread so in
Skyler's future we can define a future
it's a lot simpler than in Java we just
say future and then a block of code and
that block of code will execute some
time later and we'll get basically
notifications when it's done we can
chain new operations asynchronously on
it so i can say map I can take the
previous value and I can get a new value
after that I can put a computation to
run after the first value is done
computing somewhere else the
asynchronous piece is this chaining this
take the previous value and do something
else with it the non-blocking pieces
that features go off and do something
somewhere else and my current thread can
do something ok all right so why not use
Javas futures instead of scholars you
know Java has a future right ya know
here's here's a really good example just
creating a future the difference between
Scylla and Java is kind of intense but
more importantly it's about chaining ok
it's about asynchronously training
behavior and ending up with a future at
the end ok it's it's the ability to
define a flow of computation in your
program and have that be asynchronous
and really the goal is never having to
block never having to get the value out
of the future if you can help it that's
what you want so we're going to talk
about sequencing which is map and flat
map from functional programming we're
going to talk about joining which is zip
and traverse ok so let's talk a little
bit out synchrony
let's say I'm developing say a web
framework okay and I have an
asynchronous API to my data store so I'm
using mongos a sync driver or i'm using
the postgres a sync driver i'm not using
jdbc okay that's that's key jdbc is not
a synchronous so I execute my query and
I get back a future database result and
then I want to take that result and I
want to do something else with it so I
map it I take I map the data that I get
back from the query and I generate some
HTML now I have future HTML that future
HTML is done after the query is done and
after the HTML has been rendered and it
happens on some other thread I don't
care when that's done I need to write it
out to the socket so again I map it when
this is done go run this code okay write
it out to the socket and the socket I
get essentially in the handle request
method will assume that so if you look
here I have a flow of futures I never
actually get the result out of the
future but I still accomplish an end to
end goal of computation okay futures are
a way of flowing together computation
it's basically a runtime all right let's
say I refactor my method now that's
that's what map is essentially after one
feature is done I have a computation I
run with its result and do some more
stuff let's say I refactor though and I
make my render method and my render
method has to go off and do some other
complicated things that it needs to do
using futures because it's going to you
know defer some calculations until
something is done so my render method
now returns a future of HTML all right
so after I get my database query here
i'm going to call map on the result and
render it but what do i get back for map
i get back a future of future HTML it's
nested if I want to I can't you know I
have to defer into the future than defer
into the future so these nested maps and
everything it's really really ugly we
have a solution for that it's called
flat map okay for those who are
unfamiliar with with scholars
collections flat map is is used in there
if you're unfamiliar with this concept
essentially what you're doing is you are
flattening and mapping at the same time
we're flattening is if I have a future
of future of a I get back a future of a
if I have say a list of lists of a
flattening gives me back just a single
list with all of those lists aggregated
together with futures it's a little bit
different it's just a way of saying when
the inner one is done you know I want
that guy not the outer one okay does
that I know I'm talking fast but we're
like five minutes behind sorry guys okay
so flat map fixes the type signature so
now I can delegate to a another
asynchronous method so if I'm chaining a
set of asynchronous methods where I take
in some input get a future of something
i'm using map and flat map okay to chain
these things in schuyler we have
syntactic sugar for that it's called a
for expression so just like a collection
I can use a for expression and say for
the Dana I get from the asynchronous
query call render with that data and
then give me the HTML back and then
yield you know finally go right out the
HTML all right using for expressions
it's akin to what you do with
collections you can think of futures as
a collection of just one element and if
i iterate over it I'm essentially
waiting until that future is done to
execute code okay but this is
essentially how we do future flow in
terms of sequencing the query has to
return first before I can call render
that's key here render does not get
called into the queries finished I'm not
doing two things at the same time I'm
doing this and then this and then this
okay monadic flow is kind of what I'm
calling this the fact that we can do
this is because we have a monad against
futures for those of you who aren't
familiar with no dad it's really funny
term comes from category theory will
talk about that specifically but there's
essentially an interface on future that
allows us to use for expressions in this
style okay and this is a flow of
sequence of operations monads are
actually more powerful than just
defining flows but that's what this
pattern is okay
so what is it I have a series of
operations I need to run okay I can run
them inside of a future monett i can run
side it in a synchronous i can run them
inside of a collection so that is where
i have a collection of things and
another collection of things and i'm
digging into collections like a tree all
right have you used it before any time
you use for expressions you're using
this concept I'm trying to show you is
that it's not for expressions are not
just about collections it's about
computations okay all right so if you
have map and flat map and some sort of
factory method that's all you need to
use this pattern that's the base
discovered it's really really low level
and abstract all right now let's talk
about joining because this is more
exciting this is when we actually can
compose services all right if I have a
query to go get the users and a query go
to get projects because say I'm github
or something and I want to join these
two things together I use what's called
zip alright so let's take a look at what
zip is if I take users and projects I
have a future result for both and I zip
them together I get back a tuple where
the left-hand side is the one query
result the right-hand side is the other
query result okay looks like that joins
them together into a single future so
they both execute concurrently at the
same time possibly depending on how many
cores I have and how many are available
but they could potentially run at the
same time and then when they're both
done this new future is complete so it's
how I take two different flows join them
together ok so that's zip in the actual
the pattern we're going to call its it
has a completely different method
signature but for now zip is efficient
enough for us okay what about
collections let's say I have a list of
things that I'm doing some time in the
future and I want to get back HTML so I
have a list of database results I have
to execute and I want to join all those
together and get back a single HTML in
the future sometime okay well this is
what's known as a fork join
I have set of collections I've set of
asynchronous operations that are running
on each of those items and when it's all
done i joined back together so the
components i have is i have a list of
things an async operation that takes one
of those items and returns a future
thing and I want to get a future list
okay if I'm using map and flat map it
looks kind of weird but there's this
handy thing a tactical or in the future
API sorry come Traverse all right
Traverse iterates over the queries takes
an asynchronous yeah it takes the
queries which is your list an
asynchronous operation which is for
every query I go run it and I get back a
future query result and it's going to
give me back a future list of all the
results okay that's what Traverse does
the method signature for that sucker
looks really really painful when you
first hit it but that's essentially all
it is i have a list i have an
asynchronous operation or an operation
within a context and i want to get back
a list of things inside of my context
okay so zip is essentially an
applicative functor if you have an
implicit functor you have a zip
operation not necessarily vice versa but
anyway so this pattern that we're using
here is I have a set of operations that
I need a run and then when they all of
them are complete I have a joining
operation 22 you know combine the values
from those initial operations okay so I
essentially have an a cyclic graph of
things to do how many of you guys are
familiar with required jas anyone okay
for those of you familiar require GS is
the simplest example of applicative
functors i have a set of dependencies of
JavaScript modules that I depend on when
I define a new one and once those are
all initialized it calls the function
that initializes me and I get each of
those modules in as an argument that's
what required a j/s does that's what
applicative functors are okay and that's
just a way of defining load order well
what else looks kind of like required to
jsu
springs bean container crap is kind of
like requirejs if you will it two
handles initialization order that's this
pattern of you know joining computations
the pattern is so fundamentally simple
that in Scala we normally we normally
look at spring is being bloated because
we see the fundamental pattern of just
if I have an applicative functor on some
sort of context I can join these
computations together and make sure that
the initialization order is correct I'm
defining my dependencies that's what
this pattern is all about that's what
we're doing with futures okay it's just
we need that zip operation what about
traverse traverse looks a little bit
different you you know it what does this
pattern look like I have a collection
like entity I have an operation to run
against each element of that collection
like entity and the operation returns
values inside of the context that I
wanted to return values in so when did
you use this before well Traverse is the
lowest level pattern for iteration over
collections if you look at scholars
collections hierarchy what's the lowest
level anyone know traversable yeah
traversable just defines what we call an
internal iterator all right the
collection when I when I make use of
traversable the only thing the
collection has to do is define how to
traverse over each element and run a
function against them it doesn't
actually give you an iterator that you
can use it says I know how to iterate
better okay it's an internal iterator it
controls the iteration that is what the
traversal method here is doing
essentially if you have one of these
things which is the simplest possible
iterator to implement for any collection
you can make use of this pattern okay
but it's essentially just iteration now
we're going to go a little crazy okay so
i was showing how to compose together
this flow if we take a look at code is
that readable that's probably not is it
okay so here's our github service okay
our github service is I have a set of
project statistics I want to run
on a given github project what I need to
do is I need to pull out the pull
request from the API this pull request
if you see can you guys see the
highlight the are crap this is
eclipsed man I
yeah hold on this yeah now let's yeah
let's just use VI it'll be it'll be way
easier so its main Scala let's look at
the futures one all right so we'll fix
it in a sec okay all right is that
readable bigger smaller okay all right
so we want project statistics we and we
want to get them back in the future but
the project statistics we're looking at
in github we're going to call it the
Fort Knox statistic so this is how hard
is it for an external contributor to get
there pull requests in and we're going
to assume that over the last hundred
pull requests the percent that are
accepted of from outside contributors is
going to be indicative of how hard it is
to get a pull request in that's actually
a complete lie but that's what we're
going to calculate for fun okay so we
grabbed all our pull requests and pull
request returns a future of a sequence
of pull requests we grabbed all our
collaborators the collaborators are
people who have commit right saan the
project we have to grab it in a separate
API call it's a completely different API
call on github that returns a future
sequence of collaborators then we zip
the two things together okay so we get a
tuple that has our sequence of
collaborators a sequence of pull
requests and then we join them together
in a map function so we map that and
generate our project statistics project
statistics is a class that calculates
all the statistics I just constructor
because i was lazy and it's not actually
a method but anyway so that's that's
what it does and now we want for a
github user we want to take a look at
all those projects and see how their
fort knox levels compared so given a
user we get back so i just checked in
time we get back future statistics and
for each project of that user we have to
make an API call okay and we get back a
future sequence of projects so this
project here is a sequence of github
projects and then we traverse over each
of them right traversal
for every project we make an
asynchronous call and we get back a
future sequence of statistics for every
project of the user and we return back
the statistics for that user and his set
of projects and then we print them out
and I'm gonna run it but it might since
the Internet's been awesome here it
might might blow up and do something
weird it's access in github is my user
we're going to compare Scala and akka
which is a fun one yeah those akka guys
they're there they're actually Fort Knox
okay so what would be ideal I have this
this this thing running in futures but
what if I don't want to run at
asynchronously what if i'm debugging and
i want to run it synchronously how do i
do that well actually the way you do
that is you pull out the abstractions
for map for flat map for zip and for
traversal external to the context you're
running it so I'm going to fly through
these it's not important you can look in
them up on your own they have names
external map is what we call a functor
in functional programming okay i define
a context type where it's a context that
contains something in this case of
future and i define a map method that
given a value in the context and an
operation that takes the item in it and
maps it to something else I can get back
a new context with that you know adapted
element this functor exists for option
it exists for collections it exists for
futures and it exists for something I'm
calling synchronous okay which is the
which is identity for flat map it's
called a monad yeah it's a weird name
I'm saying this functor but this is
essentially the interface that I can
extract and then I can make use of these
patterns for zip I can do the same thing
with applicative functors I can have an
external zip I take the two contexts and
return the context and for jefferis it
looks different traverse I need a
collection and the traverse method needs
to know the context of the operations
that you're traversing over okay that's
where I need the an applicative functor
for that content
traversal can use any applicative
functor mean it can sure us over a whole
bunch of different contexts I can go
over well I should say go read a paper
called the essence of the iterator
pattern and you will see all sorts of
neat things you can do with traversal
one of my favorite examples is I can
take a collection and using a context of
a half filled out graph I can go
traverse and fill out the graph with the
values from the collection which is kind
of cool all sorts of neat different
weird patterns I'm just showing you the
basics of the most common one that you
will probably hit now okay then if I
want to do synchronous or asynchronous I
take my statistic service that user
statistics service code you just saw and
I throw a type parameter for the context
I want it to run it ok now the the
implementation that I'm going to use is
running it in the future ok with the
futures but that context the only thing
I need is a monad instance that's what
the colon monad is it says that i need a
value of the monon instance for this
type and if i have that the entire
service runs well i can implement that
for synchronous behavior and then I can
run my tests synchronously without
having to defer and wait ok yeah not
questions because we have to show you
I'll just show you oh great yeah
Internet I'm sorry guys I should have
printed out what it looks like yeah ok
so if you look at our testing here when
we do our test of the generic service
what we do is we define a new API which
is in the single threaded context
single-threaded is a type I'll let you
guys guess what the type is anyone
anyone know yeah ok if you will guess
later but essentially when I define the
project's method I'm stubbing it out and
I'm stubbing out just returning directly
some data as if it's the github API and
I do the same thing for all of the
github API that
should i have for single-threaded
instead of future and then i can just
instantiate the generic statistic
service with my single threaded API that
stubbed out and all my calls happen on
the local thread I'm not deferring
things for futures and I don't have to
deal with the overhead and the
complexity of threads and trying to wait
for things to happen and figuring out
you know what what's an appropriate time
out for this test you know like I have
to wait for a certain amount of time for
to be done it did a deadlock no it's all
synchronous if I get any sort of
exceptions or anything it happens
directly ok so what I've done by
extracting out those patterns is now I
can change the behavior of that flow of
code when we talk about functional
programming i mean that's that's a big
thing and functional programming is for
the same code that i have i can change
the actual execution model that's what
that's what things like monads help you
do ok so if that goal is worth it and
that's what you want to do you go with
the complexity of abstracting these
things out having the context having the
crazy type parameters and that kind of
thing if you're just doing stuff
asynchronously and it's always going to
be synchronous you don't care maybe the
overheads not worth it for you right
it's it's up to you to make that
decision I'm just trying to show you the
power you can get by going that next
level so I know we kind of flew through
that because I had technical issues as
always apologize any questions we have
one minute yeah why don't use of for
comprehension oh ok so one of the one of
the common mistakes that people make is
when you do a for expression ok yeah
come on import concurrent underscore
import executor now execution context
was it implicit global yay okay so one
mistake people make is I want to do
something in the future so I'm going to
print land you know one and I'm going to
return one in the future okay then I'm
going to do this thing here and print
line two all right what's the problem
here if I do sorry not now what's the
problem but do you expect these two
things to run in parallel a lot of
people mistakenly assume that they're
going to run in parallel but they don't
the second future doesn't get spawned
off until the first future is done so no
matter what I always get X plus y sorry
wow I did something bad to my SBT sorry
guys holy crap yeah lets you didn't see
that yet most people most people expect
expect these things to run in tandem you
know both futures run at the same time
but the first one will always run before
the second one applicative functor is
the only way that you can not care about
execution order when you join two things
together okay and the other reason is
that there are more things that are
implicated functors then can be in four
expressions mathematically so it's a
more it's a loser restriction it's
easier to find things that fit that it's
easier to implement to ya any yes yield
yield really should be there it doesn't
need to be there if it's a if it's a
future yeah so with futures we have the
difference between having a yield and
not having a yield is whether or not you
have a for each method if you have a for
each method you can use yield and you
know get rid of all that complexity but
there's no harm in having yield and
there is harm if you don't have a for
each method and not having yield so
that's why I have yield always but that
that that's the specific reason again a
future of unit I can just as easily
ignore as something that returns unit so
well but yeah I mean you can call get
right but you need to figure out the
right time out
for that operation when you call get so
in this case it's a little trivial you
know it's going to return immediately I
stop things out but when you're dealing
with asynchronous code in general
there's always a question of how long do
i wait for all the threading and lock in
and crap to end that's the right value
you could use int but if you happen to
have some sort of exception thrown and
maybe things don't propagate correctly
your code gets really really hard to
debug so the idea here is I want that
synchronous flow so when I step through
a debugger I see this happened then this
happened and this happened versus with
futures you know I have to start
tracking things across threads so it
helps me write my tests essentially and
again if you don't need that abstraction
for your particular code base it might
not be worthwhile to pull things out if
you do pull things out you do have a lot
more context in which stuff can run
anyway it's a it's a trade-off yeah cool
well thanks guys sorry talked really
fast 30 minutes is awesome and thanks
for having me
