so when I say brainwave controlled
people were thinking like can it read my
mind is it like extrapolating exactly
what I'm thinking not quite what we can
read our emotional states what we
understand about the mind through the
last century of neuroscience has been
that the mind works at these different
levels of emotional states you have
these different brain wave bands things
known as delta theta alpha beta and
gamma and so in the past you had to use
a complete bucket full sensors all over
your head in order to read these
brainwave states and so what neuro sky
has done is to take that medical device
technology and turn it into consumer
device technology what was previously a
bucket full of sensors is now a single
sensor on your forehead so what we can
do is we can add a creative element of
intrigue to your game a game that
understands certain emotional parts
about you we're not a replacement for
the button but what we can do is add
that emotional layer so we can monitor
these that information in the background
to create apps that know a little bit
more about the user right now there are
developers who have worked in the ADHD
space and the research space and are
using those to create serious games that
will provide benefits for the user so
with that information we can create apps
that involve the player in new levels of
interactivity and so there's kind of a
complex process to this I mean it is
after all neuroscience basically there's
a chip and then from that chip we read
your brain wave signal there's a series
of complex algorithms and then there's
an application what we want to do is to
properly enable application development
and so we're in the past we had like
complex sensors what we're out putting
are things that neuroscientists and game
developers can utilize besides raw waves
brain wave bands
and other things that neuroscientists
would find useful we have an attention
meter and a meditation meter so
basically if you can read a number from
0 to 100 you know how attentive somebody
is or how calm somebody is and so that
can be used to monitor in the background
a person's level of interest in addition
to that we can also monitor I blinks and
the signal status so basically from that
there are two waves of applying
brainwaves there are voluntary
applications and involuntary
applications from voluntary you can find
out like directly how somebody is
involved in something this will be a
demo of voluntary brainwaves it could
use it for like magic or telekinesis but
for involuntary you might be involving
the player in two different gameplay
patterns or making them watch certain
movies so then that means in the
background you can monitor those changes
in brain waves and create changes in the
game path for them so basically to sum
all of this up is the thing that we are
offering to game development is
distinction when you develop a game that
uses brain waves that takes advantage of
this technology your game will stand out
from the crowd so let's take a look at
the Mattel mindflex yeah of course I
just got to say really quickly here this
this this game depends on on being able
to focus and right now I can barely
focus on the sentence I'm saying but so
Tansy's about to completely kill me but
so the the rules of it's basically like
what it's like a tug-of-war and we're
going to try and push the ball like a
few void when you push the ball I all
the way with my side which is going to
happen pretty quickly too
alright its neck and neck this is what
we do in our office all the time so we
get a lot of practice time it makes a
great drinking game but I also wanted to
use this chance to bring up another like
sub-project of this we understand that
you know it is a very interesting and
different technology one of the things
that we had wanted to work on is
assistive technology there are people
like patients with locked-in syndrome
locked-in syndrome is this where you
cannot fully interact with others so
like locked-in syndrome is like when you
are trapped in yourself and so one of
the things that we wanted to do through
our technologies to create a way to help
developers create programs for people
with locked-in syndrome so we actually
created an IndieGoGo site specific to
creating these assistive technology
programs where we would collect money
for people that are interested in
helping and then use that money to pay
developers to create these assistive
technology programs thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
