Phil asked me to do this conference I
was really excited and I noticed that
the day was the day after the election
and I was like cause it's awesome
because we're all gonna be in a really
great mood so then it was like okay and
then my wife asked me it's morning he's
so wouldn't your time Oh after
lunch she goes boy you are not betting
very well right I promise I will make
this not very yani I promise that it is
different than a normal talk you see at
conferences like this because I do have
some unique experiences and I want to
show you a little bit about my journey
and some research that we did at Google
we call the project Aristotle about what
makes effective teams and the best part
about this research is that at Google I
get to stand on the shoulders of giants
so most of the research was done by
Julia Rose off ski and if you read the
New York Times article the article is
mostly about her I did have a little
blurb in there but it was mostly about
her and her struggles in her research
but I have a little personal bent on it
so hopefully you'll indulge me a little
bit so I'm going to open with asking you
three questions just think a little bit
about what kind of team you're on right
now and then what kind of teammate are
you
and finally what kind of leader are you
just kind of keep those things top of
mind as we go through and explore for
the next 45 minutes or so let me tell
you a little bit about my experience
with teams if you read the bio and maybe
you didn't some of you may know or may
not my first job out of school is I was
a police officer right out of college
landed as a as a cop and my first
experience on a Patrol team wasn't that
great
it's a paramilitary organization there
is a very very high pressure to conform
and not be different surprise surprise
police officers can be very conservative
xenophobic racist homophobic name the
phobic they're there I worked in a very
white Republican town I was the lone
Asian police officer so everyone knew
who I was and so I felt this real
pressure I felt pressure about me as a
person I wanted to perform well and on a
patrol team the last thing you wanted to
be seen is weak you want to be just like
them it's like peer pressure on steroids
if you think high school peer pressure
was bad be a rookie cop and do the job
and try to have to feel that pressure
there's a lot of it and really what they
expect from you is to go out and do the
job just do your best and go out there
and you were a generalist so you do
everything you're the whole hand you
drive around you find and arrest bad
people most of the time they're bad guys
right you interview interrogate
investigate collect evidence do all that
stuff you're near everything well what I
found was I had to censor myself quite a
bit political discussions would happen I
wouldn't say anything I would just nod
my hand and kind of chuckle at their
jokes they would say very rarely they
were racist slur but there were
definitely homophobic slurs going on and
and I I would love to be able to tell
you that I raised my hand and I said you
know what I am NOT okay with those words
and I'm not okay with the thoughts
behind those words I would love to be
able to say say that I did that but I
didn't because I wanted to fit in so I
could not bring my whole self to work I
kind of felt like I was just Matt the
police officer was very different than
Matt the person and that was a big
struggle for me because before and
obviously not that I had legions of
experience this is my first real job
after all but I never really had that
bifurcation of personality before and I
really struggle with that interestingly
enough four years into my career as a
police officer I joined the SWAT team
SWAT team is a very stringent selection
process it's almost as hard as getting
hired at Google obviously not a very
intellectually high intellectual bar but
there is a bar right you have to be
physically fit you have to build a chute
you have to build a running jump you
have to build a rappel you have to be
able to do a lot of stuff and pass an
oral interview and be vetted by your
peers and by the people that are already
on the existing SWAT team well actually
I made it all the way through and I
joined the SWAT team and I kind of
expected the SWAT team to be an
extension of the patrol team actually it
was quite different to my surprise it
was actually a great experience we had a
sergeant on the SWAT team who actually
really believed that in order for us to
execute at our best we really had to in
our hearts and minds believe that the
plan we were about to execute was the
best one and so even if we didn't have a
lot of time he would still ask for input
and he really meant it he wouldn't just
say okay this is what we're gonna do the
difference between patrol and SWAT
Patrol you do everything like I said
before you're the whole hand on SWAT
your finger my job was to be on the
entry team I was the number two person
on the entry team and Jimmy was in front
of me it was me and Steve was behind me
we breach open the door and rush in and
we each end assignment as you can
imagine pretty high level of
dependability right because if I make a
mistake
Gmail's not going down if I make a
mistake people can die Jimmy and Steve
depended on me doing the right action so
that's why at Google when people are
running around say oh my god we pushed
it back and taking Gmail's down I'm just
like it's all right
no one's going to die we'll figure it
out okay but anyway we had this
different environment on the SWAT team
obviously the stakes are high when
you're on Patrol
my favorite call it was like hey Matt
you got to go to a barking dog call why
cuz the barking dog is bothering a
neighbor or his shopping cart ran into
my Mercedes and now look at this big
dead oh my god right you'd have that on
patrol or you'd have other things but on
SWAT team you don't get that right on
the SWAT team you're you got called
because there's something serious that's
happening usually in progress it's a
robbery that went bad or a hostage
situation or a high-risk search warrant
something along that those lines so the
risk that the stakes are already higher
on a SWAT team and there was always
usually an element of danger one thing
we would do Jimmy was in front me and
Steve is that we wouldn't even say
anything but before we did the breach we
would turn around and touch our fists
together and look at look at each other
basically what we were saying is I got
you don't worry about it I will do my
job and I will protect you and we didn't
have to say anything right but there was
an esprit de corps there because again
my physical safety depends on what they
do and along with the inclusive
environment that the sergeant had
created it was a really really great
experience very different my patrol team
experience versus my SWAT team
experience and what I really found is
I was always chasing after that SWAT
team experience after I had to leave
police work because of an injury so what
happened was I had to leave her my back
really bad and I couldn't be a Fleece
officer anymore and I did I won't bore
you with the trials and travails of what
happened it's just kind of an
interesting story but we don't have time
today let's just say long story short I
ended up in a technical job and I was a
manager of a team of ten running the
Walmart comm website and at this point
in my career I had never logged into a
UNIX system so Oracle database didn't
know what you're talking about
Fernan web servers apache no I didn't
know I got this job because I was good
at operations and basically the VP knew
me and recommended me and that was it so
I knew I was very lucky to be in that
role luckily I had some people that were
gracious enough to teach me but I was so
green and so new that I spent all of my
cycles just getting myself technically
up to speed just so they would respect
me for the ability to be able to write a
simple bash script right keep the
website running fill in a shift for them
if I had to and so therefore I never
spent any time creating a vision for the
team improving processes and all of that
I was just massively trying to get a
reduce my technical debt my gaps so
later on what happened is that people
would complain because they didn't feel
like they had a manager because I really
wasn't a manager I was just trying to be
better and I wanted to be popular so I
made the popular decisions not the right
ones all these things as a very junior
manager this is what what happened but I
took those lessons and I moved to a
different company and I found that I
took on another team this was a software
company and the dynamics of that team
where everyone was unhappy and so my
idea was I'm just gonna make him happy
well that was a miserable failure you
can't do that right I tried and I tried
to be their friend also
not what you want to be doing as a
leader right again these are all things
that I just felt like well I want to get
to that SWAT team that that great
dynamic again how do I do it I didn't
know the algorithm to get there and so
then I figured well it's the reason why
is because the SWAT team was hand-picked
so if I could hire my own team then I'm
sure that I could create that experience
again right and so I got hired by
another tech company and they said hey
Matt what we want you to do is build out
an Operations Center you can hire and
fire people just get it up and get it
running do it the way you want you read
all the policies all the procedures you
go give you a budget and everything
suite
so I spent time I hand-picked a bunch of
people I hired them all put them
together in a pod and guess what
happened the team sucked right it was
not what I had envisioned and again it
was like what am I doing wrong move to
another tech company and another one
finally ended up landing at Google I
know a guy that hadn't logged into Unix
and then somehow seven years later it
lands at Google again I am the luckiest
person alive they still haven't figured
out I don't belong so I got a Google and
I third okay the hiring bar Google's
fairly high and they must have figured
this out I'll fix that in a second they
must have figured this out right they
have the brightest and the best so they
must have thought about how teams work
and they have the the right sauce and so
therefore it took over a team and
s-sorry and guess what you know the
answer teams weren't any better right
they weren't melding any better they
weren't working as a team and in fact in
some ways it was arguably worse than
other places I had been even though they
were the brightest and the best
so Julia came along and she had similar
experiences if you've read the article
about her post-grad work or actually was
graduate work and she thought about what
would be the differentiator between an
effective team and not so effective
teams and the quote that she heard from
somebody that sparked this research was
the people I work with define everything
she overheard that and she news as being
part of people analytics at Google that
we make data-driven decisions there is a
team at Google that is constantly
performing social experiments on us my
favorite one is that the M&amp;amp;Ms in the
micro kitchens they used to have them on
the same level as the coffee makers in a
jar with the scoop and then they said
huh I think the Googlers are eating too
many M&amp;amp;Ms so let's move them to a shelf
down below the shelf with a coffee maker
guess what consumption went down so then
they said let's get rid of the scoop and
let's get hundred calorie packs and then
we'll move it even lower and again
consumption went down and then they sent
out a report saying hey by the way last
quarter 7 million fewer sugar calories
were consumed by Google because we had
moved to the M&amp;amp;Ms and put them in
hundred calorie packs in the jar
and now what they've done is hidden the
M&amp;amp;Ms in a drawer and their way in the
back of the drawer ok all the kale chips
and the apples and you know all the good
stuffs in the front way in the back
you'll see some M&amp;amp;Ms now but what I do
is one of my favorite games that Google
is when I go to different offices I look
at the microwave the micro kitchen is
and I'm trying to figure out what
experiment they're running because we
are the biggest guinea pigs trust me
they are always running something yeah
so anyway they do base things on data
and analytics
we had a similar study about four years
ago about what makes the best managers
and it was called project oxygen in
other words there's got to be some
attributes that differentiate best
managers from the ones that aren't so
good and they did a couple year study
they interviewed people and they came up
with these attributes and I won't go
through all of them but you probably all
heard something like this before right
it's no secret you don't micromanage
your good communicator take personal
interest you have a clear vision and
strategy and Julia saw the results of
this project oxygen and said huh along
with that quote about the people I work
with define everything she was thinking
how about we come up with a study that
differentiates the effective teams from
they're not so effective and all these
slides will be available you know what
to worry about it again what sets the
best apart from the rest of course the
first thing you have to do is to find
what effectiveness is right well what is
an effective team how do you even start
to define that it's a little subjective
so what she did is just talk to
executives hey which teams do you think
are effective then she talked to tech
leads managers a lot of people in this
room not managers directors might be
higher-ups here
but leaders what teams are effective in
your mind and then finally if you ask
the people actually doing the work is
your team defective what team is
effective if it's not your team or if
your team is what it is it rigorous
study she took two years interviewing
two hundred interviews there was 180
teams involved all kinds of inputs I
want to say there was over three
thousand lines of code and 170 thousand
keywords coded or something like that
anyway rural rigorous study it's been
published and again what we were trying
to find was just like project oxygen had
the attributes of a great manager what
we were trying to do is find the
attributes of an effective team and we
had a lot of guesses she had a lot of
guesses coming into it it was kind of
like well I bet you the effective teams
have a lot of high performers or they've
been at Google for a
long time or they're co-located anyone
here have this thing where it's like
well if the software engineers are next
to the UX people that's kind of cause
this like automatic synergy and things
are going to be better how many people
have heard that before
uh-huh okay these are all the things we
thought would be important and a lot of
them were wrong here's the things that
we really found psychological safety
dependability structure meaning and
impact meaning is personal meaning not
meaning for the company and we'll dive
into mostly psychological safety because
is is the foundation of making a highly
effective team the other big takeaway is
how a team works together is far more
important than who's on the team so
forgive me in my sports analogy any
Giants fans out there okay what happened
in 2010 2012 and 2014 I guess there's
not it's not a good baseball fan it was
a bad one anyway they won the World
Series and in each of those years if you
looked at their rosters and then
compared them to the people they were
playing they were actually inferior
position by position but as a team they
want it three out of five three out of
five years three out of five years which
is not by accident right the Warriors a
couple of years ago not quite last year
but the Warriors a couple years ago game
plays like a team they definitely had
superstars but they played very well
together and again it's it's how the
team works and if you read the abstract
my analogy there is that what Google was
really good at by default was creating
all-star teams the best program manager
the best UX the best coder right and put
them in or put them on a team and then
expect it to just gel well that doesn't
work because what we found is
it's really how the team works together
not who comprises the team so a
championship team will beat an all-star
team most of the time and which we want
to do as leaders is build championship
teams with psyche safety at the bottom
and we'll dive into a little further but
basically you feel safe taking risks you
feel safe sharing vulnerabilities
dependability I can depend on others to
get done and not just get done but get
done with high standards and then
structure and clarity there's clearly
defined roles and finally sorry there's
meaning which again it's personal
meaning personally meaningful to you my
example is that we have a safe browsing
team that keeps malware and bad actors
offed off the internet right and they
have extreme passion for this personally
meaningful to them finally impact you
can see the impact of your work well we
found on the sales side it's nice
because on the end the tech side is a
little hard to evaluate who's effective
you can't go by like lines of code right
and you can't say X feature was better
than Y feature but luckily on the sales
side it's pretty clear right you either
hit your numbers or you didn't and what
we found was that the safe teams beat
their numbers by an average of 17
percent and unsafe teams were actually
missing by almost the same amount
actually 19 now there was a little human
crime when this was presented at Google
because people were like excuse me Julia
what about the directionality how do we
know like how do we know like are they
safe because they hit beat their numbers
or add or did they beat their numbers
because they're safe right and so what
they did they took that to heart and
actually tracked teams over multiple
quarters and took new teams in
consistently we found the same result so
we're pretty confident in this
conclusion also
teams that scored high in psyche safety
from the executive viewpoint by
two-to-one were viewed as being more
effective so because psychological
safety is so important let's spend a
little bit of time on that good to share
belief but held by team members that the
team is safe for interpersonal
risk-taking on my patrol team as a
police officer the philosophy was it's
the Japanese proverb right the nail that
sticks up is going to get hammered back
down this is the reverse of that right
if you have a psychologically safe team
there's no bad question you can express
yourself with that fear of ridicule or
rejection and it's really important that
when someone takes a personal risk that
the reaction of the team in that risk is
in a positive manner
we break it down even further into voice
trust and inclusion so does everyone on
your team have a voice and this includes
having the people that don't talk very
much a lot of people love to talk I'm
one of them
right but we got to make sure that the
people that don't talk very much and
have a voice
also people process information
differently some people will want to
think about it other people love
shooting from the hip but you need to be
aware of that and so when you have a
meeting we're going to talk about
something on my team but what we do is I
say hey we're going to talk about X
topic on Wednesday think about this and
come to the meeting with some ideas
because some people are going to be very
uncomfortable trying to think of a
formulated idea on the spot but if you
give them a couple days they're really
going to have some great juicy ideas to
bring to the table but does everyone
have a voice does everyone feel like
they can speak without fear of reprisal
second one is trust do I trust others on
the team both on a personal and
professional level if you read the
article what I did was not everyone knew
that I had personal health struggles and
I I wasn't exactly sure actually I
wasn't sure even up to the point where I
started opening in my mouth if I was
going to share it or not and for those
of you that don't know I have advanced
stage 4 cancer and I know that I'm not
gonna make it to 60 I knew that and I
know that and I know that my body will
fail me at some point right now I'm able
to work and do things like this
thankfully and I was afraid a little bit
to share this but at the same time I
wanted them to see me as a human being
not just as their manager and you know
what I'm fallible
I have struggles just like you and I
want to share this with you now if you
read the article it doesn't take an
ailing manager right it's I wasn't
trying to play the sympathy card or well
my wife says the cancer card like when I
bought my new car
I would have said no but okay right but
I wasn't trying to get their sympathy
while I was trying to show them it's
like I trust you did said to share this
with you and I'm gonna I'm okay with
being vulnerable in front of you and
actually it X ended up spawning this
really great conversation where other
people's had shared their struggles one
I had no idea but she had a really
really long struggle with food and her
relationship with food and she told us
the whole thing and we had no idea what
was going on right and again I'm not
saying that that's the kind of meeting
you have to have I'm not trying to say
okay we need to go to a campfire and
play the guitar and sing Kumbaya that's
not what it's about it's just about you
modeling being vulnerable and thala pole
in front of your people in whatever form
that takes so that's an element of trust
inclusion now conclusion and diversity
or hot words nowadays it is however very
very important to think about as a
leader I've got two women on my team and
as a woman in tech they are definitely
in a non dominant group we obviously
have a massive problem across all the
technology that we do not have enough
women and we're doing something wrong
because women aren't attracted to the
field right and I am a male in tech I'm
in the dominant group I need to work
really really hard to understand to try
to understand the best I can
their struggles and what causes them not
to stay in tech or be attracted to it in
the first place now I'm very fortunate
that both of the women on my team are
very confident and assertive and I asked
them very very succinctly please tell me
when I do something say something do
whatever that in any way makes you feel
not included and call me on it please
because as a male in tech I will never
understand what you're going through but
you can help me and they do and I
appreciate it I have a Muslim on my team
it was like a lot of Americans fairly
ignorant of what that means right other
than
there's some rules that I know they pray
every day and at a certain time in blah
blah blah right but I really reached out
to him and say hey you know what I want
to make sure that you feel included so I
want to make sure that if we're doing it
dinner outing I don't do it during the
month that you're fasting right and I
don't base my offsites always around
alcohol because we all love to go to
bars and bourbon tasting as I wait a
minute that's not being inclusive with
him
so being inclusive takes a lot of work
however the people on your team will
appreciate you deeply for doing it even
if they notice you just making an effort
you don't have to be perfect so those
are three elements there of how we break
down psyche safety here's some quotes
about unsafe teams the second one really
resonated with me I get a bit scared to
speak my mind there's been so many
people that have been here so long or we
have this thing called impostor syndrome
at least when I joined Google I
certainly had it and I did my gmail
rotation and I went to Zurich and all of
these senior Gmail people were there and
here's me showing up hi everybody I'm
the new Gmail essary oh you don't know
anything right and I didn't and I kind
of felt this I really felt like I
couldn't ask questions I was just
supposed to know
heads down read it Matt learn it the top
one to our team meetings don't always
feel like a safe zone for questions
condescending aggressive and not
aggressive in a really overt way just
even minor things what we call
microaggressions so I go that's never
gonna work right that can really those
kinds of statements gonna really hurt
time and time again here are some
responses these are verbatim from
Googlers about safe teams
what I try to have besides on my team is
number three
none of these are from my team by the
way I have a new what we call a new blur
having a person on my team it's just
like his second week and all of my
teammates are emphasizing this again and
again first of all the global production
stack is so complex there's not one
person that can know it all soup-to-nuts
it's just not possible to be an expert
on all of it so that's okay if you have
to ask questions and it's okay to make
mistakes the bond and one's a favorite
of mine too especially the last sentence
everyone is open to questions from
anyone at any time and no question is
considered done again it sounds kind of
like common sense right but even though
it's common sense it doesn't mean it
actually gets done what I found in my 50
something years on earth is that people
know what to do but they often don't do
what they know look we all heard the
Golden Rule before right it's very we
all have heard it how many people
practice that on a daily basis certainly
not the people on the road that I've
encountered so what can you do this is
blamele stolen by the way from Amy
Edmondson she has a great TEDx talk on
this topic and if you haven't seen it I
recommend you watch it I have the link
there when you get the slides
distributed this is her take on psych
safety so frame of work has a series of
learning problems not execution problems
so what I really try to do on my team is
there is two ways to set up a team there
actually many more ways but the two
dichotomies the dichotomy I want it to
frame for you is this is that at Google
we hire certain types of individuals and
I'm sure that your company's too now
trying to say Google's better okay we're
not is that we have jobs because we get
results consistently good results right
I mean that's why we have jobs
and we run we're at work and we're
performing well and that's what you call
a performance environment and what's the
problem with that though the problem
with that is that you're always on
you're always expected to perform and
you're always expected to produce you're
not doing a lot of learning on the
corollary on the other hand what you
want is set up a learning environment
like think about when you're in school
and you had a cohort working on a
project and then of you were subject
matter experts at it and you were asking
questions like I don't know is this the
right thing or how does this work I
don't even know well we've read this and
try this let's try that let's try this
and then in a learning environment it's
okay to try something and fail in a
learning environment it's okay to
suggest any old idea it doesn't matter
right because then you're out there
you're producing diversity of thought
that's what you want to be doing as a
leader so model curiosity and ask
questions a lot of times as leaders that
will get asked direct questions because
and a lot of times we do have to give
direct answers I mean we have a job
because we're leaders and we're supposed
to know the answers right however if
it's not really required to give the
answer at the time what I do is just do
the judo thing and say that's a great
question what do you think and I don't
even answer it and get a discussion
going and also what I try to do is ask a
lot of questions myself because again
they see the leader well he doesn't know
everything and it's okay and it's like
excuse me what is GFE - again I'm sorry
forgive my ignorance but what what is
this again and they'll go oh yeah that's
the thing
okay cool thanks you know then they'll
understand oh well it's actually okay to
ask questions again not rocket science
right you lead by example but again you
do have to practice it it's not going to
happen automatically and then finally
admit your own thal ability once a
quarter we have a team meeting where
half the meeting is all about just epic
failures and it could be the ones we've
done at Google pushed it back and fig
whoopsy Google
calm down right or things that happen
other places my fave my famous one was
that on Mission Impossible opening
weekend I was working at Sony for those
theaters and push the wrong button and
it's through the co2 detectors and all
the power went out on 16 theaters and I
got a personal phone call from the CFO
of Lowe's I can't refuse it but people
here that it wasn't funny at the time I
was not having a good day okay but it's
funny now but those are the kind of
things it's like hey you know what we've
all been there we've all made a mistake
we've all done this oopsy wait a minute
did I mean a person Oh No or I ran the
command on the production environment
that was supposed to be on QA unsaid how
do I control Siena this is what's going
on right but an intro ability again they
that way you're getting away from the
performance environment if they see you
as like this oh my god he's great he
writes like code like the matrix right
it's just beautiful and all his Agha
rhythms are perfect and he understands
Big O and everything he's awesome he or
she is awesome I'll never be that I've
got to do my best all the time that's
not what you want to embody right you
want embody that yes sometimes all right
really really great code sometimes my
code really sucks or I think I write
really great Cody
two weeks later looking at it like right
there oh my god that's awful
right okay maybe it's a month later two
months so Mitrione pal ability again how
a team works is more important than
who's on the team I can't read I cannot
emphasize this enough you can do this
with any team in closing what I want to
tell you is that you have tremendous
power as leaders to create the team that
you want and make the team the most
effective everybody they can be it all
it takes is little things here and there
but the main thing
to think about is that creating an
environment where people feel safe
create an environment where people feel
like they can bring their whole self
into work and they don't have to censor
themselves that doesn't mean they can
say anything they want right of course
not we have to be inclusive for
everybody
however what it means is that when they
show up to work they don't have to worry
about being the nail that's sticking up
they can actually ask freely they can do
actions that may end up in a mistake and
not be penalized for it but you as
leaders can demonstrate these behaviors
and you can emulate them and you can
introduce them and slowly but surely
you'll start building at that psyche
safety and then you can go on and work
on dependability and other things the
two things that Google what we find that
teams struggle with is one psyche safety
and to structure and clarity if you have
a psychologically safe team generally
dependability will follow pretty clearly
it's but structure and clarity is
definitely if you don't have roles
responsibilities mapped out you can run
into problems so when I did this in
front of my Labrador it took me a little
bit longer but I have about 13 minutes
for Q&amp;amp;A if anyone has any
you said about the Muslim person on your
team with alcohol and inclusiveness is
there a point where being inclusive is
too much cuz you can't do anything like
okay so he eats kosher so we can't go to
a restaurant that and he's a vegetarian
and he doesn't drink alcohol and he's
sensitive to Sun and you end up not
doing anything so how do you why do you
draw the line at inclusiveness yeah I
actually my team not too long ago had
the the food thing I couldn't do for
that very reason I had severe nut
allergies along with what was it someone
was ovo-lacto someone was vegan someone
didn't drink alchemy nye basically gave
up on any kind of food outings but I
didn't give up on all outings I just
didn't base it around food I base it on
something else
if it's someone is Sun sensitive then
you do things indoors I've taken them to
do puzzles indoors or whatever you can
you just have to think about it and it
doesn't mean that you're it's gonna be
the death of fun if you have to include
everybody you just may have to think a
little bit harder on making sure that
everyone feels welcome and again maybe
not everyone will show up but you
definitely got it try at least a pretty
good try on making sure that you're not
always excluding this one or two people
because it's too hard right that's
nothing that's it you want to send are
effective and if not what do you think
is the biggest pucker no definitely I
wish I could say all the hell the teams
at Google are effective we have
effective teams and not so effective
team is probably much like you the
biggest differentiator again is what we
found is that there are plenty of teams
that I work with I work with teams
internally on building their psyche
safety it's like safety communication is
the number one thing that I work with on
teams it's like how do you say things in
a way where again it I could say the
same thing as person X
and if I say it it's fine but a person X
says it it sets people off well what is
it about that right so good book for
this kind of thing is called Crucial
Conversations people heard of that book
it's great highly recommend it that's
one way to address it yeah yeah we're
not like sick it was not any better than
any other tech company well in some
respects might be yes okay thanks so
much I think it must be hard for you to
talk about you know having cancer in
front of a whole audience is that so
really appreciate I feel that you know
I'm a little safer and asking your
questions that might be even dumb here
um I think one of my struggles is that
just be nice it's kind of abstract in
general do you have any more concrete
specific practices like for that first
thing giving people a voice right is
there anything that we can emulate or
try out sure so there's many things you
can't one one manager that I know at
Google has everyone take yeah I know
this is not science space but has
everyone take myers-briggs for example
okay and marsh Briggs is good for it's
not based on science cuz it's a
personality test right but what it does
is that it shows people's preferences
and where they operate and so he kind of
knows like where people are so it's not
about being nice it's like okay like I
know she really prefers this kind of
work or framing questions in this way or
really likes data and then you just make
sure that when you have a meeting with
that person that you leave with data if
they were if that's their preference
right so that's one way to do it another
way to do it is to take these quick
there's a thing it's called through
colors and it's basically a free thing
you can have people take against the
same thing it shows work preferences and
again it's not based on science but it
does have a self-awareness element to it
and what it does is allows you to say
look I'm a blue I'm not a blue but I'm
just saying if I'm a blue in the true
colors world
I really value relationships above other
things so my one-on-ones with my blues
are completely different than my
one-on-ones with people that love date
okay if the people that love data
they're green in this model all right I
don't ask them how their weekend was
they didn't care anything it's not
because they're bad they just don't care
about that right they want to talk about
what do you want to talk about and my
blues we're talking about how was your
weekend how's your daughter how's this
how's that rose getting kicked out of
the interview room right
but with my greens it can be very good
because we're just talking about day to
day to day to data and we're out of
there right but again there's no cookie
cutter way to be a good leader you have
to I mean I don't want to go on a
preacher mode my dad was a preacher and
one of the things that always stuck with
me is that the greatest leader among you
will be a servant and he said the best
way is if you serve the needs of the
people that you lead they will follow
you anywhere
again I'm agnostic I'm just saying I
found that to be true my people again
I'm not the world's greatest manager by
any stretch but to different managers
and the VP's only it's like well your
people love you and it's like I don't do
anything secret right I just look at
their needs and I serve their needs and
make sure that they're fulfilled at work
with little things like that and then so
people I mean that really resonates with
people welcome thank you got about seven
minutes so far away so thank you very
much talk I just had a quick question
about you you spend a lot of time
talking about what makes teams great but
do you have any suggestions of how to
improve and like effectiveness between
teams these same principles apply yes I
mean again if it's if it's
cross-functional which I think your your
question is the number one thing with
cross-functional teams is what I tried
to tell my folks because again we have
in in Google and we have the classic
confrontation is SWE's software
engineers and essa Reese because that's
the research we are basically hey we're
in charge of production and SWE's always
want to change stuff right so it's like
sometimes the relationship is like this
but when I tell my folks when we're
faced with the SWE's is like look we all
care about quality we
do the best job they have a different
mission than ours but what I use is the
Stephen Covey example which is seek
first to understand and then be
understood if you do that generally that
will bring the level of conversation
down and say look these aren't evil
people over there they have a mission
they're just trying to get it through
and they need to get through before
Thanksgiving and with the sre hat on
you're saying no way we're pushing that
before Thanksgiving but it's like but we
have it okay our Dubois is if you put
there again it's just take that extra
step and say look if I was a swing on
that team I can see why it's really
really important to them so let's see if
we can reach some type of accommodation
doesn't mean you have to compromise your
principles but just going that extra
step and trying to understand them
rather than just say no way makes a big
difference in cross-functional projects
so outside of modeling these behaviors
and and you're talking with team members
about how they do the better I mean I'm
wondering how do you have any techniques
to like directly inculcate these kinds
of ideas you know within team members
outside of just modeling them I'm sorry
I missed the middle part where you said
to be on modeling do you have any
techniques for helping team members and
Colt inculcate this within themselves oh
okay well yeah that's a good question
yeah I mean what I always ask people is
this is one of those things where I do
these it's like the Jedi mind trick on
my one of my daughters right it's like
unless it's her idea it's never gonna
happen
right it's a C but it's the same kind of
thing hey Steve I notice said in that
last meeting there was a lot of people
kind of like leaning back when you were
talking about the production problem did
you notice that yeah how did you feel
about that if they feel fine I was fine
with it okay then maybe that's not the
moment to say you really need to fix
this but it's like if they come back and
say actually yeah I didn't feel great
about it and I was wondering if maybe
there's there's a long way or I want to
fix it and I go well you know there we
can work on that
if you're willing to write and then
let's bill on it and again plug for
steven covey are you seven Habits of
Highly Effective People with my people
for the people that want to and I need
with them outside my normal work and we
just say hey we chapter one let's talk
about it right and for people that want
to improve themselves give them a lot of
vehicles luckily at Google we have a
wide breadth of classes that are
available that I don't have to take it
all on right
there's other classes they can take but
I'm just saying here's a bunch of ideas
or here's some things to think about why
don't you try this next time and see how
you do but yeah definitely it there if
there are again you can't force it on
them but if they are wanting to
self-improve go out of your way to
provide the vehicle there was one here
and then we're good to you I'm sorry I
don't know who's first sorry okay I will
go first um so at Google you found
safety to be very important right within
the team how do you see that working in
other domains so not only software for
example back at the SWAT team or at the
police force yeah again police force on
the Patrol team it wasn't safe right
very safe at all in fact I felt very
unsafe on the SWAT team it was safe
because it was a different different
mission we found though obviously Google
isn't just a technical company right we
have financing legal and people
operations and a bunch of others and so
though their functions are technical at
all and yes like safety is still the
number one thing that they face and I
work with a lot of the finance folks and
legal folks on the store topic it does
it does we found that regardless of what
your function is that their company that
pyramid holds true okay over the years I
found that the method of building trust
within a team that really works for me
is like staying up till 2:00 I am fixing
outage with your teammates and know your
team needs to respect you and honestly
one way to build respect is is that a
technical progress it sounds like you
have it right however that's also not
sustainable right you can't be up at
2:00 a.m. every single time there's an
outage so the one way is like you've
done it once or twice you've written
Docs you train them your what you want
to do is be able to replicate yourself
to scale yourself that's the only way it
works so the way I do the way on this is
part of like my hundred and twenty
percent project right I have my normal
job I still have to get it done it was
great that you do speaking and stuff but
you suck you suck got it hasn't been
that I glad right but what I have is
built a fairly strong bench I have a
great TL and a great program manager and
if I'm not there my team runs as if I
was there right and that's what you want
to do as a manager you a leader you want
to be like a doctor you're always
working on the elimination of your own
position because that's the only way
then you can take on more teams and more
responsibilities if you personally
aren't up at 2:00 a.m. too often you're
not gonna be able to scale that right
we've got about a minute any other
questions and I'm available until I've
got an interview at 3:00 I'm available
we can grab coffee or talk outside it I
got a question question right here who
hasn't like right over here okay hey
sorry it one thing I've seen within our
organization is fear of risk mitigation
trickling down to the individual
contributor level and impacting that
psychological safety within the team I
wasn't sure if you had any insights on
that or does that be obviously everyone
wants you know you know as many 9s as
you can get and you know should not have
outages and customer you know facing
problems but how do you manage risk of
the company versus the ability to
innovate question so what when I'm
talking about risk and we're talking in
this context we're not talking about
product risk right if you have an SLA of
five nines or four nines or whatever
obviously you can't you can't change
that but when we're talking about when
we say risk we're talking about taking
personal risks risk at the interpersonal
level and those are the risks you can do
on a small scale team and it won't
the SLA s ellos yeah I'll be available
thank you so much for attending hope you
got something out of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
