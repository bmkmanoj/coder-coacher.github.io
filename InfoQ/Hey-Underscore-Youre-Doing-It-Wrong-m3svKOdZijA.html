the last talk of the day everybody
probably wants to go get a drink I want
to go get a drink is there after parties
does anybody know
all right cool thank somebody grab me
and take me to one so you can yell at me
for this talk so um this talk I
originally wanted to talk about lenses
in traversable yeah but it turned out
that um you know I've given a couple
similar talks um if you've seen me talk
at html5 Devcon before if I've spoken
about point free and type classes and
this is kind of a mixture of all that I
don't think I could have written a talk
about anything else because it's people
are still trying to get their heads
wrapped around this and and I guess I am
too and I don't want to go too far
without hitting the basics so pretty
much gonna talk about point free
programming and type classes all in the
context of underscore so yeah and I'm
gonna bash underscore like crazy you
guys not really not it's okay so I do
love underscore I think it's great um so
I'm not I'm not here to make fun of it
or say it's terrible or be like lodash
rules and you know it doesn't work on
note and things like that so I am here
to talk about functional programming and
I think that underscore does a terrible
job of saying functional you know it
says it's functional but it's not really
when you compare it to a real functional
language and you know I'll read blog
posts all the time on things like oh
yeah here's the functional way this
means I'm passing arguments around and
I'm really verbose and it's basically
procedural but that's what you know I
think the perception of functional
programming is and it's getting better
and better every year
but underscore is marketing themselves
saying that they have these these
functions and I want to examine that and
kind of take a close look at what you
would really do and compare that to what
underscore is doing so we could see what
it turns out you know it can be a
beautiful paradigm
all right so the agenda is currying
composition functors and random stuff so
if you already know all this stuff I
won't be offended if you leave we're
gonna go over it okay so Kareem I just
put that in there to wake you guys up
because it's like the last talk of the
day and it's really exciting background
so occurring is just a function that
takes keeps returning a new function
until it gets all its arguments and we
could look at that a little bit closer
here so with this function add I should
point out these type signatures are just
comments um we've been working on a type
parser but haven't gotten too far so
with ADD we take X and we return a new
function that takes the Y and then we
add them together and you can call it we
have add three and when we call add with
three we say that's partially applying
it with three then we get a new function
back and that function we can call with
four we'll get seven and we can call it
again with five and get eight so it's
like it made us a new function we just
gave it an argument and we got a new
function back and then we have this like
weird but looking thing if we try to
call it all together and that's not cool
so woojae s has an awesome function
called Auto curry and in Auto curry you
basically you can just keep throwing
arguments at a function and it'll just
keep returning you a function until it
gets all its arguments so you can see
there in the bottom there just like
parentheses and you know any combination
you can think of and you still get a
function back till it gets all its
arguments so we've just stolen that
function and extended the function
prototype with it
so now with add you can just slap Auto
curry at the end and when we call add
three there we get a new function back
that's just waiting for its last
argument and it works just like before
except we don't have that weird but
looking thing it's just you can call it
all together so awesome oh I should also
say just raise your hand or walk up to
the mic if you have any
questions and if you're taking the class
in a couple days you'll probably see a
couple of these slides over and over
again so but there'll be way more in
depth okay
so here's another example full name full
name takes three arguments here so we
can call it with Hunter s Thompson and
we get the name out or we can call it
just with the first and so we get this
new function called Bill something and
that's waiting for its middle and last
and if we give it that we get Bill Cosby
out so um and here's another one we can
call Bill something with just the middle
name and we'll get Bill Clinton if we
give it the last so you can pretty much
keep giving it arguments piecemeal if
you want there's just an example of like
how you can use it to get a feel for it
so why would we do this well all right
so here's a function called modulo and
if you've ever used modulo before you
know you pretty much you're going to
call it with two I think that's what I
do
so we can make a new function down there
called is odd
just by partially applying modulo with
the number two and it comes out with
zero it's even and one if it's odd so
it's true or false so that's that's a
pretty cool application of it we've got
a new function that's pretty useful just
by partially applying modulo and here's
another example we've got this function
filter and all it's doing is wrapping
the native filter but if we call it with
is odd you know it runs and if we
partially apply it with is odd we've got
a whole new function back and that's
pretty useful it always get the odd odd
numbers out of in the array but what's
crazy here is is odd is partially
applied itself right so you have a
partially applied is odd with a
partially applied filter and we've got a
third function out of that that's really
useful so the stuff is you know you're
building new functions by giving
functions arguments so let's look at an
example of that and here's where we're
going to examine the
SCOR way so let's take a second to
digest this so you have a we're going to
call this with first two letters here
that's our function name and it'll just
run through an array and return us the
first two letters back can everybody see
the commented out one is that cool so
looking at this we've got a function
that takes words we're going to map over
those words and for every word we're
going to grab the first two so I don't
know an underscore the two is optional
but we're going to pretend it's not here
so we we can rewrite this in a way more
functional way let's leave the top one
for reference there so here if we if we
just examine this if if this function
took its arguments in the other order we
could partially apply it with two and
that'd be pretty useful because then
it'd be a function just waiting for its
word and if we just take that word off
we could put it in place of this whole
function wrapper here since it is a
function waiting and waiting for a word
so it's that make sense you guys with me
we've just flipped the arguments and now
this is a function since it's partially
applied it'll just get each of these
words and run and actually turns out
that map if we flip this then this would
be a function these words and these
words kind of match up and we can just
take this off now it's a function
waiting for words so there we go
and that's all we needed so um it's it's
pretty cool with this currying and
partial application thing if underscore
did that we could have just done this
and it's pretty expressive we could say
hey I just want to map the first two and
turns out it's not specific to letters
at all and we don't need letters there
so we're just going to I know map the
first two here and so I could I could
look at this and say you know I've got
words words
word word and I've got this whole
ceremony around here I don't even really
need any of that I could just kind of
call this in line to be honest it reads
really well to me so map the first two
of these things and that'll work with
anything so there's just an example
probably kind of straw Manish but I just
wanted to show you guys if you know
underscore was a little bit more
functional we could do that so um
let's give us a point here on our normal
functional style here for for being able
to remove all the data and be completely
data generic there so it's reusable and
let's actually get another point just to
drive at home that uh you know there's
way less code on the screen so it's more
maintainable and they're just because it
didn't even need to exist in the first
place
all right so underscores API prevents
you from currying because the arguments
are backwards so that's kind of a bummer
so yeah there's currying it's got you
can make generic functions it's like a
like a little function factory and you
can get pretty pretty terse and concise
with your definitions and it's good for
a composition which we're about to talk
about does anybody have any questions
about that before I go on because it's
kind of important all right cool all
right so composition um composition is a
let's see here well it's in underscore
so that's great
underscore has composed and how many
here do you guys use compose here's a
show of hands how many people use
compose alright we've got almost a hand
Hey all right like for how many people
here use chain can you raise your hand
if you use chain hey like everybody
alright um well yeah chain is mentioned
like so much throughout the
documentation and compose is mentioned
in like the release notes and where it's
defined so let's kind of go over what
compose is so here you're pretty much
going to stick two functions together to
get a new function you're just composing
them and it will run both functions
right to left let's look at that little
closed
so here so if you want to write a really
really terribly inefficient way to get
the last element and array you could do
something like this so we get this last
function that it takes X's that's our
array and we're going to reverse them
and grab the first one so that'll be a
good way to get the last but we can
write that in another way we could write
it like this which is just the
composition of reverse and first and
there's two well let's see how it works
real quick boom so we get the last
element because it reversed sit and then
grabs the first one so it almost runs
right to left passing the output of one
function into the input of the next and
you can use more than two functions but
we'll keep it simple and stick with two
so there's there's some key differences
here in last on the top version we
actually mention X's of course in a
different way so we're referring to
arguments and data on that one and the
one under it were not at all we're just
saying glue these two functions together
and also in the top one we're specifying
we're actually baking in an order of
evaluation for JavaScript JavaScript
can't evaluate it in a different way
it's like I have to read this top line
first and then the next line but in our
composed version it's a declarative it
just says alright well you know some
other process is going to handle this so
we're not going to bake in an order of
evaluation even though we know it goes
right to left and it passes the output
in the next JavaScript is like okay
something else is going to handle this
and it's it's a way more declarative
higher-level way of programming leads to
things like parallelization and stuff
like that if that's a word alright so
here's another example just so we can
wrap our heads around compose so we have
this word cap a word count function it
takes a string and splits on the spaces
and then we're going to grab the length
and so it'll tell us the length of the
words and it's the same way to do it now
notice here
going to partially apply split so split
takes the spaces and it's still waiting
for its string and so when we call word
counting with the string that finishes
split and runs it and then the output of
split goes into length so partial
application / careening you know curried
function can be partially applied they
kind of play together with composition
because you want to just kind of make it
so your your data flows through this
this kind of chain of functions so it's
like chain but backwards and we don't
have to wrap and unwrap data explicitly
so here's a here's a cool example of us
you're actually able to unnecessary so
here it goes
category theory shoutout to John bender
so um there's the inaccurate definition
of what category theory is it's a
basically a mathematics around center
around transforming values the way I
would say it uh in the terms that I
understand so we've got a couple of
here's an example all right so these two
circles on the Left you're the one on
the Left them on the middle they're both
you know type a that's type person in
this example and the last one is the
type B which is a I guess it's like
breakfast foods and gnf are functions so
if G and F are pure functions
every time I call G with John I'll get
Mary like every time no matter what
every time I called G with Mary I get
John so you're just kind of connecting
the dots there and if I call you know G
then F with Mary I'm just going to get
eggs you can just kind of follow the way
the lines go and we say we can just
compose those and we can just cut out
the middleman and that's really useful
and there's a whole set of you know
formulas and and things you can look up
and learn that's actually applicable day
to day
this is not like math Suzanne
programming stop using math and
programming stuff I mean it's just you
know useful guiding light that you can
be like oh look at this I'm just
composing these two things it's like a
formula and I can use this to help me so
yeah that little dot there should have
mentioned is the composition operator
and this stuff can get really complex
but it's really just connecting the dots
at the end of the day and you know
there's there's some cool stuff down the
bottom it's demonstrating associativity
or it doesn't matter if you group the G
and F or the gene H first you're always
going to get the same results so that's
pretty cool so let's look at an example
of composition see here okay so we're
going to compare it against underscores
chain because I think that's the
de-facto way to do this and everybody
seems to use chain so let's let's take a
look at this compared to the composed
version of it so we're going to redefine
sorted phones here and we're gonna say
alright well chain just wraps our users
so that we can call dot on it because we
love calling dot on things and value
just unwraps it well so the only
important stuff is right here really
let's grab that I'm just going to
compose and since it's backwards we're
going to compose the sort by and then
the map I don't know I should learn BIM
alright so there we go now that's a
little bit off the screen online but you
can see it's that's we're done that's it
we don't need the you know the function
wrapper and all that stuff I should have
left it for reference but what's cool is
since we're doing functional programming
and we could we could see that we've got
a function that takes some argument and
we're just calling dot phone functions
and
we're called dot on it when we make a
dot function call that dot will use our
fancy auto curry here and that's just
going to take a property in an object
and we'll just use the bracket so um
there we go so now we can actually just
call dot on phone and dot on our signup
date that kind of cleans it up quite a
bit like bob ross up here or something
there we go this isn't that lovely
there's not a beautiful beautiful way to
clean this up thank you thank you so yes
there's there's a composition it kind of
gets rid of the wrapping and unwrapping
and the ceremony of the functions you
can see all this extra stuff is gone so
let's get back to our lovely pointing
system so we were at three to zero we're
gonna give it another point for being
completely data generic once again in a
different way and then um let's see
let's uh if you looked at it it was
actually um let's take another peek here
we've got this is kind of programming in
a declarative almost like a formula
we're switching our mentality from you
know the sequence of events back to this
kind of we can we can actually derive
properties from that and I think that's
really important and so let's give us
another point for that guy and another
one I was going to give me another one
but oh all right so this is what this is
what our code at loop occur looks like
that's where I work we're always hiring
come find me if you want to write this
crazy stuff and almost everything is
using compose so I just wanted to point
that out like it's a really insane it's
a cornerstone of what we're doing and
this stuff really works this is straight
up production code poor clients right
but here we go
okay so underscore promotes promotes
chain is the function of choice and you
know a lot of people tend to use that
over
composition which is a shame because
composition has a whole math backing it
and you know pretty powerful okay
composition so you build new functions
from other ones you can have generic
programs it's really high-level coding
it's you know totally declarative not
really specifying sequence and you got
the math backing you okay on to the
heavy stuff take a break for a second
all right
are you guys still with me I know it's
like five something hey what's up the
question is can we compare performance
I'd love for somebody to do some serious
benchmarks I I don't care about
performance I've just been writing code
ignorant Lee it's just two three was
that yeah but it's it's totally I mean
it's been working fine for us and and I
haven't had any real problems so what's
up can I do what and JavaScript oh no
you can't do Taylor recursion but we're
using a set of a you know abstract
functions that don't really I mean they
might wrap loops or something in the
background but we're not doing an
explicit Taylor call recursion and I
don't think there's a need to do that I
think you can use you know patterns to
capture the recursion or higher-order
functions
all right into the functors okay so this
alright who knows how to solve this
problem this is you're trying to call it
plus one you have an array a once an X
but it doesn't have an X it has an array
so what do we do how do we solve this
yeah you want to you want to run over
you want to iterate over the list or do
you say with Lisp oh we lift
oh yeah that's way better okay well
you're at you're way too advanced all
right so anyway we're going to iterate
over this array and we could just we
just map map the function over it and we
get a four back so so I know a lot of
people probably have done this you know
you guys use map right who uses map
anybody's alright great awesome
so we're all using map and maps great
and and that solves this problem well if
you look at a little bit closer yes it's
like we are lift
this plus one into the array if you look
over at the kind of grayed out it's like
we put it inside there and we're running
the function on it and then it comes
back out as a four and if we remove the
syntactic sugar which I just realized
that that's probably not going to work
but let's pretend it does if you give it
multiple arguments it makes an array if
you give it one it makes a blank one
with that length but anyway so we
removed the syntactic sugar and you know
it's the same thing so could we do this
with any object let's see is map more
abstract than just working on arrays and
we certainly can so let's let's talk
about that all right
so how would it work well if you wanted
to map a function over my objects what
probably happened is it would kind of
take what's out you know from inside my
object and pass it into the function and
I could run any function over my object
and it would actually you know open it
up run the function on the contents and
then close it back up for me and that's
exactly the intuition you should have
when you're thinking of map I'm going to
map this function over over this object
it's like I put my value in a bubble and
I have to open up the bubble and run the
function on it and close it back up so
let's see what this looks like a little
closer so we're going to add you know
add one to that three there and if my
object is just a constructor you know we
can and we just arbitrarily pick Val
just to refer to the value inside it
well if we define map four it would look
just like the comment up there we're
just going to run the function over the
Val so this is kind of a distinct
difference of how we treat types in
functional programming from the objects
we're really going to look at you know
the objects is containers or contexts
for our values and then we can use them
to dynamically dispatch our functions on
them so we're going to look at this a
little bit closer but basically we get
to define map on anything and by
defining map on object
object becomes a functor all it is is an
interfaces you know if you define map
you have a functor okay so let's look at
some actual useful practical
applications of this so up here we have
our our friend maybe and the very top
line there we're going to map plus one
over our maybe and it's just going to
add one to it and the middle line it
says maybe null and it actually doesn't
do anything it just ignores it and
that's the behavior of maybe maybe says
I might have this value or I might not
have this value and if I don't don't
even run the function just return me the
maybe back and we can just define this
really easily by saying if you've got a
value run it if you don't don't
so that's a pretty cool thing it's
basically the null check but abstracted
into a functor so if you have a knob
have a value let's say a number or an
object or anything and you put it inside
a maybe you basically are forced to map
over it you can't just run your function
on your value anymore it's inside the
maybe so you have to map over that just
like we saw with the list and that gives
you some kind of like dynamic type
safety that's really interesting to me
we'll look at that a little bit more so
here's another one this is a either and
the way either works is it kind of takes
two parameters one the one on the Left
would be its first parameter would be
it's a default value and its second one
is is the value that we're going to use
so if it's there so the top line there
we're going to map +1 over that either
because it has that that second value
it's going to use that one so we get
either 1 &amp;amp; 3 because it added 1 to that
2 and then on the second line since it
doesn't have its its value on the right
it's going to just use its default its
first argument you guys see that is that
being kind of confusing now all right
Zoe if you if you look at either as a
left and a right and you call it left
argument it's default and it's right is
the one that's going to get given to it
it'll actually use the right one if it
has it
and it won't if it'll just use the
default so it's an abstraction over
default values almost or you could use
it to do pure error checking stuff but
this is kind of how you'd implement that
you'd say if I have my right value just
run the function on it and if I don't
run it on the left value and so I get
defaults so I also wanted to point out
there's all this promise stuff going on
and everybody's freaking out about
promises well if you just suggested that
promises are functors and all you have
to do is map something over it that Ajax
get posts you know if that returns a
promise I'm just going to map populate
table over that eventual value you know
I don't really want to get too far into
this but it's pretty kick-ass like it's
the intuition is there I don't need to
learn about then and when and on and all
the different libraries I can just map
over it and it's a unified API yes okay
so let's look at an example here all
right it's 526 let's make that make this
happen let's make this count all right
so here um we're gonna get some random
assitive up here and we've got our
function let's our program look at this
so update greeting hTML is going to take
the current user we're going to call get
greeting first because that's how
compose works and that's going to pass
the user into get greeting and call dot
name on it you guys remember dot from
the other example it's pretty cool um
and then we're gonna concatenate GML of
our div after you get that string so
what happens when we don't have a
current user the user isn't logged in
yet well you know how do you even know
check up here we just saw that with this
thing called maybe so let's let's say
I'm going to put my current user in a
maybe and I actually can't run
this you know this function on a my
maybe anymore it doesn't take a maybe it
takes a user so what I have to do is map
over it so let's just map this function
over that and I'm done and none of my
program changed um and that's pretty
awesome right so so all I've done is say
I don't know if I have this view user or
not let's just wrap it or maybe a map
over it uh let's say our boss comes back
he's like you guys it's missing the
whole Welcome banner you know if they're
not logged in it doesn't say anything
well we could say well why don't we use
either we'll say either and then we'll
just make some kind of you know blankie
there we go and now that says welcome
blankie so that's that's you know we've
changed the value going into our app
this is the calling code this this is
our app up here you know from here to
there
and this is just the the caller there so
and notice that this doesn't mention
that data you know we've been we spent
half this talk just removing data from
our app and just gluing functions
together and partially applying them and
we're not really making any references
to it and now this data that doesn't
exist in our app is getting wrapped in
making our app work differently how
crazy is that that's like you know
really powerful so I just wanted to
point that out and if you know this user
wasn't there yet let's say they're
coming from the database and you know
we've got this promise there it would
work exactly the same way I just want to
throw promises and they're so cool
alright so there's that let's give us
more points and we get to eight now I
don't get it
okay so underscore explicitly prevents
extending map it even checks to see if
you defined map watch your object and
then it's like now about the native map
so it's funny that it does that check
and if it has a map it actually has to
map match the native one so if you look
at the map to find in underscore it's
going to work on arguments objects and
arrays but you know we'd have to get in
there and
with it to change it and here you know
it's just a functor interface I should
be able to define map as a functor so
that's not very functional at all it's a
bummer all right so that's a functors
it's not just map there's reduced
there's compose even there's a type
class for that you can do all sorts of
great stuff and let's see you've got
there's formulas associated with map
that you can drive and use and the whole
functor laws and that dynamic tape
safety we were talking about if I know
of values going into my app and it may
or may not be there
or it'll eventually be there in the case
of a promise I could just wrap that and
uh maybe or a promise or whatever and
the rest of my app is forced to deal
with it because it can't get to the
value without mapping over it and that's
crazy awesome that forces you guys to be
like oh well all right let's map over
this and it just works I don't I don't
have to make those mistakes anymore um
all right that's pretty much my talk so
in conclusion
um clocking in pretty early here because
it's some time for talks
so in conclusion um I was going to say a
thing or two about you know I think
underscore could be a lot more
functional and we do love it we do use
it I you know I think there's other
libraries that are just as good but you
know it's great to have a standard and I
wish we had a standard library that we
could use for functional programming and
we started one called score under just
to be cheeky because it reverses the
argument anyway oh uh yeah so if you
check out loop occurs github there
should be a score under there if there's
not a put it up tonight but I was hoping
we'd get some more open source effort
because I think you know next time I'd
love to talk about traversable and
lenses and you know I think this point
free in these type class talks are great
and I hope more people get into it and I
hope we build a bigger community because
it's really small right now and clients
are like can't believe you gave me this
app this is crazy
so does anybody have any questions I
just want to shoot the crab because we
got some time what's up okay so like
what what should the API be if you were
going to create a that's a really good
question um as a matter of fact so so we
use it's weird when you're programming
functionally you kind of want the world
to be a function like everything to be a
function and so we've found ourselves
wrapping the entire array built in array
stuff and string stuff and all it does
is auto curry and put its argument last
its array or string last and it works
fine I mean it might be terribly
unperformed but it might I mean it seems
to be alright for me so I shouldn't be
saying these things um now it's been
fine it's in production code there big
clients and everybody's happy so it's no
big deal and we end up with really small
maintainable and parallelizable programs
so it's it's really cool we usually make
mobile apps so you can do that on that
so yeah I would to answer your question
about what kind of functions would you
like to see I think I think just a few
standard you know like map filter reduce
and things like that like those those
are great and the array and string
extensions to be able to program
functionally and a composed that works
correctly because the order of
evaluation in JavaScript it kind of
messes up a formula or two for you
even though it's a so associative you
can group as many functions as you want
inside compose but it doesn't actually
evaluate them in the right order when
you give it multiple arguments and stuff
so that's interesting
oh so um I originally actually started
doing score under by taking underscore
running through each of the functions
flipping the arguments and calling Auto
Curry on him and that was that was kind
of a I thought it would be cool because
under underscore could keep updating and
it would just like change it but uh then
we ended up using loadout
tweaking that and now we're just kind of
I don't know where it is it's out there
put the I don't think it's more than in
the normal library just all we did is
get in there and mess with lo - so it's
the same size of lo - at this point I
love that I'm talking about lo - even
though it's an underscore talk alright
um so is anybody going to that class on
Wednesday
all right cool hey what's going on how
did you oh man I got to talk to you
after this did you have a question over
there that's a good question you know
what I haven't I should I should totally
troll him I mean none no I think the
thing is that you know in JavaScript
you're going to get these like it looks
right to put your your you know function
last like that's what looks right to
people and so I think when we're like oh
well this is functional and you know
this is is object-oriented you know like
it's not it's not functional yeah this
is so I mean maybe it is I guess it is
technically but I think it could be a
lot better as all I'm saying
and so I should write but I think a lot
of people would probably be like
currying is too confusing without type
signatures which is why we add type
signatures all the time in comments I've
got a thing or two to say about that but
I don't want to waste too much time so
but anyway I think that's all I got so
far anybody else all right I'll see you
guys later
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
