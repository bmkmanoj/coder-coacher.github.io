this episode of dart tips we made it to
classes class-based object-oriented
IMing is an extremely common and widely
deployed programming model and dart has
first-class support for classes and
inheritance classes is a big topic so
today we start with an intro and a look
at fields let's get started
when we say dart is a class-based
object-oriented programming language we
mean it everything in dart is an object
everything is an instance of a class and
all classes descend from object dart is
a single inheritance language which
means that class can inherit from or
extend from only one other class a quick
primer on classes and objects the class
defines how objects look and how they
behave a class is like an idea and to
turn that idea into reality you need an
object an object is like a physical
thing something you can create from
class and manipulate on its own for
example think of a class like the
blueprint for all sports cars in an
object like a specific Ferrari with a
license plate 1 2 3 4 red paint and a
current speed of 80 miles per hour in
this way we see that an object a
specific thing is an instance of a class
a conceptual idea classes can be
extended to define more specialized
classes a class hierarchy is a tree-like
relationship between high-level abstract
concepts like vehicle and more specific
concepts like car and then even more
specific ideas like a sports car a more
specific class inherits from or extends
from a more general class the top level
of the dart class hierarchy is object
that is all objects are instances of the
class object the dart SDK ships with
classes for everything from strings and
numbers to dates and durations to
abstract concepts like type and object
but of course you can make your own
classes here's an example this class is
named car it has two fields pink color
and is running fields are used to hold
the state of an object this car class
has three methods turn on turn off and
check key methods are like functions
that are bound to an object and they can
access an object state methods change or
expose the state of an object for
example the turn-on method checks first
if there is a key present and if so
starts the car to create an object from
a class you need to instantiate it
here's an example notice the use of new
to create a new instance of the car
class
the object is assigned to the variable
name sweet ride you can now call methods
on the object let's dive into fields or
instance variables here is a reminder of
the car class with its two fields all
instance variables have an implicit
getter this means that even though it
looks like you're accessing a field
directly you're actually going through a
generated getter method here's an
example any non final instance variable
has an implicit setter in other words if
the field is non final it will have a
setter method generated for it one of
the reasons I love dart is that it does
not promote excessive generation of
setters and getters of course you always
have the option to make your own getters
and setters let's look at how to do this
and why dard wants to make it easy for
you to evolve your api and help you
start simple and grow over time a simple
way to start is to just use fields
here's an example let's imagine over
time the class evolved to include a
field for the engine we can determine if
the engine is running by asking the new
engine field
this makes the is engine running field
redundant however if we remove is engine
running we break existing users of the
code we want to change the
implementation of the class without
breaking backwards compatibility this is
exactly why getters and setters were
introduced here's how I use them notice
how the getter and setter method names
are preceded by the words get and set a
getter has no parameters and returns a
value and the setter has one parameter
and does not return a value here's how
you use the new car class looks familiar
right
using setters and getters is transparent
to the user of the class this allows you
to evolve your API over time without
breaking existing users the DAR ways to
start simple and scale up as you go
classes are a big topic there's much
more cool stuff to cover in future
episodes for example we'll cover
constructors inheritance operator
overriding and much more thanks for
