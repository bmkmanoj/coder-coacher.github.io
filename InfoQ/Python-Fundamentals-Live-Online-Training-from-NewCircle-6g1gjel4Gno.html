teacher of the Python fundamentals and
pro django courses at new circle and
today we'll do a short sample
demonstration we'll go through one
chapter very rapidly much more rapidly
than in in real life if we were doing
this online course we'll just go through
I'll show you a little bit what an
online class looks like and hopefully
you'll see that it's very fun and
engaging so today we'll be looking at
chapter 12 of the Python fundamentals
course you see I expanded here the
sidebar and you can actually look at the
different chapters of the Python
fundamentals course so there's a lot of
very interesting things we obviously
start with you know basic variables
types and things like that but once we
get into the sort of interesting
components that Python allows you to
work with or play with well then we get
into really interesting things so
regular expressions is one very
interesting subject personally one of my
favorite subjects I'm really glad that
we go we we explore that in the course
so let me just close that sidebar so
regular expressions it is a bit of a big
subject it takes a little bit of time to
master although it's extremely useful I
would imagine that any developer has
either heard about it knows this all by
heart or you should be really interested
in this it's it's it's quite a subject
extremely briefly regular expressions
allow you to do to search through text
or search and replace through text but
in a smart fashion if we could say so
smart in the sense that you don't have
to exactly tell the computer or you know
program the computer to search for some
very very specific letters so it doesn't
have to be a word it could be Oh
followed by some characters or some
characters a certain number of times
let's say the letter A three times in a
row or a more typical example would be
white space and maybe there's some
spaces or tabs and you don't know you
know either one and it may be the tab
character maybe the three times repeated
four times repeated and you're looking
for these blocks of text are kind of
variable and dynamic doing this with
basic find and replace or find
functionality would be very annoying
you'd have to look at I'm looking for a
tab okay if I see a tab I'm looking for
another tab and it's just it gets very
messy regular expressions are a great
way very concise way of expressing what
you're looking for in searching and out
and also actually you can replace these
sort of dynamic things that you find and
replace them with other bits so let's
look at this chapter again this is a
brief introduction in an online class we
take a lot of time together to go
through and obviously there's it's very
interactive so we talk and there's
questions going back and forth but
you'll get an idea so the chapter itself
doesn't go into the syntax of regular
expressions there is a lot of content on
this subject on the Internet you can
there's even there are even websites
where you can practice your regular
expressions foo your knowledge or learn
more about it but but basically let's
assume that you have an idea of what
regular expressions are and if you don't
you can just think of regular
expressions again as you're just
searching for strings or sort of like
magical strings but let's just say that
you're looking for some strings so just
as in the search you have a big chunk of
text and you're looking for a small
chocolate text so you know the the
needle in a haystack analogy so in
Python there is a module so in the
course we'll see of course a lot of
modules
this is a built-in module so if you have
Python you should have access to this
module should as in you have access to
this module absolutely and the module
name is very short is just re for
regular expressions so if I go into my
terminal which is on also you know
always useful to just try out some
things let me import the module there
you go no errors that means that it's
there I can just type the module name
and see that it was really important and
the module exports or gives you access
to a few methods will be just looking at
the very basic search method and so if
you're looking at the documentation you
can always google Python and regular
expressions and the documentation will
go through the syntax so let's just go
see what search does so search takes two
basic arguments and it's the pattern so
this is what you're looking for this is
the this is the needle and the string is
the whole data set so the whole string
that you're looking to in which to find
this needle so that's the haystack and
we see that the the match or the search
methods they don't return they return a
regular expressions object as you can
see here so it's not an object that you
can just regular expression won't say
yes I found it or it didn't find it just
return this object and if you want to
look into this object through other
methods but we can actually just very
basically let's not let's just this keep
this extremely simple let's just look at
is this string or an expression a
regular expression present in a certain
data set so this is extremely basic
let's just do our search and my pattern
will be the later the letter 8 so in the
string just just one single letter and
let me let's say type in
sentence so so this should not work so
as you probably remember in the console
and an interactive console if there is
no result or you see there serve like an
emptiness between those two lines this
is because the result is none it's a bit
hard to see when typing like this it's
not clear has the previous method
returned anything or not but we can also
we can obviously just test this and just
type in research it is is none so that's
kind of a question that you're asking
and yet Python the same yes this is true
so it is actually known so so the search
method is returning nothing because the
a pattern or just the a string is not
present very obviously as we can see in
sentence if we have searched for e the
letter e let's just remove this none now
yeah we do get an object back so just
testing for the presence or the absence
of this object is already it's not ready
some useful information we can already
it ready indicates to us if if it's
present or not it's kind of a boolean
interesting information so this is the
super absolute most basic way of but
it's it's enough to do a regular
expression search sometimes you just
want to know if something is there or
not you don't need more information like
where it's located you don't want to
replace you just want to know yes or no
is it there so that's kind of enough to
get us started during this course we
have access to some labs and the chapter
on regular expressions is is just like
other chapters it has a lab just as it
says right there in the chapter we will
be looking at a file called complexity
one file utility Y and this file is
available from the different lab files
which are available through your
personal space on the new circle website
so I'll go ahead and download this file
as a zip
I will take this and I will put this on
my desktop and there you go
so I got that file let me open that yes
in TextWrangler
so this is what the file looks like now
again during the course this is I'll
explain but very briefly we use dark
tests in during the course and duct
tests are very useful learning tools
it's a very useful learning - it's much
more than a learning tool but we use it
as a useful learning tool and the way
that it works is that at the top of the
file so this is the the lab file let me
just move myself into the corner so at
the at the top of the file you see that
there's a there's a huge comment and
this is all commented out because of the
the three double quotes so this is a
nerd code we could just write anything
right it would work but this is actually
it's interesting because it on one hand
it's it's this big string that's in
there not doing anything on the other
hand inside of the string in the doc
test you see
command prompt and and actually there is
some code already written there it looks
like pasta Python and it is Python and
you see here that in the in this command
prompt that somebody wrote there are
some function calls to grep hmm what's
grep and there's actually some output so
I'm sorry so there is actually so output
just right here so so somebody called
grep in a command line and then we'll
probably Python print it out the result
of this method so so what's happening
what is this dark test what is this all
about well it's a very useful way a dark
test of testing for a behavior of which
so you're supposing that this behavior
will happen exactly the way that you're
describing it so it's interesting it's
it's it's live code that's inert
but the idea is you as a developer you
you you want it so that when you call
grep like this with these arguments you
want the output to be this that's your
goal okay so that's that's kind of the
block of code this is how it should
happen and at the bottom of the file
will this file doesn't do much it only
calls doc tests and it just says go
ahead doc test just through your magic
so actually if we run this file so it
has these just actually these two lines
will be the only lines were the three
what the if will be called so if I call
this file bunch of errors appear
what are those errors what's happening
well actually doc test and just as we
saw Python went into this nerd code and
read it and it tried to recreate these
same steps so it also did an import of
string I owe it also declared input data
which is equal to this string i/o object
which was enunciated with this content
this huge string and then as you can
read in the dark test it called
grep so this is the regular expression
function that we have to write this is
the lab this is what we'll be doing
together so the lab expects you the
students with help to write this
function grep and this function should
return the exact same content as printed
here so during the lab you don't change
this part this you leave this is kind of
the question if we could say that what's
important is that here in this code or
here we'll be declaring new things and
we'll be writing code together and our
goal is that when Python runs our code
the output of the code that will write
or you'll write as students is the exact
same as
test so let's look at what's happening
again just in the in the console so we
can kind of look at this we'll see
there's a bunch of asterisk so it's kind
of easy to just look at one specific
case so you see here there's a there's
an error which is kind of interesting
it's it's useful to start usually from
the bottom when there's a big trace back
of an error so at the very bottom of
this this asterisk bound block you see
name error name grep is not defined and
you see so going a little bit up that it
tried to call grep input data with the
HTTP string so going through the code
grep input data HTTP we see that this is
the line that python try to cook tried
to call and we haven't declared any
function called grep so python just
stopped there it said I can't call grep
it doesn't exist what is this crazy
notion of a grep function so let's just
stop out let's just begin to define you
know to do this lab together and let's
just create the grep function so let's
define a grip function let's even
suppose that we have no clue of what
grep will be getting into its argument
as arguments so let's just do as grep as
if grep you know wasn't able to receive
any argument and let's just actually do
an empty function that doesn't do
anything it so passes like nothing grep
is the most inert function you could
have let's try let's try running the
duck test again and you see at the very
bottom of the dog test it says five
failures and we can actually see that so
so there's 5 errors and this is actually
the number of times that graph is called
in the duck test but basically there are
5 mistakes at least 5 mistakes you have
to you have to you have to solve so
let's run this code again follows here
okay so let's just go up a little bit so
here's where I called file utility N and
again there's a bunch of mistakes and a
bunch of estimation but that's okay
we'll just
go calmly through this one problem at a
time now you see here now there's a new
error grep takes no arguments while two
arguments were given so that's
interesting and so you see what we're
already progressing so the grep function
exists Python was able to call it only
as you already know when declaring an
function Python the number of arguments
must match there are ways around this
but basic idea is this so we can
continue on kind of answering error by
error and and solving our problems we
can also look at the code and to see
what it does so you see here that we
declare a string io object and a string
I object is an interesting it's a file
like string so it's as if you you were
creating a file sort of in midair and
you were creating this object that
exactly as a file object that it's
returned when you call the open the
built-in open function you usually read
or write or seek from a file like object
well string IO is a quick way to create
a file like object without having to
have a file so you can just declare here
right here what the what this virtual
file will contain so as you see we we
create this file virtual file with this
content which for those that are working
that are used to working with web
servers you'll see that this is actually
a log of web access so this is like a
typical Apache access log so it just
says that a browser connected and then
it went to the /url and then it went to
slash printers etc so this is a log just
as we were we're reading an Apache
access log and we're just assigning this
to the input data variable and you see
that grep we see we just understand it
kind of reverse engineering this code
the slab is that grep takes two
arguments so input data which is the
haystack and the second argument is just
a needle so it's return so it's taking
an HT
so that's the string that we're probably
looking for and of course you can see
that HTTP repeats quite a few times so
two three times so it repeats actually
it repeats much more than that because
it repeats you right here so it repeats
just a bunch of times and you see that
grep returns a list so this is these are
the square brackets and the audio square
bracket is just right here so this is
closing in square bracket this is
opening square bracket and in between we
see that these are this the individual
lines so you see that there's this is
one line and this is another line and
this is another line and grep is
returning these individual lines so just
well I can already start thinking about
this so grep takes in a file like object
that's one piece of information the
second thing is that it probably splits
the content using it splits them on
lines because as you remember and we
talked about in the course we talked
about this but but a new line is just a
character just like a new space or a tab
so it will split on those create
separate lines probably in the list and
then we'll go through using the regular
expressions at the regular expression
that we're passing to grab in this case
HTTP and c4 which line there is an HTTP
and then it will return those lines and
for those lines were there's no HTTP
well it won't do anything and that's
really what grep does so we here one use
of grep here and then we see another use
of grep and then continues on and we can
actually we're adding more and more
things we're adding actually an inverse
option and so forth so hopefully this is
a gives you a small and appealing
preview of what the online course looks
like obviously we take more time to go
through the material and its interactive
because everybody gets - we all get to
talk and to ask questions of one another
and of course I'm here to answer a lot
of questions so so hopefully
I will see you soon in the Python or a
Django class and have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
