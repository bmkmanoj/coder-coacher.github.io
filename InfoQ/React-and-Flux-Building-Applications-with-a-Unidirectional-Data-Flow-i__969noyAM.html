a with Jing Chen and we both work at
Facebook we're software engineers there
and we're here to talk about flux and
react and how we use a application
architecture that has a singular to a
single Direction data flow and how that
cleans up a lot of our code we've built
things with flux ranging from very small
little widgets to some of the largest
web applications that we know of things
that our revenue critical at Facebook
and so flux has scaled with us to do
pretty much anything that we throw at it
and has done it really well
so we wanted to share some of that with
you there is a there's an available
speaker deck if you would like to
download that or follow along online and
there's also a new github repo for flux
that we are open sourcing today so
there's also I know there's the hash
tags and these hash tags are great to
share on Facebook or maybe some other
social network that you know about so
these are recommended just to keep
everybody in sync on the back Channel so
without further ado let's do an overview
of what we're going to talk about first
we'll talk about flux and reacts and
sort of what they are on a general level
and then Jing will take us on a deep
dive into stores stores are the data
layer in flux and we'll talk about how
they work
I'll go over an example application and
and then I'll and then we'll wind it up
at the end with some advanced concepts
and talk about where a future where flux
is headed in the future so without
further ado I'd like to introduce Jing
Chen the original author of flux
thanks ville
alright so a couple of you guys might
have seen our posts on the react plug it
back in April
Chopin says anyone how many of you guys
are familiar with flux and reactor have
heard of it already okay pretty good
number great so there's a URL here if
you guys want to look at check it out
afterward but that was sort of our very
introductory introduction to flux and we
also had an introductory video on there
but just to start with a little bit of
background with flux we think of it as a
single directional dataflow architecture
and what we found is that if we
constrain the structure of your app
starting from the very beginning then as
your app scales out scales up it doesn't
explode in complexity we can sort of
restrain that a little bit by sort of
keeping to the same structure and making
that easier for the developer to keep in
mind and then another key part is that
we use stores instead of models and
Bill's going to dive into that a little
bit more with the example app it seems
like a lot of you have heard of react
but just to go through that react is
Facebook's open source JavaScript
rendering library and we found that flux
and react work really well together you
know we we don't sort of we don't say
that you have to use them together the
only requirement for flux is that you
know when you want to render something
you can vendor everything as if it's
from a fresh state because flux does not
sort of give updates as in you know
here's what actually changed it just
says hey something changed so that's
really the only requirement but you know
what react does is it's conceptual it
conceptually allows you to think of your
UI as rear-ending out every single
change and that doesn't seem very
performant but the very reason it is is
that it's not actually rendering under
the hood this sort of provides you the
interface to say you know given the
state a here's how to render that given
a state B you know here's a different
rendering layout of yours of your view
and then it sort of
takes a virtual dom representation of
both of them does a diff and it applies
only the changes that have actually
happened so that's how react sort of
keeps it keeps it performant you know it
conceptually is a rerender every time
but under the hood is sort of optimizing
things for you and you know that sort of
just leads to a simpler mental model if
you can just think of everything as very
declarative you know given a state a how
do you render that you know that makes
for a very simple mental model and flux
and reactor both you know all about
keeping a simple mental model okay so
let's talk a little bit about stores you
know we've gotten a lot of questions
about this so that's why we've sort of
decided to talk about stores as our our
main part we think of stores as sort of
fad models it contains all of the data
pertaining to a logical domain so in the
example app for chat the one store would
be the messages store and it would
contain all of the messages that we know
about on the client not just a single
one it also includes all the application
logic for that logical domain so I was
clean a little bit about what that means
but the very beginning is that it will
set up to register with a dispatcher in
our system a dispatcher is just a pub
subsystem it you know you give it some
set of actions and it it sort of
distributes that to all of the people
where all the stories that are
registered to listen to it the only
input for the store is the callback that
it hands to the dispatcher when it
registers so what that means is the
dispatcher will say here's an action
that has been taken in the system and
then the store sort of digests that
action and if anything has changed based
on that action then it will emit a
change event for any of the views to
check to come back and check for new
data so the important thing here is that
the only input to the store is the
callback from the dispatcher so it's
public interface only has getters
there's no setters at all and the reason
we do this is because giving sort of
having setters on the store sort of
gives external
control to anything that can call into
the store and that makes it harder to
keep in a consistent state makes it
harder for the store to sort of reason
about what possible states it can be in
and if you ever did bug sort of a hard
to reproduce bug it's usually because
there's some sort of ordering of events
that didn't foresee and it's hard to
reproduce and that's where you know
heisenbugs come from so instead what we
do with stores is we say our only
interface is sort of the actions that
will accept from the dispatcher and
getters for views to get data back out
there's no explicit setters you know
what I want away to I think about stores
is as sort of a package of data and a
sort of caretaker for that data and the
caretaker kind of observes a stream of
actions coming in from either the user
or the server or wherever and it picks
out actions from there that it's
interested in it might not be interested
in all of them but it sort of gets all
of them it has the opportunity to change
its data as a result of that all right
so bill is going to go through an
example up and hopefully that will
demonstrate how stories fit in with the
rest of the system and make all this a
little bit more concrete so as as Jing
was alluding to this is where the stores
get their data from the dispatcher they
register a callback with the dispatcher
so that the the data that's contained in
the action can flow through the
dispatcher and into the store so the
dispatcher really doesn't know anything
about the store all it really knows is
that it has this callback that it needs
to call it a specific time then the
store will eventually well the view
actually will pull that data from the
store into itself as well the view at
that point doesn't really know much
about the internals of the store other
than only the pieces that it's
interested in the store knows nothing
about the view so everything is very
separated out and doesn't really touch
each other very much at all
the store in particular is its own kind
of universe but let's talk about a
little bit about how it gets the data
into it
so like I said it the the store
registers a callback with the dispatcher
and we can take a look at what that
looks like in some code right now
here we go this is the application that
we're actually trying to build this is
an example application it's basically
kind of a it's a simple chat it's a lot
like Facebook Messenger and and here in
the application if I can get mirroring
going I don't have a my mouse okay yeah
sure him so okay so so what we'll see in
the code is that we have a method on the
dispatcher called register that that
method has a singular argument which is
the callback thank you
and that callback has inside of it a
large switch statement by which the
store can decide and pivot on different
things that it's coming in through that
payload - what to do and it can use the
data that's in that payload to decide
how it should update itself and that's a
really important point about the here we
go
about the store is it updates itself no
one updates it it's a self-contained
universe for a logical domain so here we
are this is how it registers itself and
this is the example of the switch
statement we look at how we create a
message here and it's pivoting on the
action type you can pivot on other
things such as the payload source but we
often pivot on the action type then this
were creating some data around that text
to create a message object we're going
to store that in a private hash that's
inside that no one has access to only
they can only get it to it through the
getters and then we emit change and
stores are generally based on event
emitter nodes event emitter so that we
can then event the change event and
the concerned views can pull the data
from the stores and I'll take questions
at the end okay oh I'm sorry sorry but
they've washed out color on the screen
maybe I can just make this bigger a
little bit better so so again so if
we're creating a message here we're
doing this we type in this into the view
and we'll talk about this in a second
that's going to wind up going into the
payload and coming back in through the
dispatcher into the store so the
controller views are the ones that are
listening to that user event that I just
did on the application the controller
views are just like any other react
components but they have this special
job to do and that is to listen to
change events and when they hear that a
change event has happened from any store
they they call the stores that they're
interested in with the getters and pull
that data into there into themselves
they then update their state and
rerender all of their children with the
new data so let's take a look at what
that looks like in code
so generally so this is the message
section this is the entire area of the
page that's about the the message list
there and generally these controller
views will maybe control a section of
the page and all of the children that
are underneath them so in their initial
when they first initialize they they get
their initial data from the stores and
that's a method up here where you know
they're going to call one store to get
all the messages for the current thread
and they'll call the thread store to get
all the current messages to get which
give me which thread is the current
thread as the life cycle methods
progress here we have component did
mount that's after initialization they
set up their event listeners we have on
change as our response to that event and
we call that same method to grab the the
data and update our state so we've got
the data from the stores and we call set
state and when you call us at state in a
react component it sets off the
rendering cycle so then when we come up
here to the render method we have things
like this dot state thread name to pass
down into the children so or in this
case we have a list of message items
that we're mapping over the messages and
we have a little get get message list
item and this is the child message list
item and that's our stateless react
component so
let's go back to slides here when the
view actually responds to a UI event it
will inside of its event handlers want
to call one of the action creator
methods action creators are our methods
that wrap around the creation of an
action and and then pass them that
action to the dispatcher that's how the
data comes back into the system and
start to the top and starts flowing back
down again to eventually update the
store just like views can create these
actions API interactions can create
these actions as well actions are the
are the entry point into the system for
any any for anything that needs to enter
the system so that could be
initialization code like when it first
launches that could be a call to the API
and you're getting data back that could
be a user interaction I'm thinking to
myself maybe that could be like after
some of the talks today maybe that could
be like a router change so anything is
going to create an action to get into
this data system we can also in that
same action creator sly Fionn off the
data and do a write to the API so we can
exit the the system as well through the
action creator so let's look at how we
might add threads to our system we're
going that we've had a singular store a
message store and a message view we
would simply create another store a
thread store and a thread view the
difference here is that the message view
is going to be listening to both stores
because it needs to know both things in
our application
you can see that bill and Brian is the
is the thread name and then we have a
list of messages this whole section is
governed by the message section this
section over here is the thread section
and is and is a different controller
view
eventually we may add yet another store
to track unread threads now because
we're storing whether or not a message
has been read in the message itself we
need to know we need to know we need to
have reference to the messages and the
thread is already being known is already
a dependency of the message store the
thread stores is you know something that
the message store needs to know about so
we can't have this the a circular
dependency occur so we create a third
store to manage the unread thread stores
and then all of these need to be kept in
sync and this is where the dispatcher
really shines the dispatcher has a
special method called wait for the where
the stores inside their callbacks can
declaratively say I need to wait for
this other store to update first and
thereby that everyone stays in sync in a
very declarative model so the unread
thread store needs to wait for both of
the other stores update first before it
can update itself because it depends on
some data that's in those stores so
that's wait for it allows us to sequence
updates and allows us to set up a
hierarchy of stores for example in our
situation the thread store has no higher
has no dependencies it's at the top of
the hierarchy of the stores the message
store is a little bit below that because
it needs to depend on that thread store
to update first the unread thread store
is at the bottom they're waiting for
everyone to finish first but eventually
they all call they all emit a change and
the whole cycle updates now Jing is
going to talk about where we might else
we might go to evolve the app
all right great thanks Bill um so you
know what I mentioned at the very
beginning is that you know we want to
sort of keep a simple mental model so
that as we sort of evolve the app all of
the things that we add in doesn't sort
of explode the complexity and the number
of things you have to think about within
the system right so let's look at a
couple of examples and I won't I won't
use code in this case but hopefully
it'll give you a picture of like
wearables thought in new stores and new
features as we add to it oops sorry so
let's say that we wanted to take the
system and add the ability to start a
new conversation right so this is a very
common action we don't want to send just
a new message but we also want to start
a new thread but along with that so the
action payload might look something like
this we give it a type new thread and
here it's like a little bit less
structured than we would normally have
it but for the purposes of demoing let's
make it simple so we'll just say this
message is to Bill and I'm going to use
first names as IDs just so we don't have
to use numbers and the text will just be
hey Bill
I'm just talking to him and this is
going to be from the viewer which is
going to be me and I'll assign a
temporary thread ID and a message ID on
the client so we have something to refer
to it with so how would the thread store
react to this action so the third store
internally has a map of threads right
now from the thread ID to an object with
some metadata in it so here in this case
the thread store would look at that
action with all of the metadata in it
and sort of infer a couple of fields
from it for the new thread that's
creating so we know this five e nine
three six nine six F thread has a couple
of features it has a participant list
consisting of Bill and me since I'm the
viewer and then we know that the first
message on that list is going to be the
temporary message ID that we created and
in this case the message store is going
to react in a very similar way it knows
that we've added a new message to the
map so we'll take that ID and we'll
create an object that has the text of
that message the thread ID so we know
which
it belongs to and the author is me it's
going to be the viewer so what's
important here is that you know when you
think about when an action comes into
the system and you think about how it
should affect the system you can you
should sort of you can sort of zoom into
a particular store and think about okay
how does that affect the data within the
store you don't have to think about all
of the other interactions with
everything else in the system you just
think about the very simple constrained
problem of how should that affect my
data let's take another example let's
say we wanted to add a feature with
group chat so I want to be able to add a
participant to a thread and remove a
participant from a thread so in this
case the action might look something
like this has a type as well we already
know the thread ID because it exists and
I'm going to add a new participant with
the unique ID Chris and some metadata
about that person right so that we can
sort of render his information into the
view you know we need a profile picture
and we need a full name Christopher
Stowe in this case so it's pretty easy
to see what the thread store will want
to do given that the thread ID already
exists in the map we just want to update
that map to add another participant to
the list but we don't want to sort of
store all of the metadata for that
participant inside of the thread store
that doesn't make too much sense
especially since you can have the same
participant on multiple threads and then
you don't want to sort of get out of
sync with all of that all of the
metadata about that participant so
instead what we want to do is we want to
add a third store the participant store
that just keeps track of all the people
that we know about on the client and
when it sees this this action add to
thread what it does is it adds this new
participant to its map if it's not there
already and it creates some metadata
about it the name and the profile pic
right so if we look at this system will
we end up with is three stores and two
views right and and Bill at the end of
his example also had an unread
thread thread count-- store and in a
different view for that right so here
you know I'm not even showing the fourth
story because I wouldn't even fit on my
slide so this gets pretty complicated
you can sort of see how like as you add
features here you would add more stores
or more views to sort of manage
different domains and hopefully the
thread store versus the purchase image
store gives you an example of like when
you would want to split off into a new
store rather than keeping it all in the
same place but again like all of this
gets sort of complicated and we have all
of these arrows going back and forth you
know where is this scaling well all of
this basically reduces back down to this
diagram right we want to be able to say
you know because all of the arrows flow
in one direction you can sort of
collapse all of the stores into one
piece of the system and all the views
into one piece of the system and this is
what it looks like when you sort of zoom
out when you think about how the data
flow works in general not in a specific
case and then while you're working on it
and you want to sort of think about how
a new action would fit in or a new put a
new store or new piece of data would fit
in then you can zoom into the stores at
an individual level and think about that
right so instead of having to hold a
large system in your head and sort of
all of the cascading changes that might
happen within that system you can sort
of keep this in mind and then zoom in to
some particular pieces I think that's
what we found has been really useful in
just keeping the complexity low and
making it easy to test since you can
test each individual store and how they
react at different actions and in the
other sorry that's I think that's it so
at this point those going to talk a
little bit about how flux fix fits into
a broader picture
so so flux is obviously somewhat
influenced by MVC it's also influenced
by a lot of other ideas and fits into
this into this world that's a little bit
bigger than just MVC so these are some
of the some of the things that seem
fairly similar to flux to me there's a
lot of concepts you're like in dataflow
programming for example there is that
concept of very distinct ways of getting
in and out of the objects in the system
and the stores you know reflect that in
that they have that that callback is as
a primer the only way something can push
into the store other than that the store
can pull from other stores but other
than that is the only way that something
can push in likewise the getters are the
only way somebody can pull the data out
and the only thing the store is pushing
out is the event in addition dataflow
programming has that concept of waiting
for the inputs to become valid which is
similar to what's going on with wait for
in CQRS like that's stands for a command
query responsibility segregation I think
there is it's actually very similar
patterns or flux in that the action in a
way is the command cycle and the the
view the controller view asking for the
data from the store is like the the
query cycle in CQRS those are both
models so they don't doesn't exactly map
to flux but there is a certain
similarity there and certainly a a one
directional data flow in functional
programming there is that emphasis on it
one on a unidirectional data flow as
well as things can flow through
functions and in pure functions and
that's somewhat like what react strives
to do you can think of a react component
as being a pure function ideally where
the data is flowing through the system
much very similar to the way it might
flow through something in like Haskell
so those are the other things that are
that we think that flux is related to
even though it's you know it is
obviously some
related to MVC as well and I think that
it's appropriate to think of it as being
influenced by probably a lot of
different things so let's talk about
where we're going we we have an open
source dispatcher today in the in the
new repo and this is our this is the
same dispatcher that we use at Facebook
and it includes wait for an addition and
it will fire off a variant error if you
create a circular dependency so it's a
very robust dispatcher and we use this
in production all the time that's been
something that those those people that
have started become interested in flux
have been waiting for and so we're very
excited today to release it we also have
the example chat app that I briefly
showed on the screen and you can take a
look at that and we also have an example
a to do MVC app but it's the 2d MVC is
somewhat simplistic and this new chat
app shows a little bit more complexity
so it's like a good like second step to
as you as you learn about flux and in
the future what we're thinking about is
perhaps some flux boilerplate code or
some CLI tools to get you quickly up and
running because there can be some some
you know a bit of code to write at the
beginning which can slow you down a
little bit so we want to make things
that can help you get a little bit
faster what we do need though if anybody
is interested in open source projects
are like utilities to plug in to your
favorite whatever's and in particular
there isn't a really flux oriented
router in the world right now and that
would be a great project for someone to
take on there is there are like a react
router but it's it's not done in like a
flux kind of way where it creates an
action there's more flux stuff if you
get the slides you can get these links
but there's documentation on the react
blog there is an M the to do MVC is
accompanied by its own tutorial and
there are some new screen casts from
egghead about flux and someone has
created this thing called flux or which
is like a set of tools for getting going
with flux that they wrote in response to
the to do
do MVC example so that's that's it for
us today thank you very much for for
taking a lesson of how we build web
applications or Facebook any questions
how do you populate the data server side
you mean how does how does it come into
the how does it
what makes an action what they ate what
what what calls the API you're asking
how we get data into the system in the
first place okay
yeah so there's there's sort of two
parts to things to the question there
one is like how do we get data sort of
on to the client from the server is that
correct so the way we normally do that
is we still have everything coming into
the dispatcher so from the server we'll
sort of send a payload down that's meant
for the dispatcher that says here's all
of your initial data and then the other
side is like if your view asks for some
data that we don't have on the client
how do we get that and the way we do
that is when you ask the store for data
very often we will give you a call back
instead of returning your data
immediately so your view sort of has to
deal with that interaction where the
store may not have the data that you
want on the client and in that case the
store is responsible for sort of
fetching data from the server but the
one distinction there that I should make
clear is the store doesn't take the
response and only like consume it by
itself all of the stores sort of take
the response from the server and
redirect it through the dispatcher so
that everyone can sort of look at that
initial data payload and and you know
modify their own data if it needs to be
but in general like we think of data
loading or requesting data from the
stores as a synchronous operation
possibly so we try to leave that post
open that and and also we typically we
create like a web api utilities file and
we don't actually handle the the calling
of the server or and that sort of stuff
directly in the store we see really just
expose that to the store in the store
can use those utility methods follow-up
question yeah so we sort of think of
that as like you know when the view has
a sort of the beginning of a flow is
starting with an action right so when
the view ask the store for something it
doesn't have it yet
that's sort of the read path rather than
the right path and so that hasn't even
started going into the right path yet um
it's you know instead when when the
story goes to the server and ask for and
when it responds that's the beginning of
sort of the update flow of like you know
when we're going down through the the
center today did I forget to repeat the
question I mean to be honest I mean most
of the time when you're when you're when
you're asking for data from the server
you're doing it in response to a user
action and so most of the time that that
that utility method is actually going to
be called in that action creator that
the same the same type of action creator
that the fee would use when you like hit
enter right so the question is how do we
go around enforcing the constraints
that's a good question I think a lot of
it is I'm going to come down to culture
to some extent within a team once the
system is set up so that you know your
stories don't have any getters or start
your stories or have any setters and
everything comes in through the
dispatcher it becomes really hard to do
it any other way by modifying just
pieces and they sort of you know the
developer kind of feels gross while
they're doing it so I think you know
this is kind of like a pit of success
thing right you want to make it easy for
them to do the right thing and want them
wantem to you know make it hard to do
the wrong thing and make it feel kind of
weird in the first place so I don't have
a great answer there but
a lot of the enforcement is going to
come down to just having an example code
there and good unit tests and I think
part of the strength also is the
simplicity of the model and how quickly
developers can learn it and get ramped
up on it it's it's something that the
team can share a common mental model
really easily yeah so the question was
do we use anything with socket IO
instead of just a sink and point is that
is that right we I don't believe we've
done anything in particularly with
socket IO but it sounds it sounds like
we have something similar which is what
we use for chat updates you know we have
an open channel that uses long pole on
Facebook and that's how we sort of get
updates pushed from the server of you
know somebody new commented or somebody
sent you a message and for those we sort
of just like subscribe to the channel
and dump everything into the dispatcher
so you know the nice thing there is you
can treat a payload coming in from the
channel the same way that you would
treat a payload confirming that you sent
a message or you know an optimistic
payload that you know you're sending a
message on the client so that actually
simplifies the paths a little bit so the
question is how do we deal with hooking
up the UI to the actual actions
themselves a large part of that is going
to be or at least we handle it within
react so you can set sort of click
handlers drag handlers things like that
from a react component and then you know
when we're rendering our react component
we just hook it up to the action
creators that say you know handle a new
message with this text or handle that
somebody clicked alike does that make
sense something about that one thing
that's really nice about react is that
it automatically does the event
delegation for you so you can feel free
to like add these handlers on every
single list item and in reality what's
happening is at the top level there's
like one event handler going on
that's exactly right and that's and
that's why we we included that error
message in the console in the
development environment like so if
you're in development you will get an
error if you if you create that
situation in your in your in your
browser console but yeah that is a that
is definitely a problem to avoid so just
to clarify one thing the wait for isn't
sort of global it's actually we mostly
do it her action type so you might have
the messages store depend on or want to
wait for the thread store for one action
and then you can still have the opposite
relationship as long as it's a different
action so it's not a it's not a it's not
a circular dependency if that's the case
questions like that's it yeah
