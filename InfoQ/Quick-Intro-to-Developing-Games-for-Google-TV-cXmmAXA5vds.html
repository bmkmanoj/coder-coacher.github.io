saxman as an pointed out and so I'm a
developer advocate for Google TV and
Google TV is the well it's actually two
open apps platforms brought for
televisions one is chrome so all right
all the way up okay so I feel like I'm
eating ice cream so but so yeah to open
apps platforms one is Chrome so Google
TV has chrome full chrome web browser on
it as chrome 11 if i'm not mistaken when
I say full Chrome web browser it means
that supports html5 and all of its
goodness has a flash plugin built into
it but it does not support everything
that flash on the desktop including
extensions so but otherwise it's a
pretty full featured on the other aspect
the other open app platform is Android
so Google TV is really it's an open apps
platform or its to open apps platforms
for smart televisions so so whether your
Android developer or a mobile app
developer or you're a HTML 5 developer
you can you know build apps for the
platform the other thing about it is
that since it is Android it has the
android market on it so if you have
built apps for android tablets or phones
they potentially will actually run on
the platform itself and that's how
developers distribute their applications
is via the android market for Google TV
one other thing we think so from a game
developer standpoint if you're familiar
with what Android offers Google TV has
all the same infrastructure with one
exception and that's NDK support so no
native libraries which is kind of a big
hit for a lot of developers because if
they're using unity or some kind of
engine for for cross compiling apps it
won't work quite yet but we do have I
actually all the Android Android 2d and
3d libraries including OpenGL ES and
they what else we have render script and
you know 2d canvases and that type of
thing so so right now so you know we
just actually relaunch the platform very
recently I was back in the end of
October early November and we opened up
the platform for developers and that's
one
the Android Market on there so we're
currently working with developers to
bring apps to the platform and actually
make sure their apps look great on
televisions because as you can imagine
it's more than just a big Android device
it's you know 1080p or 1920 x 1080
resolution it's built for 10 foot in
user interface so users aren't going to
be actually touching the screen they're
going to be sitting on their couch with
a remote control so right now there's
probably about approximately 100 apps in
the market that have been optimized for
televisions we've featured actually in
the market about 60 of those so these
are ones that actually think that look
and and work really well on televisions
and kind of the point of that it's kind
of a small developer ecosystem right now
so we're actually happy to work directly
with developers that are building apps
and bring them to the platform so my
little plug is I have I have some cards
here that I brought along we're actually
for developers it might want to actually
build or test apps for the platform we
can actually help you you know get set
up potentially ship you a device or
something that affect all you do is fill
out a form and that kind of gets the bug
in our ear so please thank thank Paul
yeah thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
