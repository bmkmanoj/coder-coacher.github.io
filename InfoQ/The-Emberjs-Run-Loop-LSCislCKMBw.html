today we'll be talking about the Ember
JSON loop I got really interested in the
implementation of ember.js relew because
I feel like this this was kind of a
black box for me and also it feels like
it's a very good engineering feat on the
part of Ember core so I was interested
why ember.js front loop helps at the
Ember apps be more performant and how it
does how the internals work how the
coordinating of different events happen
so these are the three main like there
are lots of benefits to why if the wrong
loop exists but these are to me seems
like these are the three main benefits
of the ember.js front loop the first is
basically koala saying so a coordinating
or grouping of events so that the same
similar kind of events happen at once so
you'll see why that that helps the other
thing is like it helps the I think maybe
Eric will be able to tell me but but I
think it helped the Ember core be more
modular and cleaner code and also it
helped performance so it helps with dom
manipulation it helps with view rear
enders and it helps with coordination of
different types of events that happened
with it within the site life cycle of
the amber app so I found this cool
definition should I just shout is this
okay cool so I found this cool ember.js
like run loop definition in the ember
Jason action book and it seems like it
summarizes really well on what ember.js
from loop is the wrong loop is a
mechanism that ember.js uses to group
coordinate execute events Corky value
notifications and timers within your
application so basically these are the
three areas it focuses on events key
value notifications and timers and so
though these are like five hours there
is one more q but basically these are
cuse these this is how it looks so there
are these are like five different
buckets for in the whole run loop and
anytime an event occurs in in the Ember
lifecycle or in the amber app one of
these queues get events and they get
worked on they get processed there's
also one other q that was added I
couldn't see it in the in the book or
wherever I research but later on I got i
noticed that there's a another cue
called router transitions which witch is
which is responsible for like
transitioning between each route so
whenever you actually transition bit
from one route to another route you're
actually queuing it in the router
transition skew so there's one I think
it's after actions or something like
that so and so for each of these cues so
whenever a property binding occurs or
something like that happens the the sink
Q is basically the one that that gets
those events inside so it can go in and
work on our process each of those events
within them will an ember actually makes
sure that there are listeners for all of
these parts so there are listeners for
combined dings that our listeners for
whenever the unit requires rendering and
stuff like that so basically a lot of
the time or most of the time the idea is
that you don't have to interact with the
amber ground loop itself this is the
very very simplified version of how the
whole flow looks like so some event
occurs in the Dom or in the in the
application and those turn out to be in
some cue one of those five or six cubes
and they get worked on and depending on
what what has happened what happens
after that sometimes these events
because they are processed on they they
also generate some new events and those
events get either queued into a previous
q or the next cue there are some caveats
to it will go a little deep into it but
notice that the it's not linear it
we'll go back to previous cues any time
it finds that there are events that have
to happen in the previous q so for
example if we see this so think about
like if there are some events happening
for example in the render queue and
those those events trigger another
events that actually get to be scheduled
for sync it won't go forward it will
move back do the sink events again and
then move forward so it will never move
forward until and unless all of the
preceding queues are empty go so this is
something that I just so basically all
of these each of these queues processing
them will emit more more and more
workers or examined more jobs for for
each of these queues and also one thing
to notice is that this is not an
infinite loop it's not like whenever you
are loading up an application it's going
to run a loop and it will keep waiting
on things to happen it's it's a thing
that happens it if there is a trigger
that happens if someone clicks on it a
run loop runs through sync actions
router of transitions render after
render and destroy and then the run run
will finishes up and then some other
trigger happens and then the whole cycle
starts again so we'll go through each of
these queue and see what their
responsibilities are so sync you is
basically responsible for propagating
all the bound data of your application
this is basically something that you
will never this cules is something that
you will never touch yourself the
actions q is actually the most like
relevant after the after under one maybe
so the actions q is where all of the
promises in your app run they all of the
initialization events venue your uploads
they run in this queue and also any time
you do an Amber Alert run thing they all
go into actions q so the next q is the
render queue it manipulates Dom it's the
actual thing
that happens so anytime a bunch of
properties got changed as a result of
that something has to coordinate in the
view so the HTML or the thing the
browser has to react to that it happens
in the render queue the after render
queue is important because sometimes you
may want to have that element appear
because the computer property changed
and you want to hook for example a
jquery plugin to that element after
Endor q is good for that I've seen some
people have been like they use ember run
next to do this kind of stuff but it
seems like this is much more performant
if you use ember schedule in the after
render and that way you won't have to
wait for the destroy it would just do it
right after the render queue so yeah the
destroy q actually is just the garbage
collector it destroys all of the objects
and so let's go through an example right
so this is a to do's MVC app and so you
can see that there there is this so this
is a button that marks all of these to
do is as complete and you can see
there's a status bar that that shows
that there are three items left and each
of these to do is have or have a
checkbox that are that is bound to the
is completed property of each to do so
we see that the mark is completed mark
all as completed button is bound to each
of these two dues there is a status bar
thing that is bound to each of these to
do status and each to do itself is bound
each to do stuck box itself is bound to
the property is completed right so how
if if I were to click mark all is
completed here what would how would the
cycle occur what would happen so there
are so I click on the first button here
that completes all of the to do's right
so there are three is completed events
so it has to go in and update the is
completed property for each of those two
duels right there are three checked
events that actually back bind this
completed property to the element itself
in the HTML the three remaining
formatted with remaining format it is
the status bar you see at the bottom so
all of these are tied to the is
completed property of the check of the
to do and there are 3 mar called and
updates so these events are occurring
and they are not doing anything except
just changing the data model inside and
just changing the in-memory store of
ember since it's in sync so nothing has
occurred yet indeed not in the DOM and
we see that actions is just skipped
because there are no actions at this
point it's a simple binding thing that's
going on we see that there are three
check boxes that get changed so all of
them get picked the one change to status
so there's one remaining change that
happens in this in this queue and
there's also mark all is done which just
changes its it's what color for example
so if there was no sink or if there was
no run loop what would happen there
would be three all like all of these
will have three events and themselves so
anytime say so you click on mark all
done they they run a loop and it
triggers the rear entering of the view
each time a checkbox has changed and
that's inefficient right so basically
that was the theory the understanding
part let's go over how to use it like
what's the API like how how can we use
the run bloop most of the times as I
said you won't have to interact with the
wrong loop itself to me it was
interesting because I wanted to find out
how it is implemented internally the
idea like I think the amber amber core
team wants us not to be worried about
the run loop and all of that so it
actually tries to auto run sometimes but
it is in some cases like Ajax callbacks
some promises something like that you
may have to do you may have to go and
actually say i want to run this event or
this call back in the run loop itself so
for example this is the the capi um you
must have seen this so for example we're
posting to a stripe type credit card
provider
the success callback is happening in
number and loop because we want to make
sure that any time the group record is
created we want to go into a series of
those events so everything happens in
coordination so this is the it's simple
you just call run and pass it the
callback and that callback is executed
in the action skew cool so this is the
API if you want to run it but not create
so basically when you run the Ember run
loop and if there is no run loop
currently running in your in your app it
will execute a new run loop for you so
it will create an one loop go to the
action skewed do that and if there are
any more things propagating due to that
in the sink you it will do that finish
off this whole thing and then stop but
if you don't want to execute around when
you if you're not worried about creating
a run Luke yourself you want to execute
it for the next what a very whenever the
next run loop occurs in your application
you can use this ember net run next and
that will that callback will then run in
whatever the next run Lou appears this
is so if you want to run as if you want
to start a run lube or if you want to
run that call back after a second you
would pass it as a separate parameter
and so this is something that's used
when as I was saying that when a due to
a result of the computer property being
being done or reaction in reaction to
that there's a Dom element that appears
in your browser you want to hook a
jquery plugin into that element you
would actually do this you would
schedule in the after render queue so
this is actually a good example of how
to how to schedule a job in certain in
particular q you want to otherwise ember
run will always schedule it in the in
the action skew what you would do is you
would specify the name of the queue you
specify the context and basically you
would give whatever you would do do that
we were to that element so sometimes
what you want to do you want to do this
once so this will actually do it
every time you call it but sometimes you
want to do it once even if it appears so
anytime it finds out that this thing has
already had a tooltip it won't run this
that this is more efficient than
scheduled alright that's about it and so
a couple things a couple resources where
I actually like research to find out
find more about run loop this is a very
good guide this shows why run loop
exists it's a very summarized kind of
guide it does doesn't go much into
detail but it's a very good very good
summary of how and why Ron loop exists
this is a great book there's a whole
chapter on run loop and how the
internals work there's a like it he goes
through an example a lot of this talk
was based on this chapter from the book
there's also this thing that I found out
it's really cool this guy goes into the
JavaScript event loop model and finds
out how the JavaScript event model was
like an inspiration to implementing the
ember run loop itself it's a very good
resource it's quite detailed as well
that's about it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
