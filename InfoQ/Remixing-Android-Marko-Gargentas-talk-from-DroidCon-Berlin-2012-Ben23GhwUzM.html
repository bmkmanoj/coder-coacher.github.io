were at my talk yesterday okay and how
many of you have built a rom compiled
and read from source oh wow excellent
cool so I'm going to attempt to squeeze
what's normally an hour talk into 25
minutes I'm going to go really fast and
you're welcome to ask questions later on
so just a little bit about myself my
name is Marco work for a company called
maracanã based in San Francisco I'm an
author of learning android book
published by o'reilly it's also
translated into german and chinese and
but that book is more about ab
development what we're talking about
today is platform development cut making
a customer on basically so why would we
remix android what what's the point of
doing that so first of all remix thing
basically to me means taking the
existing vanilla components and in
changing them in some meaningful ways
that the end result is something that it
works better before whatever better
means one of the reasons why we would
remix android is because we can because
it's open because custom usually is
better and it's possible so there that's
that's a good enough reason if something
is possible issue is good so what are we
gonna remix so I'm not in this talk I'm
not really going to talk about cosmetics
too much I'm not overly focused on you
know how to change a boot animation or
replace the wallpaper we're going to do
a little bit more we're going to
register we're going to create a new
device and I'm going to tell you how to
do it properly and we call it markaana
alpha it's just a made up the bicycle
used for training purposes explaining
explaining purposes we're going to
create the plumbing a make file plumbing
in this tends to be the the cart is one
of the hardest parts when dealing with
custom roms we're going to build the
device we're going to add the custom
kernel we're going to add a native
library we're going to add the naked
demon where
add libraries for the j and i support so
you were exposing our native libraries
for j9 we're going to register it as a
system service and we're going to add
the the application framework support
for it so that finally our new app can
take advantage of all this plumbing that
we built and finally we're going to
build a custom SDK so that other
developers didn't take advantage of what
we added to the platform so most of you
have seen this type of picture before
this is a very sort of high-level
overview of the Android stack recap
linux kernel at the bottom and we have
native Native layer application
framework apps at the top and I expect
most of you have seen one version of
this or another I'm going to be using a
slightly more detailed version of the of
the same of the same stack and in this
version basically what they do is
explain where things are both in the
source tree as well as on the device
when it's all said and done right when
you deploy it on my device so it may be
a small text that this image is
available on murkhana com so you're
welcome to to get a full version and out
also provide this talk later on as well
um so in a standard Android we have
interaction between layers and basically
at the top of the stack we have this is
your application right it could be a
system app it could be an app that user
just downloaded that application talks
to something in the in the application
framework this is the Java framework
that's elegantly exposed to us as app
developers that in turn may be talking
to a Java service one of the system
services there about 57 of them in
standard ICS release and that in turn
may be talking to it are native demon or
loading a native library that may talk
to a driver how harder abstraction layer
and ultimately go to the Linux kernel
realm so this is a typical interaction
when you try to do something in android
for example if you're trying to figure
out what your location is by a GPS
that's basically in that in the location
case you would your app will be
into the location manager which will be
talking to a location service which is a
system service which would load either a
location library and it could use some
kind of how to talk to the physical
driver that's in the kernel space so
we're going to build one of those
vertical stacks this is another way to
kind of look at that so basically you
know typical Android space you have a
client some kind of application and that
application ultimately is talking to
some kind of service right that
communication usually happens via
something called binder which is
basically the ipcc mechanisms with the
Android provides our service may also
use a native library to get a job done
so some piece of C C++ compiled code so
we're going to take this picture and
we're going to blow it up a little into
a little more detail so in this case we
now have a client here we have a service
here so this is some kind of a client
application the blue is dalvik so it's
basically Java code and this at the
bottom is our kernel and what we have is
we have some kind of activity that is
starting via a manager through the proxy
because this is called the IPC
communication actually happens to our
service which is then in turn talking to
a native library which in turn is
talking down to the colonel so basically
we have a vertical top to bottom add to
middleware middle layer app framework to
native libraries to halt to down to the
to the bottom of it all which is usually
a kernel driver so we're going to build
something like this one of these
vertical stacks and we're going to
explain it via a via this example which
is a simple logging service so first
what you do is you download the source
code from source that android com you
build a source tree you run it on a
device and you know if you go the one of
the things that you need to know is how
to properly set up the structure when
you re mixing your version of Android so
basically the source tree would
ultimately look like something like this
you basically have all the everything
that you just downloaded from from from
the end repository on and often people
go and start sprinkling their changes so
load all over the source
that's usually not a good idea because
you want a future proof your your
changes and it is going to come with a
new version of Android then you're going
to want to pull it down and you will you
will want to move your changes upstream
with a new version so the better
approach is to basically create a device
in the device directory this is called
Google suggests to do it and so that's
what we're doing here we basically have
this directory called Mariana because
we're building this device called mark
on alpha so what we're going to do is
we're going to keep that keep that is
the main directory for it we're going to
create a alpha directory which is the
poor the stuff that goes on to the
device versus the stuff that goes into
the SDK add-on versus the stuff that's
calm so this would be basically the
shared holidays so so that's basically
how we organize the code in this case so
first thing first you register your
device so there's a special file called
vendor set up dot SH you basically put a
one liner in that file basically says
what kind of a device you're registering
for the build system so for the end of
built system um and when you do source
mobility and be set up which is the
first thing you need to do before you
build the Android ROM you you will
notice that your device has been
registered in that case so so so far so
good that's that's a good thing next
what we're going to do is we're going to
create the plumbing for the make system
like I said this tends to be one of the
most complex parts of the of the job so
basically what we're doing is we're
creating the mother of all files which
is basically Android products mkay and
we're simply saying include our full
version of this device because you could
hear multiple multiple versions of your
alpha device it could be a full version
debug version user version a certain so
what you're doing next is we're
basically providing a couple of
information about the device what we're
saying that this is a full release the
device name is alpha in a short
description is that it's some kind of
mark on alpha image that we're building
in this case and focused on an emulator
but these steps are exactly the same if
you're building for a physical
device such as Motorola Xoom or
something like that or pandaboard so
next what we do is we copied the
boilerplate make files from another
another sample device directory so in
this case I copied from the generic
because i'm using the emulator if i was
going to do for motor up for pandaboard
or beagleboard or something like that I
would simply copy the files from those
directors that's usually the easiest way
to get started with this so what we do
next is we need to create the signing
keys for the platform you already have
the keys in your source tree but those
are those are not gonna pass the CTS so
you need to create your own keys so
first thing you do is you define
designer so this is basically what
you're saying is that you know this is
where based in the u.s. California San
Francisco company name is Mariana and
this is our email either switch should
probably change and and then we need to
create a we need to remove the existing
piece so you basically there's a
directory called build target product
security and you just delete all the
files that match the pattern in there
and then you start creating your keys so
first we're creating a platform key
again this is a tool that ships with the
source tree so it's fairly easy to use
and you just basically run it and you
create that key throw that which create
a shared key the same steps we create a
media key the same steps and we generate
the test piece so therefore he is
opinion we need to create and finally we
verify that everything is there so we
basically just check that all the key
all the files are there and we just
basically can then make sure that we
have the proper issue specified and that
all the keys are there keep in mind of
these keys you probably want to keep
them safe because they're your private
keys so you're on a garden as such so we
build the device so we basically source
building and be set up we can we can
verify that indeed we're building ice
cream sandwich that we're building that
release and we're building forearm in
this case we turn on you see cash
so that it runs faster and we finally
run it to make sure that we have a built
and as you can see we can verify that
this is really a divisive creatures
build and it's got a model number two
people do so so that's basically so far
vanilla haven't done anything so first
thing that we do is we modify the
colonel so we're going to be basically
modifying it's in pieces of this
vertical stack so the colonel we're not
the colonel fits in this place in the
picture just going to give you another
perspective so basically what we're
going to do is we're going to create a
directory we're going to get cloned
colonel we're going to check it out
we're going to build it so in this case
I'm not really modifying anything i'm
simply compiling vanilla Colonel I copy
the colonel into a specific place that
goes into alpha common so that's that's
what it's going to live and we then
specify in our board config that we're
using the colonel this is a double
negative so keep watch out for that so
and finally what we do is we add to them
to the Alpha make file that we want to
copy that Colonel into the final release
that's how we get a colonel into the
building what we do then is we make sure
that we include that file and we then
run it on a device and we can verify
that this point we really indeed cap the
custom kernel in our in our version of
Android so in this case like I said we
just basically downloaded the basic
kernel and compiled it but if you want
to modify it you will just go and modify
colonel whichever way you like so baton
the next thing that we're doing is we're
adding a native library so that's this
is where it fits in the picture so
basically our native library is both
part of the service because the service
uses it but we also have a demon code
that's going to be using the same native
library this is where it's going to end
up in terms of the stack looking it to a
different perspective so what we do is
we create a directory where we're going
to keep the library so it's going to be
it's going to go into common because
it's shared between there is both device
and development tools etc and we're
going to get to create a directory
called web we create the top-level make
file
this is the main thought that's going to
include all the other make false so
that's one of the types of a make file
we created directory for our light for
our library and we then create a gather
file because we're going to need to
expose some of the library functionality
ideally eventually to Jay and I we then
implement that library using ICT alcohol
so like like I said in this case um we
just wanted to showcase how you can
actually call maker Colonel Paul and one
of the colonel calls is the ictr call
for flushing the log file system and we
create a make file this is a typical
make file in android you almost always
have these two lines of code at the
beginning and you always get the final
line something like this where this may
change it could be build shared library
building securable build package bill
module etc etc depending on what the
output of that is so these make false
you see all over the place and it's
always called Android MK what what we're
doing that make fall is we make sure
that we add this library into a package
so just building it is not going to
unnecessarily release it into the final
product what we then do is we run it to
make sure that it's built so you could
be make it and we can see that the
target that this is actually being
compiled and linked and all that stuff
so it's the final product is released as
the log Tessa so what we're going to do
next is we're going to build a native
demon so it's going to fit into this
part of the stack is going to be calling
that native library so we create a
directory again it grows into common but
in this case bin not lip we create the
top-level make file right the one that
we also always need we then write our C
code and we create a make file again
make fall is the same two lines at the
top build executable is the target again
we need to register it with the product
packages otherwise it doesn't get copied
in and in this case what we also do is
to get this demon start we need to add
it to the in itarsi file and in this
case a couple of ways we can deal with
this I chose to pop it the existing in
itarsi and modify
so I copied the unit RC into our Comment
directory and I modify it by saying hey
start our service at boot time so when
the colonel runs in it are say it kicks
off our service as a one-shot and in
transit as a system user and what we
finally need to do is we need to tell
the make system that we need to copy the
cygnet RC into the final image otherwise
it's not going to get copied in we make
it we run it and when we execute it on a
deep you shell if I do it Michelle PS i
can actually verify that indeed my demon
is get is being run every in this case
sir for 60 seconds right so I can verify
that this is indeed working next what we
are going to do is we're going to modify
the we're going to create the J'naii
around our lip because ultimately java
is going to be calling this native code
so we need to expose it by Jane I so
what we are doing is we are basically
creating a directory in this case it's
common framework so we're creating a
frame-up directory there and we are
creating the top-level make file the one
you need whenever you create one of this
top-level directly like been make AB in
lib or framework so far so and then what
we do is we write our Java I did not
include fear because it's too much
information but we write our Java code
we write our Java main just for testing
purposes and we add a permission that we
add we basically specify that this
library is we request to use this
library this library is going to need to
be copied into the the system the system
folder so that it can be later on loaded
so that's what we need to basically
specify that in this library is part of
that we cannot make fall in this case
make file may look longer but it's
really a three make false in one right
so we do click the two lines at the top
right and then we basically here we
build the library so the output is built
java library then we built the
documentation needed for the sdk add-on
and then we built the
xml or actually just copy the xml and we
create the jni header by Java H does j9
that's our header so we basically get
those boilerplate code we copied that we
implement that that header in a.c file
and we then create a make file so again
two lines are the same the last one is
build shared library so the output is
going to be an Esso we add it to the
main make file for the platform and we
compile it and then we can basically run
it we can verify that if I run make main
I can verify that this is actually
working by doing it to be logcat I can
verify that Delta that we we cannot that
we can see this library and some so that
was the making the demon so what we're
going to do next is we're going to build
the IPC mechanism to communicate back
and forth between the client and server
that fits into this part of the picture
of the stack so we're going to create
the directory again it's going to go
into framework directory we're going to
implement the AI dll file we are going
to write our Java code and we're going
to specify the pure using that library
again and we're going to then create a
make file again it's very similar to the
one we thought just previously in the
demon and when we get the sample code we
are going to register these files
because it need to be copied over so
it's an XML file and we're going to make
this and verify that it all got
installed so that the jar file actually
got correctly installed in the right
place finally we're going to implement
the service so this is going to go into
this part of the stack so what we're
going to do is we're going to create a
directory in this case it's an app so it
goes into an app directory so we need
one of those top-level make files the
one-liners what you do next is we create
the manifest file we implement the Java
implement some more Java and then the
make fall again looks like that again
same two lines here we're building a
package that's what you do when you
build an application and we're also
specifying here that we're using some of
those libraries that to build previously
there
our libraries of Jane I levers and
finally we added to our make file and we
install it so so that's now installed on
the system service finally we have a
client to create it's going to go into
this directory so it's a nap it's an
application basic application with the
UI so we created directory for it so it
goes back into the app structure we
write some large Java code we create our
xml code and then we create a make file
that is creating the package at the end
of the day we add it to our packages
list so it gets compiled and we make the
system and we finally can see that our
application is now working so this is
our custom application it's now baked
into the round into the platform and we
now want to have a way for developers to
be able to develop using our new system
service so we need to package all this
into an SDK package so what we do is we
create a directory under SDK add-on and
in this case I'm just going to simply
create a skin and copy some library
silver so I'm basically starting with
the skin that's just one of the default
ones um I all we did is just add a log
or just so we can actually see that it's
working so we do a portrait and the
landscape version of it and we then
create a file that you need it's called
hardware but I 09 and we're simply
specifying the heap size in this case
but you can modify various parameters
about your specific board that you have
and responsive then there's another file
that you must have is manifest at I&amp;amp;I
and you specify information about your
your SDK in this case it's just the name
bender description API level I guess
that's important and also the libraries
that are part of this so how is it how
is this SDK different than everything
else so you need to specify the
libraries we then specify in our stub
what to include so for example make the
main Java class was there just to
basically provide your test stub for us
so we minus it from the bill it doesn't
need to go there but the log library and
the log
the log libraries basically need to be
there so we do include okay we create a
rather complex MK file so there's a Don
MK file and I don't have time to go into
all the details of it but you kind of
get the idea of the steps at least and
we register all this into the with our
make system we include we create the
top-level make file we compile
everything and the end result is that
you can verify in your eclipse for
example that indeed you have a new
version available in there as an SDK
add-on to compile against so we can then
if I'm building all this I can basically
see that I can build with that add-on
and that's basically what our skin looks
at the end of the day with a custom
custom kernel custom build custom model
in custom skin so it's all customized
about this one so so that's that's
basically it in terms of how we modify
this rom all the way from the top level
lap down to the low level kernel space
and all the code and everything is
available on marcano comp so I actually
have this entire thing in more detail as
an article available so feel free to
check it out in as well as the boiler
the strawman implementation of these
rooms available on github so thank you
