listening to my talk I'm going to tell
you a little bit about Tesla web forward
it's a really cool movement and I just
want to get a quick show of hands it has
anybody here who's heard of Tesla web
forward all right a few has anybody been
to an event yeah I see sign now some of
you I'm cool so most of you haven't I'm
going to tell you a little bit about
about what it is how it got started and
what we do there and hopefully for those
of you who've never been to one or don't
know I'll entice you to join the
movement so a little bit about me my
name is Rebecca hope I work for Adobe
and I just said I would have been there
for eight years I work here in the San
Francisco office down on townsend street
i'm on the web platform team and i've
been deeply involved with tessa web
forward since the beginning so i'm going
to start out with a quote from tim
berners-lee because it really captures
the essence of what of what test the web
forward is he said if I had taken
proprietary control of the web and it
never would have taken off people only
committed their time because they knew
it was open and shared and that they
could help decide what happened next so
his vision for the web was not just a
technological vision but an evolutionary
vision and so now we are almost 25 years
later after he invented the web and
we've seen prolific growth exponential
growth from many millions of people
contributions technology ideas content
everything and his evolutionary vision
came true because the web today really
truly is defined by the community but he
also realized very soon after that in
order for it to prevent it from from
fragmenting and becoming utter chaos
there needed to be a common set of
standards around which the web developed
in advance to keep it somewhat sane so
he in 1994 founded the world wide web
consortium which we know is the w3c for
short as the standards body for the web
and it's the root of communication for
how we develop the web in advance it and
just like communication is how we as
people come together standards bring
people together on the web
so what exactly is a standard well at
the very basic definition it's defined
somehow something should work it's based
in the w3c it's based on the consensus
of community all decisions of how things
are done our consensus based there's no
central authority to figure and it often
it's a lot of iterations before we can
come to agreement it's it's a little
like a legislative process that we're
familiar with the in government a
standard has to be theoretically
possible to implement it always starts
as an idea but it has to be feasible and
theoretical you can or me bet they're
okay better and so this is really
important it also has to be implemented
more than once if you implement a
standard just once and you can't repeat
it and it's an anomaly or it's not
standardized abul because maybe there's
too many variables to keep control of or
to define and this is the important part
the implementations have to pass a
common test suite so how do you know
that you're conforming to the standard
well there's there's there's a set of
tests that everybody that comes along
that implements asked pests of pests so
how does standards come to be I'm going
to go through a very high-level very
quick overview of the process and and
this is the this is the desired process
and I'm going to point out here that are
sometimes in reality we veer away from
the desired process a little bit a
standard always starts as a draft a
draft is a work in progress there's
multiple updates to a standard usually
quite a lot of them over many cases a
long period of time sometimes a couple
of years here prototyping and early
implementation begins so so this is
where we deviate a little bit from what
is desired to what actually happens so a
lot of the things in w3c that are
standards in draft form are in shipping
browsers and that's because we're really
hungry for the new technology we really
want to get it out there and in people's
hands it's because we want people to try
it out and give us feedback so that we
can make it better with with the caveat
that we know that it's a standard and
it's
might change and and it's because we
can't keep up with the process that the
innovation is so fast that we need to
keep up with it so that's partly why
we're getting have this test the web
forward movement is we want to
streamline that process we want to bring
more people on and maybe pull those two
timelines a little closer together the
draft also advances on consensus the
working groups meet regularly and have
discussions every day about every detail
and every letter of a respect it's quite
fascinating if you follow any tests are
needed in this phase for the proof of
concept to resolve the details and
really again because these are things
that are shipping in browsers so these
tests kind of go beyond proving concept
and serve as a functional tests for the
software in a lot of cases so the next
phase is the candidate recommendation
phase and this is where it is the draft
becomes a little more stable and a
little more firm on the working group at
this point believes that the spec has
everything that it needs here the
implementations are needed to validate
the belief that the spec is ready and
again tests are needed here so the
implementations can start on the ground
start being interoperable from the start
and also the tests are required for the
implementations to pass so that it can
get to the final recommendation version
when there it becomes a recommendation
when there are two more implementations
because like I said before that that
validates it as a standard when two
people at least two organizations can do
it all implementations pass the same
suite of tests and future
implementations or future versions of
those implementations can still use the
same test suite to continue to prove
conformance so Toby Langella from
facebook and now he's the test lead at
the w3c and Robin Burj on who's an
editor on the html5 spec have been doing
some work recently to generate some
coverage statistics on the specs since
we're probably all familiar with code
coverage this is different because
there's no code it's just words it's
bex so they've come up with an algorithm
that parses the language of the specs
does some word counting and word
analysis we've got we've got details at
the spec section level and they're doing
this to try to figure out where are we
with html5 how much more do we have to
go what do we need and I'm not sure if
you can see the number up there but we
are at thirty-seven percent coverage
currently on html5 so we're not even
halfway there with the test suite we
feel like we need about twenty five
thousand tests we currently have about
ten which means we need over 15,000 more
tests to get HTML there additionally all
these tests need to be looked at by
somebody and reviewed so there are
someone needs to look at each one of
those tests to say yep this is good this
will prove conformance there's about six
thousand tests sitting in that queue
yeah soak that in furman so those are
huge numbers and scary and bear in mind
that's one speck granted it's the
biggest bag it's html5 but there are so
many w3c specs and a lot of them have
the same story so it may seem like it's
an enormous mountain to climb and I you
get your form on how the hell are we
going to get there like how are we going
to do this well what we need is easy we
need more people more tests and we need
to do it so we ultimately have a better
web so about a year though my colleagues
at a doe we started a movement and we
called it Tesla web forward it was
intended to be at grassroots community
based movement we had our first event in
San Francisco last June and since it was
the very first one and it was kind of
this cutie named with these cool little
dinosaurs I remember thinking kind of
myself the enthusiasm was huge people
came in the WC staff came in we had a
spec editors travel hate to be here we
had this cool hackathon in her office
and the food was great but but before
that like all the excitement I thought
how they were so excited kind of over
nothing because it was
just an idea at that point I thought it
was interesting but the idea was so good
and it was so when you did was really
proof that when you can just rally
people and you didn't give a good idea
and everyone showed up and contributed
and it was great so it took off from
there we had a few more events we had
one in Beijing last fall shortly
followed by one in Paris that was a lot
of fun Sydney Australia earlier this
year and just a couple of weeks ago up
in Seattle and more in the pipeline we
just opened up registration for our
Tokyo event this June we opened it up
yesterday and it filled up within 12
hours so I guess you could say we're big
in Japan and we also have shanghai and
shenzhen china coming later this year so
we didn't do this alone this was truly a
community effort and our very good
friends at Google Microsoft Facebook the
w3c a lot of other smaller organizations
contributed money expertise people time
and people showed up the web development
people work the small web development
shop students came it's been really
really cool in a truly community-based
effort we have a lot more coming soon
every time we announce a new event just
yesterday we announced Tokyo and someone
shouted out for you to Singapore we have
somebody asking to bring it to Germany
so people are people are clamoring to
have this come to their community so
what happens at these events well it's
your con unusual hackathon stuff there's
a light show there's a DJ there's
dancing till four in the morning but
there's also learning we teach you a lot
at these events we get you started there
typically spread over two days it's a
Friday evening of a few Tech Talks three
or four hours Tech Talks and beer of
course we teach her everything you need
to know to get started so experts come
in and the weekend should we teach them
like how to read a w3c specs believe it
or not there's a skill to it they're
written in a certain language and
there's certain ways that you can pull
out testable assertions we teach you how
to test the test harness j/s that's the
w3c's prefer
javascript testing framework we teach
you how to write a w3c raft test those
are good tests that's a good test format
to use when you're you need to do visual
verification how something looks or is
rendered on a page filing the best bugs
they're just skilled to that too good
bug versus a bad bug may mean one that
gets fixed or one that doesn't some of
the working groups have really cool test
frameworks the CSS working group has a
beautiful test case management system
and sometimes we'll do a top locking me
do that if we're doing a lot of focus on
CSS testing and then you get the experts
here so they'll give you a snapshot of
what's going on what's this what's the
state of this spec right now so like I
kind of just gave you a snapshot of
html5 you can talk to the editors you
can talk to the people who are running
the testing efforts on those and learn
so I'm going to walk you through a very
brief excerpt of one of the talks that
we give and that's how to give a rough
test these are the actual slides that we
use I just shorten them a bit but just
kind of give you an idea of what they
are so the full tutorials on our website
at tests the web forward org and it's
under resources it's there available
there's sample files that go along with
it and it's designed for you to do it at
home on your own so a rough test does
anybody know what a rough test is have
you heard of rough test suite no.1 cool
well not wasting my time a rap test is
something that you would choose to use a
rough test versus a JavaScript test when
you have something visual that you need
to verify you need to make sure that
something is rendered properly on the
page you can't always do that
programmatically with JavaScript you can
ask JavaScript where something is and
what color it is that you can't see it
so rough test is good for that and
historically in software testing when we
have to verify you I will do some kind
of screenshot image comparison and
there's managing big libraries of
screenshots and then if one little pixel
changes in your UI you've got a rebase
line everything and then you're not
your head because you've been through
this before it's a nightmare well the
Rev test operates on the same screen
shot Bates idea except they're much
lighter weight there to test files to
files rather it's one that's a test file
and one that's a reference file the test
file is the one that uses the feature
you're testing the reference file is
something that is going to look exactly
the same way you're going to construct
it differently not using the feature
your test a good rough test is
self-describing you put a sentence on
the page so that if someone manually
wants to look at the test you can say
that the test passes if this but they
also are designed to work with
automation so Mozilla IE blank WebKit
all have I'll have a support in their
testing internal testing tools to 44 f
tests so they basically will run them in
an automated engine where the load each
HTML file take a quick screen grab do
the image comparison and if everything
passes they pitch out the results much
better than maintaining huge libraries
of images for all the platforms and then
the nightmare drew baselining so their
cross browser in their cross platform so
this is a sample test case and this
comes from an actual spec and this is
the CSS transform spec and this is a
this is actually an example when you're
getting started with writing wdc test
it's really good to start with the
examples because you've got images that
you can see how something looks you
almost always have code there and if
aspects example doesn't pass a test then
that's fly one you want to test the
stuff we're demonstrating so this year
is a transform this is a CSS transform
property that takes a translate function
that has two arguments it's the x and
the y so this says right here the
transform is going to be moved by
hundred pixels in the x direction and in
the y direction so i'm going to start
with showing you the completed rough
test just so that you can visualize this
as we walk through the code so this is
looks like the same
the two separate files the top file is
the test file the bottom files the
reference style file they're the same
the w3c requires you to put a little
metadata in the top of your tests you
know a title for the page telling
basically what the test is who you are
so that we know who to follow up with
when we review tests and so that you get
credit for your contributions the next
two links are spec links this is
something that CSS working group does to
track what section of the spec you're
testing so some of that section level
coverage data that we know is mapped
back this way so we can programmatically
extract it and then the match referenced
the last link is what identifies this
I'm sorry the second to last link is
what identifies this as a as a reference
test so this hey this is the file that
matches this test file and then the last
is the assertion in the spec that you're
testing so in this case it's verbatim
from the spec the transfer moves the
element by a hundred pixels in both the
x and y direction so under the test file
we're going to now add the elephant
element with the transform applied and
since its needs to be a green square
it's going to be a div but it needs to
be a green square so we need to put the
styles on there to make it with the
green background and we're going to make
it a hundred pixels by 100 pixels and
then the last line there's is that's the
test over in the reference file we
create the exact same identical
rendering only rather than move putting
the positioning the square it the div in
that using a transform we just simply
set the top and the left to 100 by 100
now this is a cool technique that we use
a lot ruf tests that where we put
something red on the test than if it
fails the red appears and if it passes
there's no red again really nice for
somebody who's coming on and looking at
the test and that you'll see in the
statement will say we shouldn't see red
when this fails so here we create a red
square of the same size that is going to
be positioned beneath the green square
if the Green Square properly trans
worms into the right position and then
at both of these since these are pages
and they're going to be compared
programmatically probably in somebody's
on mated engine you got to put the same
sentence in both test passes if there's
a green square and no red and then one
of the guidelines I've been told when
writing these tests is your grandma
should be able to look at Nova passes my
grandma could probably say yes or maybe
she could open the browser and then the
last thing you put your dibs on the file
the only thing to note here is you want
to put your Red Square first before your
green square so it's or before in the so
that the green square will get rendered
on top of it just as following the Dom
order and then this is your reference
div and so this is what a failing test
in a past passing test looks like and we
were the first the top test I showed you
in the beginning and the bottom test is
one where the transform failed it didn't
get applied in oh there's the red so my
grandmother could totally stay fail so
that's it that's the basics of a rough
test and we go through this of these
events we do write tests we do and we do
a little deeper we've got people you
know hands on I got sample materials and
everything and we do it for JavaScript
tests as well and then we move on to
hacking and that's what's really fun and
we spent all day hacking people hive and
they form groups and they huddle around
specs and then come up with testing
plans and in the past we'd written tests
for html5 transforms backgrounds and
borders CSS values and Eunice up in
Seattle we had a cool group doing
pointer events which that spec is moving
along really rapidly some of the web
apps and some guys it came to our Paris
and I'm from Sweden and did some web RTC
testing which was cool and unusual and
then of course the people are
contributing their every test we write
is a contribution to the w3c so to date
over actually it's probably more like
over 1,300 tests at this point every
event we can find interoperability
if you've ever loaded a web page in
multiple browsers this probably isn't a
surprise they look different and these
are the kinds of things we're trying to
but we want them to look the same we had
a really cool on in Seattle a couple of
weeks ago where the guy loaded his tests
as JavaScript tests in three different
browsers they all had different results
and none of them had it right the spec
was very clear all three were wrong and
all three were different from each other
and if anybody's done web development
this should almost no surprise to him
and this is exactly the kind of stuff
that we're trying to get it we also find
spec bugs they're totally up for
scrutiny to it's entirely possible with
all the iterations and all the arguments
and all the changes you know even if
it's as simple as typos or
inconsistencies there's a bug database
in a process for that and believe me the
editors would love to have this feedback
they would love people looking at their
specs because ultimately it only makes
it better we've had some people come and
convert their own test Suites if you
work for a smaller shop and you've got
tests that you think are valuable that
you could want to contribute that come
to an event convert them do them on your
own we had a phonegap guys did convert
it in the Paris event the Cordova test
suite and contributed it back it was not
that I was a day of about five guys that
got around and converted there's from
their format they use jasmine into test
harness j/s format and I know there's
lots of other test Suites out there so
that's a really good cuz it's not really
doing a whole lot of extra work maybe
spending a day tweaking things to make
them fit into the wrec way and by the
way if there's a lot of those out there
the w3c is open to bending their ways
and accepting other formats leave you
know there were a ton of jasmine tests
out there maybe we can okay we'll look
so too has been test as is and
make a process for example knows I've
seen test infrastructure hacking
projects going on the guy the author who
wrote test harness jay s is from opera
James Graham he had a group of guys and
they were making improvements and
enhancements to the harness at one of
the event so so that counts too and then
we have experts that comedies events and
everybody prepares and mixed tutorials
and documentation and materials and
we're starting to really develop a nice
library of information and good stuff
and with Tokyo coming up we'll probably
have some Japanese content and we have
Charlie a promotion or a Beijing event
so it's even starting to get organically
localized just by the process of being
in these other countries and then we're
building community we're all here
tonight we're all part of the same
communities that's our super fun I mean
there's food is always really good
there's always stuff to drink there's a
sense of that you did something to
advance the web at the end of it you
make good friends your network they're
awesome these are some photos from
Beijing in San Francisco and Paris and I
didn't have time to get any Seattle
photos in there but we tweet it's on
from the account and there's a blurs
blog up there on Adobe's web platform
blog and so yay we're making the web a
better place all right so I'm going to
take you to Paris for two minutes and
let you get a glimpse of what that event
was like this is a video that really
sums it up and it was a really good time
when you
yes sir
so a useful
so sorry so I encourage you all to join
the movement come to an event if it
comes to your city or somewhere you're
traveling to there's lots of sponsorship
opportunities big and small you don't
have to have gobs of cash little tiny
things you can do to make it a better
it's truly community-based you can host
your own event they also don't need to
be huge to day events we can we're
looking to do more smaller like meetups
maybe you know 50 people or 100 people
in somebody's office for one evening you
don't have to do any of this if you
could just write tests there's materials
out there there's ways to get involved
so you can visit our website Tesla
forward org we have a w3c mailing list
that you can subscribe to tonight if you
want to see me or Larry McCluster after
this follow us on Twitter course or
hashtag is test twf and my name is
rebecca hub thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
