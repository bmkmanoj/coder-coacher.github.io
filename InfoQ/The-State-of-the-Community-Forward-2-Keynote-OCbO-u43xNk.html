you who are actually wondering how to
say my surname its store so you might
understand why i always say oh it's just
this weird surname starting with s like
don't even bar singing it with all your
wrist pipe seriously um anyhow um i was
i was really humbled when they've told
me to do at keynote in the morning apart
from for my afternoon session and of
course i fought oh I'm going to do this
great keynote I will talk about the
state of the community and then when I
was jet-lagged at free am today I fought
oh my god how am I even going to you
know talk about the state of the
community in 10 minutes so that being
said I had an entire talk written that
could probably take me 40 minutes to say
it was about open source how it came to
life in dat is how Richard Stallman gave
out his his manifesto how open source
and the notion of free software became
somewhat mainstream when Linux started
there were a lot of Linux distributions
and how time passed and there was there
was Mozilla is this torrid of open
source of some kind and then how Google
released chrome OS and Android an open
source how how open source is pretty
years old and it's so great and so
awesome and how how we had distributed
version control and I'm talking about
get in in 2005 how github changed the
way we write software and how we
collaborate but then I thought that's
not actually what I want to talk about
and I want to approach open source from
a little bit different perspective which
is community and we're all a part of
community JavaScript community design
community front community Ruby community
those smaller tribes intersect and
interact with each other all the time
so we are kind of like family but why
talk about community when we are talking
about open source and talk was supposed
to be the state of open source community
or open source in general well open
source was built on the premise of
collaboration on this basic human need
of being social it's spurred of the
willingness of sharing and contributing
to the community as a whole instead of
sitting alone in isolation which is
fundamentally against our nature as
humans it is this period of generosity
giving our time giving advice giving
free software and for the most part not
wanting anything back it is this period
of collaboration that contributes to our
ability to solve problems it's easier to
tackle problems as a collective than so
that's that's why we have friends that
is why when we feel really bad we go to
our friends and really just help me help
me deal with that because I don't know
what to do building better communities
and it's inseparably intertwined with
building a better self and I think a lot
of people fail to acknowledge or think
about it that way but community is built
from from humans we are the crucial
ingredient for communities so if every
single one of you sitting here and every
single one of anyone being out there on
Twitter wherever living wherever pays
attention to creating safer and more
welcoming spaces the whole system the
whole community will be will be better
and I kind of hate to be recommending
books at 9am and recommending self-help
books but there are free books that
really changed how I thought about
community and interaction with human
beings in general and I've seen a lot of
people having a lot of a lot of the only
fun reading them but also it changed her
perspective so I'm going to recommend
them anyway it's creative and
incorporated by Ed Catmull from Pixar
and nonviolent communication and
positive and intelligence and I do not
remember the outdoors and if you forget
the title
I will tweet about them again but it's
something that got me and many people
that I know started on working on
themselves as a goal for building better
communities practice empathy and
gratitude why because there are so many
people who are entering communities and
entering open sores in general and for
them is like unknown waters like they
they just started working with
technology or design or they've been
working on on designer or software but
on the realm not collaborating in and
they're scared and we need to have some
empathy for it for them that you know
they are just starting and they need
your help to get out there and in
gratitude towards most of all
contributions because people spend so
much time to make your lives better and
easier at work or personally so we
should be grateful for for both people
who are veterans and who are writing the
best frameworks and they are well known
but also for people who are newcomers
and they are putting themselves out
there and being so vulnerable but still
wanting to help and talking about
empathy and and and gravity I think it's
really important and I'm very happy that
this event has has serious approach to
code of conduct it is actually being
being considerate to diversity and
inclusivity for its and codes of conduct
because it's so easy to dismiss if you
are you I don't know if you've never
needed that or you don't personally
don't see a need of that but other
people do so let's have empathy look
around right now physically please all
of you just look around these people
sitting here and people who are you who
you are interacting with on a daily
basis they kind of benefit from your
help and you think that you might not
have enough knowledge or you might not
be awesome enough to be helping someone
but that's a lie you are more capable
than you realize you have impact and you
don't have a lot of people say well but
I'm not famous I don't have the social
credit on Twitter
or wherever else or get up that is not
true you don't have to have Social
Credit whatever that means to be helpful
and be awesome to someone from your
community this is michael rogers and
someone some of you might know him
personally or follow him on twitter and
one of the reasons why I'm mentioning
him when I'm talking about community and
being empowering is because he's
probably one of the most empowering
people that I've ever ever met in my
life and he has been praying his heart
to building awesome communities not only
in a node and JavaScript which he is
known for but but in general and he
encouraged me so much for as a designer
and foreign person to contribute to
JavaScript projects to to go out there
and to offer my help he he made me run
the CSS conf Oakland which was so
amazing he was so empowering and um I'm
not sure if I would be standing here if
it wasn't for him and people like that
like him the point being um you can be a
person like that you can be a mentor you
can be a mentor for someone in this room
or someone on the other side of the
world be open and communicate
compassionately there is there's the
human being on the other side and I know
it's harder to be compassionate
especially online because it's just a
bunch of characters on the screen and
and it's so figure out it's so hard to
figure out what someone is feeling what
someone intentions might be and it's
hard it is very easy to miss enter
people so it's very important to be to
be compassionate and and compassion
isn't you might think compassion is a
feeling for that you should have for for
people who are old and sick somewhere I
don't know and their life is kind of
kind of sad or and that's that's
compassion that's compassion towards
those people who are less fortunate but
that's not true compassion should be the
default the default feeling that you
have for for anyone you're interacting
with with this community or another
commonly
community as well life's most persistent
and urgent question is what are you
doing for others and it's not me it's
Martin Luther King and that's actually a
quote that I got from a talk that a
colleague very good friend of mine who
actually is working with me at and yet
Adam ball used in his presentation at
jay's confit you closing keynote called
people first and if you can remember
what I just said you should totally
watch it because it's amazing but I
think it's really really important to
remember that question remember the
question what are you doing for others
and does the thing that I'm doing right
now brings me value two questions for
you to ask yourself every single day
community is a group responsibility it's
not someone who is probably famous out
there who's managing the community for
you and you're just supposed to be
sitting here and not perfect I mean
participating but not trying to to build
a better community is our responsibility
it's our mutual mutual work for for
making a better community JavaScript
design committee committee in general of
programmers designers who ever so I
guess the most important takeaway in
this super hectic fast keynote is let's
remember that communities of group
responsibility and let's own it together
