dart tips fun little fact the dart
language spec doesn't mention the word
array but fret not my happy dartisans
start as many ways to store and retrieve
collections of objects out of the box
start supports four types of collections
with full-featured api's lists Maps cues
and sets an ordered ordered random
access or by a key
you'll find it in dart core libraries
let's get started first a bit of
taxonomy the root of darts collection
classes start at iterable an object that
implements iterable exposes read-only
access to a group of items the
collection class extends iterable adding
the ability to add and remove items the
rubber hits the road with the list set
and queue which implement collection you
can see that map doesn't extend or
implement collection but it's an
honorary member of the useful collection
type classes we'll talk about each
collection class in turn but let's start
at the top iterable just for
illustration here's an example of
generating an interval series of 5
numbers 0 through 4 most of the time
you'll iterate through actual collection
objects but it's cool to know you can
generate a pure iterable object we're
talking about iterable here so let's
iterate interval objects plane nicely
with 4 in loops because they can
generate iterators here's an example of
a for in loop using an iterable you can
think of the foreign code as syntactic
sugar for this code notice how a new
iterator is created and moved next is
called for every iteration the current
value from the iterator is accessed and
printed I don't know about you but I
find the 4 in version easier to read
still it's nice to know what's happening
under the hood an iterable object can do
much more than just iterate through
items iterable defines very useful
methods for filtering searching
transforming reducing and more here are
a few examples the last two examples
where and map illustrate intervals lazy
application of chaining for example in
the last example map returns a new
iterable without actually running the
mapping operation this means the actual
doubling operation doesn't take effect
until 2 list is called which actually
performs the iteration and stuffs the
results in the list there are many more
methods on iterable
I encourage you to check out the docs to
learn more let's move on to some
collection classes while the interval
interface defines read-only behaviors on
a group of items the collection class
extends iterable with the ability to add
and remove items list set and Q are all
collections so let's start with list the
list class is an ordered collection of
items with zero based index retrieval in
other words if you're looking for arrays
they are masquerading as lists here is
some example code that uses lists note
that you can declare lists in two ways
using the constructor from the list
class or using the square bracket
literal remember that lists implement
collection which extend iterable so a
list can be filtered transformed and
more you can see here an example of
filtering the list for only items that
start with the letter a it's important
to know that accessing an index that is
out of bounds throws a ranger dart
doesn't keep on trucking it tells you
right away that something is wrong
keeping with an ordered theme let's now
look at queues like lists a queue is an
ordered collection
unlike lists however a queue is
optimized for addition or removal from
either end of the collection the
trade-off is that there is no index
access to elements in a queue use a
queue if you need to efficiently add or
remove items from the head or tail of a
collection a Q and R can be treated like
a first in first out or last in first
out data structure here is some example
code that uses a queue notice the add
first remove first and add last remove
last methods the queue is efficient
because it doesn't allocate a whole new
data structure when new items are added
or removed from the head or tail
sometimes you don't care about
maintaining order but you do care about
ensuring there's one and only one item
in a collection in contrast the lists
and queues which are ordered and allowed
duplicate items a set is unordered and
does not allow any duplicate items
here's some example code that uses a set
notice how the length of the set is -
even though I called add 3 times also of
note is the intersection method which
returns a new set containing only the
items that are found in this set and
another collection finally let's look at
the map class maps known as dictionaries
or hash maps in other languages contain
key value pairs Maps associate keys the
objects for easy retrieval they're great
for fast access to arbitrary objects if
you know
key keys must be unique and cannot be
known here is some example code that
uses map you can see how maps work great
with their literal values don't be
fooled though maps aren't like
JavaScript objects in Dart only objects
that implement the map interface can be
treated as a map a particular notice put
if absent which will call a function and
insert its result only if the key does
not exist in the map darn ships with 4
main collection types lists queues sets
and maps as honorable mention each has
their own trade-offs and optimizations
to help you keep them straight here's a
handy way to look at them if you need
key value pairs there's one option map
if you need to contain unique items set
is your only option
this leaves two ordered collections
lists and cue lists are great for
arbitrary access to items anywhere in
the collection but changing their size
can be costly queues are great if you
only operate on the head or tail of the
collection but there's no efficient way
to access a specific element in the
middle of the collection lists sets and
queues are iterable which means you can
filter transform search and chained them
you can find these collection classes
and more in the dark core libraries
which are bundled in every dart SDK and
editor release there's a lot more
functionality that these classes we
barely scratched the surface I encourage
you to dig into the API Docs to learn
