my name is Matt Harrington I'm a
developer evangelist here at Microsoft I
live in work in San Francisco actually I
work out of this office I work with
Bruno I blog at a blog on MSDN which is
where Microsoft employees blog you can
find it at this short bitly link here
and I tweet at mh4 one five initials in
the area code the level set Windows
Azure is the cloud offering from
Microsoft so who knows who does not know
what Amazon Web Services is everyone
knows what Amazon is ec2 okay so I'll
just use ec2 languages like the lingua
franca here so Azure is our version of
ec2 essentially so how many people are
deployed on Amazon expected a fair
number of you guys how many people are
deployed like on Rackspace a bunch of
people - how about giant I knew you
would be and I their hands over here for
joint interesting and about Heroku - is
there a big one that I've missed here
probably got it
okay thanks so to do some level setting
here I'm just gonna bring everyone up to
speed with a couple PowerPoint slides
about what asher is and then i'm going
to dive into some code for a sample
application that uses as your fort for
storage so on the left here we have
traditional software so if you're
hosting in your own data center and you
maintain everything you maintain the
networking the storage the servers the
VMS the date of the runtime everyone
knows this you're just running an
application in your own data center this
is very familiar and then on the right
we have three varieties of cloud
providers the first one is called
infrastructure as a service or is and
the best-known provider of this I think
is Amazon so the bottom four components
here networking storage servers and
virtualization are managed by the vendor
in this case by Amazon on top of that
everything in orange you manage yourself
as a developer or as a DevOps person or
as a Systems Manager or some
like this so you're going to choose your
operating system so Amazon supports
multiple operating systems you choose
your operating system you're going to
patch it you're going to take care of it
you're going to choose your middleware
layer and of course you're going to
manage your own data and your own
application in the middle here moving
over to the right we have platform as a
service or Pass paas and this is what
asher is so azure is fundamentally
different from what we traditionally
think of as Amazon Web Services so as
you can see the bottom four components
are the same networking storage servers
and virtualization we manage that on top
of that we manage the operating system
the middleware and the runtime so the
advantage of this is that you don't have
to manage this stuff yourself so I go to
many many cloud talks and so many of
them are actually less about what the
startup or what the cloud offering does
and more about how they solve certain
DevOps problems and actually those are
kind of fun problems to solve you think
about how am I going to do change
configuration or configuration
management and huge clusters of systems
how am I going to roll out my updates to
lots of systems and things like that
those actually are kind of fun problems
to solve but I wonder if it actually
makes economic sense for startups to do
this because you can use a platform as a
service provider like in the middle and
it's just done all for you so when I
came to the Microsoft sphere of
influence 12 months ago I was especially
attracted to platform as a service and
to Azure on top of this of course you're
going to manage your own data in your
own application and on the right we have
software as a service so everything is
in green everything is managed by the
vendor so this is a typical example here
would be Microsoft Dynamics and online
CRM and enterprise resource planning
offering from Microsoft or
salesforce.com I'm sure everyone has
heard of salesforce.com everything is
managed so just I wanted to make sure
we're all on the same page here
what I'd be talking about here asher is
the platform as a service offering here
in the middle so what is in Azure this
is a really simple slide here so again
I'll be using the jargon from the Amazon
world since everyone seems to be
familiar with that we have core services
we have a compute offering and this is
akin to Amazon ec2 so this is just the
computer in the sky compute we have
storage within storage we have a no
sequel offering we have a queueing sauce
a queueing offering and we have a blob
storage
offering so this is akin to s3 I believe
from Amazon and on the right we have a
traditional sort of industrial or
enterprise strength relational database
server so we have sequel server in the
cloud and on Amazon I believe they offer
my sequel to the right gear we have a
bunch of sort of supporting services we
have a caching layer we have security
services there's a service bus for
connectivity there's a data market so if
you have a lot of data that you actually
want to sell you can put it up in the
cloud and then charge per request you
can have applications that you put up in
the cloud and in charge every time
someone uses some things like that so
there's actually quite a quite a few
more application services than I have
displayed here so that's all I have for
PowerPoint I just want to make sure we
were all on the same page about what
what Azure was you can call it as your
also if you're from Europe or Canada or
something but the way I describe it is
as your rhymes with badger so okay so
next I'm going to talk about node on
Windows so of the people using node who
raised their hands earlier or who didn't
raise their hands and want to raise it
now how many people are actually using
it on I win dough's okay a couple of you
guys I assume everyone else is probably
using like a Mac laptop and then
deploying either to Linux or to Solaris
in the cloud if you're using joint or
something like that so there's really a
lot of love for JavaScript at Microsoft
there's a lot of fans of JavaScript and
you'll see it and you see it in a lot of
products now and you'll see it a lot
more products coming out and so the
story is a couple of years ago we
noticed that node was taking off in
popularity and we just wanted to get on
that earlier versions of node did not
run well on windows so version 0.4 if
node and before had to be run in cygwin
cygwin project is really cool it allows
you to run POSIX applications on top of
Windows but it's not awesome it's not
it's things aren't very very fast on it
so we worked with giant to port nodes to
Windows and in version 0.6 Windows is
fully supported and it runs just as fast
as it does on Linux and it's done the
way that this has accomplished is by
using a sort of shim layer called libuv
and in the linux world you do i/o
through something called a polls a poll
and then on Windows you use i/o
completion ports and these are really
kind of complicated low-level things
it's hard to find experts who are who
know both of those worlds really really
well even like you know the top
programmers out there so live UV is an
abstraction that makes this a lot easier
and when we worked with giant two-port
no two windows in a native way of course
the node team said there's no way we're
going to accept a regression and
performance when we support Windows and
we said fair enough we don't want that
either
and actually it got no it got a little
bit faster for for the other platforms
also when windows support came out we
also have a full-time Microsoft employee
who's a node commuter named Igor
Stankowski so there's really again
there's a lot of love for for node and
there's a lot of love for JavaScript at
Microsoft not only that but there's a
lot of love for the asynchronous
programming model that Bruno talked
about earlier so Windows 8 which will be
coming out soon everything that you do
in Windows 8 for so-called metro-style
applications is done asynchronously so
if you want to write an application that
blocks you can't so you do everything a
synchronously and that's what that's the
same sort of philosophy that's in that's
a node so if you wanted to get started
with Windows Azure the first place to go
is Windows Azure comm there's a free
trial so there's a three month free
trial we do require a credit card but we
never charge it that we require the
credit card only to prevent fraud
however we give you like a monthly
allotment for three months and however
if you wanted to exceed that if you
wanted to use like more than your
monthly allotment you would check some
box saying like go ahead and charge my
credit card after that we would continue
to charge your credit card after three
months but it's not typically if you
don't do that if you don't jump through
that hoop we don't charge your card
after three months I just want to spread
that word other cloud providers such as
Amazon also require credit cards so
there's nothing unusual there and the
all the offerings are described here but
what I wanted to point you out to or
point you guys to is the develop center
here and you can see on the right these
are the officially supported SDKs from
us so of course that net is fully
supported so we're Microsoft we make net
that's supported quite well no js' here
Java and PHP have official sort of
sdks from Microsoft and you can run
other applications also like from Python
or C++ or something like this basically
anything that runs on Windows will run
in Windows Azure if you click into the
node area here you'll see all sorts of
tutorials on the left so if anything
that I talked to you tonight sounds
interesting you want to go back to
Windows Azure comm and look for all of
these tutorials over here so I think
we're gonna take a break so we're gonna
hold questions but feel free to come
find me and I'll answer them so thanks
guys
