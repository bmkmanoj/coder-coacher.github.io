front-end developer I am also a t-shirt
with maracanã actually have a boot camp
coming up April sixteenth in New York
City if any of you are from the east
coast that's where I'm from but i'll
also be back in San Francisco I think
sometime in june for Marikana again i
wrote a couple books i co-wrote the
first one with the orange robot with
estelle whale and Louie Lazarus which
has done really well and was a really
awesome book to work on and then more
recently this other one learning CSS
animations and transitions and I'm super
excited that i can say that both of my
books have robots on the cover I think
that's a really big achievement um and
sometimes I I kind of have like two
lives I used to work on Wall Street and
now i'm really into financial reform so
i actually occasionally pop up on the
Rachel Maddow Show sometimes so if you
ever turn on MSNBC and see someone that
kind of looks like me it probably is me
but that's neither here nor there and
just one other warning about me I might
talk about cats at some point in this
presentation so if you hate cats I
apologize okay so that's me I want to
know a little bit about you guys before
I start so who's use CSS transitions
already okay pretty much all of you
sweet and then who's used in CSS
animations keyframe animations okay
about half okay and this is the most
important question so I want you to pay
attention who has visited the Pirates
door in the mission okay good so see
these people talk to them or find the
pirate store i believe is 826 Valencia
you can get an eye patch and true story
my friend Ingrid he's from San Francisco
said that I should buy an eye patch wear
it for the duration of the talk and not
acknowledge that I was wearing an eye
patch and as you can see I failed to do
that but maybe next time I'm so I'm
really into words so before we get
started I just want to kind of like to
find what we're talking about so when we
talk about animation we go back like to
the etymology the
werd actually kind of about spirit and
life and breathing life into things and
so really what I want to talk about
today is not anything crazy complicated
not any kind of multiple chained flash
style animation but it's actually a
couple of really simple examples that
you can whoa sorry that was inevitable
simple things that you can do to sites
that you already have just to kind of
add a little bit of like pep and pizzazz
and a little bit of like life and
movement so that's that's the goal now
the reason I think that animations are
important and worth taking the time to
add even to a site that works fine
without them probably most of all is it
because it can provide important
feedback to the user so it can give them
this sense that oh this action that I
took was responded to was received by
the website and it can be used in that
way and I think that that's really
important and really helpful the other
thing is just more fun right it can make
it more immersive it can make it more
entertaining and interesting and more
like a real rich experience and then I
guess the last reason is just there's
really in my mind no excuse not to
animate a handful of things on your
sites because chances are your site has
an image on it somewhere and insights
that are not going to support sites in
browsers that are not going to support
these animations if you animate an image
or add some kind of transform that image
is still going to show up right you just
won't see the animation so it's a really
good idea in my mind to just add a
little bit of extra flair to things that
are going to show up regardless but then
for all of us who are using modern
browsers we get to see a nice little
interesting you know rotation or some
something like that so it seems like
most of you know this already but just
just to like make sure that everybody's
on the same page i'm just going to go
through this a bit quickly just like the
basics about how this works so there's
two kinds of animations that you can set
and css3 there's transitions and key
frames or CSS animations i'll use those
two terms interchangeably transitions
are great because they're fast because
the browser is actually saying okay you
had a property that was great
you changed it to blue and I'm going to
interpolate the difference between green
and blue and the browser is really fast
at doing that and just in case you don't
know that word interpolate it just means
when there's two points it's figuring
out how to get from one point to another
and if there's multiple points it's you
know some computer figuring out how to
get from A to B the C to D to e so it's
fast but there's no built-in way to
repeat it so if you want to do some nice
little thing on a loop that transitions
not the best it's also not great if you
want to do anything more complicated
than this sort of like on off a to be
green the blue 200 to 100 big too small
so keyframes are going to be a little
bit slower because you're taking over
the responsibility from the browser of
doing that not all the interpolation
because you're still going to define
some significant intermediate points but
the browser is not doing everything and
so it's going to be a little bit slower
but it's much more flexible and there's
a lot more options so it's so like 360
not 360 birdseye again most of you
probably know this but just in case the
two things that you must use if you're
going to use a transition are these two
properties what is the property you're
trying to transition and what is the
duration of that transition and here's
an example of what that would look like
there's some additional ones that you
can use transition timing function and
transition delay just quickly this is
what the different transition timing
functions look like so the default is
called ease there's linear there's ease
in which is a little bit slower at the
beginning these out is a little bit
slower at the end and then you can
define your own which is what this cubic
Bezier one is and so who's seen this
tool before most of some of you this is
awesome so this is Leah Moreau whose
name I don't know how to pronounce her
last name but she I'm such a fangirl for
she's amazing so this is a way to create
your own custom timing function and a
timing function is just the rate at
which the animation plays and so once
I've created my own custom
function here I can click go and it will
compare my custom function to the
default which is ease or I can compare
it to linear and see how it plays and
one thing that I mentioned on this slide
that you might have seen this was from a
couple years ago that she put together a
really good talk ten secrets you may not
know about CSS and she just followed it
up in February with ten more secrets
both worth watching both are linked on
the slides where she mentioned that you
can make up bounce kind of an animation
happen if you extend the cubic Bezier
beyond the 0 to 1 values and so if you
watch this little i guess thats pink you
see how it goes past the end and then
sort of bounces back if you make a
Bezier curve like this you can get that
little sort of pop back and that's one
of the things that she covers in this
talk which is worth watching if you
haven't seen it already so this is just
an example of using the shorthand so we
can combine all of these properties
together into the shorthand transition
you don't need to specify them all but
if you wanted to specify them all it
would look something like this so let's
say when a change happens to background
color we want that change to happen over
the course of two seconds we want the
timing function and the rate at which
that animation plays to follow this ease
pattern which is this blue one and we
want to delay it by a second before it
begins so transitions are really about
setting up an animation that's going to
fire as soon as a change happens to the
property you want to pay attention to
the transition of and you can specify
multiple transitions on a single element
oops oh this is code not a text area so
if I just had a second one just like
this after this I could have a comma and
then I could have a second transition so
if i want to set up a different
transition for color with a different
duration than i want for background
color i can do that I just need to run
through the whole list of properties and
then comma and then start over again
so let's get practical I always try to
look around at sites who are using
animations in a way that's clever and
and when I say clever i don't actually
mean complicated i mean simple but like
helpful so delta has this search box
that when you focus on it expands
nothing really complicated happening
here but i really like that because i'm
really used to kind of not knowing
whether or not i have focused on a given
input field and i think that this is a
really simple thing that is makes it
really clear where your focus is and
it's really quite easy to accomplish so
i really liked it when i noticed it
they're doing some other things here
like this expands when you load the page
which is another little transition that
they have our vegas when you highlight
but this is quite easy to replicate so i
just have it here on this slide so you
can see when I focus it expands and
that's really about it and so the way
this works you can probably guess how it
works so the input field has a class
search field I set up a transition okay
when the width changes let's change the
width / point eight seconds cool are
starting with is 10 ms which looks like
this and then on focus we change the
width to 15 ms and it just expands if
you want it so right now it's extending
out i always get confused when i'm doing
a presentation if that's my left or my
fri it's expanding out that way if you
wanted to expand out the other way you
basically just have to change the text
alignment and it will expand out the
other direction and if you align it in
the middle then it will expand out
evenly in both directions so you can use
the text alignment to dictate how you
want the box to expand
so that's just a simple example of how
you might use a transition to give your
user some feedback about their action
and where their focus is on this is
another example that I saw on the web
little inspiration I didn't even know
about this site this is great so if you
want to buy something for yourself and
you have no money and you want to ask
your friends to buy it for you share a
gift calm so pay attention to this
little triangle so they're using some
jQuery to detect where I'm scrolling and
as I scroll down to different sections
it just moves little navigation pointer
around and I just thought that looks
kind of neat you know I need to go fast
or slow but all this is is a bit of
jQuery to detect the scrolling and where
the scroll is so I think it's using like
offset and top in jQuery but the
animation is just a transition so I have
another little example to replicate this
it's much more simple than that it's not
using scrolling at all let me just show
it to you before I talk about the code
so basically the way this works let me
just show you how it works so you click
on the individual ones and it just moves
the triangle around so I just have a
little bit of jQuery so I am basically
watching for the click event on these
three ID selectors which are just these
Li elements that make up looks messed up
when I'm all smushed but then make up my
navigation so that's this line I ad in a
class that is set to the ID of the
elements I've clicked so if I've clicked
about it adds the class about to the
triangle and the triangle is this div
that's just that little triangle do
people know how to make that triangle
with the borders most people so if
you've never done this before it's it's
kind of fun the first time you do it
this triangle is just a div with like a
height and like a height
one and a width of zero with a left
border and a right border set to
transparent and a bottom border set to
green and you know the bottom border is
15 pixels so then you get a transparent
border a transparent border green and it
creates that bevel and you get the
triangle so it's just a border so yeah
so I'm adding this class about blog or
home to my little div depending on what
I've clicked and then the transition
which is why we're all here is again
quite simple I'm just paying attention
to changes to margin left and any change
to margin left should happen over one
second and so here I just sort of have
it's kind of just like a CSS switch
statement almost if the class is set to
home the margin is 4.2 if it's about its
10.2 and if it's blog at 16 points you
and that just gets me the result i
showed you before which is just this
little guy moving around as i click so
again nothing too fancy but i thought it
was a neat effect and it's pretty easy
to add this is really just a repeat okay
this is my favorite one this is another
one from leah from her talk in February
so let me just show this to you first so
like do people know what a light boxes I
assume people know what that yeah so
with a lightbox you typically have
something that either spreads out wide
and then goes tall or goes tall and then
spreads out wide and you get an effect
kind of like that and it's usually
accomplished by JavaScript and then you
sort of reverse it when you close the
overlay and so in Leah's talk she
basically described how to do this with
just CSS basically and so the way this
works is there's two transitions set up
there's basically two elements in this
case I'm doing it on the hover action so
in this case by default
i am going to transition with over the
course of one second and height also
over one second but with a delay of one
second so that means that the width is
going to go first the height is not
going to change at all and then once the
width is done then the height will
change so that's how I get the sort of
opening and then the growing like that
so that sort of on the way in I guess
that's on the way out sorry the weigh-in
is on the hover and so on the way and
it's just the opposite the height goes
first and then the width waits for a
second and then the width goes so
they're just multiple transitions one on
two different elements basically and you
can just see that they're just slightly
reversed we could do them the same if we
wanted to have the same behavior both
ways but I think it looks a little bit
better to do it different so yeah I'm
not a huge fan of it sort of smashing up
like that and then going and this is
used on the w3 comp homepage and it's
also used on web platform gorg so if you
click on any video on the web platform
morgue you get this effect and it's all
powered by CSS transitions and I do not
want to play this video right now and
then when I click this it shrinks back
down and so obviously there's a little
bit of you know jquery JavaScript sort
of triggering that but the animation is
all done with really those two two
simple lines here and here so I really
like this effect a lot
mmm kitten okay um talked about that
okay so that's my picture of a kitten in
a glass of beer for you there's no
explanation other than that um okay so
this is shifting gears so transitions
are cool they're also quite simple
there's only so much you can do and
can't loop them you also can't do more
than a to be so if you wanted to do
something like this little bouncing
spring you're kind of out of luck
because this bouncing spring kind of it
expands and then it goes contracts and
then expands a little less and then it
contracts and then it expands even a
little less and so you can't do that
with a transition because you're just
going from A to B so if we want to do
something like this we need a keyframe
animation so again I'm just going to
assume that you're rusty I'm sure you're
not but might as well refresh so the way
we set up a keyframe is a two-step
process first we set up what are called
the keyframes and these are kind of like
if you think about like Walt Disney
cartoons and how they used to have the
individual cells these are kind of like
that except we get to skip a bunch of
the frames we just get to define the
ones that are really important and then
the browser figures out the rest so in
this infamous case you either have a
zero percent to a hundred percent or the
key word from and to and so this is
basically your starting point and where
you want to go and so this sets up your
frames but will not play the animation
until we call the animation property and
then this is just a shorthand this is
that this is how long we want it to take
this is how much we want it to repeat an
infinite will repeat it infinitely and
then here's our timing function so who
remembers the 80s I didn't manage to put
the audio tag on this but one day I will
so this is basically that right so what
am I doing here I'm saying rotate y
begin at 0 degrees turn all the way
around to 360 and then do it infinitely
do it over 18 seconds this is it
basically the output of the previous
slide plus a little bit of extra stuff
there is just a couple things i should
mention about this since this is a 3d
transform and i know this is not a 3d
transform talk but just briefly so neck
regular rotate or rotate z is like
rotating like that rotate why is like if
this is my y-axis we're rotating about
the Y and rotate X if here's my ex we
rotate about my ex there's a problem
with using these without a magical
property and shout it out if you know it
what is the property I need to set
before I do 3d transforms I don't think
I heard it its perspective and the way I
think about this is kind of like when I
go to the museum by default this
property called perspective is zero
perspective zero is like going to the
museum and putting your nose right up on
a canvas or really close to the canvas
and it's kind of cool because you can
see the like texture of the paint but
you cannot see the composition when
you're at the museum and you want to see
the composition you have to take this
like metaphoric will step back from the
painting and then you can see the whole
composition perspective is kind of like
that by default when we do a 3d
transform and perspective is set to the
default which is zero it's just going to
look Schmidt it's not going to look 3d
so we need to set perspective to
something like 500 or 800 seems to be
the sweet spot and then we'll be able to
actually see the 3d transform um I can
show you this just really quickly in
this code I just wanted to mention that
though so here it is just webcam
perspective 800 and that has to be on
the containing div for some reason yeah
question or comment
there's something called preserve 2d or
sorry preserve 3d but I do have that set
what's the you mean the point at which
it kind of turns and it's 180 degrees
not that I know of because that's kind
of I guess what I would expect to happen
what would you expect it what would you
want to happen oh the very edge yeah
that would be cool I suppose that if you
built it in three dimensions this is
just like a flat pain with no I guess
depth I suppose if you added a depth
that you could do that and achieve it i
just haven't tried it myself but that's
a good question that would be fun to try
okay let me go back because we're
talking about keyframes ok so again just
review there's a bunch of properties you
can set to that are not present in
transitions that you should know about
well three iteration count how many
times you want it to loop 1 10 5
infinite animation direction which is
let's see I'm like looking for a prop if
I'm making this thing like go like that
and I don't set animation direction to
reverse its going to go here and then
jump and here and then jump if I set
animation direction to reverse and I've
set my interation count to two or more
it's going to go like that as opposed to
going here and then jumping back to
where it was so reverse just lets you go
back and forth and then fill mode is
really important and so I have them just
a little slide about it so this has to
do with whether or not the styles that
you apply to your key frame stick around
after your key frame is over so just by
way of example so these both have the
same animation but do you see how one of
them stays purple and the other one
flips back to light blue which was the
original color I just want to do it one
more time so the top one flips back
once days purple the bottom once these
purple because it has animation film
mode set to forwards which basically
means whatever your final key frame was
apply it even after the key frame has
finished playing by default animation
film mode is set to none which just
means whatever style you had and key
frame one hundred percent I don't care
about and going back to the way the
element originally was so there's four
words which is the one I use the most
there's backwards which is basically
whatever is in key frames 0 will stick
and that makes sense if you're
alternating and you end on let's see one
two even number so if i wanted to
alternate twice that would mean i was
ending on the zero-percent keyframe if i
want that to stick around i should say
backwards and if for some reason i want
the zero-percent keyframe to apply
before i begin animating and i want the
one hundred percent keyframe to apply
after i'm done animating i can use this
value both okay so who's used this
library some of you this is great this
this guy that made this is awesome so
this is just a bunch of keyframes for
you to use just a bunch of templates so
you can customize it and choose which
affects you want you can get all of them
or you can do what I like to do which is
just check it out on github and see how
we did it so I really just like to kind
of look at his key frames and see what's
going on so like you can see this
bounced one so i should mention what's
happening here i mean you can probably
guess right this is just like grouping
selectors regularly is in CSS we want
the zero-percent keyframe and the twenty
percent and the fifty percent keyframe
to all get the translate y of 0 which is
handy because you don't want to have to
list these all out manually so this is a
very handy tool especially as you're
getting started and want
kind of figure out different effects
that you might want to apply to your
buttons fade up and out it's all kinds
of good stuff bouncing down so there's
just one thing I want to make sure i
mentioned i'm not sure if i have a slide
about it oh I do I have a slide about it
later okay so this is just a silly
example I didn't wear my eye patch so I
thought I would make a weird pirate
thing I don't know I found this on open
clipart I think it's supposed to be an
alien OOP where did my alien other areas
so the way this works is you have this I
a little bit creepy it has a keyframe
animation set up it takes two seconds
it's infinite and it alternates which is
why the I kind of goes around and then
back get around and then mech I don't
know it's not very natural but this is
like an alien pirate so I don't know
what you want so here's the rotation
it's just from zero degrees to 360 the
only thing that's tricky about this is
getting the transform origin right so
the fifty percent was pretty easy the 30
pixels I had to think about so let me
just slow this down for one second so
basically i wanted to rotate this about
peer and so the width of this i is its
twenty pixels wide i think but has a 10
pixel border so it's basically like 40
pixels by 40 pixels and so I set the
transform origin to be 30 which is about
here and so that's the anchor point by
which this thing rotates around so it's
I don't think it's totally perfect and I
could probably tweak it a little bit
better but it pretty much stays within
the confines of the socket I socket so
that's really the only tricky part about
doing something like this is getting
that transform origin correct
so and I should just mention this isn't
the very very end of the presentation
just a link but i have a whole separate
github project for the book that i wrote
and there's a different example of a cat
whose pupils don't go around they go
back and forth so if that's something
you're interested in doing i would
direct you to basically i'll just show
you real quick it's just my other github
page it's called learning CSS animations
and it's a chapter what chapter is it
well it's better to go to this and again
this is linked to at the end of the
slides chapter 9 so this is an example
of a different kind of pupil movement if
that's the kind of thing that you're
interested in okay just a few more
things here so I'm going to talk about
this bouncing spring so this one is more
complicated let's just look at it one
more time so it's just a spring it
recoils long it compresses it requires a
little less long and then it does that a
few times I'm only showing part of the
code on the slides oops but i just want
to show you this visualization because i
think it helps illustrate what's going
on so basically if we look at the first
two keyframes we start with a scale of 1
and then we increase it sorry decrease
it to a scale of 1 comma point 5 so
there's two values here because the
first value is with we're keeping the
with the same we're just shrinking the
height so what's happening here is we're
basically compressing the height by one
half between zero and thirty percent and
I tried to like make these to scale
they're not perfect but trying to give a
sense of how this works and then from 30
to 40 we're going from that one half to
one and a half times which is the
tallest it ever gets and then we just
sort of progressively keep doing the
same thing but shrinking down the recoil
each time and then we just get something
that looks like that
so these are nice they're not that hard
to do I did have to think about this I
did kind of have to draw it out I find
that I often have to do that when I'm
doing keyframes is it helps me if I just
kind of put it down on paper and think
about how much time I want to spend in
each sort of like a to BB to see that's
really in my mind that the trickiest biz
is getting the time incorrect okay so
this is like the main thing I want you
to think about when you leave which is
do I have some images on my website that
i could add a little bit of animation to
you know don't don't just background
image anime and this could be something
really really simple like this group
strike debt which is awesome and you
should look up if you've never heard of
them they basically by debt in the
secondary market that debt collectors
would buy and like how you and her ask
you and you know threaten you and they
buy it and they abolish it no questions
asked and they buy medical debt which
like right like it's no one's fault if
they get sick really so anyway i'm
showing you their site just because of
this it's very simple it's just a rotate
but i really like it and it looks really
nice and this is such an easy thing to
add to your site and like i know i'm a
dork and so obviously this makes me
happy maybe more than a regular person
but like I can't tell you how often I do
this so that's one thing you could do
this is a little more complicated so
maybe you have a site about getting on a
boat and maybe in the past you just had
a picture of a boat and a picture of the
ocean well why not animate your ocean
and animate your boat because you want
to entice people to get on your boat so
I just want to show you basically how I
did these three things and then we'll be
about done so the boat is pretty simple
it's a a rotation a rotate Z it's so I
mentioned this before you can start at
zero percent or you can use the keyword
from and then go to one hundred percent
or use the keyword to so I'm
transforming on the z axis I'm going
negative
degrees and then four degrees and
because I set it to alternate it goes
back and forth and then the timing
function ease in and out it's just a
little slower on this end and a little
slower on that end and then it just
Bob's back and forth and it's a rocking
boat and you can see a rockin here too I
used who's using the html5 boilerplate
so i use the html5 boilerplate
responsive so you know how you can click
so you can customize it and one of the
choices is a responsive site so i used
that as my starting point for this boat
site and so there are already some
predefined media queries and the way
that this template works is they want
you to design for mobile first right
that's like the new hotness right now
mobile first desktop next so by default
this is small and then I set up in my
knee dia query for anything over 67 68
to be a bit larger so this doesn't have
anything to do with the animations per
se but it makes it a little bit nicer
when I shrink this down as if I were on
a phone you can see the boat gets
smaller so that the boat wouldn't be
quite so large on the phone and I
actually did the same thing I don't have
a slide about it but actually changed
the transform origin so it's a little
bit subtle but the transform origin when
it's on a desktop is here because it was
on the right so I kind of wanted to make
it look like it was sort of off to the
edge and kind of bobbing up like that
and then when it's on a smaller device
the transform origin is in the middle
and it's doing it a bit more evenly it's
not a hugely it's a bit subtle but that
was just another thing that I played
around with with the media query on this
example so last part I think is these
ocean waves so these are two divs both
with background images the first div
basically has a background image set and
then I'm alternating the background
position so I'm just moving it back and
forth by pushing the background position
back and forth
and I do it over two seconds and I
alternate it and I make sure that it
sticks although this is probably
superfluous since it is infinite but if
this were not infinite this animation
film out for words would be important
and now this one is a bit harder to see
let me make it a bit bigger this is a
scale up so this is the second div with
the same background image and this is
what i wanted to mention before if you
are not changing the style of the
element between like the start of the
animation and what it is right now you
don't actually even have to specify from
so what i mean by that is my scale right
now is just scale one and that's what i
want the from to be I want from to be
scale one so since it's already scale
one I don't even need to specify from
the browser can figure that out so you
can save yourself some typing and you
know a bite or two if you are not
changing the way the animation begins
from the way the element is right now
you don't even need the from or the
zero-percent you can just jump to the
one hundred percent or the twenty
percent or whatever so this is just
scaling up with stays the same height
goes up one thing I should mention it's
not on the slide the transform origin is
down here by default transform origin is
in the middle so if it I've kept it in
the middle the waves would have gone
groan down as well as up which is not
what I wanted I only wanted the waves to
grow up so I had to change the transform
origin to be I said it to be fifty
percent where's my like if this is my
wave fifty percent a hundred percent so
it's down here so it grows up like that
and then I just use positioning to put
them basically on top of each other to
get an effect kind of like that so
um none of these are super complicated I
realized but really just what I wanted
to convey is that with a little bit of
work not too complicated of a keyframe
you can add some interesting nice little
effects to your site that really in my
mind make a difference they make them
much more interesting than if these were
static images and so I strongly
encourage you to do this and play around
in there and they're pretty fun if you
are interested in more complicated
things like flash style or flash
replacement or go into some more
complicated examples in my book and but
again you don't even need to buy the
book although I polish and say that you
can just look at the code oh my oh my
github page and poke around on that so
let me see what else do I have here so
just some shoutouts I guess I mentioned
this not too many of you raise your hand
totally check this out the html5
boilerplate will save you so much time
especially this responsive one because
you don't want to mess around like
riding your own media queries to start
with you want to leverage the the web's
brilliance and people like Divya and
Paul this is a presentation deck from
from Leah same with the lightbox example
and then I just credited our little open
clip art clipart friends so I realized I
should have done this at the beginning
of the talk but I didn't so these slides
are up now I will probably be tweaking
them because I just always do that they
will I'll just reuploaded to the same
place they are also up on github and
like I mentioned the code samples from
my book are up and the code samples from
this talk are also up so you can look at
it in the presentation you don't have to
look at it on github but I just find it
sometimes a little bit easier to
download it you know a zip file or pull
it to my git repository or whatever and
as opposed to kind of inspecting element
and looking around but both both options
are available and I'm happy to take
questions I'm happy to take them at the
or privately whatever you people want
but I really appreciate you coming in
you know end of the day it's a graveyard
shift so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
