two lovely daughters Olivia and Madeline
Madeline's the one on the right the
little artist and when I'm not hanging
out with my family I am a developer
evangelist here at PayPal I also like to
organize events inside organizing these
Bay Area Mobile events and I've been
developing apps for about ten years plus
mostly doing web apps but in the last
year or two I've gotten really excited
about what's possible in the mobile
space using JavaScript libraries and
html5 and when I came across PhoneGap
that really got me excited as well so
when I'm out and I'm talking to people
about PayPal and being an evangelist the
first question is sort of like so what's
up with PayPal and mobile how does that
work because when people talk about
in-app payments they often are thinking
about the App Store or the Android
Marketplace they're thinking about
digital goods selling virtual goods and
how does PayPal store to fit into that
space so driving home last night I was
thinking you know it's sort of like the
matrix right when neo is in the matrix
everything is digital it's all virtual
but then when you cross into the real
world
that's where PayPal can really help you
because PayPal is excellent for physical
goods person-to-person transactions
business-to-business transactions
because let's face it paying Apple 30%
for some physical good that you're
buying isn't going to really work as a
business model so I went online did a
little searching for some stats about
Commerce and mobile commerce in
particular I didn't pull these stats out
of my back-end but I did get them off
the internet
so take them for what they're worth
I think the second quote is most
interesting the fact that the four top
application stores are bringing in 3.8
billion dollars
projected for 2011 that's pretty
impressive especially if you think back
three years ago
how much was being how much money was
being spent on digital virtual goods at
that point but then if you think about
the actual bigger mobile commerce pie
that's out there I went and found these
crazy numbers out there as low as you
know 119 119 billion by 2015
you see we're talking about the future
here all the way up to close to a
trillion okay I'll let you all decide
where you think will be in 2014 or 2015
but what I am pretty sure about is that
this these large numbers are not going
to be driven by just digital and virtual
goods it's going to be commerce overall
that's where I think these numbers are
being generated from so I'm definitely
encouraging people to think about how to
expand their business into things beyond
digital and virtual because there's a
lot of opportunity that's going to be
out there some ideas I just decided to
throw up here on some slides or parking
meters I go to San Francisco and I hate
hate hate having to dig around for
quarters I don't know about you but the
people at Starbucks don't always like me
live come in and ask him for a bunch of
quarters split in Bell with friends I
have a friend who I go out to dinner
with I'll cover it with my credit card
and then he'll say I'll send you a check
so I'll get a check in the mail he's
finally started using PayPal so I'm
happy about that but if I had a large
party of friends it might be nice if I
could have an app to help me split the
bill and send them an email that they
could then send me a money via PayPal I
love going to the farmers market I
always have to swing by the ATM because
I have to have cash to buy my organic
strawberries
buying a group gift you know maybe
there's a there's an app that could be
built that would help you search for
that perfect gift for your coworker and
then collect the money from your fellow
co-workers and and then order the gift
online taxi fare just pretty much
anywhere that cash or credit cards are
being used if you can create a better
experience using one of these mobile
devices there's an opportunity and
there's an opportunity for payments to
be involved so there's a lot of
different providers out there why should
we take a look at PayPal a couple
reasons one is that PayPal is available
in 190 countries 25 currencies
it has 98 million active users and when
you think about 98 million active users
you need to think about the fact that
there's a bit of brand loyalty going on
there so when they see the PayPal logo
there's trust there's a feeling of yeah
I like shopping with PayPal they make
the experience a little bit easier and
that's something that we've been working
on is building SDKs and libraries for
different situations especially for
mobile and making it easier for people
to make their payments using mobile
devices I don't know about you but I
don't like having to type in on my
keyboard ever so if I had to put in my
my 16 digit credit card number plus my
address and all that information that's
a lot more painful than just typing in
my email address and a password
especially if it just remembers my email
address and maybe I just have to put in
my password every time and that gets
that provides less friction so hopefully
more conversions are going to happen so
tonight I'm just going to do a quick
demo of a PhoneGap plugin that was built
by chas of course he actually I did this
back in October he threw it up on github
and I started PayPal about four months
ago and I and I'm big on html5 so I was
asking around you know is there anything
for for PhoneGap and I went and I Google
then I found his
his project on github and decided to
start playing around with it so I
actually built a little demo to use the
plug-in all you need to do is have Xcode
and and PhoneGap installed on your
laptop and then you can download all of
Chaz's plugins so if you go to github
when you hit download you can get all of
the different libraries and you'll want
to dig in there and get the PayPal one
so I think this picture describes how I
feel right now I'm about to do my live
demo here so I'll escape oops my eyes
that here's our repository and if you
dig in there there's a folder called the
PayPal plugin and it's got a these
couple folders couple files and the way
I started was I just took a look at the
PayPal plugin - host which is actually
an Xcode project and it was it's a very
very basic example that has just a Buy
button so I decided to pretty it up a
little bit for tonight and I actually
use jQuery Mobile to create a donate app
for an NPR program that I'm a big fan of
called This American Life yeah if you
haven't listened to it it's on iTunes
it's a free podcast and amazing
storytelling so if you were to do this
from scratch what you do is you just
need to drag in the PayPal mobile
payments library there and this is a
native library that PayPal is created to
allow you to start your payment flow and
end it all inside of your app so it
doesn't spawn a separate browser it
doesn't take your user away from your
app to a - Safari where you have to log
into PayPal and then somehow get them
back to your app instead it actually
happens in native code it launches it
takes you through the payment process
the checkout process and then closes
back down and you're still in the app so
it's it's a very nice experience the
other thing you need to have in your
project are these two plugins
that has created you don't really need
to touch these too much except I'll say
this one this one situation which is
where you're actually pointing because
PayPal has a sandbox where you can do
test transactions without using real
money and then you have a live server
that you will do you'll want to use when
you deploy and there's also this
environment called nun where it's sort
of fake simulates the transaction
without ever talking to the server and
that's done in this dot M file and you
can see right here I currently have it
set for my app ID to be no app ID and my
environment to be none and just to be
safe I'm gonna clean all my targets
because when you change that I found out
today you have to clean your targets so
um I'm gonna go ahead and build it I
want to show you what it looks like
before I actually show you the
JavaScript code so hopefully this will
come up there we go okay so lovely
jQuery Mobile and I'm using the latest
libraries so hopefully no bugs
got a simple um you know select how much
you want to donate and then you click
the give Now button and now it's invoked
our payment library and takes you to a
login screen this is an actual sandbox
account but I could just type in you
know any password I want because I'm in
this sort of I'm gonna call it fake but
your offline mode basically so I'm not
going to hit a server I could put in any
email address any password hit login and
it's going to show me mo White's address
and for some reason her bank balance
never goes down so yeah you can test
this as much as you want but you'll see
it's got the the title of my I'm giving
my donation to and my ten dollars and if
I had donate it processes the payment it
says you know good job it was successful
I hit done and this little bit of
JavaScript that's pulling up this
you can remove that in fact you probably
would want to remove it but for
debugging purposes there's an alert if
you succeed you fail or you cancel and
then it has this fake transaction ID
that it's generating and it takes you
back to your app so that's a that's what
the app looks like and let me go back
and I'll show you the code so again I
base this off of the sample project that
comes when you download the plug-in so
just about everything in here was
already there when I got there I didn't
have to write all this code the only
thing I added was I wanted to add some
metadata because I wanted to have the
viewport go fullscreen and I added in my
jQuery libraries and then all this
JavaScript right here to these listeners
these were all here before so I just
went ahead and left them and this is it
the only code I had was this document
dot ready this a little bit of jQuery
and I'm simply binding a click event and
then I'm calling three different
functions in this plugin the first one
is my prepare function where I pass in
what type of payment I want to do you
can do hard Goods a service a personal
or a donation and based on what type of
payment that'll determine whether
there's going to be any fees involved if
it's a person a personal payment like a
person to person then there's no fee
attached to that if it's you know you're
sending it from one PayPal person to
another PayPal account the second thing
I do here is I go and I grab that amount
from my select field and I tell me I
tell what the recipient is if you're
using personal the recipient doesn't
have to be on the sandbox account but
when you do decide to run this with
sandbox then you're going to need an
actual a buyer and a seller basically so
this is my recipient or my seller
account so this is actually a real
account in my sandbox
I passed those into the set payment info
function and the third thing I do is I
actually call PayPal pay and that's what
triggers that login screen to pop up so
I'm gonna go back to let's go back to
the M file here and I'm going to
actually use the sandbox for a second so
I can show you what that looks like
kill that let's all have to change I
save it
oh it's still running so I can't I can't
clear my targets thank you where'd that
go
alright so I cleaned my targets and now
if I run it it's actually going to want
me to put in a real password here I
can't just put in a dummy one so five
dollars actually you know I'm feeling
generous I'll do 50 say give now and if
I put in just a junk password it's gonna
you know it's gonna try it fails so the
password is PhoneGap and I hit login and
now instead of Emma white it's actually
just showing one Main Street because
it's my sandbox account and I go ahead
and donate my $50 and when I'm done I
say done and there's our transaction ID
and the last thing I want to show you is
actually when you go into the sandbox
you can create your own account just go
to developer PayPal comm and here you
can create as many test accounts as you
want I actually created one for tonight
called tal for this American life and I
say enter the sandbox
this is I'm on the tightrope right now
because hopefully there's gonna be $50
showing up in here yeah there it is
$50 sweet okay cool so that's that's how
the sandbox works and you can create
it's like I said as many accounts as you
want here's the the PG the PhoneGap
account that I created so if I went in
there you'd see it was - seen 50 dollars
to go over there but I won't bore you
with that and then the last thing I
wanted to show you was where did I get
that sandbox API or that app ID that I'm
using right back here where did I get
this from you you when you're running on
sandbox um everyone can use the same app
ID so you go under you go to XCOM and go
to PayPal and then just scroll on down
to testing and click on testing come on
I'm on the wireless and over here on the
right you can see test app ID and
everybody uses that so this is built
with our mobile payment library which is
supported by our adaptive payments and
there's a lot of things you can do with
adaptive payments things like chained
payments and and parallel payments where
you're paying multiple merchants I want
to let you know that the this plugin for
PhoneGap only uses our simple pay that's
it I think Shaz just did it just sort of
for fun to kind of see like how we do it
but now that you know I'm here and I'm
really pushing for this I think we're
gonna definitely build that out for the
rest of the adaptive API features I
don't know if this is gonna be an
internal thing or a community thing I
actually have two of our members here at
BAM Paul and Karl if they're still here
there's ball and there's Carl they got
together and they have been building a
PhoneGap plugin for PayPal on Android
and they're getting close to having that
ready and they're gonna put it up on
github or something like that so that's
that was really excited to find that out
tonight and I think
about wraps it up for my part of the
demo and I didn't fall here's my email
address here's my Twitter handle if you
have any questions if you want to ask me
anything about PayPal api's or about you
know working with this plug-in I'd be
happy to chat with you about it and if
you have other questions you can always
go to XCOM slash mobile and that will
take you to all the docs in the SDKs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
