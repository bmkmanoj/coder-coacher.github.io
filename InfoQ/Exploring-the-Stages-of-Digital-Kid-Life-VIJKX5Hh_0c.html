myself my name is donna freedman mayor
and i've been in his business a long
time spent my career at Nickelodeon
Warner Brothers National Geographic and
I'm actually a former client of insight
kids and so I'm thrilled to be here
talking on their behalf today just
before we get started I want to get a
sense of who the audience is so how many
of you are sort of on the entertainment
business network side of things anybody
developers marketers other kinds of
business execs nice little summary so
why you're here today and inside kids we
really believe that there's if you want
to connect with kids in a meaningful way
there are two key things that you need
to do and the first is you have to help
them have fun that's obvious and that's
I'm sure what all of you are really good
at the second is that you have to help
kids do the work of growing up kids
every single day or learning and growing
and you know we're going to talk a lot
about what that means today but it's
really important as content creators
developers distributors to understand
who kids are and what's going on in
their lives in order to really make the
most engaging content for them so that's
that's what we're going to do just to
tell you a little bit more about insight
insight is a research-driven strategy
company that's really focused on
building inspiring and innovative
content of all kinds for kids and
parents we do a ton of work for
companies like Nickelodeon and Hasbro
and Crayola paramount DreamWorks and we
sort of summarize our mission at insight
in three words and that is truth plus
possibility equals inspiration and what
we mean by truth and what I'm here to
talk to you about today is that we
really focus on getting to that deeper
truth of who kids are why they do what
they do what motivates their decisions
what motivates their behavior and so my
goal today is to share
with you a bit of the truth of who kids
are and then hopefully highlight for you
a little bit of the possibilities what
does that mean for you as a zap
producers and developers in terms of the
kind of content that you can create to
connect with them and finally if I've
done my job well hopefully you'll leave
here a little bit inspired with a sort
of sense of confidence and vision about
oh okay I get it this is how I can
translate this into what I do every day
um so we're going to start by just
remembering what it's like to be 47 and
11 why we need this refresher because
the world that kids are living in today
is completely different from the world
that we grew up in it's driven by media
and technology in a way that was not
available to us and kids as you know are
so completely immersed in it and the
work of growing up that I talked about
earlier is has three components learning
playing and communicating and all of
these things overlap kids play to learn
kids communicators play you know so
these not these are not three individual
boxes but they are dimensions of the
work that kid zip do every day and what
we're going to see and what again you
kind of all know this but I think it's
important to just be sort of reminded of
some of these things as before I kind of
get into the details of who kids are
from a developmental perspective so kids
are still doing everything on the right
kids still do read out of books and they
still do have marble notebooks that they
write in and they still do their times
tables and they actually learn how to
you know write numbers with crayons and
pencils but they have all of these
additional tools available to them on
the right so you know Google and iPads
and computers and Excel so again the
stuff on the left hasn't gone away the
tools have just expanded the same is
true in terms of playtime so again the
play patterns that we see on the left
you know in terms of you know
gameplay sports play music role modeling
nurturing all of those play patterns
still exist kids still do them in the
physical world but again all of the
options available to them have grown so
exponentially you know you can play
sports on the way you can create music
with guitar hero you can nurture
characters and build worlds in farmville
or Club Penguin um and the type of
communication that's available to kids
has also expanded so thankfully kids are
still snuggling up in bed with their
grandparents and their parents and using
walkie-talkies and things like that but
obviously you know just the digital
world has opened up an incredible new
way the kids are communicating with
their friends with their family with
their world um it's also really
important to remember that kids are
sponges and every engagement with
contents provides an opportunity for
them to learn and I think it's really
important to remember that they are
going to learn whether we want them to
or not and so you know we've been
starting to see and hear when we're
talking to kids and you know I even hear
a little bit about my kids I think as we
go through i have an almost five and a
seven year old so you know to them they
don't understand the concept of linear
television you know they when they want
to see what they want when they want it
they think they can pause the television
you know we're seeing kids trying to
swipe television screens or expands you
know and and close so you know what you
just have to remember that every single
thing that you are doing is a learning
moment from the kids point of view and
it is important to say that you know we
feel really strongly that you have a
responsibility that we all have a
responsibility as content creators for
kids to provide good role models and you
know good learning opportunities and I
think it's important to note here and
again you all know this but you know
moms and parents and gate keepers are so
critical for kids you know at throughout
their lives but most specifically in
that sort of
you know up to seven eight nine and we
sort of talked about that there's a
model in just thinking about sort of
your relationship with the parents and
they're sort of three raised the parents
react to media content for their kids
they either promote it permit it or
prohibit it so obviously you don't want
to be in that prohibit column you know
you just you don't want to be that like
I'm not going to let you watch or do or
play or by X you know it's okay to be in
the permit column but what you really
want to be is in that promote box you
know where your and especially in you
know the app world where the parent had
mayor in many cases is doing the
purchasing you want to be that place
where P that kids are going to the
parents are going to first and they know
they're going to get a positive
experience for their kid and again you
know this but again it's just important
to sort of state it up front that you
know kids today expect 360 degree brand
experiences with the content and
characters that they love so again as
app developers it's just really
important to remember that you what you
are creating is just part of a larger
ecosystem in a kid's life and from a
kid's point of view you know there is no
boundary between what is digital and
what is physical they just don't think
about it you know to them it's not a
world with lots of little circles it's
just a world filled with the stuff that
they love so I think it's just important
to remember that as you as we as we move
forward so as I said I'm going to focus
now my conversation on really talking
about those key developmental stages
we're going to look at kids from a
social emotional cognitive and physical
developmental point of view just again
as a refer many for many of you it might
be a refresher for many as Lana said
maybe this is this is new information I
do want to put the a very very important
caveat out there which is I am talking
about the average every single kid is
different all kids development develop
at their own
stage and at their own pace so what I am
talking about is sort of the overall
average you know let's I don't want to
you know sort of kids can't be so easily
put into a box so who kids are from a
social emotional perspective first of
all it's important to remember family is
central I mean that is the core of their
being at this at this time and I was
actually thinking about it in the prior
session when there was a little bit of a
discussion about social apps and the
idea that kids and parents you know kids
want to play with parents parents want
to play with kids that makes complete
sense from a developmental point of view
you know again I have a four and a half
year old thankfully I am still one
hundred percent the center of his
universe he just told me last week he
wants to marry me that made me very very
happy um so you know from a social point
of view yes they may beginning to you
know start playing with one friends but
family is the center the center of their
world they still very much enjoy
pretending playing dress-up imaginary
games they are beginning to develop a
sense of self and a sense a sense of
Independence but again they're always
looking for that attention from
grown-ups as we said they can be easily
frustrated they're not good with
transitions they're working hard at
sharing and turn-taking they are
beginning to get out of that completely
self-centered egotistical itsallaboutme
world and beginning to have a sense of
other but and they and and with that
there comes a little bit of a sense of
danger so that's something important to
keep in mind from a cognitive
perspective and I think you know this is
really critical from a developmental
point of view and obviously PBS and you
know I know Angela santomero and those
guys very well and they really have been
revolutionary in terms of bringing that
child development educational you know
that will focus on like who kids are and
I think why they've done as well as
they've done is because they really do
but the kid at the center of their
development and they understand
completely cognitively where kids are at
I think very often you know we as
grown-ups like and I know I myself as a
former producer have tried to do this at
times like what you just want to kind of
you have a great idea and you want to
throw it in but you lose sight of really
what kids can take in at this age so
again it's important to remember yes
kids can they can begin to categorize
they can speak in sentences they can
sort objects by shape and color and size
they can work in an activity for maybe
up to 10 or 15 minutes they are more
process-oriented they're not so focused
on the finished product you know they
may start saying you know I'm gonna make
a rainbow and butterflies and the next
thing you know it's I don't know a pond
with fish um they're mastering cause and
effect and again you know a lot of these
are all elements that play very much a
part of app development and how apps
work they enjoy simple Rhymes and
nonsense words they're beginning to
distinguish the difference between
fantasy and reality again as Jennifer
talked about it's all about why at this
stage so that's kind of where they are
they're very into routine and a sense of
order the more you can sort of help them
navigate this world that they are
incredibly curious about in a in an
ordered and simple way I think the more
successful that you'll be on from a
physical point of view and obviously
this is also critical for from an app
development perspective you know kids it
they're still you know they're they're
mastering their gross motor skills their
fine motor skills are are really not
that refines I was talking to an app
developer friend of mine who who talked
about you know an early work that she
did you know she had a plan where the
kid had to drag something you know in a
straight line from here to there but for
a four-year-old getting from here to
there does not go like this it goes like
that you know and so you
have to remember that every single you
know every single you know beat on that
screen is a touch point for kids and
you've got to be prepared for what's
going to happen because they're going to
go there whether you want them to or not
so you know they will touch everything
um also what's going on for them
physically obviously they are learning
to control their urges if you are
successful potty training your child
they're learning to multitask so you
know riding a bike requires them to be
able to steer and pedal at the same time
they can dress themselves so again just
some key things to remember what they're
doing parallel play so that means it's
more side by side there's not that much
direct interaction between two kids
dress up arts and crafts social play and
one of the things that we have seen is
apps that mirror play patterns the kids
already know are that much easier for
kids to sort of pick up and adapt to so
that's something to think about as you
are developing your apps are you
building on existing play patterns or
are you creating a completely new one
again caveat caveat caveat um these you
know we'll just talk a little bit about
gender difference at this age again it's
important to remember I know these look
like stereotypes but the truth is they
there is real truth to this so um from
on the boys side boys tend to play more
side to side focused on a third object
where girls are more playing face to
face focusing on each other and pretend
play boys are more rough and tumble
they're working on things moving from
danger to safety playing dragons
dinosaurs that kind of thing where girls
pretend play more revolves around social
dynamics you know mommy and child
friends of friends boys are more often
choosing games and toys that are more
physical and action-oriented and girls
are choosing toys and games where they
can explore relationships
and so how does it feel um just I think
the i love these quotes because they
just get at some of the the sort of
truth of where kids are at i love when
mommy and daddy tuck me in at night why
are there no more leaves on trees look
at the pattern i made i learned to skip
really fast watch me um i don't want to
take a path i want to keep playing so
what is this mean from a Content
perspective one of the are sort of
summary about what you should think
about when you're developing contents
for this age group is that engaging
content needs to be nurturing and what
we mean by that is that combination of
you know familiar yet with a little bit
of challenge I think it's really
important as I sort of said before that
everything is new to them and so they
can't learn too many things at once so
if you want to teach them colors give
them a world and a background that is
familiar so you know that's what we mean
here by you know familiar settings
characters and activities when I talked
about the importance of routine that's a
relatable and predictable format if I do
this then this will happen then this
will happen and then this will happen
that's incredibly empowering for kids at
this age again they're super why clear
takeaway messages it's critical try not
to do too much at once you know these
you know and I've just put some of the
kinds of you know key media franchises
that I hope most of you know that I
think do these things really well and
finally engaging but simple look and
feel and if you take anything away from
this part of the conversation it's
simple simple simple again as creators
you know we want to make it as
stunningly beautiful as we possibly can
and all the bells and whistles but
remember that there's a fine line
between giving kids quality and
distracting them from the core of what
it is that you want them to do or you
want them to experience so simplicity
repetition repetition repetition
repetition really works
it's very very empowering for kids and I
think for us too so I will repeat myself
for sure today um okay so now we're
going to grow up a little bit and we're
going to talk about and actually should
I stop on four or maybe I should go
through the whole thing and we'll save
questions till the end we're going to
grow up a little bit and talk about
seven year olds and we call 7 year olds
try try again irse because this age is
all about mastery so social emotional
social emotionally they are becoming
more social creatures parents are still
thankfully very important in their lives
but they are definitely becoming more
social creatures they may have a best
friends at this age and you know while
they still enjoy solitaire play they
will migrate towards a larger group but
what comes with entering social world
and in a bigger way you know come some
of those insecurities and sensitivities
of being liked and again my daughter
right now is suddenly into you know
fashion clothes you know they can
they're beginning to understand games
with more complex rules and they're
forming they're forming a stronger
gender identity at this age cognitively
there's this is an incredible time you
know this is when kids are learning to
read they can handle transitions in a
much more easy way they're starting to
understand more complex language similes
metaphors hyperbole they can write in
complete sentences they still are
they're just beginning to develop
inferences based on concrete observation
they're not yet abstract thinkers but
they they can make inferences based on
direct experience they're still mostly
process oriented so they're not confined
by success you know but again it's
really about like the doing and the
mastering of whatever it is that they're
you know whether they're this is the age
where sometimes kids start playing an
instrument or more seriously playing a
sport
um and they want to get good at it from
a physical point of view um you're
losing their teeth my daughter's at ten
way ahead of her friends in that regard
um they again they have on income uneven
and incomplete muscle development so
you'll see wide variations at this age
in terms of kids proficiencies in terms
of they're fine and they're gross motor
skills they are able to start kind of
doing two things at once they can you
know bounce a ball and run at the same
time they're fine tuning their high and
eye coordination and there's a sense of
real satisfaction and achievement from
from their physical life what are they
doing games games games it's also
collecting is a really important
activity at this age because again they
have a sense of you know what what makes
things alike and what makes them
different so I don't know if any of you
live through the silly band craze that
we're has gone through my house in the
last couple of years again I talked
about more focused activities this is
where they're starting to take those
ballet lessons and violin lessons and
explore things like that and and
communication is is becoming more and
more important you know and again I'm
sorry to keep talking about my daughter
but she's fun like I can have a real
conversation with her on the telephone
now in a way that I couldn't even six
months ago which is pretty fun from in
terms of gender differences you see a
lot of you know it is interesting as
much as and I know you know in my early
days at Nickelodeon you know we were
very big on this whole notion of gender
neutral and the truth is it just that's
really really it's hard to do and it
doesn't holy exists boys and girls
really are different in their essence
boys at this age more often play in
large groups where girls will start
pairing off and again have the best
friends boys choose games that are more
competitive more complex with explicit
rules and goals girls games are much
more collab
an open-ended boys participate again in
more fantasy play that revolves around
high stakes and action and girls fantasy
play is more relationship based and sort
of dramatic so this is how this age
feels last week I want to be an
astronaut so next week I'm going to be a
trapeze artist they're really trying on
different identities and sort of
figuring out who they are and what
they're good at on Sundays I still like
to build forts with my dad if my friends
and I fight we just talk it over you
know they're beginning to be able to
navigate social relationships in a more
sophisticated way from a Content point
of view we find at this age that the
most engaging content for kids offers
them safe risk-taking so um they want
again they're sort of in this in between
there in the heart of being a kid so
they want humor for their age but you
know the kind of physical and character
driven humor that you find in a
spongebob or in toy story but they also
want high-stakes situations but that
don't go too far you know so actually
some of the later Harry Potter's really
are too they're too risky they're too
dangerous they're too scary for kids at
this age you know so I think something
like Star Wars has been really i think
has done a really good job of leveling
its contents for different audiences on
different platforms and giving them the
kind of experience the kids can handle
at each of the age of their appropriate
ages they want contents that breaks
break the rules but not too much so a
show like phineas and ferb if you don't
know the show it's about two kids who
it's basically endless summer and every
day there's a mission that they want to
achieve and it's outrageous and it's
crazy but it just it never goes over
that edge of being dangerous and they
also want more and more interactive
control and that's why apps are so
powerful for them at this age you know
they want the ability to control their
environment
okay so now we're going to grow up a
little bit more so social emotionally as
I said they you know kids are fully
social at this age they enjoy being with
peer groups usually of the same sex
they're very much for coming more
self-conscious again they need to make
sure you know their clothes and what
they're doing and kinds of bands or
sports figures that they're into or cool
they're connecting very aggressively
with social media and technology they're
starting to worry about their body image
they're starting to have more of an
identity within their social circle very
much this too is a time where they are
figuring out who they are so at this age
they'll say I am a gymnast you know but
I'm not good at math I'm a pianist but I
don't like drama um you know whereas
earlier kids are much more flexible and
fluid in terms of figuring out who they
are at this age they're starting to
define themselves cognitively and again
this is really important from an ABS
perspective kids at this age you know
can handle delayed gratification there
they have more abstract thinking they
can look towards the future they can
understand more complex rules they can
categorize in more complex ways they
also may begin to challenge rules and
want to kind of break the rules so those
are all I think important dynamics as
you develop content for them physically
yes hormones are starting to kick in at
this stage they have improved
coordination and reaction time and
obviously you know you guys know better
than I how facile they are in terms of
their ability to you know play both in
the physical world and the digital world
they have increased hands and body
dexterity and strength and competition
and winning is more and more important
to them so what they're doing they are
connecting I just did a talk recently in
France on teens and these kids you know
they're not quite there yet but they are
you know they want to be in
watch and connected all the time
exploration solitary time which still
can mean reading a book or it can be
playing video games for hours or it
could be you know going for a walk in
the park or playing you know basketball
drills in the driveway and competition
is really important and the gender
differences again still very much exist
at this age boys like many men seek out
socialization mainly through common
interest so they like the same kind of
video game they like the same sports
teams they have the same you know
they're into math or science or whatever
it might be whereas girls you know are
much more driven by sort of social peer
you know what's cool from boys from a
texting and mobile point of view they're
using like you know we've seen the boys
text will text back and forth like hey
want to get together sure ten o'clock my
house great done girls will use it to
just chat hi how are ya good great
uh-huh boys are more drawn to content
that protects depicts action and really
again pushes those boundaries girls are
more drawn to contact about social
relationships boys are more concerns
with kind of height and weight girls are
more concerned with weight and looks how
does this feel as I kind of said
earliest that I'm good at the piano but
I'm not a great athlete I mean I love my
parents and everything but I don't want
to hang out with them all the time I
want my iPad and I totally know how to
get my parents to get me one so they
they're figuring out how to manipulate
us I only got to be on my report card
because I forgot to write a concluding
paragraph you know if the range of what
we've seen in terms of kids you know
social emotional cognitive and physical
development at this stage is huge if you
think if you think about it so we find
it again you know eleven-year-old are
called tweens for a reason they really
are at that place between being a kid
and being a teenager and so we find that
the most engaging content for this age
group
warts that transition from being a kid
in being a tween so again you've got the
same who SpongeBob and toy story on the
left they do want content they may not
brag about it to their friends they may
not wear spongebob t-shirts to school
but they still enjoy that kind of silly
playful humor that just like reminds
them that you know life is still can be
simple and just fun and at the same time
they very much are looking to media to
model older social behavior so they may
not be engaging in the kinds of social
behavior that is modeled and shows like
iCarly or Degrassi but they know it's
coming and you know I it's quite amazing
how much kids use media to kind of test
out and explore to how different social
relationships work again they're looking
for contents that's edgier and more rule
breaking whether that's call of duty or
YouTube you know YouTube provides you
know there's just a vast world of an
uncensored on unexplored content for
kids that can be very very empowering
for them and finally they're looking for
aspirational contents whether it's you
know Taylor Swift or Top Chef you know
these kids really are beginning to look
ahead and think about like who they are
and who they want to be I think Disney
has been so successful with a lot of it
shows because it really understands that
it's got a lot of those shows have a
great balance of feeling somewhat
relatable to kids but also being very
aspirational in terms of the content so
what does this all mean for you I will
end where I started which is I think
it's really important to meet kids where
they are and remember that your job is
to connect and to inspire them and to do
that you need to first help them do the
work of growing up and hopefully I've
helped start thinking about that today
and then at the same time help kids have
fun which I'm sure you're all doing
already very well so my most important
sort of piece of advice is know your
target audience you know it really
is hard to make an appt and and they
exist that sort of appeals to a wide
range but I think it's really critical
to sort of start with a clear target of
who that sweet spot is and then more can
you know surround that but i think if
you sort of start out by like I'm going
to make a game for two two
eleven-year-olds that's pretty tough
because as I think we've seen you've got
a vast array of of where kids are at at
this stage you know socially so these
are the questions you should be asking
yourself you know where are they social
emotionally we talked about you know
they are moving from solitary to social
from family to friends from silly to
more serious and through all of it
they're they're really figuring out and
exploring who they are and figuring out
how to express who they are cognitively
what is their cognitive level of
development are they going to be able to
cognitively grok you know what it is
that you are trying for them to to learn
you know in this case obviously it's
huge though they're going from learning
to hold a pencil to you know typing 300
words a minute from you know just
beginning to kind of get control over
their bodies to being out of control
again as the hormones kick in
cognitively I kind of said all that
already so it's a huge array um you know
from from this four to 11 and 12 and
then you you know what happens after
that so these are the critical questions
you've got to ask yourself am i meeting
kids where they are from a developmental
perspective so that you know it because
as good as you are at making
entertainment if kids don't understand
