my name is Martine on to Monica's my
twitter handle is in Vantaa you can
follow me if you want to increase my ego
and today we'll be talking about how to
create good documentation so it always
seems kind of boring documentation so
are you guys ready to learn about
documentation awesome say we're spiking
things up so let me start first with a
little introduction about myself so I'm
a software developer from monocytes
Argentina that means that I travel like
15 hours to get here thankfully I could
sleep because it's like too long
and I work at out zero I will tell you a
little bit more about zero later on and
the important thing is that I used to be
coding JavaScript all day long so this
used to be me all day long like I was
like a machine coding touching the
keyboard and putting new features and
things like that but recently I've
changed a little bit and now I work as a
developer advocate I wish I were working
with Al Pacino because I love him
but unfortunately I'm not so when I say
that I'm a developer advocate a lot of
people think that I do this that is so
like smoke and mirrors and just like dog
smoke but I do code trust me I still
code not all day but I do code so let's
dive into the dock let's start with a
talk I also love Jim Carrey
so let's start with one fact creating
documentation is really hard and why is
that because when we're writing
something we usually write it on how we
think that it's it should be understand
how we think people will understand it
but the thing is that we don't use
empathy and we don't put ourself in a
position of somebody else and something
that is even more important is that
creating good documentation for
developers is even harder because a
developer is like a really really really
hard public because we're not like we
would like to read prose I mean if you
give me a blog post that is all prose I
won't read it that's for sure just give
me a few tags code let me
make it easy to copy and paste or
something like that and that's it so
writing goon documentation for
developers is even harder and that's
what I'm going to try to explain today
like what are the different things that
iíve learned by working and creating
documentation for developers so the
question that we're going 23rd is how do
we do it but first before answering that
question we should start from the
beginning and the beginning is how we
stay in a developer life so if we're
writing something for a developer we
must understand what a developer does in
his day and how we can make it easy for
him to read something and be able to use
it so house today in a developer life
this is how my ex-girlfriend used to
think that I was doing because in my
company I had a ping-pong I had a
foosball so she thought I was playing
all day long and that's it I really love
this xkcd joke where yeah I'm compiling
are you are doing like sword fighting or
something like that and this is not
really what we do all day long there's
another shock which is a little bit more
similar to the truth where we're always
near the computer I mean I don't know
I'm buying a sandwich I'm ordering
something I'm readying I'm everything
I'm doing I'm always with a computer and
even when I'm dreaming I'm with a
computer at least for me a lot of time
has happened that I was having like a
really really really hard problem and I
was trying to crack it and I didn't know
how to do it but then I went to sleep
and once I woke up wow now I know how
because my brain was like clean I don't
know
so even when I sleep I tried I'm
thinking problems about a developer but
what is the most important feature that
I think I'll develop I should have know
how to Google search I think I'm like
60% of my day doing Google search I love
Google search so you always have to know
the right words to put in Google because
that's what I do I google search I use
the code from there I honestly don't
know how people used to code before
Google existed or refer they could just
compile or anything every time that's
really hard so let's imagine now that I
want to use something so I'm using I
don't know no js' project and I'm using
Express and I want to do a write X so I
don't want to implement it myself so
what I would do is I would search Trade
Act Express
MPM on google and then click on the
result and once I found find that the
result I will read the readme really
really really fast to see if that works
or not so once I find that result I
would say okay let's see if it works and
what I would do is select the code copy
and then go to sublime and paste and
then just click on run and hope that it
runs because if it runs let's see that
means that's it now I have redirect I
didn't have to do anything else I just
googled I find the result I didn't read
anything I copied and pasted it and Wow
it just works but what happens were done
when that doesn't happen when I just a
copy paste and it doesn't work then I go
to look at two examples because when I
copy and paste some code from a
documentation I know the documentation
doesn't compile it's just text so we can
however sink and have a lot of things
but an example runs so what I would do
is I would download the example and then
I would run that example and see how it
works and once I see it works I would
copy it from there
now I stop the example running I copied
to my code yet it still doesn't work
what do I do in that case in that case I
go back again to my first wheel of tool
which is Google but now I Google for a
stackoverflow question because somebody
else must have got the same problem I
mean I can't be the only one with that
problem and I try to look at it and what
if I don't find a stack overflow problem
question that means that I have to
create a stack overflow questions I
think I've done that like very very few
times in my life and once I did that I
never get a response soon so once I have
to create a stack overflow questions
this is my face I'm like really really
mad because it means I google for the
code the code I copy this the code it
didn't work
I downloaded the sample I copied the
code for example it didn't work I look
for stock overflow for the solution I
copied that solution it didn't work so
what does that mean again I have to code
now and if I am a nice person what that
means is that I will code the solution
and then open-source it so that if
there's somebody else like me gets that
problem then he can just use that same
solution that's at least how most of my
open-source projects have been created
I've tried to find something I didn't
find it i coded it and i say yeah i
coded it let's let's make it easy for
other person do not have that same
problem so at least that's what I think
that the developer journeys throughout
the entire day and everything is Google
or search focused because what is
something that is important is that if
you're doing like a product or an
open-source project for developers I
think that it's really monetary to
understand a developer and to know what
that developer really wants and
something that is like the most
important thing is that the developer
wise he always googling because what he
wants to code what he wants to add to
the project if this is something that
adds value so imagine that you're doing
I don't know a new application and you
want to have logging which is
distributed but your application doesn't
depend on that login you just want it
because it's easy to log something but
it's something that it's collateral to
your application everything that is
collateral to your application the idea
would be that you would actually search
for it or find a tool that already
exists so every open source library or
product that is being mail should avoid
the developer having to code something
that doesn't add value to what he is
doing and every time you're doing
something it has like one core value or
one main value and then the rest of the
things help you out and that's basically
what we have been doing at out zero in
alt 0 is basically a SAS that helps you
with authentication authorization so in
a that is that you hook it up to your
app or API and with a couple lines of
code you get authentication working and
that is that most upscale 10th occasion
but that's not the core I mean you want
the user to log in you want to get the
user information but then you want to do
something with that information and
maybe create a new application or
whatever you need but that's something
that it's something that he needs to
have but that doesn't add value and the
important part of what I've just said is
that we try to make the developer use it
with a couple lines of code and make it
really easy for a developer to use our
product because if it's hard or if the
combination isn't clear or if what he's
doing he can't find it that means that
the product doesn't that it doesn't work
it doesn't give anything to that
developer and the same if we would be an
open source project I mean if you're
trying to accomplish something to give
some
the user and it's not clear how to use
it then it doesn't work so this is what
we've learned so far when trying to work
to make it easy for the developer to
implement our tool these are like the 8
different things that I'm going to be
speaking about I want I will go one by
one right now so let's start with the
first one
so the first one is tailored
documentation what does it mean well it
means copy/paste friendly as I was
saying the developer always wants to
copy paste code and imagine you're
making a product if you're making a
product that means that he's probably
going to have to put in the code some I
don't know client ID or user ID or
secret or whatever and then there are a
lot of products that having the Cadi
documentation that says client ID put
your client ID here user ID put your
user ID here and developers don't
breathe so I copy and paste and run it
doesn't work and why because below that
it said yeah and you need to change your
user ID for that user ID
it seems dumb but we have a lot of
questions of people saying okay we
copied this and it doesn't work and they
just didn't see that so if it's easy who
I not just actually show that in this
case I'm logged in with my conferences
account and the copy vegetable snippet
that you see here has the client ID and
client secret for that so once he copies
this and paste it it will work and one
step further of this is to also have
tailored sample projects because as I
was saying when you're creating
documentation that doesn't compile and
sometimes you copy paste that and it
doesn't work so you should have samples
that the user can download and if those
samples also need configuration for the
user like as I was saying user ID or
whatever you should be you should let
the user actually download that sample
with those keys so let's actually see it
live in our the combination we have this
download sealed project for example
which once you click on it it will
download the file and once you you want
zip that file that you get you will see
that in this case it has a dorium file
which cause all the configuration for
the client ID client secret etc and the
nice thing about it is that this example
that you're downloading here is actually
on github because another
think that we developers love is github
so if you're going to have a sample only
on your on your on your documentation
page well it won't work because a lot of
people won't find it so you always have
to come that sample in detail and of
course as we are developers we like the
dry principal don't repeat yourself so
we won't create a sample twice so what
we are doing is creating the sample once
in get code in this case you will see
that it's in no doubt see the repository
under the examples folder and the nice
thing is that if you read the readme
what it will say is ok if you want to
run this example the only thing you
gotta do is create that dot M file and
put all your keys from out zero so if
you download this sample from the our
documentation it will have all the keys
already configured but if you get here
from github it will say ok now create
that dirham that was actually created
automatically in the other way and use
that and then you will be able to run it
and this sample is actually sitting here
on github and the nice thing about this
is that you can do this same thing that
we are doing yourself with open sourced
a library called configure sample
generator and what it does is it lets
you grab a sample project from github
and whatever configuration that you want
and then send it back to the client so
let's see really quickly how we can
actually make it work and what you would
do is you have this Packer computer and
here are two important parts in this
first you need to configure the
information loader which is this one and
information loader what it will do is it
will connect to your database or to
whatever you want and get all the
information that will be tailored for
that user in this case for example I'm
getting the secrets from the DV and then
I'm setting that in the context the
context is like that bag of cuts that
will get sent then to the user once it's
configured and then we have these type
processors a type processor is what is
going to actually save that information
that you have into the simple projects
we know that there are different type of
sample projects so you can create
different type of type processors for
example the server one in this case what
it does is it creates that doram file
which is usually used in a server
project but we also have one which lets
you create like a Java Script
a shell script file for a front-end
project and then we have for example in
this case these five replacer were if
you're doing a project what it will do
is it will search for the bracket client
ID or Blackett client secret and then
replace it for whatever information you
have loaded and once you have configured
this then you can just use it and for
that you will instantiate this Packer
object and you will specify which
repository from github it will use which
branch it will use you will say the
example path because at least in our
case we'll so we always have the SDK
which is like the repository on github
and then inside there we have the
examples folder so what he would
download is an example inside that
repository once you have that in this
case he's specifying the sample type
which in this case is server so that
means that this will create their own
there are M file and then this context
information is like the initial
information to create to to get all of
these custom information in this case
it's getting the client ID from the
request once that's done we just call
this create and that will return to us
the stream which is like the zip file
which was created for that sample with
all that information for a user and then
you can just pipe it to a response or
send it to the response and the user
will then get that zip file already
configured and for example how we are
using this what we're doing is you're
going to obsidium slash docs and then
all of the properties that you see here
that are hard-coded in the Packer we're
actually sending them as part of the URL
so that you can create whatever package
so in this case what it's saying is OK
it will download the day's simple from
the nodal sealer repository from the
master branch they the example is in the
example note jsapi path this will be a
type server which means that it will
create it or m and then this is the
extra information that you need to load
everything so if this would be an i
don't know an angular example in this
case it will be like angular outsider a
master create package blah blah blah and
the main idea is that then we have
created this little tool that all it
does is it receives all the parameters
from their requests sends it back to
their packer and then calls this Packard
create and that's it it just worked for
us and of course we're using this
when celebrity that we have created and
that way it's really easy to create
these sample projects that are already
configured for your user to use another
thing that is really important is
embeddable documentation what does it
mean again documentation should be
everywhere as I was saying people will
get to your documentation from a lot of
different places some people might get
from github because they are looking on
get come and they find it there some
people might find it on the
documentation public page from your
product or your open source project or
some miok might actually log in to your
product and they want to see the
documentation inside there so that means
that there are a lot of points where the
user might want to see a documentation
and we don't want to be linking the user
around so that he goes from one place to
another but again we don't want to
repeat ourselves again we don't want to
write the documentation more than once
so the solution that we have found for
that is actually writing the
documentation or markdown on github so
if you go to out zero github.com /l 0
slash Doc's
you will see that all of our
documentation is written in markdown so
what you see here is like a regular
markdown which has this link to download
a simple project and then it's just like
the code and the different regular
things that you have it and then that
same project what it does is it renders
dart markdown using mark Doc's anywhere
and it's embeddable everywhere so the
documentation that you see here even
though it's styled it's the same
markdown that is on github you will see
this as this download seed project with
your keys already configured which is
exactly what it says here so what we are
rendering is exactly what is on github
and this that is rendered here is just
using mark Docs which is an NPM library
and again this is like the docs public
page from out sedum but then if the user
is logged in as in this case then you
can also see that same documentation
inside there because if you're already
logged in and you say okay I want to
login with Facebook and Twitter and now
okay how do i implement my Dolce gets up
and then you can just see it in there we
don't have to link you to like the
public page or whatever and you can see
it in here really fast and another thing
that we use to make this documentation
be easy to use and available everywhere
is this load
planing basically what we're doing is
lodash is like very similar to
underscore and it's just like a very
minimal templating library and what
we're doing is we're adding a plugin to
mark Docs which actually lets lets you
template that markdown and i'll eaves
and force and things like that so that
they markdown itself can get information
from the context which in our case is
the session and then based on that show
one thing or another I will just show it
live in a second
but one example for us is that imagine
you're creating like a single page up
with a jQuery and then that's similar
pressure that you're creating can have
two different types of api's one is like
an API that you made like no J's and
another one is an API that you're using
a third party API like firebase so all
the documentation in our case is exactly
the same except for one step which will
defer if you're using your API or a
third party so instead of writing the
whole document again what we're doing is
we're adding an if there and it will
show one section or the other depending
on a session barrio so let's see it live
we have this low - true here and then
first you will see that we have an if
saying okay it's a third party and it
will show a different sample based on
that and then if we go a little bit down
you will see that the step four is two
times call fearing a call to third party
API and then you will see the first step
again confirming call to your API and
above that there was an if and an else
which was was checking the session
variables to see okay what type of
application is the user creating and
based on that showing something and also
we are using that same lodash templating
to the create that tailored
documentation that I've shown before
so once it goes up again what you will
see is that you were using like context
dot client ID or context dot client
secret and that will be the one that is
actually showing the user information in
that case and the last thing I want to
say about like having the docs every
word is that a lot of people will have
errors in a documentation I mean I am
very type of friendly I always always
always have typos so if you can get
people to actually help you with the
documentation and things like that it's
really amazing because instead of
creating like a support ticket what we
are doing is we have these three
typo link in our documentation
everywhere and as all of our
documentation is written on markdown on
github they can just correct it with a
pull request so in here if they CDs
found the type of fix it they just click
on the pattern it will take them to
actually eat cup and then once they are
a new club they just click on an it they
can add whatever they want and then send
a PR and the good thing about that is
and then they found a typo they fixed it
we usually merge it really really fast
and that's it it just works because of
the C I will send it to our
documentation and again the cool thing
about this is that you can do this same
thing that we're doing yourself if you
go to the outside Elcom slash dogs sorry
to get cut off from /lc the slash dogs
we will see how we have implemented it
and in there you will see how we have
implemented marked dogs how we have
implemented the lodash templating and
everything all I'm saying right now it's
all open source in that project another
thing that is really important is a
complete it Capri me we are making
besides the product we are making a lot
of open source projects because I mean
if we're making it for our SDKs why not
just open source it so that everybody
can use it and what we've seen is that
there are a lot of open source projects
that are not used just because their
readme sucks because let's face it if
you have three different libraries and
you'll uncover documentation or read me
that means you gotta read the code and
if you have to read the code it takes a
lot of time so if you have something
that has a really cool documentation
then I would use that and this is a
structure that we have found is that an
angular storage they really that we have
we have always a title description key
features as you see here installing it I
will speak a little bit more about this
section in a second then we have this TL
DR using it then we have a more advanced
usage like namespace
storage and then after that we have the
complete API if somebody wants to do
something beyond the basic example and
then we have what is it used how can you
contribute what is the issue reporting
and what is the license all of those are
actually written here so title on
description of course but I think that
one of the things that most libraries
forget that is really important is these
key features if you can put in four
lines what is really
really important of your library that
will mean that a people will say okay
now I understand why you should use this
library instead of the other or we they
will say I don't care about this feature
so it I won't use it but at least
by just reading those four points in two
seconds the guy will know if he's using
or not your library then after the key
features you should you should show them
the person how to install it if you
can't have like different ways whether
we will wait use for a front-end library
we use like CDN we use also Bauer and
NPM if you don't cover in this a CDN by
yourself you can actually polish it for
free in in what was the name I forgot
the name
Shay is the liver for example the liver
is the CDN that we are using and it's
actually free to use you can just submit
a PR and then if you submit a PR with
the details of your github repository
each time that you deploy a new version
that version will be automatically
deployed to that CDN so if you want to
use it you should use shells deliver
it's like really really good after
installing it we always have these this
TLDR so how to use it in four lines so
that you can copy paste use it that's it
after that if somebody wants like a more
complete usage then they can check out
the full API if it's like really really
big I wouldn't put the full API in the
readme but the main that the main
methods or the main fields I would put
them there and then from there you can
link to a full API in the wiki so it's
not to make it like so long the readme
then it's really really important to
have examples because if you don't have
a an example and somebody just copy and
paste the code as I was saying and it
doesn't work it's really hard to for him
to the baguette but if he has an example
of he can run and it works then it's
really easy to copy and paste that
example and see why it's working or not
then of course if somebody wants to
contribute you should have some
guidelines of how he can contribute how
he should report an issue or where he
should search an issue some repositories
use Stack Overflow some use github
issues so clarified here and finally a
license we're always using MIT for our
open source projects but it's really
important to put a license because if
you don't put a license there are a lot
of big enterprise that won't be able to
use your open source projects
unfortunately because they lawyer saying
no
don't use that another thing about
documentation is that things should be
easy to find because imagine you're
writing like a really really really
great documentation but nobody can find
it then why did you write the
documentation if nobody will be able to
find it
so for us we have this QuickStart where
you choose what type of application are
wielding like single paisa or whatever
if you say I'm milling a single page
shop you say I'm using it angularjs in
this case with no J's and then you get
automatically dedicate the documentation
or how to implement it first for
angularjs and net and then for node.js
and then this means that we have with I
think we have like approximately 50
different documentation page for each
language for each type and with this
simple wizard in three steps and three
clicks he got to choose exactly what he
needed so this worked for us but the
important thing is that there should be
an easy way so that you can accommodate
all the information so that with a
couple of clicks he can get exactly
documentation that he needs and in our
case what we have done we have actually
copied it from stripe is to add a help
and support page where you can write
there whatever you wanna search and that
search will actually search everywhere
it will search you know in the blog it
will search in in the documentation it
will search on github so whatever in
this case says angular it will pop up
here so even if the QuickStart didn't
didn't work he can use this this help
and support in there were using actually
an open-source library for implementing
it which is like really easy to use but
I forgot to put down the name but if I
will tweet it in I will tweet it in
after the talk so look for it because I
I don't remember sorry another very
important thing is community driven Docs
so in our case you know 0 we are like 4
people writing documentation and four
people for a library or a product that
is used a lot it's not that much so if
you can get the community to write dogs
for you that's even better
so what we are doing in that case is we
have this ask the route 0 calm which is
basically a discourse I don't know if
you know the tool but this course is an
open source project
which was created by the stackoverflow
creator and this is basically and like a
custom stackoverflow it works exactly
the same as stackoverflow but it is for
your own product or for your own open
source Russia you can have tags
responses you can have bad cheese etc
and it's open source so you can just
download it and deploy it whatever you
want and the cool thing about it is that
whatever question that is it's put here
then it's like google searchable so it's
really easy to then search for this
information and for somebody else to
actually find it somebody really great
that is that that is doing this is
digitalocean
they are much better than us at this and
what they are doing is I don't know if
you have heard but they have a plan
where if you want to write an article
for digitalocean they pay you $50 and
besides paying you $50 to write the
article
you get like reputation so the better
you are you had a bigger reputation and
you have the advantage that most of the
articles from digitalocean are always
first results so for example in this
case I had a typo I I realized after
taking a screenshot that I had a typo
but in this case I was searching like
how to install check heel and nginx and
the first two results are from
digitalocean
and those two results from digitalocean
were actually ridden by a community
person that doesn't work in this
generation he got paid to write that he
got like self-esteem for for what
writing that and the good thing is that
the documentation that he wrote is on
digital ocean common domain so when he
goes to that page even though it will
say his name and the recommendation will
be written there the person will at
least know what digital ocean is he
might click it and then he it creates
more brand awareness and it is really
cool because whatever you search now in
the internet or how to install something
you most probably will get a digital
ocean result and that's because they
have done a really good job on creating
community Docs
another thing that we are doing that I
think is really important is if you if
your product has an API you should have
an API Explorer this is like a live
sample because an API Explorer means
that the user should be able to enter
whatever he wants in a website and then
just call the API from there another way
he can get a response from the API he
can see how the request works and that's
really straight so that
seeds this is this used to be our old
API this was tailor made by us so if you
click on whatever API you will see what
you see the requests you click on try me
and in there you add their response this
was tailored made by us but now we're
actually moving to swallow I don't know
if you have heard of swagger but again
is an open source project that lets you
create the documentation for your API
and then she also create this live
documentation phases where you can call
the API in our case we have all of our
back-end a application made with node.js
and we started using JSON schema JSON
schema lets you specify what parameters
your API call will get what type how
many blah blah blah blah blah and they
would think about that is at that JSON
schema lets you automatically create SQL
file that's logger file is a
documentation description of your API
and once you cut that swagger file you
can use the swagger UI project which
will then let you create this website
which is run all by itself so in our
case we didn't have to do anything at
all to make it working we just added
this JSON schema specifying the fields
and from that we got the new live page
which I will show now it's actually in
beta and it's like really ugly but it
works and it's almost the same I mean
you have the documentation here and you
will see that once I expand users you
get like all the different things and
once you click you have all the
different parameters they type however
they work the different response status
type the different response and you can
click try now to get the response down
there or you can click on curl it up to
get like the current link to call it and
all of this was free who didn't do
anything at all it is just so our UI and
then another important thing is that the
documentation should be easy on the eye
as I was saying before developers don't
like to read prose I hate reading prose
so the documentation for the developer
should be really really really easy to
real and really easy to find the things
that you want so just three simple tips
is that first you should use number
steps I don't know why but when you're
there's number steps your head is like
more ordered and it's really easy what
to do first what to do then what to do
then and it's easier to understand what
to do if they're not numbered steps it's
really hard to understand what is wells
first was then what do I get a copy
etcetera and also each of these steps
should be concise we don't like reading
so each step should be like install
these dependency run these do that and
then just very few words be very concise
and add a lot of code so that they can
actually copy paste that code so once we
started understanding how all of these
dogs they were like a lot of things that
we we had to learn we were like wow this
is a lot of information a lot of things
that you gotta learn to actually write
documentation for developers and well
this is what we have right now so what
I'm gonna show you is what's next for
outsider what are we adding right now
the first thing we're running is this
trip shares tutorials
what are these so we're going to create
interact interactive tutorials the idea
is that there are a lot of companies
that create like short videos that show
how to use like a certain thing but the
reality is that when you read a video
it's all sorry you see a video things
that you see I mean you understand them
and then it's harder to actually repeat
that however when you're actually doing
something it stays in your brain for
example it happened to me when I II was
trying to learn Scala
I reread the 1000 book by Martino that
is T about Scala and then six months
later I wanted to call Scalia and I knew
 I mean I had to read the whole book
again and that's because I read it and I
didn't do anything so the basically
enough of an interactive tutorial is
that it will tell you how to do
something but you gotta do it yourself
unless you do it yourself it will stay
in your ring so let's see an example in
this page you click on apps it goes to
all the application you click on create
an app and it will create a new app this
is just a mock example and then if you
click start tutorial it will guide you
but it will let you do that thing so
click here to go to the apps page click
here to create a new app and then it
will say voila the application has just
been created so this way
this is a tutorial the guy is learning
how to do it but he's doing it his self
I research it for a lot of libraries to
do this interactive tutorials and after
trying lots and lots of them this is the
best one that I've found this is trip
chairs it's really really configurable
you can do whatever you want you can
blur the screen not blur changed
animations it's really good and it's
really easy to use this is what we're
going to add next
and even though interactive tutorials
are better than video tutorials we're
also going to add video tutorials so
just like a 30 40 seconds so that they
can learn how to do it if they all want
to follow an interactive tutorial they
can just watch the video and my question
is then what's next for you to make your
documentation better because I know
we're not doing everything I know that
we we have a lot of things to improve so
I would like to know later on from you
what are you doing for your
documentation how are you learning those
things and what do you think a good
documentation should be so this is the
end of the presentation thank you for
listening
