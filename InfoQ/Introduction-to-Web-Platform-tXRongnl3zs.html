website how many of you have already
heard about it okay quite a few of you
and how many of you have actually
already contributed something were
created an account okay so all right not
too many though that's good so for those
of you that haven't seen it yet I'm
going to play you just quick when I
first started web development there was
pretty much just Netscape all I ever had
to do was open up one browser and make
sure that it worked there these days
it's not unusual for me to have about
five different browser windows open at
the same time a good portion of my front
end development time is spent trying to
figure out how I can best build a
feature and a good portion of that is
spent finding the right website where i
can find out the information I need
right now there's a lot of great
information is out there but it spread
across a bunch of different sites often
times the difference between getting
that information quickly and right and
getting it wrong can be the difference
between something taking an hour and all
day as the web moves forward we have
different organ systems different
browsers and devices and not just that
the standards that we use for the web
keep changing rapidly day in and day out
and it's hard to find the documentation
for what works across all of them this
is something we all need to solve
together as a community for the web to
be the best it can be the founding
members of web platform dogs have
contributed quite a bit of content to
create the foundation for web platform
docs it's a new community driven site
that aims to become a comprehensive
source for web developer documentation
but it's also an open community which
means you can contribute by sharing your
knowledge and your experience what we
need now is a larger community to get in
there and deepen the content with their
own expertise join in the conversation
make this website do that just go to a
backpack on the dark and sign up share
your expertise make it exactly just what
you and I need the building a web page
join the community and started learning
and sharing today
one of the exciting things about the web
platform that of work that I find this
um so I've been working on this for a
while died just four months ago joined
Google and started working as a program
manager for it a chrome developer
relations team one of the projects that
was sort of pulled into not long after
was the start of this web platform docs
and I've been super excited about is in
fact if you look at the names down here
and this is these are sort of the let's
say the founding stewards and you know
these are the people are the companies
that kicked it off it's not often that
you'll find all of these companies
working together like one of the
examples was sort of html5 itself right
and so here's a project cross vendor and
not not just the browsers but companies
like Facebook can adobe everyone is
pitching in here to create sort of the
canonical reference for the web rights
for documentation of the web so web
platform dot org as you can see here is
sort of that that's site and the initial
product if you will is a documentation
set so for example we have documentation
at Mozilla developer network we also
have html5 rocks we have msdn all of the
company's opera has some great work w3c
has some great articles but all of that
is not easy to edit I mean you can edit
it the exception would probably be mdn
where many of you probably have
contributed but this is a site where
everyone can come together so it's not
just a doc site built by those companies
and then kept there it's basically these
companies have literally just seated
this content and as soon as possible
open it up as an alpha release to the
community so what you see here anything
you see here is not going to be perfect
but the idea was to release it as soon
as possible
22 community so everyone can start
pitching in as opposed to spending
another two years perfecting it and then
having it woefully out of date but one
of the other nice things about this site
and having these companies involved is
that for example at Google we have
writers who job it is to contribute to
this site right then all of the
companies that are listed here have
people full-time people working on this
as well so we have you know company
efforts behind it as well as the
community and it's in very early alpha
stage but it's very easy to contribute
and that's what I'm going to just show
you and there are people in this room
that have already contributed quite a
bit so for example Vanessa and Peter
moskovits from causing they edited a few
articles people from Adobe Julius here
there's lots of people that have already
very actively contributed in this room
itself so as you can see here the first
thing that you get to is the landing
page but really the only thing that is
flushed out at the moment is the
documentation so you see here the the
docs link will take you to the docs dot
web platform that'll work and you notice
in the URL that's a wiki so this is just
a wiki if you're familiar with Mozilla
developer Network it's pretty much
identical it's using wiki architecture
and it's very easy to edit these pages
now the kinds of materials that you'll
find here are let's say three high-level
categories of documentation first one is
conceptual documentation and this is
coming from lots of different places
then there is reference documentation
and a large portion of the reference
documentation was imported than
effectively donated by Microsoft from
msdn library so we have a huge import
that we did before we launched it that
effectively stubs out a lot of the web
reference as a starting point but it is
still a lot of work
and then also another area to the stairs
tutorials so let me just quickly jump to
that one first and the tutorials are
list it in so there's a landing page for
tutorials and let me just make it a
little bit bigger so you see
fundamentals topics the main thing is
tutorials often span multiple feature
area so you may have a tutorial on
combining several let's say html5
features and you know it's it's not
really just the pure reference it's
really more of an end-to-end how-to on
how to work with specific technologies
so as an example will take the
connectivity area and when you get in
there you'll see that there are already
three tutorials out there and in this
case I'll just pick one of them the
WebSocket tutorial and you notice that
this isn't tutorial this actually was
imported from html5 rocks so a lot of
the documentation there has been
literally just donated to seed this
project and you'll find it here and this
article is pretty much a complete
tutorial that's already there getting
started with web socket and it's just
one simple example now you'll find that
a lot of the stuff on the web there are
some great sites for example I like
using can i use for browser
compatibility and there's other sites
that have similar things the one problem
with most of those sites is that you
cannot edit that and so the biggest
difference really it's like the web
platform documentation with an edit
button right that's a one good way to
describe it so if I wanted to edit this
document there's only it's very simple
in fact it's two steps one is to create
an account it's free then you just
create an account the very first time
you get to decide create an account the
username
and a password then you have that so you
see i'm logged in here and as soon as
you have that you can edit so i click on
edit and you'll notice that all of these
documents are there using wiki templates
and there's if you're familiar with that
system there's a whole lot of things you
can do in sort of template language that
is used inside the wiki wiki and for
example there's an author name so you
don't have to necessarily write all of
this in the raw HD and in the raw wiki
markup an article summary and then here
you'll see that this is the actual
content so here I see you know like an
area and I can literally just go in here
edit something and make a comment about
just what I did at the bottom here and
okay there's quite a bit here and then
create a little summary and save it so
now I've updated that document so anyone
can do that and up that's really the
power of this one of the things you'll
find here is that let me just go to
another topic here so here so we go to
the documentation the reference
documentation you'll find that there is
information about lots of different
areas for example CSS complete reference
and you can find pages for all of the
different CSS properties for example
let's say border radius and then those
pages will have browser compatibility
tables let me just find one
okay well let me just
just give me one second
ok
okay so once you're in edit mode you can
find these compatibility tables that a
lot of topics have and so here you see
desktop and mobile compatibility tables
and so it's very easy to fill this out
so what we've tried to do with this
scientists to make it very easy for
anyone to contribute but you may only
have five minutes you may have half an
hour you may have a whole day and a
little bit more on the whole day in a
little bit so for example you may be a
subject matter expert on a specific
feature and that's great in many cases
you can't edit that information on the
web but here you can just go in and edit
it so what we're trying to say here is
this is an alpha release is a lot of
stuff wrong with it right there's a lot
it's not necessary wrong it's just very
incomplete many things need to be be
added but everyone should be able to do
that so we're hoping that the community
will step in here and build this up you
know one of the things I always say is
like ultimately one of the ideal
situations we would be in is whether if
you do a search online for let's say
that same border-radius property and
this ends up higher than w3 schools that
we're still a little ways off from that
but it should be that simple right it
should be just anyone looking for web
information going there and finding it
alright so there's the browser
compatibility and one other thing I
wanted to sort of point out in terms of
the editing is that a lot of topics have
these flags and the whole system works
with a series of flags that you can
apply so even if you say look I know
this is wrong but I don't know what the
right thing is you can flag things for
later so somebody can come around later
in a dark sprint ordering some other
time that you can come back and say okay
let me do a little bit of additional
research and add it in but you can at
least flag things for example you may
say hey we really need a topic on I
don't know some property or some feature
you don't have time to
night at all but you can still create a
stub topic and you know go that way so
there are flags for things like missing
relevant sections there's actually a
flag called needs flags so if that's the
very beginning once the topic has the
appropriate flags and we can go through
and find ways to edit those and so let
me get into how you can get started so
you notice that at the very top of the
page you'll find a link that has a
getting started guide which going to
click on here ok now I'm going to skip
right past this broken image and go
right to the task so here's a bunch of
tasks that we've already outlined for
people so there's five minute tasks half
hour tasks and so on and you notice that
for example the correct spelling and
grammar flags are turned on or missing
compatibility information so there are
lists and these lists are auto-generated
of course from all the topics that have
that specific flag set so it's a sort of
a moving thing that that will constantly
be updated so you can if you what we
want to do is make it very simple for
people say ok give me something to do
for half an hour is go here help out a
little bit so that that's sort of the
system a lot of these task queues ok
then here so we have half hour taos half
day tasks and of course there are some
lower-level things that you would need
some pretty good knowledge of the wiki
system for so if you have that kind of
background and for sure become one of
the admins it's a pretty open community
we're basically just trying to say look
let's not bitch about stuff let's just
build build something let's just
contribute instead of whining about
not being not working ok so there's ways
to create new pages i'm not going to go
into all of that for example there's
also a community page so we are planning
a really cool event right here in two
weeks on a Saturday November third in
fact this is going here now here's the
draft for that meetup that I have saved
and I'm going to turn it on right now so
I'm scheduling this the next meet up
there and I'm going to announce it so
you heard it here first this has now
been announced you should have an email
about this event and this event is going
to be here at adobe's it's a whole day
the first real web doc web platform dock
sprint if you go if you're familiar with
the Mozilla developer network docs
prints it's basically a day where people
get together and you don't have to
necessarily be here we'll have a
back-channel running the IRC channel
that you can use to get more information
so this is just announced one quick
thing about this event is that don't
just RSVP only here there's a common
problem that we actually have an event
bright URL set up for this many people
just click on RSVP yes and then they
come in and say oh you didn't actually
register so make sure you actually
register for the event on eventbrite
which will show here and so that's very
simple it's free of course in fact adobe
has been kind enough to not only offer
breakfast with cater lunch we'll have a
perception with drinks at the end so we
have a whole day where will help you in
any way possible to to get up to speed
and to really become productive and
hopefully then you guys can also take
that information and help others to to
spread this a little bit wider so I'm
really excited about the events I'll be
here of course vanessa is going to be
here a lot of people from the community
are going to be here Julie
everyone that has been involved with
this project is going to be here and
helping with that as well so let's see
here so one just just to give you a real
quick idea how little it might takes two
so here I have a web platform docks
Prince oh I have this URL here and I
have a community events page on web
platform docks I'm going to just edit it
to show you just how simple it is and
this in this case I just need to update
this link to this new event that I just
launched here I'm going to just edit it
here and say community event page now
has this event on there and that's going
there so I just actually edit this on
the site live it is really that simple
clearly it's just as simple to add
browser compatibility that's something
that I think this will be a big draw for
this site I think the quality reference
will be really important but more and
more you want to see where which browser
support things what we're thinks ready
gotchas are and that's what I think this
larger community can really bring to the
table so there's actually a couple of
things I want to show you as well there
is a
alright so to getting started has
information on how to how to find
additional help so there is a an IRC
channel is on free no dork if you go to
the site then you look for that you find
all that information but so this is a an
IRC channel that is dedicated to this
its web platform and there's another one
called web platform hopefully I'm not
doing something crazy so this is a an
easy way to get some help if you're
online I mean there's actually tons of
people online that are part of this
project you can see lots of stuff
happening so so that's that's an easy
way to get involved and there's also one
called web platform site that deals with
a little bit more the back-end
infrastructure then there's a mailing
list and that's public web platform
w3.org easy to get get involved in and
you can send questions to the group no
one's going to bite and it's just easy
to to get answers for all of the things
you're working on if you want to you
want to get started there's plenty of
people here to help you and finally
there's a bug database so if you have an
actual issue with let's say these
templates need to be updated something a
little bit larger than something you can
do yourself or you can't flag then you
can file a bug against the system and
these bugs are triage fairly frequently
and trying to get the most important
things done as soon as possible so
that's a that's a little bit about the
web platform platform dachshund this is
all very liberally licensed unlike other
sides where you couldn't simply copy and
paste things from you can feel free to
use it in all of your blog post and
thatthat's nope no problem at all so the
licensing here I wish forget the exact
licensing someone helped me out is that
the it's creative commons
anyone remember what it is so I'll
follow up with you offline but it's a
very liberal license in fact you should
be able to do exactly what you're
talking about right the comment was
would be great if you have some sort of
live editing mode and and that's in fact
already discussed it's not there right
now but that's definitely on the agenda
for making this much more like you know
we're in 2012 now ok the kind of
important that we start doing these
using the stuff we're actually talking
about ourselves so I can't really
comment on exactly when that might land
but that's again dependent on mostly
just community in fact one thing i will
say about the sort of the you know that
we've been working on this for a while
and these these companies that were
listed there does the stewards if you
will but it wasn't an effort to try to
sort of do that behind closed doors at
all in fact we made this effort to get
it out as soon as possible but in a
reasonable alpha form so that it's not
completely broken and so that I think
that was successful it was launched we
had already had over a million page
views and in the first day we had
something like 2400 people that signed
up for an account something like 250
editors joined so there's a lot of
activity already and a lot of stuff has
already been improved there's of course
a lot more to do but the idea was that
as soon as we launched that everything
even all the meetings and all of those
things they became like done in a public
so there's no sort of utter committee
somewhere behind the scenes running the
show it's literally community so for
example we'll have regular meetings for
the content regular meetings for other
things like direction they will be
publicly announced here you can join
them we'll figure out exactly how we do
it there may be a call-in number at
edison allen store a an IRC channel
things like that but that's really it's
all out in the open
