well thank you guys for coming I'm Joey
I'm a lead UI developer here at quid of
being here for the last three and a bit
years developing what I think is a
pretty cool data visualization product
if you guys can pick up an accent I do
have one I'm from New Zealand move care
three and a half years ago just kind of
compelled by the technical challenge
that we're trying to solve here at quit
what we're really trying to solve is how
to how to have our users understand
really large amounts of unstructured
data so we're not we're not really
pulling together charts of numeric data
where we're really taking unstructured
data that means text and lots of it and
really trying to help users understand
it and in a very much much quicker way
than you normally would by reading so in
the last three and a half years of I've
really enjoyed seeing a brand new idea
come into kind of life building and
building a product building a platform
and and finding a product market fit and
starting to see some commercial success
we have quite a few enterprise clients
now over over 200 i believe active users
so the focus of my talk is going to be
about what I I perceive to be the the
core kind of technological advancement
that quit is making and it happens to be
about graph theory so if my talk is too
technical for you guys I apologize I'll
try to keep it pretty pretty consumable
but inside and out quit is all about the
graph
I'll be talking I'll give you guys an
overview of graphs and sort of common
examples of graph theory and comment
sort of technology products so you guys
are probably seen before I'll uh I'll
use this these terms these graph theory
terms to describe what quit actually
does under the hood and then I'll give
you guys a quick demo of quit so first
things first what is a graph when I when
I'm talking in the sort of our graphs I
don't necessarily mean charts so charts
like scatter plots or you know plots
like scatter plots charts like our
charts and histograms and not really
what I'm talking about i'm using the
more mathematical definition where a
graph is composed of a set of things
technically we call these things nodes
or vertices when talking about graphs
but they can represent anything in a
model and it also consists of a set of
links which connect these things and we
call those edges it's still quite a
simple thing it's just two things things
and links to pull them together here is
a very simple visualization of the graph
you can see in this case we use circles
to represent the things and lines to
represent the links in this in this
example we have our heads on the lines
to to kind of show that the links
themselves are directed by nature and
you can see there are different sized
things so--yes size to kind of show a
little more information typically
numeric information about the thing in
this case the there is a meaning behind
this graph of the things in this case
our web pages and the links are
hyperlinks and what this graph actually
demonstrates is Google's PageRank
algorithm
you can see the larger nose that
typically have more incoming links this
is kind of the notes that are more
influential within the the sub web here
you can see that nodes with one incoming
link such as one of the top right here
is larger than another one with this one
incoming link such as this one because
the web page with the ink with the link
linking to it is actually much more
influential so it's kind of like a
voting system to determine who the most
influential web pages are my google
doesn't show you a graph visualization
they simply use the algorithm to give
you a much better search result but but
it could be argued that graph theory and
the application of graph theory is what
gave Google the competitive edge to give
the best quality search results in the
late 90s and beat up Yahoo in altavista
and other competitors this should be a
pretty recognizable example of another
graph me in this case the graph
represents people and their pets on the
facebook social networking platform the
lines between people are very explicitly
mutually agreed friendships between
people what's interesting about this
graph is that it's a little bigger than
the previous example you can actually
start to see higher level information
coming through the actual structure of
the graph so on the top right you can
kind of see a community forming and then
in the center and then one or maybe two
communities forming on the left here
aside from identifying communities which
we can do so algorithmically I can also
highlight the potential people of
interest by looking at the general graph
structure so in the center of
communities you can see people who have
a lot of friends and very often more so
than people on
that's good hot skirts then sort of the
outer edges of the communities you can
also look at people who breach the
communities sort of people here
connecting them and kind of you know
draw conclusions as to why they might be
in that position it might be that they
change jobs or travel a lot but they
have a lot of kind of play bridge
communities of people and one last thing
to note is that you don't actually see
this graph visualization in facebook
either their product is kind of
delivering different sort of it's not a
visualization product it's a networking
product but they do use the graph data
structure a lock and turn away to drive
a better friend suggests algorithms and
make better decisions in which would
show you know which ads to show their
users another another example of a graph
visualization is a from a data set
called the netflix prize netflix a
number of years ago published a lot of
user rating data and asked data
scientists around the world to use it to
come up with an algorithm to improve
their movie recommendation systems so
this is one example published on a
beautiful w/e calm what's interesting
about this graph is that although the
the films themselves or the herbs are
the nodes themself represent movies the
edges used to connect the movies are
generated by an algorithm so edges
generated by an algorithm we call
implicit edges as opposed to explicit
edges that you might find in facebook or
pagerank or even linkedin and what would
you see here is you can actually see by
generating edges between movies and put
plotting in the graph you can actually
start to identify communities of niche
sort of communities of films that
you know have a lot of people liking the
same kind of film so around here you
spine the wall of the Star Trek films is
sort of a couple of religious clusters
down here and kind of get the mainstream
with fast and the furious at the top
again this is used by the data science
teams at companies that necklace it's
not shown to the user in their product
and it kind of leads to my point a lot
of these examples show that graph see
used all over the place in technology
industry but are not exposed the wrinkly
to the user however we also see that the
graph structure itself contains a lot of
sort of high-level insights a lot of
information that users don't normally
have access to and that's that's kind of
what we're trying to do here at quit and
then power to the user so this is a
quick description of our our technology
sort of the three main things we do we
allow user to define the set of things
that they want to visualize so we
actually have several data sets these
things can include news articles patents
blog posts descriptions of companies and
tweets it could be really anything the
only requirement that algorithms need is
that they have some text associated with
the things we then use our algorithm
stat to compute links between these
things we analyze the text we create
sort of a vector space model we perform
dimensionality reduction and try to get
this as fast as possible to produce
projects a graph which connects similar
documents and then the third part is
that we get the graph directly to the
user without interactive data
as a tool I so that leads me to the
demonstration part Quinn is a sort of a
a question answering platform of sorts
you can think of it a little bit like
Google you ask it a lot more difficult
questions and it doesn't give you the
answer directly it gives you a data
visualization which you can use to
answer your questions we call it
augmented intelligence it's a it's not
yet fully automated this is the question
that I've asked with what does the data
visualization technology landscape look
like this is if you imagine yourself as
one of our clients who might be a
decision maker on a corporate strategy
team in a large so technology company
they really want to know who's out there
in the data visualization space I want
to know who's the more interesting
companies that they might want to
possibly acquire or you know do measures
with or somewhere them
so after searching quite literally data
visualization in our company days it
this is the ground that I get back how
you can see in this case the nodes are
companies they're connected by links
which are you know similar similar
companies based on the words they used
to describe themselves and we went
clustering algorithms to cluster the
graph into different segments this is
about 300 data visualization companies
doing it doing a company segmentation
and kind of collecting that number of
companies and doing a segmentation takes
its aesthetically the job of a an
analyst at a company like McKinsey or
Bay and then they'd seen weeks on this
kind of stuff I go this together and
what if you have a couple of seconds
really so you can see the breakdown of
the the landscape you can kind of see
quite a cohesive cluster of the toe
right about genetics sequencing that's
of the thing you get energy monitoring
companies at the top see how the other
clusters that sort of makes sense
medicine of Finance what's interesting
to me is this Web Apps it's a little bit
more general purpose with apps I'm going
to dive into that one if I can find my
mouse
so here we go complete as see some
familiar names is in program we can read
a bit of information about a program we
can replace your cell data so you
purchase it from Quetta like you so to
the industry little data you can kind of
see that their base in Latvia I'm a
braised to put my million dollars and
private of isn't that sounds right
because nothing I sure the first
neighbors this is just highlight that
the first set of meters for in program
and surprise surprise silky chosen which
is great if i zoom in a little bit more
so the label shows up quids actually
right there as well so I didn't do any
budging of the data this actually came
up with them both connected so that was
very promising as I prepared the demo
yesterday so aside from looking at the
graph and seeing the high-level
segmentation and identifying interesting
companies based on the Pacific the
structure of the graph i can now i can
also use some of our more classical
Channing tools not the web chat not
graph in this case
so I'm going to move into a large huh so
this is it takes the notes that were
companies and just move them into a
child so you can see the same set of
nodes up here but plotted by the
community that will put them in as well
as a sizing deloused by investment
received so this gives you a good sense
of which clusters I'm sorry which
communities have received the most
amount of attention from a mrs. in this
case you can see business analytics
receiving a lot of money and also do a
scatterplot view so I'm going to do is
similar a similar analysis on the abyss
it received amount let's get a blood and
I'm actually going to merge the
companies in to represent their their
communities so here we can actually see
averages over the communities the
average founding year on the x-axis and
the average investment about alliances
and you kind of get a sense of which
parts of the visualization landscape are
new and which ones are receiving a lot
of investment and you can start to make
conclusions about what would otherwise
just be obstruction text and make real
decisions based on this information
