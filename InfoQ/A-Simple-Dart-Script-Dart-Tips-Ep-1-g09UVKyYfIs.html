first episode of dart tips throughout
this series I'll teach you all about the
dart language and libraries in short
easy to watch videos to kick things off
here's a quick orientation to a simple
dart script the designers of dart built
a scripting language that is generally
free of ceremony yet provides structure
for larger apps and is analyzable by
tools primarily a web development
language that must make it easy to write
a few lines of code and then simply hit
reload in your browser to see the
changes those scripts must then be able
to scale up to large full-featured apps
with potentially hundreds of thousands
of lines of code therefore dart has to
be terse easy to read and write
structured with classes and libraries
and not force you into rituals or
formalities this philosophy is evident
in this very simple dart program all
dart scripts start with main knowing
exactly where the program starts is the
first step to understanding the complete
program structure which in turn makes it
easy for minimizer's or other code size
reduction utilities to do a good job
dart is an optionally typed language
which means variables can be typed or
untyped here we use var to declare that
the answer is an untyped variable with
an initial value of 42 and integer
literal the object that answer points to
is an int but the variable itself is
dynamic or untyped tools like dart
editor can infer that the variable
answer is an integer but you can be even
more clear by using type annotations
here we have type the answer variable as
an INT sometimes developers want to be
more explicit which is especially
helpful when writing code that other
developers will use darts optional
static types are an important topic and
we will cover them in more detail in a
future episode for now just think of
static types as inline documentation or
type annotations that convey your
intention the tools and fellow
developers both versions of the script
have the same runtime semantics because
type annotations are optional and the
program runs as if you use a bar
everywhere everything in dart is an
object and every object is an instance
of a class even numbers and functions
are objects so yes
42 is an object and not a primitive
speaking of functions let's look at the
print number function dart supports
top-level functions because again
sometimes you don't need classes and it
should be easy to start
the most simple thing that works the
print number function takes one
parameter which is typed as a num and
named a number is good dart style to use
type annotations in the surface area of
your program such as function signatures
because it makes it very easy to declare
what the function expects inside a print
number we use a built-in print function
to display the number is 42 to the
console notice the dollar sign followed
by the name of a variable this syntax
called string interpolation includes a
variables value inside a string literal
this is a terse way to build strings
nothing new but dart uses a double
forward slash as a one-line common dart
also supports the multi-line comment
format made popular in other languages
as you can see dart is unsurprising and
familiar which is exactly the point
we built a language that most developers
can be productive in within just a few
hours or less if you have experience
with C C++ Java ActionScript c-sharp or
JavaScript you'll find dart easy to
learn but don't let this familiar syntax
fool you for now that you know how to
read dart code there are plenty of
improvements and cool features to show
off in future videos thanks for watching
