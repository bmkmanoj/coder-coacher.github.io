client-side for like better user
experience more responsiveness and more
native feel so there's a lot more Jas
JavaScript right now how many of you
write significant amounts of it how many
of you use a framework for it cool
that's actually a significant number so
um out of this talk I'm I'd like you I'd
like you to know what client-side
frameworks are how to evaluate them some
where to look for documentation
tutorials and sort of a thousand foot
view of backbone integration this isn't
going to be a really long talk so I
can't really get into the details so why
would use a framework you want to use
something to organize your JavaScript
intertwined business and presentation
logic isn't really very exciting and
there's probably a lot of repeated stuff
around and so the doms a handy places
store info and a lot of JavaScript ends
up being a really nested jquery
callbacks so that's if you've ever seen
a lot of messy JavaScript this is a good
way to fix it so the lot of other
frameworks out like probably 50 or more
or something so some of the major ones
spines probably the closest to backbone
it's written coffee script and it's
lighter a little more different
something spine does differently is who
had on is who handles a lot of the
business logic spine moves it more to
the client side so all server requests
are asynchronous they don't really
happen that often so it's not the
easiest to integrate with an existing
rails app but it's great if you want to
do a lot of stuff client-side ember used
to be sprout on used to be sprout core
it's really feature-rich there's a lot
going on for it it falls a lot of the
convention over configuration so if
you're into Ruby maybe that's your thing
knockout it's it's a little different
from the rest of them because it's not
MVC it's mvvm so it what knockout really
does well that excels at data binding
templates
there's like a whole scripting language
in the HTML so you can you can bind
things really well JavaScript MVC it's
older it's one of the oldest um
frameworks out there it's got it it's
extremely comprehensive it has a good
tit has tests and everything so yeah so
you don't have to rewrite them on your
own um and Batman the server is in node
so that's how it deals with server
integration so a little bit about
backbone it's written by Jeremy ashkan s
I've only seen it red he's the same guy
who wrote coffeescript and maintains it
it's fairly lightweight the source is
extremely readable so if you if you're
looking into backbone I suggest that you
start reading the source first because
the docs are less um they're not as good
as introducing you to it it's extremely
flexible you can override everything you
have options for doing anything you ever
want to do and what it excels at is
integrating with a restful api it's only
hard dependency is underscore and it
uses either jQuery or zep dough which
you probably have in your app anyway
this is the official blurb from the
docks I've highlighted a couple of the
important words I'll let you read
through it
so the components of backbone there's a
model maintain state there's a
collection which backbone separates from
a model which is pretty handy there's
view a router kind of takes the place of
a um of a controller it's similar to
routes Darby in Ruby history deals with
um dispatching URL changes to the router
and sync is how is how it interacts with
the server and underscore and jQuery so
here's kind of an overview of how things
fit together it's a pretty picture
between the server sync deals with Ajax
requests there a collection is a some
sort of a sorted order of models sword
collection of models and the models and
views are bound by by a hash that you
can declare that map's URL stream that
maps events to to actual actions on the
model and then that's bound to the the
browser through jQuery and that's how
your use and that's how user interacts
with it so models and collections you
create a backbone model by calling
extend on it and that provides you with
getters and setters and attributes and
you can initialize that with JSON and it
may be kind of unusual to separate the
collection from the model but in
practice it's super useful because a lot
of the actions you do are usually on
collections more than they are on
individual models you'll probably be
interacting more with collections in the
long run than you do with any individual
model and it's also neat because if you
give it a comparator it will maintain a
collection order when you add models to
it and you can filter it you can ask it
for all models that have some property
the views they're not technically MVC
views since they're not the templates
themselves they're more view classes um
so each view is bound to some element in
the Dom and you can specify the tag name
in the class name or the element
directly and you override render to
create the view and that
is called whenever of you is um whatever
reviews trying to be created and you you
create a hash that delegates events to
add event had lurdes to your element and
the router this is what connects the
browser state to your app so it provides
methods so you can route client-side
pages so you can give it variables and
or or splats and will call the call the
function on it and history is what deals
with dispatching this the router sync is
the magic behind interacting with these
server it defaults to Ajax but you can
override the sync method so it usually
it uses local store or pretty much
anything you want it to and those are
the options on the default one there's a
lot of information these slides I didn't
mean to cover everything since it's a 15
minute talk they're available online I
heard you like JavaScript so that's what
this talk is written in so an overview
of integration with rails you limit the
the interface is limited to a json REST
API so if you've got that already in
your app and you're pretty much set to
go file organization instead of sticking
everything into an application jas you
can spread it out across folders and
it'll gum and the asset pipeline or your
pre rails 3 point 0 public javascripts
will serve it up so basically this is
what it looks on this is what the
interaction between rails and backbone
looks like the model gets information
from the controller the backbone model
gets information from the rails
controller and then provides that
information to the view which deals with
updating templates inside the inside
whatever rails template you have the you
don't really need a one-to-one mapping
between your rails models and your
backbone models since there's a lot of
stuff you might do clients either you
don't necessarily want to store in a
server but you do need one rails
controller / your back / backbone modal
/
bone model I had too much coffee each
backpal each backbone view is bound to
an element in the Dom and you should use
some sort of templating engine it comes
back one comes with underscores so
that's the handy thing to use the only
gotcha that you might want to deal with
is if you're mixing your rails templates
with your backbone templates in one file
you want to change the the variable
indicator on that because both um
because a hamel also uses little percent
equals to denote Ruby code so there are
a lot of resources online to get to know
backbone there is documentation there's
the annotated source code which is where
I recommend starting it's well-written
easy to read and also underscore dot
document it um and then there's a lot of
tutorials online about this there's a
neat blog post about where the
JavaScript code goes there a couple
there a couple of really neat tutorials
you can follow instead of the usual
to-do app there's um cloud edit is sort
of a Google Docs really quickly written
up in that in backbone and a couple of
paid resources if you're into that you
can buy a book there's an online book
and then a pitch so I worked for
anything social and we're developing a
website called zambozo calm in addition
to other things it's um it's an
astrology application that lets you see
your friends horoscopes how they
interact with you it's neat if you want
cute little sentences to send around or
if you're into astrology you should
check it out
