instructor with Marikana I teach html5
and some of the mobile modules today i
want to show you two browser tools for
viewing hardware acceleration and CSS to
take a step back one disadvantage of
using CSS animations also known as
keyframe animations instead of the more
vanilla transitions is that the browser
is not doing any interpolation now
interpolation is when the computer
determines all of the unknown points
between a set of known points more
concretely if we have a point a B and C
it's when the computer determines all
the intermediate points between a B and
C now in order to speed things up in our
keyframe animations we can leverage
what's called hardware acceleration
hardware acceleration is the offloading
of work from the cpu to the GPU the
graphics card on your computer now to
trigger hardware acceleration in our key
frames we can simply set the property
transform to the value translate 3d 000
we can actually use any of the 3d
transform properties to trigger hardware
acceleration so not just translate 3d
but also scale 3d rotate 3d or even
rotate Z now we can use these properties
even if we don't have a reason to we can
simply add translate 3d 0 0 0 to n eq
frame in order to implement hardware
acceleration now once you've added this
it's really helpful to be able to see if
it's taken effect so I want to show you
how to turn on the viewing of hardware
acceleration in both Chrome and Safari
so let's take a look let's start off by
looking at how this works in chrome so
open up a new chrome window and type
about flags in the URL bar this is going
to bring up all of your different
options that you can set and different
things that you can enable and the one
that you're going to want to look for is
composite render layer borders it's a
little bit farther down let's search for
it and there's a few different options
for composite so here's the one we need
composited render layer borders so I
already have a turn on so let me turn it
off and reenable it in order to see this
come into effect you need to restart
crumb so let's go ahead and read
launched chrome now what this is going
to do is it's going to paint in chrome
anything that chrome itself is
compositing in other words sort of
putting together in the browser in other
words hardware accelerating so I want to
show you one example this is from a
github page from a series of code
examples that I did for the html5 dev
conference it's got a rotating sailboat
a/c that's moving up and down and then
another layer where C is moving back and
forth now the way that this ship
animation works is it's a rotate Z which
would be triggering hardware
acceleration and so let's just look at
the cove real quick just to have a seat
at what it's doing so we can actually
just take a look at the CSS the
animation is called rock and here it is
so just to transform a rotate z of
negative 2 degrees 24 degrees so this is
considered a 3d transform because we're
using rotate z not just rotate and
that's what's causing the hardware
acceleration now there's two other
animations I want to show you one is
called ocean rise which does have an
orange border around it and I'm just
using a scale here so you might ask the
question why is this being hardware
accelerated so let me just take a break
and show you something in the chromium
blog which is a list of all of the
things that will actually trigger
hardware acceleration in chrome and you
can see here that one of them is if you
use a CSS animation for a WebKit
transform so it's actually going to do
hardware acceleration not just for the
3d transforms but also for any transform
that is being animated via a keyframe so
that's why this first ocean is being
hardware accelerated now there's one
more waves pass this is just changing
background position back and forth and
you can see it it's a little bit
underneath this is actually a separate
layer and it does not have an orange
border around it so that is not using
any kind of a transform be it 3d or an
animated transform and so we do not see
hardware acceleration here so that's how
you take a look at this in Chrome so
let's switch over to the term
no and have a look at how we do this in
Safari basically this is the magic flag
we're just going to run safari with this
flag set see a color opaque set to one
which is going to paint a red background
on anything that's hardware accelerated
and then you just want to provide the
path to your Safari so this is the path
to mine your mileage may vary depending
on your OS so we're just going to run
that it's going to launch a new safari
and once I close that Safari this option
will no longer be there it just lives
for the duration that this particular
Safari is open so i'm going to paste in
this same link to the sailboat and just
as in chrome we're seeing hardware
acceleration on the rocking boat and in
the rising and falling wave but not on
the wave that is simply animating a
change to background position so we can
look at just one other thing i have a
seat at maybe a different site this is a
really cool demo by anthony calzadilla
we could take a look at it in chrome
let's let's check it out in Safari oops
we're going to see a lot of red gives a
lot of his stuff is using hardware
acceleration really just so here's your
he basically redid the intro to madman
it's pretty impressive so you can see
here a whole bunch of stuff as being
hardware accelerated pretty much all the
different elements on the page so thanks
so much for watching this screencast if
you want to learn more I did a talk at
the html5 dev conference i also have a
book learning css3 animations and
transitions from Pearson I teach html5
courses and mobile courses for Maracana
if you want to see when a course is
coming up in your area or an online
course take a look at this link and if
you want to track me down at any time
I'm always happy to answer questions and
really the best way to find me is on
Twitter I'm just add Alexis goldstein I
really hope you enjoyed this screencast
have a great day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
