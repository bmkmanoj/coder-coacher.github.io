and your chicken out there and everybody
has those chairs to every way I got
their chair and their t-shirts and of
course we have james gosling is going to
be the main event right now your we're
going to have a presentation from Gary
Collins and myself we're both engineers
former son and now at Oracle and we're
the warm-up for james gosling so we're
like the warm-up band for james gosling
who's like the Rolling Stones or James
Brown where we're like the monkeys we're
like the new kids on a block so so
Gary's like Marky Mark I'm kind of like
the Funky Bunch but we're here to give
to the talk on developing with Oracle
Java embedded technology for the
Raspberry Pi how many people here have
heard about the raspberry pi or
currently developed a while geez that's
probably a good over sixty percent of
the people out here so that's good we're
going to talk about how you could take
today's Java embedded and be able to run
on it and that's since you're all part
of the job of users group that's
probably in your interest and also it
segues nicely into james's talk because
Gary and I saw his presentation it's
going to be a really good presentation
so so stay tuned for that it's he's got
his demo he's got all kinds of things
with the liquid robotics is his company
that is that that it's all kinds of cool
things and and you're going to really
want to take a good look at that but as
I said before that we're going to give a
presentation on how you can use Java
embedded on a similar type of device
linux arm that's called the Raspberry Pi
it's a very popular type of development
platform today and also we're here to
get your feedback so any type of
information that you want to tell us
we'll open it up for questions and
answers at the end after Gary's going to
go through a bunch of steps that will
get you there to be running on the
Raspberry Pi and it also applies to
other types of devices that are out
there there are the the BeagleBoard the
IMX freescale boards that are similar
their linux arm and that's one of the
reasons we want to do that is to allow
technology developers out there to be
using today's devices to play around
with Java and so before we begin this is
Oracle now it's not son we have a safe
harbor statement so let's all read this
together so you know we have to go
through this when we have our our types
of presentations but that's you know
getting past that here's our agenda for
today we're going to go through an
introduction what exactly is java SE
embedded then we're going to talk about
developing with javab for embedded all
these fun devices including robotics
including small boards that that will be
able to light up LED lights for you or
drive servo motors for you or do all
kinds of fun stuff what it are the best
practices with java for embedded then
Gary will take over the presentation and
he'll go over downloading installing
java SE embedded platform for your
Raspberry Pi and it'll go through step
by step there's all kinds of interesting
details that that he's got some hints on
how to get around some of the pitfalls
that heaps he's seen before and then
we'll have a discussion about that and
finally a demo and open it up for
questions and we'll make sure to save
time for James and and his talk and
jumping right into it the introduction
to java SE embed includes that we have a
proven and stable platform it's got a
huge developer base that kind of shows
the effect here by having so many people
come out for a java talk and there's
rapid application development that you
could do with it you you all know being
part of the java community
it's fully object-oriented runs on a
virtual machine it's got memory
management portability and it could
support it can be supported on today's
multi-core devices and that's important
because linux arm now has quad core and
and multi-core target devices that are
showing up in tablets in network routers
and all kinds of other devices so being
able to handle that is something
inherently that Java can do there's also
as you guys know security and high
availability networking and also there's
the full java SE specifications that
that java SE embedded file is if you if
you know the different editions that
we've had in past I've worked on Java ME
CDC how many know Java me connected
device configuration not a huge amount
maybe ten percent maybe five percent so
so you guys are more aware of java SE as
one single specification one set of AP
is we had problems in Java ME because we
were a subset of the spec and so you
would have to switch your mindset is
this API available and the subset or is
it something I'm thinking about that's
only available on desktop well we're
getting rid of all that now java
embedded has the same exact set of AP is
that you would find on Java desktop so
it'll make you guys happy because you're
used to Java SC and there's also
optimizations you don't want to run the
same binary you have on your desktop on
these devices like the Raspberry Pi you
want to save on memory you want to have
smaller footprint in terms of static
footprint size so there's a smaller
persistent rom and disk requirements and
smaller impact to your volatile ram so
less dynamic memory usage also there's
runtime optimizations in the JIT and
especially for these new arm compilers
and we'll keep this informal if you have
questions just wave and shout it out and
as we go along developing for a job
embedded where is it used well it's used
in these embedded devices now as
mentioned network routers multifunction
printers
there's definitely smaller amounts of
memory on them it might be 512 bag or
128 Meg not the four gig that you're
used to on your desktop or laptop and
there's lower power CPUs it's primarily
these arm chips that we're talking about
and you'll find them in in robots you'll
find them in these low power devices
also and they're still networked and as
you'll you'll see in James this talk
there's going to be communication that's
done with all those robots that are out
in the ocean they are talking a wireless
network protocol and that's primarily
what you see with these devices nowadays
and they're either headless or have very
small and limited screen so you have
limited types of input either a touch
screen or a keypad not a full 101 qwerty
keyboard and this is as much marketing
as I'll get this is where you see it in
TVs and cars and everywhere and this is
the typical stack diagrams that you've
seen in the past on one side you have
big servers on the left side and then
you have Java EE that's meant to be run
as the key AP is that you have but you
also have the desktop where you can run
things like javafx and in the future
we'll see that also go to embedded in
the middle you have the higher-end
embedded and lower end embedded and if
you look at the the blocks for Java you
could see there's java SE and Java ME
meet there in the middle of embedded so
on the on the lower embedded side you'll
have things like TV your blu-ray player
your your smartphones and your feature
phones and all the way on the smallest
end of the spectrum on the very right
most there is your Java card so what
we're talking about now is actually in
java SE we span down into embedded
devices and it's the higher-end embedded
devices such as what you see from james
when he's using linux arm on these
devices that are floating around in the
ocean that's a higher-end embedded
device the lower-end embedded devices
would use Java ME maybe
connected limited device configuration
instead and then tying it all together
of course as everybody knows here is the
Java language so that you program it
once using the programming programming
language for Java and be able to
transfer that knowledge to all these
different devices and what are the best
practices you're going to want to watch
your memory just because you have a
limited amount you're going to want to
use tricks that we have for reducing
static initializers making sure you're
aware every time you're doing a static
initializer that's going to be another
burden on the dynamic memory also use
lazy memory allocation instead of being
eagerly allocating static arrays or or
just grabbing a huge heap make sure to
do that only when needed on demand and
then there's limiting your static
footprint size we have now investigating
in our group ahead of time compilation
so that your your static footprint size
or what you need in ROM is going to be
the minimal and then there's limiting
use of threads even though your
multi-core you don't want to use
everything up there's the system that's
going to be running in a background so
make sure to limit your use of threads
and all this together is dealing with
these lower powered CPU such as the arm
devices and let's take a look at what
you could download right now and this is
what Gary will be showing is that for
your Raspberry Pi you can go out there
and use these product releases that
Oracle has already and if you see the
top three they're all arm-based types of
binaries you can download now there's
our md5 support this is for has anybody
used a guru plug or the Shiva plug to do
linux arm development before show hands
guru or Shiva but not that many okay so
that's kind of older technology right
now it seems like the sweet spot is the
arm v6 arm v7 devices and that's what
you see in the second row there is a
Linux arm v6 arm v7 headless and
headphone binary that we support so you
can download that as a java SE embedded
binary and be able to run all your java
/
Rams compile using Java Sea and then be
able to copy it over your device as
Gary's going to show and and show how to
run then there's also one more there's a
server jet version of arm v7 and that's
for your higher end type of device it
might be a micro server might be
something that runs in a data center
that's based on arm and there's also
several other bynars that we have
flavors for powerpc and x86 so at this
point I'm going to turn it over to Gary
and he's going to step you through the
actual instructions for getting java
running on your Raspberry Pi so so he
you already know my name we asked the
question how many here is know about the
raspberry pi how about how many have a
Raspberry Pi pretty cool about four or
five of us yeah well we had the same
issue so don't feel bad we're all in the
same line so to speak so basically what
I'm going to talk about is the Raspberry
Pi obviously the good question where do
you get a raspberry pi some installation
typical customization stuff that I've
found very useful doing arm I think
we've been doing arm for oh gosh I don't
know many years and so over the years
I've found a lot of different types of
issues that i ran into and i kind of
listed a few of them make it a little
bit easier for people that are jumping
into these platforms and the last not
the last but how to download that's the
most important where do we get it and
how do we download it it is their job
already so then a simple demo of Java
running actually on a Raspberry Pi and
we actually have a Raspberry Pi it's
sitting right here and the demo will be
running on this I don't know if
everybody can see it but so the
Raspberry Pi was basically made for you
know try to engage the students to
actually learn more and actually maybe
engage us to actually teach more to the
children and maybe teach Java on a
platform like this so this this is an
arm v6 system 700 megahertz
it's what we consider an arm 11 even
though it's v6 as a broadcom chip for
the processor it also has a broadcom
video core for OpenGL es2 I know 256
mega memory but I think that's kind of a
rich environment for the most part for
when you're a headless environment HDMI
a dsi compose a video audio jack the
HDMI is actually 1080p I with audio out
which is actually pretty compelling for
an edge device if you wanted to make
something to connect to a TV two USB
ports 2 dot 0 that is on SD MMC slot and
sdio slot it has an Ethernet jack which
if you're working in a lab environment
it's you know wireless is nice but when
i work an oracle wireless isn't nice and
so we recycle our passwords 20 every 24
hours so having a hardwired to a device
like this really makes it easy for us to
use in a lab environment and actually
for good testing the awesome 8 a cheapy
i/o ports for those that I'd like to
turn lights on and off on a on a little
device you aren't for you know
interfacing with the device I to see the
SBI bus the cool part 3 point 5 watts at
5 volts that's pretty awesome for a
small device costs thirty-five dollars
i'm sure you guys already heard all of
this about the system and shipping they
have two models the first model was the
reveille they haven't shipped again it
has no ethernet one USB this device here
actually has again to USB slots and
ethernet so the other one doesn't and
the hdmi next slide so this is the
device sure you most of you all know all
most of all the stuff on it but if you
look on the bottom middle that's the
hdmi slot ethernet is the top bottom
right or top right as you say then you
got the USBs but in the middle is the is
the the brains so to speak inside the
middle is an arm
or basically your application processor
also a GPU and then later on top of that
is your 256 mega memory most systems
have them layered on the side they've
actually consolidated space to trim down
the device to as small as they can and
the bottom or top left is the GPIO ports
and you can connect even at like a
simple LCD to display to this device as
well so here's where we can get it if
you're in the UK but you guys aren't so
you'd want to stick with the second one
the RS Components group and to go to
their fill out the you know submit your
email address and they'll eventually
send you an email saying you're up and
that's about as best you can get but
they're starting to get into production
even more so there'll be a lot more
available and that's a cool device so so
I'm not really going to get into how to
DD an image onto an SD card the link
there and again we'll have some slot a
slide at the end which will show a URL
to an internal site or an external site
that you you can follow a guide there's
a more comprehensive set of steps used
to actually get Raspberry Pi up and get
java on it and actually do simple
testing so again the first step there is
basically dding a debian image which is
what the preferred image at the moment
and it's debbie and 605 once you do the
first update customization steps my
steps aren't always the best for
everybody but for the most part from my
test environment for making the machines
basically a set it and forget it putting
in a lab in just letting it go that's
kind of what this is towards usually
with the GUI going and ssh enabled but
for the demo we're not going to have a
GUI actually running on the device
because there's no cable connected to it
so the one of the first steps that I
usually do is you know when you get this
card there you know I've got onto the
website and research most people stick
their card into the device they did eat
and then I go and take that and they put
it into the machine like I only have a
hundred and twenty Meg left I can't do
anything with this so and they had a
four gig starting from so basic
the first step just resize the SD card
you're actually burning this card from a
windows box or from a linux box if
you're from Linux bring up gparted
and/or your command line if you feel
like doing it and actually resize the
petitions again there is a document that
will show how to do that but Google
Raspberry Pi and or go to either one of
those websites that I told the front l
or the Allied they have great
instructions on this as well and in
pretty good detailed instructions it's
just what we show is what we used so
that's the resize the fix in the ssh i
found this was usually whenever i get an
embedded device from any one of the
communities linaro and boon to adobe and
usually they already have a pre-canned
image that you can pop on to these
devices well this is the first device
i've got from somebody that actually
didn't have ssh enabled and i understand
why they didn't they didn't want to
consume more power and consume more
space or use more memory so they didn't
start the the graphics environment and
they didn't start sshd so that command
basically will tell you how to launch
sshd as an upstart job and then you
don't have to do anything I've heard a
lot of people actually trying to install
ssh and way sick it's already there that
just shows you how to enable him the
next step was I found pretty useful when
you here in the US and where this device
was made was in the UK the M inch was
made in the UK so changing your timezone
your localization and your console
keyboard settings I found this useful
for debian ubuntu makes it pretty easy
but Debbie ins a little bit more unique
and I found that while I was trying to
edit a file on the X etfs tab file and I
try to put a pound key and I was getting
this weird squiggle I didn't know why it
was a lot of people have found different
keyboards not working it's not a matter
of the keyboard will work you might just
have to remap it and those commands at
the bottom there the D package reconfig
dash pillow with locales and the
reconfigure keyboard configuration those
two of the magic to make the keyboard
localization all work for your for your
environment or the US that that is
alright so the next step they don't
start the GUI by default but the x
server actually so to speak or the x
server is so to speak running but not
really running doing the change in the
inner tab on off you are all familiar
with linux and how how easy it is to
manipulate it but these devices are
pretty simple just change the init tab
file change the init level from a 2 2 of
5 and then it will start automatically a
lot of people had to start hacking the
GD m.com files and a bunch of different
things this is simple change it to to a
5 the graphic starts automatically you
don't have to type startx again I try to
make it so in a test environment it
always just works and it works and
deploys across multiple machines so
another one I found useful and you find
this I found this this next step the
static IP of course static IP is the
easiest way to have something managed in
a lab environment because I can log into
a device because I know what it is and
if it repower it comes back up it's the
same IP and a test environment is
crucial for most people when you're
running from your home you don't need to
do that but the the next step i found
was very useful and I find this much of
a pain is the hardware address ether
with the mac address you pound that into
that etsy network interfaces file when
you're using static what I found in
testing over time this the network gets
saturated the i/o gets saturated enough
that the system kind of gets confused
and the reit and the network resets on
you and so you went from ether 02 ether
one and you know how did that happen
make and someone said oh your machines
hung and everything it's not actually
you walk over the system it's running
the problem is it rotated itself and
went to the next ether report so doing
this this saved me tons of time in a lab
environment it just makes it you don't
even have to think about it the next one
I found so to speak you useful you're in
the UK they're using the UK debian place
change your change the place to the US
it'll be faster for pulling your app
gets for installing packages or whatever
you're doing in the last they didn't
enable sound I would assume it's the
same reason they didn't load the module
so add that to you
modules file and sound will work on the
next reboot unless you want to do the
magic to start it right then and there
but that's about it for that part all
right so at one nice time I what we try
to do in the lab environment is we try
to set up systems so they basically
hands off as much as possible like a
setter set it and forget it is less
moving parts as possible some of these
parts are very expensive and you know
talking thirty to forty to sixty dollars
USB cards but they go they don't have a
life they have a very short life if
you're writing lots of files to it so
this trick here i found was very useful
using know at time and no dirt time on
your mounts for the petition to which is
your root filesystem when you actually
read on these devices on these are
devices every read is a right doing this
makes it so it isn't one increases your
performance slightly but it guarantees
your life of your device is is extended
now because you're not doing massive
amounts of rights petition three by
default isn't enabled which is your swap
petition you can use it if you wish or
not I actually enable it in a test
environment it just gives me that extra
wiggle room especially on 256 actually
there's only 190 available to a user on
this particular setup last but not least
is iceweasel it's the browser that I
install on the device at least for
Debian it's pretty reliable it works
well on the arm system the midori
default browser nothing to do with Java
just you click on the thing that just
dies iceweasel works great horrible wait
I'm just before I'll be repeating the
questions that's my job here so the
perform you were asking about
performance wishing to MMC swapping on
mfc you want to avoid it like the plague
but it's I mean it's it's not that it's
not good so you want to try to keep and
like I think Pinkman said earlier you
really want to manage your your memory
and in the funny part is you know
everybody says job is taking up so much
memory and you're executing all this
stuff and you're consuming lots of
memory start the x server up on when you
get one of these and launch the graphics
server on it and then before you do it
check your memory then do it it's 90 Meg
just the graphic environment so and the
system by itself default takes about 25
meg so you're already lost about 115 so
you really have to manage your space
well alright so can I have some Jabba
with my raspberry pi I thought there was
a catchy phrase glad somebody thought it
was humorous so it's a tough crowd today
yeah so you go to that website there
it's the oracle network site and you
download java SE so the trick for this
device is we've always had java here
it's always been on the the website for
v6 supports a Raspberry Pi a lot of
people in the forums have said there
isn't any job on the Raspberry Pi how do
we get Raspberry Pi for drama and a lot
of people just you know app get and they
install OpenJDK and they say oh it's not
really that fast probably right so where
do you get the performance Java this
website here you go to this website
click on it download the the arm v6
headless version for this device it's an
e ba bi vfp with soft FP ABI I don't
know if you guys probably all familiar
with that with little endian so fill out
the questionnaire well I heard somebody
at the dinner tonight said what's up
with the question here why do I have to
answer questions I said well you know
for us to be able to predict the future
we need information from you to help us
know where we're going to go in the
future so the more information you
provide the better we can in predicting
where we're going to go next to make
sure that we're giving you what you need
to do your next greatest thing so once
you fill this out obviously you have to
do this from a Linux host box unless you
really want to set up a mail system on a
Raspberry Pi and send your email back to
that but you can do it and it does work
but from your host system you're going
to get an email click on the email once
you're all done submitting that is in
this is the download you're going to
actually download the arm v6 Linux
headless very specific the ej re and
this version here and that will work
perfectly fine the headless environment
on this device and it works so x so i'm
sure you guys all know about tar.gz
files and so are our bits are basically
tar.gz up there's not an RPM or our
package to install it's basically a
tarball that you put on to device so i
don't know if everybody knows well those
commands but it's basically simple java
and simple tar.gz commands to pop it on
so i guess we're going to go into the
demo now the show the Raspberry Pi
running a simple Java program it's
basically a server socket program
running on the Raspberry Pi and what
it's doing is its opening up a port on
the Raspberry Pi and basically
communicating bites back to a web
browser through some port and that's
actually going to be communicating back
to the mac to show in the browser did
you want to talk about the type of data
it's grabbing it's the cpu in five so
basically that the system that java is a
java program that's basically in the
background is doing a bunch of pulling
of different files in property
information from the system itself and
is sending it back it's not our
inspiring but the point is is java and
it works on the device I could have
shown you a really cool demo but I
figured I'd leave it for James and he
can show a really cool demo on his
device but this is a simple Java program
running hardware status so you might
want to point out this cursor and this
prompt is on the glass very pop yeah so
the left the left screen is basically
the Raspberry Pi if you can see the
process we did a cat proc CPU info
you'll see it's an RB 6 compatible
device it's 697 megahertz or 700 they
call a bogo but that's basically begging
megahertz as a broadcom 2708 chip and
it's a type 2 and i'm not sure what the
reversion why it's revision 2 but ok so
i'll just start up the jar down yeah
so this is the Java that Gary talked
about downloading directly from the
Oracle otn website and then e you just
untie ur dit yeah now we're just going
ahead and run it so it's starting up
it's going to open up a port and start
communicating on that port now do you
want to talk about the browser yeah so
they poked in here so basically the
browser we obviously if you notice that
the time is there it's a fictitious time
obviously because I didn't do ntp date I
usually for myself I always drop inside
the NCRC local file I don't know if you
guys use that at all I actually add
little commands and different things and
a lot of the arm device people will
actually drop a lot of information in
there to query the system and one in
this instance that actually queries for
the IP and the IP sent back so then you
can see what you need to SSH into if
you're attached with the monitor but
basically this one here is showing you
the time the last time it was running
which was 4 10 which is a long time ago
today and you'll see the memory and
you'll see it's a chip so now he's just
going to basically reload the page from
running and it's actually going out and
connecting as you can see it connected
to the system and then the time actually
changed it's not really the real time
because I didn't set the date so it
shows the price let me control see this
and yeah and just show people that it's
actually trying to communicate to the
raspberry pi because now so now I won't
see it yep won't but then I started back
up again gets on that same socket 5002
reload again a client connected I'm
either it is I don't know how else to
show it but I mean I can hold a network
cable out and show you but basically
this is the device here and Java runs
and it runs great on it so go get
yourself one and start playing around i
mean it's a $35 you can't beat it I mean
it's just amazing 710 thank you hey you
got applause for a demo that's good
thank you we're just going to have a
discussion now and then we'll open it up
for questions so if you guys can queue
up and think of any questions that you
might have for Gary or myself that that
program that you ran it's a jar file
that's from revolution robotics yeah
sorry I should have done a thankless
plug to two iron more from revolution
robotics he basically wrote a really
cool demo but he gave us a bunch of
different pieces from that we put it off
he basically put it all together in a
net beans project and made a few
modifications which we showed on the
screen but basically he did most of all
this work we just utilizing this this
code by the way we'll actually you can
be able to be able to download it will
have will try to update our our site
where explains in more detail of how to
get a raspberry pi up and running pretty
quickly so on that site will try to put
the link at the bottom maybe to
reference where where you can download
from revolution robotics this code and
another question that people might have
about their right away is if you have
your dot C source I'm sorry taxi dot
java source file and you want to compile
it what is the way that you're supposed
to compile it and then get it on to the
Raspberry Pi so in this case we have a
JRE on the device so there is no Java
Sea and typical deployments for embedded
devices as they you build it on your
really cool linux or mac or some device
compile it and deployed its java its
class files you just drop it over there
and it executes you where you bridge the
the world is with a little bit of jni so
that's where you have to be a little bit
more creative on how to actually cross
compile your native code to work on the
arm device and then merge the two
together and then deploy so here's the
resources that Gary talked about and
we'll have these available for for
anyone that wants to come up after after
James the stock and have questions for
us but we'll also make the presentation
available to people too and there is at
the very bottom there's a getting
started guide that will sum everything
up there so that's a more in-depth
I went really quick and I really didn't
go into detail and we're going to try to
build on a better resource so how to
really get up and going on an arm device
I mean I've run into so many different
types of issues and I hit my head
against the wall so many times and so
basically you know you really want to
make a minimal minimizes much the scope
out of this out of developing on these
devices and make just pure job and
that's what you're trying to worry about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
