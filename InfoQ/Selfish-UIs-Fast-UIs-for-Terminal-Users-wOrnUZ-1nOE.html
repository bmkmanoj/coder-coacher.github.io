surrett I'm the guy who uses a linux
laptop and can't present on his own
laptop randomly I think this is second
time tapped me in any scholar so what oh
I'm sorry yeah it's pretty awesome
anyway so I don't know if you remember
last year I think I was the last one to
give a talk and I went way over time way
over time by like 30 minutes so I
promise you that this one will be much
shorter because most of it was meant to
be live coding all right anyway no not
that that's a lie okay we're going to
talk about selfish you eyes and we're
going to start with the demo which is no
longer happening but it's fine it's fine
I'll tell you what happened we can
visualize okay then we're going to talk
about like how to implement your own us
but first a little bit of motivation all
right so all the time we're developing
software to try to make somebody else's
lives easier all the time all the time
how often do you focus on your own daily
life and try to make your own life a
little bit easier so that you can
develop software faster a lot of times
there's little tiny command line tools
that you can make for some task you do
repeatedly that will improve your
ability to deliver code the person who
taught me this I think is still here his
name is Paul Phillips I don't know where
he is but if you ever have a chance to
watch this this man work it's amazing
the amount of productivity tools he's
built around his dev process is exciting
and it really can improve your
throughput of what you can build but
anyway it's actually relatively easy to
make these things and if you make
something that's reusable for other
people that's awesome the demo you can
imagine I have a terminal open and I
type snark check and it shows my Twitter
stream in color that's that's what the
demo is and you can also run tweets and
that sort of thing it's just a little
command line terminal client that I made
to show you like examples of what this
is we're going to talk about how this
how this guy is implemented it works so
the architecture of snark check you pass
a command line string in okay do the
thing I want this comes into a parser
you lift that into a command you pass in
your configuration context and you
execute it does this sound familiar to
anyone who watched ruin ours talk yeah
okay good because that's that's
basically all we're doing in command
lines and we're doing it very small very
quick very efficiently but because i was
lazy we don't necessarily use functional
programming no anyway okay but our
technology choices right now just
because i implemented this in about 30
minutes was SBT completion which is what
we'll talk about this is how you can do
command line parsing and tab completion
and without the demo it doesn't look as
nice but this is what's used under the
covers for SBT if you've seen SBT on the
command line when you press tab it will
tell you what tasks are available and
that's dynamically created the SBT
completion parser library is how that
happens for the fancy color schemes if
you want to color content you get that
right out of the standard library Scala
there's this thing called Scala console
that has nice nice immutable values
called red and green the most important
one is reset because after you make
something red if you want to ever read
anything ever again you need to reset
the terminal and then for rich
interaction is j line but i kind of cut
a lot of that out of the talk because j
line is not a 50-minute talk j line is a
well it's a lifetime of pain okay so how
many of you guys are familiar with parts
are common are unfamiliar with parts are
combinatory anyone unfamiliar okay so
we'll do I have you get about maybe 60
seconds of the parser comments or
explanation okay parser Combinator's are
I have a parser that parses something i
call it foo and then i want to parse the
string bar after foo is done parsing so
i put this a little funny till the
operator because i love operators I
really want more of them so i put a
little till the operator that says parse
foo and then parse bar and then parse a
space and then parse a file
that the person will type in okay and
this creates a new parson a new parser
which will parse foo then the string bar
then a space and then whatever file
someone types say okay these are
reusable parsers I can define a file
parser once and reuse it in a whole
bunch of different code and I combine my
parsers with these combinators their
operators which allow you to combine
things okay so tilde means then parse
this then parse that then parse this
there's another one with it's a pipe
called or like parts this or parse this
another interesting one is the the three
I don't even know what you would call
this man this is like this is a mutant
cat operator what this does is we parse
foo and parsers by default return the
string that they've parsed okay I don't
want to return strings I want to turn a
string into my AST my syntax tree or my
ADT if I ruin our right so the ATT is
I'm going to return an instance of foo
after through parses okay so I say after
you parse this is the object d return
there's another version which is the
regular for in the Scylla parser library
it's the regular cat operator but in
spt's libraries map so after you parse I
an ID I want to run a map operation and
convert the string which you parsed into
an actual object called foo that has the
ID in it okay so this is essentially
we've parsed strings and we're
converting them into actual case classes
and objects and that sort of thing okay
so the goal is when we win an ID is
parsed we want to return a foo okay
anyway what we add on top of normal
parser comments or libraries are things
called examples so if I have something
that parses as a possible language that
someone can enter I give them examples
that they can autocomplete of most
likely what they would be writing on the
terminal okay these are the most likely
languages in order of how often I've
seen them written on my own terminal so
uh yeah anyway when the user hits tab
what the framework we'll do is we'll
look at your parsers look at these
examples combine them together and
provide them to the user so it helps
with completion you get that really nice
autocomplete another thing you can do is
you can define a parser as a token which
says this whole thing completes as one
entity the you'll care about the details
of that if you have time to work in the
library but we don't have a whole ton of
time anyway so here's here's what the
command line parser actually looks like
if you want to make use of this you need
to use the SBT completion library you
import SBT completion you import the
default parsers you construct your
command hierarchy ok we have a command
hierarchy of just do stuff that's the
only thing oh and I was evil this case
class doesn't take parameters but should
sorry ignore that pretend there's
parameters here never do this alright
and the next thing is we define a do
stuff parser which is going to parse the
token do and return the do stuff command
ok and then I'm going to create my
command parser which can convert parse
any command and right now it just parses
the do stuff command if I pass a string
to this parser and I pass do it will
return me the do stuff command if I pass
any other string it just fails ok so now
I can start parsing user input where
this gets interesting is I want to talk
to the terminal and allow the user to
press tab and get all that nice auto
completion so what I do is I create
what's called a full reader we can we
can ask mark why it's called a full rate
I don't even know the full reader you
pass it a of where to say the users
command history so if you'd like them to
be able to scroll through previous
commands they've typed in the past you
can do so if you're implementing a rebel
as a terminal utility if not you just
pass it the parser and what this guy
does is when you call read line he will
allow the user to press tab to press up
and down and all the fancy things that
you want from a command-line application
and get auto-completion based on the
prot on the parser you've given it okay
you can also give it a mask a mask is if
you're like me you just ask for
someone's password and let them type it
in the clear but if you actually cared
you'd kind of hide it where ever they
type a piece of input you want to show a
carrot or star cat picture I don't know
just to let them know that they type
something but you don't display it so
mask is a character which you will
render every time they type in something
so you can hide things like passwords
all right now what's interesting is you
can construct one of these readers that
can read lines based on a parser and
that's where you get your auto
completion information after you parse a
line from that reader or after you get a
line you still have to parse it because
a user can just ignore all the auto
completion help and type whatever the
heck they want so then we parse the line
and we either get a right here's the
thing that we parsed or a left some sort
of exception parse exception where there
was an error we when we make these you
is for ourselves we don't care about
errors we just assume we type everything
perfectly because you know that's that's
what I think of myself and yeah we'd
return the command so this is the
example of reading passwords where you
can pass in the star to read passwords
if you want to like read user input that
that you don't want them to see and you
don't really care about this whole
parsing crap there's a thing called
simple reader that comes with the
library so you can read in a password
with the same mask and get everything
and then now we're going to talk about
deployment so I created this awesome
command-line tool I have a main method
it does everything I want it takes in
user input it has it's a little terminal
thing where they can tie up and all that
I need to deploy it so for this snark
guy in our bill BTW we create a new
project called native we depend on the
native packager the SBT native packager
and these are the settings we add these
for name maintainer and package summary
package description we tell it what the
main class is we enable java app
packaging and then we type debian
package binned we get addy bean file we
install it on our system if we're on my
laptop you see
just typing snark something and then it
does that work if you say snark check it
shows your Twitter timeline if you say
snark mentions it shows you who
mentioned you and you can snark tweet to
send tweets anyway that's one option is
this native packager where you use this
SBT configuration you can make a debian
file you can make an RPM file you can
just make a zip file but it's a way of
distributing this to other people if you
find it useful or if you're doing ops
and you want to install this on like
your ec2 boxes is a little command-line
helper to debug things the other option
is there's a thing called conscript you
literally create a launch config file
this file is composed of four sections
the one section is always copying pasted
from the SBT launch config the top is
what version is Scala use we say just
auto detect the second one is your
coordinates and a maven repository the
third one are what maven and I be
repositories you need to resolve you
take this file you put it in your github
repo and then you say you know conscript
install J surrett whatever the name of
your repo is unless it's not Jace right
it's your name your github name your
github repo and you get a local install
of your utility assuming you have it
published two amazing repo somewhere and
this can resolve it I just said that
really really quickly but these are
basically install options right you you
create this you shove it out there and
all of a sudden everyone can get access
to your little utility if it's
convenient and useful to recap because I
can't show you there is a let's see I
don't remember how to get multiple
windows and mac that's awesome to recap
we have get home
command tab yeah maybe yeah I think I
want command C anyway I'm running out of
time running out of time there we go
okay so github and I don't have Wi-Fi on
so it doesn't matter github com /j
Surette / snark you can download this
sucker you can try it out it's it's
loaded up to Ben Tre you can you can
package it locally what it does is when
you start this guy it's going to ask you
to go to Twitter and authorize the app
and then you get a pin number you enter
the pin number with little stars on the
command line and it saves your your Roth
credentials somewhere and it won't ask
you again and then you can check your
tweets from the command line which is
really great way to waste time at work
and it saves you so much time versus
going to the website you know like why
even why even open up a web browser when
I can just like run a build and then
check Twitter and then run a build so it
really really improved my throughput
yeah so with that we have about a minute
for four questions I'm sorry I can't
demonstrate this because that's kind of
a a good point we have we have three
questions I think this one was first
yeah the evil secrets file should be
very apparent what you need to do you
need to go to Twitter you need to get
your own developer API key which people
will authorize you to do things on
behalf of their account and you need to
create the evil secrets object and then
shove your evil secrets in there but I'm
not giving you mine because I don't want
to get in trouble for what you might do
to other people's accounts it's it's one
of these things where if you're giving a
secret I don't like to give it out but
that's why that's why I won't compile
i'm debating just giving my secrets away
anyway because I don't really care i
know enough people at twitter they know
i'm not evil so anyway yeah you need to
create a basically an evil secrets
object and put your twitter api docs
your your app so when it asks to
authorized to make tweets on your behalf
it's going to do that whole off crap
yeah yes
yeah so tweening compiler is 140
characters I like that idea yeah and all
and then and then there should be a bot
that takes that and automatically opens
a gyro ticket yes so in this
configuration file you've had a version
of the deck but then still in the name
you had to prove a fam that room yeah
this is this is a artifact of okay so
the way the way the launcher works it
actually creates a nested class loader
to share you can launch more than one
application and it creates a nested
class loader to share between
applications with the scholar version
embedded I think I'm done so I got to
cut it off not going over sorry guys
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
