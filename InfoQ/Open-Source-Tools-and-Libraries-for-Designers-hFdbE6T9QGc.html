you can find me at nerdcore I hate
soliciting myself but there's 3 R's
oh yeah there's 3 hours it's kind of
nerve-wracking to think you might
misspell your own name but I got it up
there so if you want to talk to me at
any point over over the interwebs that's
where you'll find me so like I said I'm
Julie I design and build stuff I get hub
how many people use github in this room
that's amazing thank you guys
for paying my salary that's great and if
you don't that's that's good too
anyways that's really exciting to see so
I don't have to go through the whole
what's a github thing which is kind of
exciting for me I can kind of move along
so I'm I like to think of myself as a
designer who writes or who thinks in
code but mostly it's because I I write
code and that a lot of people ask you
know should a designer learn to code my
answer is maybe always a designer should
learn to code if they want to build
things everyone's that we all engineer
software I think someone recently said
it really well my coworker Kyle neath
who said regardless of what tool you're
using to design software or build
software we're all engineering it
together
so don't don't necessarily force your
designers to learn how to code but if
they want to I'm here to tell you how to
kind of put together a design
environment to build and design software
so uh I wanted to kind of entitle this
talk hacking a design environment you
hear dev environment really often but
you don't ever hear design environment
you hear oh i design in photoshop i
design in fireworks i design an
illustrator or i design in browser which
is becoming more and more common so I
maybe got to that a little prematurely
okay so so I have given a variation of
this talk before and I called it because
Photoshop but I've decided to kind of
reel back the f-bombs and talk a little
bit more about the design environment
and what that means and supplementing
like different design tools into that
environment so my process which is
becoming again more and more popular is
designing an browser and what that means
is I'm I'm I use a variety of tools and
I work almost exclusively in code so my
process happens in code mostly in code
so I do supplement you know my design
process with things like you know if I
need an illustration I'm obviously not
gonna do that in browser yet and
hopefully with us moving the web forward
someday maybe that's gonna be a reality
or something like html5 campus or
something like that so let's talk about
the status quo so I've looked through
and I do this kind of for fun because
they like to see what's out there and to
stay competitive it is good to see what
kind of jobs we're offering and what
what really they're asking of their
designers and one that I common commonly
say is pixel perfect Photoshop comps and
this is usually the tagline and it's
sown almost every design ad for
a job ever so so not that there's
anything necessarily wrong with this but
the problem is when you start to think
about the end product so what you're
asking of your designers when you say
that is the one requirement of them is
you're saying that that's what they're
responsible for that's their
responsibility as your coworker as your
employee and also as a designer so the
problem with that is the end product of
what they're creating is a picture of a
website how many of you know who Megan
Fisher is oh that's a shame really okay
Megan Fisher is an incredible designer
and she's really really popular for
being kind of a proponent of mocking up
in markup and that's sort of a big part
of my process so I'm gonna talk a little
bit about that but one thing she said a
while ago that I think is really smart
as a web science design should start
where it's going to live and I don't
know about what you guys are necessarily
building but it's most likely either
going to in end up in the browser right
if it's a web product it's gonna get it
end up in the browser if it's an iPhone
app it's gonna end up
so so this is kind of a quote that I
like to kind of live by and think about
what I'm approaching a project so like I
said most of my stuff starts in a
browser somewhere but I also use a lot
of other tools one of those is a code
editor and then another is obviously the
terminal or command line you know you
don't have to use the command line to
push code somewhere but it is a really
great tool to learn and master and if
you weren't aware of this I think Tim
Wednesday we're doing a git workshop
here at html5 Devcon with Matthew
McCullough and our training team which
is really really useful if you even if
you are you know basic get stuff it's
good to kind of learn some advanced
stuff some tricks
so that's gonna be available I think I'm
not sure if it's sold out or not so my
apologies if it has so these are two
tools I use another so the code I write
I write a lot of CSS and css3 is the
first time that ads designers were
really able to kind of pull in a lot of
these Photoshop effects that were that
you're used to seeing in Photoshop comps
and you're allowed to like do them
purely in CSS so some of these are
lighting effects you want to make like a
container on a page pop out a little
more you're going to give it a highlight
something like a box shadow so some some
other things are multiple background
shadows and some interaction layer stuff
too with CSS transitions so there's a
really great site that's actually I
guess kind of dated but it was when I
learned CSS for the first time for css3
and it's something by dan cedar home and
it's called things we left on the mood
and it's really just an example of all
the different css3 elements that you can
use today in browser that are actually
barely well supported across browser so
another reason I do this is we have this
new thing called frettin that displays
and they're becoming you know more and
more common obviously they're probably a
low percentage of your user base but you
still want to be able to support that
and a great way to implement that in
browser is to use things that scale
really well so you can actually look at
how they look in retina by just zooming
in on a webpage so it can be a lot
easier and and one tool that we use
specifically at github is
I conference so I don't know how many of
you have seen our icons on on github.com
okay I hope so because they're
everywhere so so we we went out of the
way to create our own icon font so that
we could use scalable images so it could
be across retina and also so that we
have like a visual language to
communicate with our users another thing
we do to prepare for retina is using 4x
images so what we do is we essentially
create we load images at 4x the size
that we actually need them so that it's
actually it translates to retina for us
without having to like use media queries
or any kind of JavaScript plugin so
Sasson s CSS sass is basically a way to
hack CSS it allows you to pass in
variables and do a little more
complicated abstract kind of ideas
within your code so it allows you to
work faster in a lot of ways and for me
I found it specifically useful when
working in browser with things like
lighten for example so what you're
saying is gray is actually a color
variable that I've defined somewhere
else in my CSS but if I want to say
let's say I'm doing a button and I don't
know for those of you who aren't really
designed heavy you usually want to make
that button look realistic usually want
the top border to be a little lighter
than the darker or the bottom border so
what you want to do is give the top
order a lighter color and let's say I
don't have all the time in the
world to sit in Photoshop and color pick
all day you know or scale to scale with
different colors I can literally just
tell them okay I want to lighten this
gray by 10% if that's the background
color of the button and it works the
same way with darken and this is all
built-in into sass and it's really easy
to install it says Jim install sass
which is really great if you use Ruby
gems so another thing I really love
about sass is that it handles errors
like a champ so if you work with
an application framework like rails and
you're working in browser and you're
testing locally obviously you're
reloading your CSS and looking for
changes one way to do that or one one
thing that's really awesome about sass
is it actually throws an error for you
that's like common if your
logic or something like that it'll throw
a syntaxerror for you and tell you which
line of your code has the CSS error and
I don't know how many of you have
written a lot of CSS but if you're
writing you know in a specifically large
file sometimes you won't have
accidentally left out a semicolon
especially if you're working at like 3
a.m. in the morning that seems to be a
lot more common but you end up having to
scroll through line by line trying to
find where you left out that semicolon
oh that's kind of eliminates that for
you at least to a certain extent that's
why I love says so another great thing
about designing in browser is you don't
have to face the inconsistency that you
usually deal with when translating a
Photoshop comp to a living breathing
website so one of these things that I
feel it gives me the most rage as a
designer is how different browsers
different browsers are rendering it
changes you know cross browser and I'm
not just talking about older legacy
browsers like ie6 I'm talking about
every single browser renders a color
different way they render box shadows
differently you know unless they're
powered by the same rendering engine so
one way to avoid you know having to go
back into Photoshop and and kind of
altered and kind of tweak the color
changes that you want to make is to do
it all at one time so one so I guess the
way that I like to describe it is kind
of like this cross browsers in and I
have a bunch of browsers open at one
time and I'm testing colors to get the
best kind of median in order to display
the kind of aesthetic feel that I want
to create in my website or app so
another thing that if you have an
experienced font rendering rage yet I'm
deeply envious of you
Photoshop cs6 recently so when the
usually the rendering of fonts in
Photoshop is really really really
inaccurate to how it will render in the
browser so you end up with all these
problems like well this this this font
looked great in in Photoshop but it
turns out one like we don't have a web
license to even display this font even
if you're using something like
face a lot of fonts aren't rendered or
aren't built to be rendered on the web
they're built for print and they're
built for other mediums and so in order
to try to combat this Photoshop thought
they wouldn't make it better by giving
you a bunch of different anti-alias
saying options but really there's no
equivalent to bees necessarily in the
browser at least they don't explain them
well enough for you to know so that's
that's one way to avoid this is just to
just start in in browser with your fonts
also use web safe fonts or something
that in type kit or something that you
can add font face fairly fairly safely
so I I don't know if you are front-end
developers you may have given you at one
time gotten a Photoshop comp from your
designer and and once you put it into
the browser you realize holy
this looks terrible because one you know
maybe they design something that is more
common for a flash web site or something
that technology that we don't really use
anymore to build websites something
that's not realistic and so starting in
the browser can kind of help you avoid
some of those problems and it also if
your designers code it teaches them to
be more practical I think so I guess
attic Zen mode is perfect for this if
you have you know a bunch of browsers
open and this is a big part of my design
environment is having you know Firefox
open having Safari open having even
github we don't support older versions
of ie
but I still like to look across all the
other browsers at the same time and get
the best kind of experience for my users
debugging CSS is fantastic with dev
tools these days so you know Chrome webs
web dev tools are amazing also but it
allows you kind of to play with
something in web inspector and check it
out before you make that those changes
to your code or your design JavaScript a
lot of people ask me if your designers
should learn JavaScript again my answer
will always be if they want to but
another good reason is you want to be
able to design interactions there's a
lot of
you know a lot of simply line type shops
now that say okay you're a visual
designer you're a UX designer you're an
interaction designer these things should
really all be one and that's kind of
what we look for when we hire designers
that github we actually only designer or
only hire designers who code and we'd
like people to be responsible for the
entire experience so so the reason that
I use Java scripts when I use JavaScript
is to create kind of these interactions
and there's a lot of tools that allow
you to do that really easily these days
with jQuery and other things like
bootstrap plugins and all these things
that they don't actually want to write
the JavaScript themselves explain that a
little ahead again so software crashes
really suck right like there's
there's oh my god I can't even think of
how many times I have you know been
towards the end of finishing something
or something I consider to be almost
done and you know Photoshop just crashes
and ruins my day so another great thing
about designing in browser is every time
you hit save to reload your changes it
turns out it saves your changes so you
don't have to worry about your software
crashing and if the browser crashes it
doesn't really affect your code or your
work environment one thing I feel really
really passionate about is giving
designers commit access I know it's a
risk sometimes but I think it's really
really really really important
both for designers who want to be able
to contribute to the developer workflow
and also for developers to trust their
designers a little more so building this
trust between your teams can actually be
really beneficial it allows the front of
the developers not to have to do kind of
 like work in like just
transferring assets it allows them to
work on what they want to be focused on
and it allows your designers to update
assets when they have new ones ready I
also really believe in investing in your
employees teaching your designers to
code or at least giving the tools giving
them the tools they need to code is
incredibly important if you want to push
your entire team forward and they might
surprise you you know the only reason
that I've learned too
be as good as a developer as I am a
designer is because I've been given the
opportunity to you know and if they
might up and you you might regret
giving them come in access but though I
guarantee you they probably won't make
that mistake again all right so I kind
of already talked about the whole like
saving saving changes and preventing you
know Photoshop crashes from ruining your
day so I'm kind of gonna so I'm gonna
talk about some more tools that you
could use to build websites and so this
is less of the philosophy and more of
the actual things you can touch and feel
and use to build the things you want to
build so you want to build real apps and
you want to build things that you know
live in the embargo in the environment
they're going to live in so I'm gonna
give you some tools for that so version
control is actually a really awesome
design tool and a lot of people kind of
laugh when I initially say that but I'm
gonna give you a few examples that will
kind of I think help help my case one
thing is it helps you manage those
assets that you have so it you know as
much as I would like everything to be
built in browser whether or not it's an
illustration or whatever you're gonna
have assets certain images that you're
gonna need to update fairly regularly
there are a lot of companies now that
are actually bringing their designers
into the fold and having them update
assets on their own one of those is
square obviously github does it it's a
pretty it's a pretty trendy thing I
guess that's happening another thing is
obviously version control helps you
track your changes it also helps you
track changes to design so we use this
that github we use pull requests to do a
lot of our design work and iteration so
we can actually post screenshots in
those pull requests and say okay you
know I'm gonna make this change what do
you guys think about this not only does
it enable you to start a discussion with
your co-workers but it helps you go back
and see how things used to be like how
did this how was this page originally
implemented what were they what was this
other designer thinking when they did it
what were the decisions behind making it
you don't have to repeat yourself as
often so github it's obviously another
really great tool for this and one
specific github things that is really
great for designers
is image dipping and how many of you
have heard of the image dipping fewer
okay this is cool I can actually teach
you guys something hmm
so interesting dipping is awesome so you
can actually see this in a commit
message so you just click through to a
commit and you can actually there's a
couple different modes for image dipping
that allows you to see the difference in
the images or you just pushed to get out
basically so this is one of the first
views you can see them side by side
another one is kind of overlapping them
so you can see more granular changes
those of them were overlaid and then
also like kind of hidden beneath it you
can it's it's it becomes fairly useful
when you're doing something like icon
changes and you want to see the
difference pixel by pixel so prototyping
is really really awesome and I'm gonna
talk a little bit about this and how
it's a part of my process and how it
might help your designers are you
you know concept ideas a little better
so it turns out it's really easy if you
write code and one tool I use to
prototype is github gist's so just stock
github comm if you've never used just
but I'm gonna show you guys a little bit
about about these so I use them way too
often and what's in adjust is I'm gonna
like I'm gonna tell you guys a little
bit about it so you can do a lot more
than you would expect adjusts and a lot
of it is just encouraging a conversation
or on your code I want it so the first
piece is code so I like to open-source
you know CSS snippets because I one I
like to document them somewhere and keep
them somewhere if I'm think they're
gonna be reusable and I also like to see
what other people have to say about them
and see if they can make them better so
in the comments section you can actually
post images you can link to a live demo
so people can play with your code and
then you can also encourage feedback
which is kind of awesome
so this specific just that I that I
created you could someone took it and
they made a compass and how much do
people know what compass is kind of okay
their own compass is I'm like breathing
really heavily on this microphone I
thought
so compasses actually just like a
basically like a SAS like reusable
library thing someone basically took
this and and made it into a compass mix
in which was really awesome so if you
don't want to use just necessarily what
you could use is something called ablet
I was written by it's an open-source
project by Leo Bru who's a really
well-known JavaScript developer and also
designer and you can essentially
visualize those CSS snippets so if I
want to show something somebody a really
quick mock-up what I'll do is I'll just
drop in my CSS to doublet it'll show me
a visualization right here what you're
seeing is that gradient in case you're
wondering it's not tie-dyed so you don't
have to start from scratch there are a
lot of tools out there that will give
you kind of a base foundation of the CSS
like specific styles you need if you're
not planning on using the code in
production then it's perfectly okay to
use some of these tools one of them is
the very well-known bootstrap and this
is it's again really great more great I
think for developers who don't want to
spend a lot of time implementing a
visual change and great for designers
who don't want to start from scratch
when they're building something in CSS
well JavaScript when you do more
interactive stuff so CSS is reusable
don't write they can't same code twice
so it actually though the holder I think
I've me a little nuts because it
shouldn't be the thing that drives your
code but it is smart to kind of document
changes that you've made and this is a
lot easier for developers right you can
look at an older commit commit message
but like how do you do it for designers
there are some things so one thing is
you can always you can always make your
code better it's a little motivation for
you but putting it out there and get any
more eyes on it is the best way to
improve it I recently gave was gave a
similar talk at JS con for you and
someone else gave a talk and described
what he called the github third law and
it's essentially that you post something
to get hub you open-source a repo
someone takes that repo and then works
on it and you're like they did that
better than I did so then you
immediately want to take that and
improve upon that and so that's the
third law of github and I think that's a
really interesting concept it's kind of
all of us pushing each other forward a
little
a little more every day so the chances
are if you can't make your code better
someone else can and and maybe you don't
agree maybe you don't you don't think
that a change someone makes one day for
Curie bow or they FERC you're just it's
better you don't have to you know you
don't have to accept that pull request
if they end up sending a polar class you
don't have to deal with it it's just a
really great way to give you a different
perspective on the problem you're trying
to solve so if it's not reusable set it
all on fire there is no better feeling
than ripping out code and even for
designers this is this goes without
saying it's not just a developer
specific thing starting from scratch is
kind of the easiest way to clear your
head
so pattern libraries these are
definitely a really great open source
kind of tool to use to be able to to
build on what you've already done so
they're really awesome so it's also a
way to constantly improve your code and
I started thinking about pattern
libraries on dribble because what they
they have this feature called buckets
and you can actually bucket together you
know let's say I want to look for a
specific UI piece I want to say I want
to collect a visual pattern library of
what different people do for search
really basic right so I can basically
bucket all of these different visual
like basically visual snippets of search
you know you eyes and then I can look at
those for not only inspiration but it's
a way to approach a problem right I mean
you're not always going to have you know
the most unique and the most brilliant
idea right off the bat but it gets your
mind thinking so I started thinking
about them from from that perspective
but then Dan cedar home came around and
and built something really interesting
so far so so pattern pattern and I'll
get to that in a second but pattern
libraries are a great worry to learn
from the past you a great way to learn
about you know kind of how how you've
approached problems differently it's a
great way to learn from each other so
the tool that I always speaking of is
called pairs I don't know if you can see
the URL up there but its peña tartar
tartar dot RS so this is a tool that
dance your home recently open source
it's on github
it's actually
now I think only written in PHP so I'm
kind of dying for someone to take it
down and write it into something else
but so it's basically a way to store
markup and CSS patterns instead of
visually so like the way that I thought
about dribble buckets were oh this is a
way for me to visually kind of
experience how people are doing things
but this is a way how they're actually
to experience kind of how they're
building them and not only for other
people but for yourself and it's a great
way to go back and look at these and say
oh I was doing this wrong maybe I should
and not necessarily from anybody else
but from your own from your past self
and say oh I was doing this wrong look
let me update this and then when I need
to implement something like this on the
front end I can just refer to my own
pattern library and it doesn't have to
be public you don't need to open-source
it I know a lot of people kind of
especially designers this is an
interesting thing that's kind of
happening is you know that the special
sauce right like the magic the magic
it's like you you kind of want to hold
on to the things that you do really well
because you think that they're going to
give you the competitive edge I'm more
of a believer that if you put your code
out there which actually most front-end
code is open source whether or not you'd
like it to be I'm a really big believer
and obviously github is as well as
putting your code out there because it
allows us kind of all to move forward
and for me if I can save somebody five
minutes of banging their head on their
computer or on their keyboard I will
gladly do it so style guides this is
becoming more and more popular among
bigger companies and I think this is
just in order to make sure that you're
communicating like the same the same
visual language across your website your
app whatever it is that you're building
so they kind of suck though you you
obviously you don't sign up to be a
designer because you want to copy and
paste CSS all over the place that's
really not something that motivates you
you kind of want to be able to I don't
know execute your own vision what you're
passionate about so I like to think of
them as considerations so something to
think about and these are really basic
things for like a friend under it maybe
okay like the line height on something
it's supposed to be even on the top and
the bottom it might not be something
that everything everyone necessarily
knows like especially front in
developers it may not be something
you know especially if it's not
something the browser does for you so
our style guide is actually open source
and I encourage you all to check it out
to see how we read our code and you know
how we use things like our icon fonts
how we write JavaScript how we write
Ruby because our designers actually
write all of these things so it's it's
really cool I encourage you guys all to
check it out it also includes all of our
button styles all these basic kind of
visual language things that we'd like to
it's not necessarily instill in our
designers but there are considerations
when you're building a new UI so the way
that I learned to build websites is I
consumed other websites and I think a
really great way to build the web is use
the web to do that and that doesn't mean
you know going to so-and-so's website
and copy and pasting their CSS into your
site because I would HIGHLY advise doing
that but there's a great way to use the
web to make the web so one thing I do is
like I kind of categorize things and
you're like yeah bookmarks dad Julie
we're not idiots but one thing I do is I
categorize specific resources so that I
know when to get to them when I need
them and if you don't already do this
it's kind of a great way start sending
your designers resources whether it's
just learning really trivial you know
get commands like it gets cheat sheet
whether it's learning emojis so they can
auto complete in pull request like just
start sending them resources so they can
start collecting them and categorizing
them and knowing when to reach towards
them when they want to do when they want
to learn a little more and that just
goes back to investing in your designers
so I think that's a pretty big deal so a
lot of designers look at the command
line and they're like what the this
isn't hackers I don't know what to do so
yeah command line tools they're not easy
they're really not but yeah and get it
can be really confusing nothing you know
certain commands aren't necessarily
intuitive or logical and neither is the
GUI of the command line to begin with so
github has actually found a really great
way to help designers and one of those
ways is github for Mac
does anyone use github for mac oh that's
awesome
how cool so Jennifer Mac is basically a
GUI interface on top of the Pam line and
it's really easy to update branches you
literally hit a sync button and it syncs
for you so you don't really have to
worry you know unless you have unless
you're in merge conflict hell you know
you don't really have to worry about you
know stashing things and I don't know
more complicated things than designers
necessarily think to worry about so the
reason I give this talk is because I
kind of want to encourage everybody to
learn a little more I want to encourage
developers to learn a little bit more
about the design process but also
designers to take a few pieces of what
developers are doing into their own
environment and their own process and I
would love to encourage you all to give
me feedback and let me know if there's
anything you're doing specifically that
you think could contribute to pushing us
all forward and thank you guys it's been
great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
