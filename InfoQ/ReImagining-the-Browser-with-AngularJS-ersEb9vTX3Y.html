glad to be here I'm going to tell you
about my exciting project and thank you
by the way all the previous presenters
for sharing their the lava affairs with
their particular frameworks so I'm the
original author of angularjs but now we
have a team of few more people and
there's about team of six of us working
on this so I can no longer take credit
for all this stuff but I wanted to I'm
gonna go quickly through a couple of
slides at the beginning because we only
have a half an hour and I wanted to
spend about a half of the presentation
doing some demos because I think people
like the most right big fan okay how
many of you guys thank you how many of
you guys I will have used angular JS
before okay good good shows our hands
thank you very much so yeah browsers
started long then it got better and then
we could do I des sorry I'm skipping
going fast but the current state is that
users are pretty happy with the web apps
but the developers aren't and if you say
the developing for web browsers is an
awesome experience then I want to talk
to you because I want to drink what
you're drinking and the reason is that
complexity kills and why is that well
browsers are really designed for static
pages and they excel at it I mean
they're really amazingly good you want
to say hello world this is a simple of a
hello world as you're gonna get you put
a bunch of P tags around it which means
it's going to be a paragraph and it's
gonna render and this is just you know I
can't think of a shorter hello world
than this you remedy the P tags okay
but but compare this I don't think would
be interesting well then be a text file
at that point but that's okay so compare
this with the equivalent JavaScript
hello world and this is the opposite
extreme this must be the most
complicated hello world there is and
also keep in mind that you know there's
a lot of knowledge you have to know
about how the browsers work how the
event system works and how the whole
thing gets bootstrapped and is just too
much to deal with and so you know I feel
like developing for browsers is black
magic and I feel like I'm tricking the
browser you know how many times have you
been like him I want to do eggs now how
do I trick the browser to do X for me
you know you get that feeling and you
know remember how you took the browser's
into doing border-radius before we there
was a border radius you know the that
you chopped up the images and put tables
and things and so this is the kind of
thing we have to do with with
applications you know browsers natively
to really don't do applications and then
it really feels like tricking it and so
what we want to do with angular is you
know for lack of a better term we call
ourselves framework but what we really
try to do is really try to say we're
actually a better browser and let me
demonstrate why that is but then before
we get there you know you're going to
say well what about jQuery and jQuery
just amazing and it is you know I
believe nobody has done as much for the
web as jquery and John has done the
author of jQuery but if you think about
jQuery for a second you realize the
jQuery shouldn't exist if the browser
vendors got there you know act together
and they were consistent and they had a
good API that would be no need for
jquery and the other thing about jQuery
is that it's imperative meaning that you
have to execute it in order to know what
the result is and the reason why the
original hello world was amazing is
because it was declarative that I could
just say what I want and I got what I
want so angular is all about declarative
way of expressing yourself and so we
want to do something like this for the
application and the answer to that is
data binding and we'll talk about that
more so data mining is you know
spreadsheet like updates you know if you
have a if you
we got a thing of superheroes so that
goes through all of our releases etc so
if you have a spreadsheet you know if
you have a form and you edit the form it
updates the model and then the model can
be bound to a view and that I updates
the view as well and notice this is
bidirectional for the forms and it's a
single direction for for the views and
you can think of it the thing you want
to take away from it is that the model
becomes a single source of the truth you
don't query the Dom you don't update the
Dom you don't talk to the Dom it's
relevant Dom it just happens to be the
projection of your current model but
model is the truth if you want to read
what the current state of the form is
you go to the model and say what's the
current state if you want to change the
current state of the model you simply go
to the model and update the model so so
far this is very similar to the the
other frameworks and you know this is
kind of the Holy Grail that everybody
tries to get to this is some more
example that we can do repeating over
here i'm going to skip through this
again because i don't want to get to
some good demos but i wanted to show you
is that angularjs gives you data binding
and it gives you data binding now but
you know we also don't just want to say
hey this is something we do we actually
want to go to the standards and say you
know this really should be part of the
browser and so we're working on a speck
called model-driven views and a child
speck of that called object observe and
what it does is it brings native
implementation of data binding into the
browser how many you guys have heard of
model-driven views or object observed
one okay few of you guys also oh I see
an angular JS classic shirt and very
nice so so we want to really bring the
browser's up to date here because we
feel that unless browsers really
fundamentally embrace data binding
there's not going to never going to be
an ecosystem where you can take
different widgets from different
libraries and components and bring them
together into a single page and have a
good experience about it so hopefully
that's the near future but you know
speaking about hey verbose could you
know when you have a verbose JavaScript
which you can do is you can pull it out
into functions and we know how functions
work and we know how we can reuse
functions and all that stuff but it
turns out that the HTML suffers from the
same thing so if you
have let's say tab or the idea of tabs
you can go to a bootstrap sorry at blank
for a second you know the bootstrap you
can get amazing skin for something like
tabs but then if you want to actually
render the tabs you have to go to HTML
and it really literally have to cut and
paste this chunk of HTML into your
browser into your application so that
you can have this thing rendered in it
and I really feel like we're back in to
square one we're tricking the browser
into doing you know tabs because browser
simply doesn't have vocabulary for it
what I really want to do is I simply
want to say this i say i wanna have tabs
and tabs are made out of paintings
paintings have titles and it should be
as simple as this in order to express
your software this is the goal and so
again this is something we call
components and we can you can do that
today with angularjs and you can have
your imagination go wild as to what you
could possibly build with this and the
reason why this is important is because
it allows you to turn your HTML into dsl
domain-specific language you can turn
your HTML as the thing where you go to
and you say aha this is how the
application is built you know normally
when you look at an app is usually the
scary main method it kind of assembles
the app and the bigger the app the
scarier the main method gets with what
we're trying to do with it with angular
is that HTML becomes a single source of
the truth you simply go to the HTML you
see all the components you see how
they're arranged you go away ha I know
how the application is assembled and so
in a good fashion where not only do we
want to we bring this to you with
angularjs we also want standards for
this and this is where web components
comes in this is another standard that
is being worked on again it's going to
be native implementation of of this
feature and hopefully it's going to
happen in a very very near future so
that's it for my talk and let's do some
demos by the way I love questions so
don't hesitate to ask
so this is our hello world application
everybody has to hello world and what I
like about this is that it really like
what you said earlier what the presenter
said about not repeating yourself and
being terse because those are good
qualities which allow you to build
large-scale application and following
conventions and so on and so for example
in the case of a hello world let me give
you show you that it works what we want
to say is that hey there's an input and
whatever the input model of this thing
is we wanted to render inside of our
data binding now couple of things to
notice first of all notice that this is
regular HTML these are not a script tags
these are not text node somewhere these
are not string concatenation this is
HTML the second thing I want you to
notice is actually that there is no app
because this is so simple that there
should be no app there is no javascript
/ say other than our library delete the
oh okay not sure what the question was
the Delete key works as well yes it's
total dynamic think spreadsheets think
thinking like spreadsheet is a really
good way to think about it but when I
want you to focus on is really the HTML
and as I said earlier HTML is really
good about starting a public static
static documents and we want to turn we
want to teach HTML new tricks we want to
teach HTML how to do applications so the
way I like to think about it is angular
is a what a web browser would have been
had it been designed for web apps so the
first the way you bootstrap yourself is
you simply do ng-app you simply say you
know there is a this is my application
wherever you put place this inside of
your HTML document everything underneath
it now follows the rules of angular the
other thing is that everybody already
knows HTML and so there's no need to
learn anything new but we're extending
the vocabulary HTML with these ng dash
prefixes so in this case we're saying
there's this ng model in other words we
everybody knows what an input already is
and it behaves just like you
would expect but the thing we're doing
is we're taking the model and putting it
inside of your JavaScript heap rather
than inside of the down for which you
can have to get a reference to and then
read it out now not only can we do this
but I wanted to show you okay here's the
same hello world application I want to
show you a little bit of debugging
trickery here because I think that makes
a great demo first of all we have an
extension for the browser so that it
actually understands angular.js
applications to help you with it but I
want to do this manual way because i
think it's interesting first let me show
you the HTML as you can see this is a
standard HTML that we are so so earlier
and so one of the tricks i don't of you
about it in chrome is that if you click
on something like this guy over here you
can do percent so dollar zero and it
gives you a reference to this particular
node so you can say angular dot element
get ahold of the node this is
essentially the same thing as jquery the
dollar sign and we can get a hold of the
scope and let's write this in time
variable and if we expand the variable
let's put some text into here
oops notice there is now your name
because your name is the thing that we
have looked at so let's actually look at
it more in depth and say your name and
notice that as I type and I look at the
your name property it gets updated but
it also works the other way around and
we can do it like that but doesn't
update immediately this is because
you've done something outside of what
angular knows about so you have to give
it a little kick normally you don't have
to do this this is usually done
automatically but we're inside a
debugger so it's a little bit of extra
work and notice how it gets updated as
well now so far you've seen this with
other frameworks but I wanted to point
out something interesting here is that s
that your name is just a regular
property on the regular object you don't
have to go through special getter or
setter to access this and what that
means is that as angle abduction doesn't
actually have an official model in other
words model is just any good old objects
that you're familiar with an array an
object is will do a model if you have an
existing library that provides you a
model some kind of object it represents
your data that will work as a model as
well so there's no need to do any kind
of wrapping let's move on to the next
one so the next thing every application
has to have is a to do that's an
interesting checkbox and one of the
things that we wanted to do actual let's
go back over here one of the things we
wanted to do notice again is that
there's no script tags or any anything
else it's just HTML which means that you
can open this inside of your favorite
HTML editor and it will parse as
expected we added vocabulary for example
controller and the best way to think
about a controller is it simply it's
code behind the DOM and the reason why
that's the way to think about it is that
for example there's an archive method
which removes items that are already
checked so if I add an item here
hi archive it that particular item gets
gets removed and so simply referring to
an archive method you can call it now
I'll show you what an archive method is
but before that I want you to look at
the code this is the controller and
notice there's actually no no api that
we actually expose to you there's no api
to learn there's no classes to extend
there's no no matt there's some
conventions to follow but you know
really there's nothing from angular that
leaks into your application and we think
this is an important point because we're
not forcing you in any way and this is
why I'd like to say that angular is not
really a framework it's more of a more
better browser you know this is really
how if you think about it this is how a
browser should have been done from the
very beginning if browsers were designed
for web applications any questions so
far yes
why are all the attributes prefixed with
ng because I think Angie sounds like
angular but it's shirt no Angie no
doesn't sound like angular I think
there's no other reason other than we
wanted to kind of make it clear that
these are extensions of angular and so
if third parties right other extensions
they should have other prefixes now a
lot of people complain that they would
like to see data dash and you can very
much do that so if you really want to
run this through an HTML validator you
can put data dash in g dash model and it
will work just fine as well so actually
bring up a very good point which is we
have these extensions to HTML but here
is the kicker which I think separates
angular from from the other frameworks
and really I really don't like the word
framework for angular the better word
would be angular is actually a meta
framework because angular allows you as
a developer to come up with your own set
of tags and your own set of behaviors
and your own sort of vocabulary that you
can then graft on top of a browser so
yes angular comes out of the box with
these things we call ng dash whatever
happen have you but there's a whole
other things that you can imagine this
thing doing so for example there's a
frame there's a project out there called
jQuery angular UI and they give you
standard things like tabs and
integration with bootstrap and so on and
all through just simple extensions to
the HTML okay the other thing we would
like to do is if you have leaned a
large-scale application you need to do
things like routing you need to do
things you know the standard things you
know routing deep linking having views
talking to the backend and one of the
things that we really focused on is we
want to make sure that the that we
embrace HTML CSS and JavaScript rather
than abstracting it away you know you
know there's there's been attempts in
the past to basically look at this
particular problem of building web i
wasn't saying well the problem is age
mrs. complicate will just abstract it
away from you and you know these
abstractions never quite work in corner
cases that's when it kind of they break
down and so what we really focused on is
we wanted to embrace them so you know
typically application as a chrome and
there's the ng view which basically says
this is where the individual pieces go
you can declare a route we can go more
in depth in it but this basically is
your URLs will say what controllers and
what templates are being used for this
particular route but here is something
interesting the way you navigate to a
particular sub route is just an A Href
right normally if this if you had an A
Href in your application clicking it
would take you to another page and so in
most frameworks the way this is not as
you get a hold of the particular item
and you register a click listener on it
and then when you click on this
particular thing you have to remember it
somehow to update the URL so that you
have deep linking going over there and
you know there's a lot of frameworks
that help you tremendous amount with it
but the difference in angular approach
is that we really wanted to embrace what
the web order does what you are already
familiar with which is well a href
already does the navigation it already
does deep linking it already does all
the right stuff and so we just wanted to
bring it in the same exact spirit into
the application so when you're building
a angular application very much feels
like you're building a similar
application to the round trip server
type applications where we have views
you have controllers for those views we
have routes accept everything execute on
the client and there's a result it's
very responsive very fast and you get
the bookmark ability out of the box and
other things the other thing that I
wanted to point out about angular which
i think is unique is that it has
dependency injection dependency
injection is an interesting thing which
you know whenever I look at demos of
other frameworks I'm always curious how
do you boot strap yourself how does how
does the app get place assembled and
usually there is you know some
interesting process by which the
application gets assembled but in
angular actually there's no such thing
there is no main method there is
no one place where you can say you kick
it off the closest thing we have to a
main method is the ng-app directive that
kind of says get going and the
interesting thing about that is that
because you don't have any main method
the application simply assembles by
introspecting and controllers and says
okay so I see that you're in particular
route in this case / route I see that
this requires a list controller the list
controller simply goes in and says well
I need a scope and I need a project and
the angular says well I don't know what
a project is but later on later on we
declare what a project is and the
projects as well in order for me to be
instantiated I need something called the
resource and notice how the application
just self-assembles just simply by
trying to instantiate things and
following what you need in order to get
your job done the app literally
self-assembles and as a result there is
no main method there is no place inside
of our application inside of the code
base which which app assembles the
application and then has a very
important side effect for all for
testability point of view so in my
previous life I was an advocate for
testing I don't know if you guys read
some of my previous blogs on this and so
I feel very deeply about having a good
testing story and to me it's not just
the testing story in a sense that you
should test and you should be a good
citizen should do it but I feel like as
a developer / framework it is my
responsibility to provide you with all
of the tools to write good test out of
the box so angular out of the box comes
with a unit testing story and end-to-end
testing story mocks and the whole
dependency injection comes into a great
advantage because which you can do is
you can assemble the application with
components replaced so inside of your
your tests you can say well instead of
talking to real back-end server I want
to knock out communication channels so I
don't actually have to do HTTP requests
and responses and you can do this
relatively easily with angular simply by
overriding the HTTP service and then you
say well give me this controller the
controller assembles in a normal fashion
like it normally does but it gets a fake
back end
and then your side of your test you can
test this the other thing you can do is
you can do implant this and with
end-to-end tests like selenium suppose
you click on a button you don't know how
long to wait before the server has
responded and give you back a response
so typically you do some kind of pulling
or timeouts or something of that sort
angular actually has a runner end-to-end
test runner which is integrated with
internals of angular and so when you say
click the tester knows exactly how long
to wait before all the responses come
back and you can continue executing to
the next particular point other
questions so far yes so the question is
can you add conditions when you are when
you're logged in yes you can do that in
a lot of different ways I don't really
want to get into it in here but you can
catch me afterwards there's events you
can hook into you can hook into the HTTP
service and because of the dependency
injection you can actually go a lower
level and at any point in communication
you can you can redirect the login page
and somebody actually did a very good
blog post on that so let's talk about
components for a second one of the
things about components is here's an
example again with what components looks
like you have again pure HTML again you
have a body and you have tabs right
browsers do not understand tabs out of
out of the box this is meaningless and
similarly out of the box the pain is
meaningless and so is the title
attribute but what we can do is as I
said angular is a meta framework what
you can do is you can declare your own
components and so in this particular
case you're saying well if you come
across a tab inside of HTML here is what
I want you to do and first of all there
is the scary-looking piece of HTML and
it's to get replaced for rendering
purposes this basically comes from
bootstrap but more importantly there is
behavior that goes with this thing so
only are we saying this is how something
renders I'm also going to add behaviors
in terms of what it should do but notice
the component itself has full on data
binding and events and so instead of
implementing the component through
ng-click I'm sorting through you know
registering click listeners you can
simply use what you already are familiar
with in engler which is clicking having
data bindings and so on similarly you
have a pain which is another component
which simply wraps the confident in a
div and then in pain then communicates
with the with the tabs in order to add
itself into the component now here's
where this really starts to shine is
that suppose we have a controller called
ng-repeat and you want to add multiple
panes dynamically because ng-repeat adds
whatever it happens to be inside of it
if it happens to have pains it
automatically adds more pains into your
page yes you sound like a dinosaur
saying this but I still use XML and XSL
and for advocating the J sodding a lot
of my data in JSON and I actually go to
the trouble to translate it to xml to
translate it with XSL in order to put in
to generate HTML so I'm looking at this
and I'm saying you're bypassing all of
that by having a native databinding this
looks very much like my XSL probably yes
you know if you squint hard enough
everything looks like everything else
okay so this is kind of all however they
on time I see some okay some parallels
here would you agree that this is
basically just making it more natural so
that yes sort of data you have you can
transform your interview yes so I think
I covered everything I wanted to cover
there's also a little bit of
localization in there as well thank you
by the way for coming really people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
