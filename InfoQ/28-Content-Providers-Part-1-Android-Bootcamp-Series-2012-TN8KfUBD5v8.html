so remember we said we talked about this
on Monday we basically said you know one
of the main building blocks is this
thing called a content provider and
basically what it is it's a way to share
data between two apps right it's
essentially your crud interface right
whenever you deal with data there are
four and only four things you can do to
a data create retrieve update and delete
right crud
so that nicely translates into insert
update delete and query right those are
four things and so there is there some
there's such thing as content provider
which allows us to basically do do this
thing with with data to access it from
another app I mentioned the system uses
content providers quite a bit internally
as well we mentioned contacts for
example media store settings as etc like
if I show you on a faucet you know on
the app list many clothes that I think
you actually if I show you here
in the file explorer notice that data
data notice that your contacts app for
instance doesn't have any data there's
basically no data under contact right
it's empty but if you go on to providers
contacts that's where the data is right
so that's your people are right here
so we're separating concerns right
that's the idea behind content providers
so so and this is just an example so we
mentioned this in this context for
example so we said you in what oops what
really what you really have in the
system
why do they go first light second
that's what goes on in the system is
that you have a UI app right this is
your application that represents your UI
and then you have another app that
represents your data right so basically
a content provider is accessing the data
and then exposing it to whoever needs to
access it now what this allows for is
for other components to easily access
your data as well so for example
somebody wanted to write a nicer looking
address book like HTC does they have a
sexier address book right they can just
write a new UI then it's going to tap
into the same database data source right
so you don't have to have multiple data
sources so that's the motive motivation
for content providers so far so good so
let's create a content provider so to
create a content provider it's just like
other main building blocks right so you
are going to start by creating a new
class in Yamba we're gonna create a new
class let me explain why we're adding it
to Yamba first other than you know
something to show you but the real need
for for this was that we want it to at
some point be able to create a widget
right something that sits in a home
screen well that turns in a separate
process altogether so for that to be
able to access your data we need to
expose the data by Otakon fertilizer so
that's the motivation yeah
otherwise nobody outside our app can
access with it and we actually want
tweets to be available so
to do that we're going to create a new
class a new Android class and I'm gonna
call it status Pro Rider
okay so just like before you need to
extend provider content provider so I'm
not provided content provider organize
import and you need to then add and
implement in that its troops there's a
whole bunch
okay we care about content provider well
we do you mean underwear underwear no no
you're talking about the package you're
probably referring to this in DDMS
you're talking about this right provided
right yeah no this is just a package
name so it's a standard practice in
Android to name a content provider
comment with providers and then this is
a content provider second content
provider Turkana provider and so on so
it's a naming convention and you can see
some of the built in one straight
applications calendar contacts downloads
DRM media settings telephony user direct
a dictionary and so on
yeah that's called yeah that's how it
started now keep in mind that media
doesn't really media is really just a
meta information about your media your
actual images are still gonna be in an
SD card but the content providers gonna
know where they are and so on where them
identify them inside yeah probably I
mean you can set permissions and content
providers if you if it's about
confidential information right
you can set permissions and so on but
the first thing you know the content
provider is designed for sharing data
now you may say I want to only want to
share data with allies right or friends
right then you would use permissions to
manage that and you can set permissions
for readwrite and so on and so on cool
so now that we got this file with
gazillion things in it what you want to
I'm just gonna reorganize it so that for
example on create is first followed by
you know all the other methods
so on create kind of make sense like
insert update delete and query I would
kind of organize them to be in that
order
I insert inquiry
it is this disorder sort of doesn't
doesn't lends itself well so that's what
I'm just gonna insert update delete
query right that's just that's sort of
how I think about it and then we can on
create and on get type so this will be
your template right did I actually do
this one in in your templates do we have
we do there's a content provider and
there's a temple for content provider
tanam so you got you got it right but
what it does right so all the stuffs
that I'm talking about right here step
by step right so that's the content
provider and what we need to do is we
need to fill in the blanks this is our
what we so so basically what we're gonna
have is we're going to define a content
and so every content provider must have
a Content URI this is what its gonna
respond to right usually define it as a
constant it's usually a public public
public static final string sorry URI
content URI
organized imports now
to get a uri usually gonna do something
like this
URI dot parse and then some kind of
string
okay now what I typically do is they
define what goes in here we usually call
Authority right so I usually define that
also as a constant it's not necessary
but just I find it a little cleaner
this one is necessary content it's
pretty typical actually it's more of a
convention than the law
so so far good so what we do under what
authority should look like is something
like this let me point you to the
official like dev guide on content
providers because there's a nice little
picture content providers and then there
are toward the bottom there's a little
picture this is what your typical
Authority looks like it looks like this
right content blah blah blah blah blah
blah yeah now let's let's focus figure
out what is what so this is sort of
written in stone this part a there's
really not much to think about it it's
always like that
haunting calm slash slash right part
beam is usually going to be something
that identifies your app right so this
should usually be something like in the
reversal of the main name or something
like that right so for us it will be
calm example Yamba Yamba status provided
for example that would be a good one um
then these are optional right this is
all C is optional the path to content
provider to determine what kind of data
is being requested it could be just a
slash it could be zero or more elements
right so we could have slash status
slash public or star status slash trends
slash timeline slash friends it's up to
you right essentially and I'll get back
to it essentially in a second and the
final one is also totally optional
optional if present it identifies a
single record if not present it will
identify all records right so content
provider URI would be pointing to a
single record or many records
like many mostly all right so but the
authority is going to be basically this
part here I usually add
to it as well so basically it would be
HTTP colon slash user actually content
poem / / comm dot example that young dot
status and Yambol provider dot stats I
can just save doctor right that's that's
good right
so that is that is a good way to kind of
it so what we can then do parse that and
that's gonna give us our content to your
I know you cannot access content URI
over HTTP now content provider only
responds to content column slash slash
type of thing right
it can serve any type of content but
which will be defined by the type but
but it's all a song designed for this
specific protocol it's something that's
proprietary to entry
if you're running HTTP server locally
can you wrap it in a common provider so
back to design diagram so content
provider is you know is just an
interface to a data now it doesn't have
to be that this data is a database it
could actually be that you know there's
a cloud and that your content provider
is merely going straight to the club so
that's also the possibility like for
example another way to design Yamba
would be to basically have forget about
querying the database forget about
inserting your database but go directly
into content provider go directly from
content provider and not worry cup
content providers getting the data maybe
confroy is actually getting the data
directly from here right so that that
will be another approach I think one of
my design graph that I showed you at one
point was doing something like that
so if PDF so this was one design where
all the access to data was done through
a content provider so we didn't really
care how content provider was getting
the data so right our time line activity
was just getting it from here right and
it could have that it got it gone this
way it put a little gone this way right
it doesn't it's not important so what's
backing connick problem is not important
but it usually is a database yeah but it
could be a file and so on could be some
penological all right so so far so good
and that's yeah so so we're just
creating an account right now - couple
other things in oncreate concrete is you
standard on create if it was
successfully created
you would want to return true right so
that means yeah we we are we have paid
it right it's crazy
and now let's do let's talk about a
couple of these methods so gets type is
supposed to return a mime type so let me
show you my documentation so what's this
get type is supposed to do is return the
mime type of the of the document that it
returns so if there's a mime type of the
given you arrive typically the mime type
will either be something like this so
it's either gonna be something like this
or something like this basically the
only difference being that you're either
gonna say I'm returning in one item or I
mean turning returning an entire
director right so now to do this you got
to figure out what is the URI because it
says get type for the URI
right so so basically what we would need
to do here is we will need to figure out
you know what is the the that and to
figure that out you will need to do URI
dot not Authority but at last path
segment I believe
you
I believe you wanna we are basically
check in this case get a path and then
figure out if the path is let me see
what they did in in this case you wanna
get I get type system so basically you
want to figure out what is the type of
that URI that that was so for example I
could say URI dog yet
so the decoded path or now if this is
not not that segment
it's not a fast
either way we can basically just ignore
it for our purpose II get lost at
segments it was that one canonical it
last segment hepatica last payment or
not the path is empty I believe that's
the one so for example if you know if
the last path path segments and remember
the path refers to that right so this
will be the last path the D right to
record right so basically if that
segment is null
right then I would return for examples
you know one Authority if it's not now I
would return another right so so
basically and now that that's that's
your return type that you would want to
return and those those things look like
this so basically single record would be
something like that
but if you type this one you can ignore
it
so the difference is that if it's now we
return an item if it's not we would
return a door and in our case it would
basically be we said the example and
then I think I'm status right it seemed
like that
so what we're making doing here is we're
making up a we're making up a you are a
mime type yeah mime type yeah yes yeah
now this is all internal yeah within the
app so that's why it's not really
actually important to us in this case at
all this will all work fine if you just
return now as well so you don't really
need to worry about it too much
on so that's it's it's basically part of
the system so basically England to
handle requests to the mime type of the
data as the given you either return mime
type should be blah or blah multiple and
this method can be called from multiple
threads so that's if you are trying to
figure out what kind of information
specific content provider is providing
you know that's kind of like for almost
requiring content providers like I'm not
sure if you know Facebook people provide
their returns names or pictures or
something like that right so if you then
say hey Facebook people provider what do
you provide that's essentially what this
so you can get a mime type in
then-candidate so you can do some
interesting query on the system in like
real time yeah yeah but in our case like
I said I mean it it to all honesty like
if you're lazy you can just return no
and it's all gonna be fine right but but
I guess you know you can also it doesn't
matter now you guys good so far
now let's talk about in insert so insert
does the following
insert inserts values right into that
you are right right so so this is
basically now calling database and then
the base insert right so what we could
do is we could use our status data to to
basically do this we already have DB
helper right you know status data so
remember it's that this data we
basically had our DB helper and we had a
database so it's an insert is actually
very similar to this except
it already does this right so we just
need to do that right
so you can copy if you want you can copy
paste that okay so you can copy paste
this into into that code or we can have
this guy then later on just call the
content provider so later on we can
simplify this guy too or move the little
helper altogether to do it to your
content provider but for now so so make
the DB helper muds already privates to
the package so I'm gonna define you
known create here I'm gonna define
sequel Lite database DB right in the DB
helper DB helper right and then what we
can do it on create four instances we
can just initialize variables so DB
helper is gonna be Yamba app right yet
we don't have yet application
Oh
and so it may make sense to do some
refactoring at this point because maybe
helper may make more sense now in the
context of of the status provider right
and then status data could actually be
using that Thanks
um so we could do that as well so
basically you're saying to make this guy
be a studs provide abundant provider
it's totally fine it's more um to
totally work the only reason why I'm
thinking of games that is just that I
would complicate this pile quite a bit
so I'm trying to keep the file somewhat
manageable in size so it we could we
could do that we could also do this so
we have the context we could actually
create a new DB helper for now just I'll
just do them in peril so I'll say DB
helper I can say something like this new
DB helper
on first
well what just happened Oh No so I
wanted to make it there yeah so I'm
gonna take the status status DB helper
out of of this guy so basically I'm
gonna do this and a clock as opposed to
being an inner class or close this right
I'm gonna so basically a reformat now DB
helper is a class in its own right and I
just need to fix this to say status data
dot okay because now it doesn't know
about variables data status data told is
red red underlines
I guess I can define private static
string tag
okay so now that they have status data I
could this also come pops DB help you
guys get what they just did so just
leave I took because we now need DB
helper to be accessible in the content
provider it actually should be moved
there eventually but just the kind of
decoupled from status data what I did is
I took it out so it's not an inner class
anymore okay and that just meant I had
to pass the context in and I get to fix
couple of references right for things
that around the underlined right okay so
so what they did so that's what we did
so there's basically added the
constructor fix a couple of references
there and then in terms of up I just now
we need to pass the context in before I
was kind of depending on the fact that
it's all tied in and so on and so on but
now I can expose the yanked it out of
decoupled it's from status date it's
still on status data file but it's not
otherwise tied to its put live in its
own file if we chose to chose to write
as a matter of fact you want to do that
without make make it make more sense to
put in a separate file DB helper not for
now pass it then get context and
and
so first again so I renowned good on
same page yeah thanks for pile only two
files for touching so far so it happy
right insert well insert so you're gonna
get two things here right you're gonna
get the URI and you're gonna get insert
values the values are gonna be what you
insert into a database so we're gonna be
opening the database somewhere we're
gonna say DB is gonna be DB helper dot
get writable database right so we get a
database and then we're gonna say DB dot
insert word on conflict right and then
we're going to do the actual
right so then we're gonna do the actual
insert right so status data dot tape
stands daily dot table right now cognac
we said it's in now right initial values
is gonna be the values right and
conflict algorithm is gonna be ignore
it's gonna be always the sequel I didn't
is conflict ignore rights at that point
I mean you could copy paste this line
but right
so basically this here again is
identical with this here
well if it's identical then why is this
stuff here in the first place why is the
why is the DB what can we get rid of
this I mean now you know we got
duplicate code right two lines of code
same as these two lines of code right so
we could get rid of it here it so so I
could get rid of it here and to do that
and then huh but I have value so how do
I now call the content resolver call the
content provider right so now you have a
content provider providing insert we
just need to pass it the values we got
the values right so that we build these
values so how do we now insert so you
can do something like this get a context
dot get content resolver insert right so
we have a context and we can now say
insert into this URI right now the URI
itself is gonna be that constant right
so it's gonna be status provider dot
content values content URI and that's
gonna be the URL right so this now calls
that so our content provider has an
insert statement again our our data now
calls get content resolver and says
insert now what's gonna happen is based
on this URI it's somehow magically gonna
get resolved to that content provider
right
so far so good
so you can kind of see how you know it's
it's kind of convenient because content
provider is village is kind of like a
query just kind of like a proxy to a
database almost yeah they are an insane
trend
yeah you're supposed to yeah so good
questions a question about threads and
this is now getting into into the
territory of like some changes to turn
new so up until recently it was the best
practice to do something like this on a
separate thread right but you would have
to kind of worry about it yourself and
it was just the best practice since API
11 honeycomb this became a lot because
they made strictmode be the default mode
and but to support it they created
something called content loaders so so
we can look into that later on we can
bring once we get this content provider
done we can actually bring it back to
our you know make it work so we'll get
to that so okay so we now that's that's
gonna create a values right and then
it's gonna simply say get resolver and
then insert right now on the here
there's one thing that's kind of missing
what the heck is this now right so the
in theory what we're supposed to do is
and again this is just call it soul
remember it's an interface so there's
certain like kind of like rules we
should adhere to if we don't sometimes
it's okay but it's like you know to
button everything up the proper way
would be to return this
dis uri plus the ID of what was inserted
so this actually returns an idea of what
was inserted right so it's gonna return
long and it's gonna return ID or minus
one if any error and here where it is
supposed to return the URI of a newly
created item right so basically so we
should do something like this long ID is
gonna be that right so I should now
return
so if I would say if ID is not minus one
I would return
URI dot with appended path now it's like
so it's actually URI and path segment is
going to be long it's going to be ideal
and we laugh I can do that yeah I was
hoping
like that else I'm gonna return URI
make sense or i-corp I mean maybe it's
cleaner this will return your eye and
then your eye because so if if ID is
great and not -1 we append it and then
we return that to your eye
ok so that's to kind of like be proper
so far so good uncreate just basically
creates a new DB helper and it turns
true okay so by the same token let's do
the other one that's kind of complex and
that's the query right so query is gonna
do the query right so we need to
basically immutable iron blah blah blah
no no no that
so query influences too can query
request from a client blah blah example
quark calls manage query
and so on so what we again what we need
to do a query is we need what we already
have here in status data get three
double database get a cursor a return a
cursor you can basically copy what you
did before and paste it here for the
most part
made
now this query DB query we passed in a
bunch of nails we're not gonna do that
this time around but DB query basically
had so first one was table second ones
columns okay Danny was selection
selection arcs so columns is actually
projections so this would go here right
this would go here this would go here
right we do not have having and grouping
but we do have a sort order so we're not
gonna hard-coded we're gonna do this
right
so we're basically passing the data that
came to the content provider directly to
the database you can kind of not see how
there's a like a nice sort of
relationship between the two right
projection is columns it's basically
which which columns the you care box
right so like you know select star from
statics that would be a projection would
be star meaning all columns selection
and selection arcs are the where where
selection is the actual where statement
the arcs are the variable centered so
it's a you know you plug it in the
national numbers yep whoa so now that we
have that we can in our query as opposed
to doing all that we can basically just
say return return
yeah today can't get content resolver
right dot query right and then status
provider fountain to your eye right and
projection was now selection was now
selection arcs was now
and so Dora was stabbed to data dot
created that + space descending like
that right
it's anybody's basically just forward to
their call there's not a lot of value I
guess in this in this case
yeah we could we could add permissions
yeah so we can we can we can look into
that let's do that next so where are the
permissions for insert for example
anyone can read but not everyone can
insert
presumably that don't need that so you
can make it to a shop thank you but I
know it's not okay well we've got insert
and we've got query we're gonna leave
updating the late for now don't care
about it too much
what do you wanna do about the what else
is missing what do you think is missing
Memphis folia so whenever we define a
main building block we've got to define
it in the manifest file so where would
it go the where right it's gonna be
equal level citizen to all the other
services receivers and provide and
activities right so it's gonna be called
a provider so you can go control space
provider right control space name dot
status provider and there is a one other
thing you need to specify and that's the
authority yeah
authorities yeah and authorities are
basically it's basically that string
that we had yeah yeah without the dot so
it's gonna be this this is our authority
calm example Yambol provider in my case
that's it we now registered it
there
that's correct that's correct yeah
there's no there's no good motivation to
do this unless you need to expose it so
Mike I created that motivation by
creative saying hey at some point we
want to create a wedge and a wedge it
lives in a separate process so something
like this is actually necessary
yeah if what it only needs read not
right can we use intent I mean we could
but it's not really cards designed
widgets are really designed to to read
data from a content provider usually I
mean but yes you could I mean you could
be you could have a widget read from a
file system or something crazy like that
but it's not very typical yes the idea
yeah there's a binder based IPC yes how
do you control the options so basically
yeah content providers are designed for
exchanging data I pcs are more more for
making blocking calls right so they
serve different purpose you know so it's
but there's you know there's enough gray
area in there to have cases that could
fit in both so so permissions you guys
for asking well let's first of all check
that this works and then we'll break it
further so let me make sure that this
first of all works at all right
alright so I'm gonna go menu refresh
sister work
menu status update new testing testing
nice
well
everything worked fine
so let me show you something now notice
that our status data no longer uses the
database as a matter of fact no longer
uses the DB helper so such it doesn't
need to create it right so at some point
it doesn't really make sense why Debbie
CalPERS even here to begin with okay
access so at this point what I would do
is I would cut it out okay and I would
move it into into status provider
as VB helper could even be an inner
class at this point actually it could be
an inner class because it lives inside
of there who've been in a class because
nobody else really needs it right so my
status data is now uber simple little
file it just basically defines
high-level stuff right as a matter of
fact they these two things also are not
questionable if this should be yeah
that's fine so it just defines sort of
like high-level things like how to do
insert / status how to do a query of you
know this right so yeah but that's
basically what what it is
how does the other apps know about this
so other apps know about this because we
registered it here in the authority so
remember when you install an app what
happens is is this gets called the the
the manifest file gets analyzed and it
is sees that you have a provider with a
certain target so when somebody else has
resolved this provider this call it's
fun okay now what if the authority be
the same name rate exists I don't know
that's the problem they may have then
you know whatever maybe the first one
wins or something like that um
now let's uh let's keep on mod let's
keep on thinking about this a little
further first of all you guys all good
for now okay let's think about this a
little further
I mean what's really the point of this
guy here insert doesn't really add a lot
kill of a lot to value morning you we're
gonna do some refactoring so some stuff
is gonna move around but it's all in the
interest of kind of like hey we learn
something new oh let's see how we can
improve on this so so what we can do is
we can basically as a you know the value
here is really just converting status
atwitter concept into content which is
an android concept so I could actually
provide a public a little helper method
public I'll call it content values
status to values status status right
take the scope move it down their net
return values
okay so that's gonna be a little helper
now you know this can now just do you
know status to values status and does
that the same thing right
make sense yes content values is a
building class yes so far so good now my
question is what the heck is a point of
having this insert here to begin with
right
the reason why we hung it here it was
because we needed some easy way in in
our other places to to basically insert
in a database but what if I let's let me
let me let's try let's copy this line
what are we using this insert well we
are using it in we're using it in
refresh service right so refresh service
is doing oh no actually we're using it
in number Yamba is doing pull pull and
insert right so it's doing the status
data insert status here right but what
if the um but then do that but used
actually in a content provider
right and and by the way we could have
made in status the status data we should
have made this static right because it
doesn't depend on the state it's just a
little helper
it just converts from one data type to
another right so if I if I do that so
basically here we use as opposed to use
insert we now use this content resolver
insert right what that means I no longer
need the insert here
right
I just move that code then we move the
word context dot because now we're
easier context as opposed to Kazakh
context previously we had a Kazakh
context so that's why we had to do it
context dot to get the result but here
it's easier relationship so we are
inside our context so we can just say
context right what's that
or your status to values well you need
to also add this right it's that static
status data yeah yeah so now status data
here's that little helper and it's got
this and that right so so first a good
whatabout query oh yeah
so query I'm gonna I'm gonna just copy
this line right but we were doing that
in time line activity right we were
doing the query somewhere right
we're doing it in oncreate right oh and
then we're doing it somewhere else right
yeah in boot receiver right so as
opposed to doing this like stuff like
this we could actually oops we could
have done cursor is get content resolver
right
so I'm basically trying to eliminate
cells data all together but then we're
gonna take some advantages of a content
provider when it comes to handling the
caning the threading we're gonna get
into content loaders which is somewhat
advanced stuff I mean relatively new
stuff so that's why so so we got this
here and then also I got a cursor here
I'm gonna remove that as well
and so now my studies data no longer
need square
well it no longer actually needs context
because nobody's using it right
actually the point is nobody ever needs
to construct status data anymore right
because yam Bob could live without
status data it is get rid of status data
almost yes so in time - aver I changed
the - there are two lines where you do
cursor equals rate so in previously we
were getting Yamba app dot status data
dot query now it's saying content
resolver
query dot blah blah same thing
um maybe it's not an inner class for you
so if it's not an inner class it's not
gonna know because timeline receiver is
not a you if that you could also try
context dot but I didn't have to do that
because it's an inner class yeah so
that's that's what we're at so we are
now no longer our status data is really
not that necessary anymore we could
actually move all this stuff into status
provider if you wanted to right make
sense I mean we just got a bunch of
constants and I want help or find a file
so you could cut this out put it into a
status provider what's that yeah we may
have to actually eclipse seems to be
smart enough and cares adjusted
everything right is it it seems to it
seems like it has
maybe not but status data thank you
thank you so yes I just did a quick
search replace for status data dot
replace with nothing and everything
Bree factor itself you just want to make
sure everything from piles and then once
you're done with that you can delete
your status data well let me first fix
my timeline activity because it seems
like it still refers to status data when
we start provider
so let me just replace all BAM fixes it
I just did search a place in timeline
and that fixes it and then Yamba app
same thing you can do there's only one
spot but you can you can manually change
it so status datas became status
provided it says here yeah so let's just
finish this and and then I'll let you
eat the pizza for those of you who
compiled whose code compiles pizza is
that way for the rest you gotta stay in
here yeah so we so I'm now gonna burn my
status data gone so no more poor juice
when I run to make sure it works and but
keep in mind you guys we're not done
here there's more work to be done it's
gonna work but it's not optimal there
are some nice things that we can now do
with content provider because we can
introduce loaders and certain other
things like that so this is just setting
up the stage for next right so menu
refresh yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
