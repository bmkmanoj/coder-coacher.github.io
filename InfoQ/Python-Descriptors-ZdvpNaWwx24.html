you Joker's but just recently someone
emailed me and said that they they love
some of my screencasts and stuff at
least they thought they did and then
they noticed that I use the word
basically all the time and now they
can't watch anything that I say so I
basically just feel like basically all
the time I say nothing but basically I'm
incredibly self-conscious about it um
yeah if you want to ring a little bell
every time I say basically apparently
this is the problem yeah yeah yeah cool
yo so basically the talk tonight is
about descriptors starting with me so
I'm summing in Franklin and what I said
this guy which is about right actually
your humble co-organizer I currently
work for Twitter a technical instructor
I teach Python and like some other stuff
to people at a Twitter you can follow me
on Twitter or find my personal page so
me Franklin comm so I don't know maybe
this would have been a better title what
are descriptors and why do I care it's
kind of the idea with the talk tonight
is descriptors give us a powerful
interface to write reusable code that
can be shared between classes totally
not an inheritance sense we'll see what
that means it just if you're working
with object-oriented Python code you
need to understand how two descriptors
work even if you're not going to write
it yourself and it might turn out that
it's useful for you to write some
descriptors yourself so we're gonna try
and talk through some implementation
patterns and anti patterns and some use
cases as well as explain again you know
what the heck descriptors are in the
first place so um cool we'll do some
descriptor magic here in just a little
bit but it's going to take me a little
bit to get to descriptors got just a bit
of background knowledge to review first
there's going to be like lots of details
and listening to Jess like trying to pay
attention when it gets detailed I'll try
to go slow with details that you know
I'm having trouble following medical
asses I think this is this might be
easier but it's it's worthwhile
knowledge is power so let's let's gain a
little bit of power everybody knows
about simple classes
and objects right you make a class it's
got some attributes it's got some
functions this particular thing is kind
of interesting
it's got class attributes and object
attributes and everybody's okay with
that I can make an instance of my class
and I can refer to an attribute called
pi there on line 9 hmm what exactly is
that so when you access an attribute of
an object so basically just say you know
like object dot foo what goes on exactly
so the first thing you get back is
something stored in the objects
underscore underscore dict property
right everybody knows that it's just
object attribute access is like
syntactic sugar for for dictionaries
more or less but of course if you
reference an attribute that doesn't
exist on the object then you fall back
to looking in the classes underscore
underscore dict property which is also
like a dictionary like like thing in
this case so you can say my circle about
pi that's not on the object so it looks
in the class so everybody is there three
simple rules for understanding attribute
access you say object dot foo and that
means you're getting the Fuki out of the
dict on the object or you're getting the
Foo key out of the dict
on the type of the object I have the
class the object or if you're assigned
to it you're just creating it in the
dictionary okay so three simple rules
attribute access really really simple
really easy really uncomplicated throw
inheritance into the mix just make sure
we account for that so you have method
resolution order class B inherits from
class a I got a couple classes here and
you can say you make a you make an
object and you can reference like the
copyright attribute and it looks through
the the mro the method resolution order
is it on the object is it on the class
is it on all the classes listed in the
mro the inheritance chain okay so it
actually should be four rules look an
object ik kind of clastic look through
all the classes in the mro oh yeah if
you assign to it just create something
on the object okay so basic Python
knowledge everybody's with me so far one
more thing here before we get to
descriptor sometimes just simple
attributes aren't enough we need
something a little bit more powerful so
you know because the classic
object-oriented programming mistake I
had this class called circle you call
the constructor you pass it a radius oh
and sometimes people want the
circumference I'm going to calculate
that in my in my constructor they're on
line five and store it and I now have a
broken class right you can change the
radius and the circumference doesn't
change
so yeah I'm stealing from Raymond head
and Jerry can go watch his PyCon talk
and he's got circles and explains this
stuff but you know still from the best
so everybody knows how to fix this
particular problem right it's it's
really beautiful in Python you say app
property that's a decorator you write a
function that has the name of the
attribute you want to intercept and hey
it's a getter right it's a calculated
property it still looks like you're
referencing an attribute you can say my
circle dot radius is equal to three and
my circle dot circumference it looks
like it's an attribute but really
there's like there's a function call you
know kind of hidden there so we added a
getter but we didn't have to change the
API our class at all cool powerful
feature we like we like properties I
love getting people who write Java and
showing them properties and they're
really happy because you don't have to
write all your getters and setters
upfront you can add them later on when
you need them so properties properties
cool we like property have you ever
wondered how the app property decorator
works and is it actually always the
right tool for the job so just review
our attribute access rules which are
growing slightly okay six simple rules
if you say object dot foo you get the
result of the property if it's defined
and I don't really know what that means
or the value in the object dictionary or
the very in the class or the value in
the Heritage classes until you find a
match look into the mro accounting for
inheritance there and you always
assignment always creates a new entry in
the dick unless there was a setter
property and we can do both getters and
setters with that property thing so our
rules got slightly more complicated but
everything we know so far that rule
number one is actually this rule instead
accessing an attribute though saying
object dot foo gets you the
result of the underscore underscore get
method of the data descriptor of the
same name attached to the class if it
exists that's really what's going on hey
descriptors finally we got there okay so
what is a data descriptor
what's a descriptor it's easy a
descriptor is just any object that has
one of at least one of three methods get
set and delete a data descriptor has
both getting set a non-data descriptor
that's really the name for it has just
just get so I'm done but okay not not
quite thank you
have I said basically yet by the way I'm
sweaty oh I'm sweating up here I'm
really working hard not to ever say
basically okay so we'll look at the
implementation some some ways to
implement those three functions like
what they mean but first you'll hear
people talk about the descriptor
protocol so just to kind of clarify the
descriptor protocol is rule number one
explained and also a brand new rule
number three plus a few more details of
Management so here's the deal seven
simple rules if you say object dot foo
what you get back is the get method of
the data descriptor that's attached to
the class the type of the object you're
referencing if it exists or number two
you could be retrieving the key from the
underscore underscore dict attached to
the object or number three you could be
getting the get method of the non-data
descriptor it's like there's two
different kinds of descriptors and they
both have little slots in in these rules
or you could fall back to looking on the
type over the list of inherited types
till you find a match an assignment
always creates an entry in your objects
dict unless there was a set of property
which we now know means you're calling
the underscore under course set method
of the descriptor which is an object
that's attached to your class and we got
to figure out what what all that is okay
so there's actually seven things that
object dot foo could
right this is just this is horrific no
one could possibly understand all the
stuff so many rules right it's not that
complicated people do all sorts of
really complicated things all the time
um descriptors so there's this get set
delete method their signatures are fixed
and I want to look at what it means to
write these three methods some common
patterns of implementation besides just
you know what the signature looks like
and I'm gonna just punt on Dell because
who wants to delete a property an
attribute anyways so I'll just do get
and set if you don't mind okay so get
and set my slides like really wait in
this resolution all right can I just
here we go cool descriptors will look
really odd because descriptors are
instances of an object that's then
attached to another class so this is a
lines one through five here is a
descriptor class any class that
implements at least one of underscore
and score get underscore no score set a
score underscore del here so I've got
get inset and all I'm going to do is
print out the arguments that I got so
I'm not going to do anything useful but
you would typically attach this to a
class by saying at class definition time
there on line eight x equals an instance
of my descriptor and that's really weird
that's not really how most stuff tends
to work in Python usually you make
attributes you know like in the end it
on self and attaching it to the class is
a totally different thing but again the
point of this is to simulate attribute
access and kind of hide a function call
so when you make an instance of your
class you can reference object X X
attach the object and what you're really
calling is the get method of the
instance of the descriptor that's
attached to your class that's what
happens so function calls hidden
attached to the class - you could say my
class X and you've got a hidden function
call you're calling the get method of
the instance of the descriptor attached
to a class and you can assign to the
object you can't assign to the class
we'll see that in a bit but again it's
kind of like a property sort of thing
but a lot more complicated so far so
details on the methods you're going to
get self
because you always get self self is the
instance of the descriptor so just
thinking about this there's going to be
one self for any particular class like
you made one instance of the descriptor
attached to the class
doesn't matter how many objects you make
from the class there's one self one
instance of the descriptor object is the
thing that you're attached to so the
object that you're attached to that's
made from the class that you put
yourself on type is the class that
you're attached to and yet you can call
on both the class where the object set
you can only call on the object and
there's a few obvious reasons for that
also if you call on the elf and type are
both provided on object attribute access
that makes sense
only type is provided on class attribute
access because I think I meant to say
object there is no object that you're
attached to if you're calling attached
to a class I think I got an example here
that'll make that clear so this is what
a descriptor looks like and this is me
trying to write a useful descriptor so I
could say uh you know what do you
usually do in a class do you like attach
stuff to self right this looks like
really good normal Python code this
doesn't work for descriptors why not
self is the descriptor there's only one
descriptor how many how many different
objects are made from the class that
it's attached to
so like essentially we just recreated a
class level attribute you could set your
attribute and then you'll be able to
retrieve the current value from another
instance of the same class so you can't
do that simple thing it would be nice
you can't do that simple thing possible
strategies for how we could write
recipes for out we could write our
descriptors we might try storing stuff
on object so that's the instance of the
thing I'm attached to we could try
storing stuff so I instance of the class
the instance by descriptors - -
sometimes I have no idea what I'm saying
myself it's really not my fault it is
that complicated or maybe instead of
attaching stuff to objects will get
attached stuffs to self that's the
descriptor itself but we'll have to
very it somehow so let's look at those
strategies and maybe this will help us
understand our get method a little bit
better
let's try storing stuff on self so
here's the problem
you can't just store stuff on self with
the same field name you got to vary the
field name so what I might try doing is
using object that's the thing when I'm
attached to as a dictionary key so I'm
going to make an empty dictionary in the
constructor of my descriptor when you
try to retrieve the value of my
descriptor I say well which object am i
attached to and then I'll give you the
value for that particular object alright
and the same thing with self I'm just
going to store the value that comes in
and I'm gonna use the object as the key
so this this is actually really horrible
I actually wrote a descriptor like this
and has some really strong problems
among other things you now have a
reference for every instance of your
class stored in the descriptor attached
to the class so you can delete the
objects they don't get garbage collected
because you've still got you know a
pointer to them essentially you'd have
to delete the class to make the objects
made from the class go away
that's really bad shouldn't do that you
could still use the same pattern yeah
you can use weak references so pep 205
there's a weak ref module it's got a
dictionary that you give it objects to
use as keys and it doesn't use the
object you use a weak reference to the
object be careful because stuff
disappears from your dictionary when it
gets garbage collected
I can occasionally bite you when you're
iterating but this what this would work
and some people write descriptors this
way so just make a a weak key dictionary
again kind of vary stuff by the object
as key and store everything in the
descriptor sort of kind of not
everything can be weak referenced so if
you slots no weak references a bunch of
the the built-in types
can't be weak referenced you can't use
lots of things as keys right you get the
have you ever tried to you know use a
list as a key to a dictionary you get
the unhackable type thing so if you
inherit from a mutable data type you
can't use so there's a bunch of there's
a bunch of classes of things that you
won't be able to use as weak reference
keys in a dictionary so we might not be
able use this solution
so let's try storing stuff on the object
that a descriptor is attached to
so that would be obj and here's a
problem you define your descriptor like
this right you say like vowel equals an
instance of my descriptor class at class
definition time the descriptors
constructor runs it doesn't know the
name of the attribute that it's attached
to so how do you know like what name
should I use on the object you could you
could do this right you could just
duplicate the name you could pass like
hard code the name vowel is equal to my
descriptor and I'll pass you the name of
the field in which you can safely store
stuff so just a little bit of code
duplication and it makes the descriptor
easy to write so my new strategy is the
constructor for my descriptor assumes
you're going to give it a field name my
get just prints you called get so I can
see it happens and then you're going to
store stuff in the objects dictionary
with the key self dot field and the set
is going to store stuff the get is going
to retrieve stuff but you're going to
use the field name in the objects
dictionary so you get why that works
right if you say object X normally you'd
get the stuff stored in the objects
dictionary but since you have a
descriptor you don't it's kind of hidden
so it's okay if the descriptor uses
object underscore no score dict dot x
nobody else is gonna be able to get to
that that value without explicitly
referencing the dictionary so that would
be a safe thing to do the only thing is
you've got a little code duplication and
fortunately that like doesn't bug
programmers like a little duplicated
code it's fine
so nobody cares that solution works fine
um if only I knew something about
metaclasses which I totally don't or
class decorators you could do something
magical to make the pain go away like
this you can attach a decorator to a
class that was easier for me to write
than metaclasses but not quite as
powerful and this is a descriptor that
says give me a class I'll loop over all
the attributes of the class and I got
the name and I got the thing if the
thing is a descriptor then
let's go ahead and tell the descriptor
the name that it's being stored under so
that prevents my little bit of code
duplication just at the expense of a
little bit of magic it might be too much
magic it does work it's nice but you
know I don't know your tolerance for
magic may vary so again the point of all
this is you can say like object of X
equals 10 and object X and you get back
a value and really behind the scenes
there are function calls and this feels
like property was cool right does
anybody think does anybody think
descriptors are cool so far y'all want
to go out and write descriptors now
write property is actually syntactic
sugar on top of the descriptor protocol
it's implemented using descriptors and
so is static method and class method a
bunch of the the decorators that do
stuff to your classes methods are
actually just taking advantage of
knowing how the descriptor protocol
works so we might want to understand
what's going on underneath the covers
but hey you know maybe property is just
like doing the typical Python thing
right gives me a simple interface to a
complicated thing and cool I don't have
to write custom descriptors because
somebody else did that hard work for me
is there ever a reason for me to go out
and write objects with get set bleep
methods and attach them to my classes at
runtime and put up with all the pain of
implementation yes there is so app
property is not going to work for every
case where I need to attribute intercept
attribute access imagine this use case
you got a class it's got a bunch of it's
got a bunch of attributes and they're
all going to store currency amounts and
so you want to make sure that they're
they're decimals going to do like a
little bit of normalization well that's
cool you know I know property so I can
just write a separate property
definition for every single attribute
like if I had a dozen attributes and all
of them wanted to convert stuff back and
forth to decimal I have to copy and
paste you know it's not very much code
but I'd have to have one of these app
property things for every single field
and another one of these setter things
for every single field like I've got a
bunch of repetition there just keep
repeating and it kind of seemed to me
that the point of that property was to
keep me from having to put a bunch of
boilerplate
in my code in the first place so I don't
want to do that wouldn't you rather do
this you could write the translate stuff
from strings to decimals or from from
floats to strange to decimals and a
descriptor pretty easily and then you
can just signify the fields that have
some common behavior at class definition
time that's a lot prettier
I mean that looks good I'd rather I'd
rather do that if I could the take away
descriptors are cool if you've got
properties that have the same behavior
across lots of different names and maybe
across lots of different classes
it's like reusable properties so does
that ever does that ever happen think
database fields and this looks like
familiar code right you have like
varchar' fields and there's some stuff
that goes into having a varchar' field
you might always want to make sure that
the varchar' field the data coming in
isn't longer than the maximum length of
varchar' fields those of our char fields
name different things on all the
different classes so familiar code you
know for any database or layer and
there's some descriptors in Django or it
GUI languages you've got properties that
need to do stuff when they change their
values you know talk to an event loop
tell them something has changed if
you've done a little bit of key V T V
has properties that really its own hand
roll descriptor um or you know you might
do it just to be cool like it's kind of
nice to have a declarative API it's fun
writing forms or models and Django they
all kind of look the same you make a
class you have a few like class level
instances we can provide that API if we
can write descriptors or maybe you just
want to do advanced things like your own
property decorator and this is one that
I've seen soap has this more or less i'm
rana kerr has one of these there's one
of these like in flask i think it's a
it's a lazy loading property and let's
see if we can understand what's going on
here
so every framework ever seems to have an
implementation of this the first thing
is my lazy property
what kind of descriptor is that
non-data descriptor right you remember
so descriptors have at least one of
three methods data descriptors have get
inset non-data descriptor zone lis have
get okay so non-data descriptor and what
it does is hmm that's interesting
my constructor takes a function and
stores it and also remembers what the
functions name was and then my get
method says I'm going to call the
function that was passed to me to
compute the value I'm going to stuff it
in the object I'm going to give you back
the value so you could use it like this
it looks a lot like the property
decorator you just write a function def
X returns you know 42 the answer to
every complicated question and it's
decorated without lazy property so what
is it doing the first time you reference
X it called the descriptor and gives you
42 the second time it just gives you 42
do you remember why we're relying on
rule number 3 you know rule number one
is data descriptor rule number two is in
the objects dict rule number three is
non-data descriptor we hit the non-data
descriptor the first time we put it in
the object dict the second time we hit
the object dict instead of falling down
to the non-data descriptor its own it's
a lot of details
honestly writing out the the list of
rules are struggling to keep it all in
one slide um but if you get how it works
like congratulations this is a
complicated piece of pythons
object-oriented machinery that's that's
useful
go forth and wizard right cool stuff
with it some resources you might like
totally was inspired by Luciano Romano's
talk at PyCon about descriptors made me
actually think descriptors could be
useful David Beasley has a cool talk
that has some stuff about descriptors in
it among other class magic and follow me
on Twitter and I will post the slides on
my blog here when I when we get done
tonight any any questions can these
properties I was thinking be used to
make some of the attributes in
instances objects private effectively
yes the descriptor spec says make a data
descriptor and then you're supposed to
raise a like not implemented there's a
specific exception to raise in the set
method and that is what Python means
when it says you have a read-only
property there's also you can raise it
in the get to say like you could get the
value but you're not allowed to so yeah
implementing things like data privacy or
a data prevention is something you
should do with descriptors you could
just put a @ property to write the
getter and not write a setter to but you
get a more cryptic error message in that
case it's lots and a lot of fun
descriptors
so is your could you describe some
useful use cases where where these two
things go hand in hand so I need more
rules if I get the slots because if we
have slots we don't have an underscore
underscore dick at all we've kind of
hard-coded what our definition looks
like and we're no longer syntactic sugar
for a dictionary a reason to use both
slots and descriptors I can't think of a
particular reason to use both you
typically use slots for efficiency right
and you typically use descriptors for
mediated access to properties the two
don't necessarily interfere with each
other as long as you're not trying to
like you know store references to the
particular objects so I don't see the
reason why you can't use both I can't
think of a good reason to use both
particularly I tend to leave off slot if
I can if I can manage it I like my
Python dynamic Suman
I want to ask you about the slide so you
you brought up kind of increasingly
scary use cases of descriptors before
switching back to properties but if we
went back to that kind of really scary
part what's what's really if we wanted
to start using descriptors where should
we be storing the data what what came
out to you is the best way of so I do I
do like storing it on the object it's
nice to get the field name and I'm okay
with a like using a class decorator to
magically give me the field name
should you use descriptors if that was
the case if that was the question if I
have to the when should we use them yeah
if I have to write two properties that
look the same descriptor time where
where's a good place to store them
because when you brought up using a
dictionary with keys I mean the hashable
yeah so it seems like there isn't any
perfect like always solution and if you
look for descriptive recipes people use
the week graph it tends to make sense
that descriptor data should be stored in
the descriptor that logically makes
sense but there's some significant job
actually that approach and I personally
what I write them I always store them on
the object with a field of the same name
hello oh um so you use you showed your
examples of showing descriptors for
objects as attributes on your classes
what in which cases would you want to
use a descriptor of for a function on a
class so intercepting access to a
function yeah yeah so that before but I
can't so as remember why you did it the
normal way we're kind of attaching
descriptors is yeah it kind of looks
like fields and we're think about these
things as attributes just pieces of data
and not thinking about them as functions
but that last one that I did see if I
can get to it here it's important to
realize where is implementation here we
go this at lazy property decorator thing
is making a descriptor and returning it
in place of this function that I made
and then this function X is going to be
called by my descriptor so I am totally
replacing a function with a descriptor
and if you're going to do that
the decorator syntax and decorators are
take a callable and give a callable back
in its place
seems like the right thing to use it's
extremely common I might say to write
descriptors and then apply the Miss
function or apply them as decorators
cool so I thought about doing this at
the beginning but I thought I might be
I'm too discouraged has anybody written
descriptors in the audience here's a
hand so it's my perception that this is
an underutilized feature of the Python
language and maybe it's like metaclasses
there's a lot of details to manage but I
do look at frameworks like Django and
see really effective use using
descriptors to manage complicated types
so I'm actually kind of encouraged to go
out and look for use cases for
descriptors I kind of was hoping I'd do
that for you too
