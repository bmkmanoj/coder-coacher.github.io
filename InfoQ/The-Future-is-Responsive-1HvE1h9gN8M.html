use the web and the way people are
connecting to websites is changing right
this is a picture of Liza Gardner making
sweet device love to all the devices
that she has you guys all here Paul I
have your iPad your iPhone your Android
whatever it is but even this picture is
kind of a misrepresentation at what's
really happening most of these devices
here Apple devices but people are course
using every kind of device all over the
world mobile users are going to
outnumber desktop users next year so
this is a thing that's going to happen
and mobile accounts for over half of all
the traffic in Asia and Africa right now
in other countries like Africa it's
really common for people to check their
bank accounts on their phone so they're
doing most of their bank transactions
using their feature phone as opposed to
going to an actual bank so this is that
we have some new challenges for how we
designed for the web how we design web
applications and application is going to
work on devices with different sized
screens take HTC for example HTC alone
has 12 different screen size resolution
combinations on Android okay and HTC is
one of the simpler Android lineups and
it doesn't even talk about a sure
Motorola LG Sony Ericsson at the other
25 manufacturers of Android phones all
with their own different screen size
resolutions and that's just android
phones we're not talking about iphones
kindles blackberries maybe webOS but not
really anymore nothing okay so design a
different interface for every device is
impossible but not considering devices
is a death sentence and we're only
barely starting to solve these problems
so hey I'm from ZURB my name is Matt
ZURB is an interaction design company
and product company we have worked with
over 200 startups in the last 14 years
to create over 1.5 billion dollars in
market capitalization we've also worked
the lauder bigger companies you may have
heard of some of these and I'm here to
talk about responsive web design and
some of the work we've been doing on
this so what are your options for
building a mobile product right we need
to be considered different device
I think that's pretty obvious now so why
responsive design why am I talking about
this well because it scales we talked
about the ten different devices for the
HTC and that's just screens anything
with four corners right so we're not
just talking about delivering your
content to phones and tablets and
desktops but also TVs and anywhere else
people are consuming your content so
anything with four corners right if it's
small like this like a phone or big like
this like an iPad or a tablet that's
that we need to be considering it's also
orientations rotations locations sounds
site and more right I talked about the
ten different screen sizes for Android
that doesn't include the different
orientations you can have on that device
which of course doubles that number so
the responsive web is the idea we can
build one single code base and you see
anywhere right we have this option of
delivering our applications as a
responsive web application and also
potentially embedding these in an app
application so I'm sure you guys are
familiar with like the the netflix app
on the ipad if we're doing responsive
design to deliver content we can do it
just frustrate content website but we
can also do it for an application so
taking a website and embedded inside an
application to get access to more
functionality on the device let's just
worry about 10 or 12 things at lunch
right now so what does this mean for
product design now that we have all
these different devices to think about
when we're doing our web design how it's
going to change the way that we think
about things so like I said Serb is a
product design company and create design
is all about iteration this concept that
great designers just kind of leave to a
conclusion if they sit around on these
fluffy chairs all day and all of a
sudden they have this like aha moment
they're like oh yes I see exactly what
the problem is and they solve it that's
totally a lie right great design is all
about iteration the designers that I
work with they are never laying down
there constantly up there doing
sketching on nope notepads with sharpies
or they're up at the whiteboards
figuring out some concepts erasing it
and doing something else I constantly
get any feedback it's as I idea of
iterating over and over again and
getting feedback that produces really
great results so take these two
gentlemen that created this you know
iconic piece of industrial design the
telephone and you can see in the
background all the different iterations
that they went through all different
prototypes to get to this great device
they shaped the way the phones look
right does anyone know what this is
besides a piece of wood it's an iphone
yes that's right this is the prototype
for the original the ipod actually did
Steve Jobs carried around in his pocket
right if you think about the time that
the ipod came out the phones were all
about really small phones the razor flip
phones clamshells look in some really
small in our pocket you really want to
make sure that people would actually
take a device this large and carry it
around so he took this block of wood and
he put in his pocket and he carried it
around to make sure that it fit into his
skinny jeans right and this is where the
original form factor of the ipod came in
and of course past that there were
enough of iterations on the ipod to get
it right the first ones kind of old
clunky with the big buttons they got
sexier and sexier all the way to this
device that i'll bet more than half you
have in your pocket right now designers
also like to work on juicers so this is
the juicer maybe your grandma had maybe
you have in the kitchen i don't know i'm
not going to judge you this is a newer
iteration on the juicer it's a little
cooler looking this is a number of other
iterations done on that juicer to come
to this juicer that apparently juices
much better than those users and looks
really cool right all the way to this
you know crazy looking kind of alien
thing maybe a step back but very elegant
design the last iteration of the juicer
this is mountain dew this is mountain
dew code revv does anybody know what the
latest iteration it Mountain Dew is it's
the mountain dew am nothing you guys
you're killing me here okay so that's
iteration up until now the way that most
designers iterate on a website is by
doing something like this right we go to
photoshop we create a new canvas and we
do a design in photoshop we call
somebody over we say hey look at this
design what do you think they have some
feedback we move some stuff around on it
we try it again right it's just not good
anymore this isn't the way that people
consume content right previously we
could have a fixed with design for our
web content and that work just fine
because everybody was viewing our
content on a screen it was pretty much
the same with or was at least bigger
that you're trying to deliver so as long
as we delivered an experience that
worked for the majority of devices
everything is great this wasn't a
problem so here this is your content and
it travels through all these different
mediums to get to your user right they
can do it on their TV their phone their
desktop and they get their content and
you don't have control over how they get
that content anymore now that
everybody's carrying these 20 or 15
devices around their pocket all right so
it's kind of a roundabout way to get to
what is responsive prototyping what I'm
talking about so responsive prototyping
is all about doing it in code right
let's do it live because this is the
best way we're actually be able to take
our design and see what it looks like on
a phone what it looks like on a tablet
what's gonna look on a desktop and
that's doing a practical design review
like I said before if we're just doing a
design it's 960 pixels wide then that's
great we only need to do a design review
on that original design show it to some
people and that's fine but now when you
see what does it look like on a phone
what does it look like on an iPad what
does it look like on a desktop right are
the links going to be clickable by a
finger do I have to get my pinky out do
I need some kind of special stylist
operate this website and everywhere else
that you can think of thinking about how
your design works everywhere not just on
your 960 grid Photoshop layout which
lets us iterate faster for multiple
devices by doing a prototype write in
code we can see that prototype right in
front of us and iterate quickly for all
the different devices so what's so great
about response to prototyping well we
can prototype for every device very
quickly because we're using the three
10s response to prototyping going to
talk about a second and we're going to
cut down stiffly on development because
we're not building a different code base
for each device so we're going to build
just one code base it's going to work
across all these different devices and
we're going to ready for device it don't
exist yet right we don't know what the
screen resolution is going to be on the
iPad next year we don't know if we're
going to go to a double retina device
that has twice the pixel density we
don't know is going to happen so we need
some new tools the rescue right you guys
are all developers we all like tools so
I talked about some tools and that some
fun stuff but first just a little bit of
background on responsive design and what
it really is so how do we get to this
responsive design concept what actually
happened pretty quickly this guy named
Ethan Marcotte wrote this article on a
list of part where he explained
responsive design coined the term and
went down the three points what does it
mean to have actual
pancit website so it's three things the
first thing is a fluid grid system so if
you guys were doing websites 13 years
ago you probably are really big deal but
monitors got really big everyone get
really excited they like oh we have to
do everything fluid so we can use every
last pixel on this monitor right but
ultimately didn't really pan out because
people didn't really care about using
all the things on the monitor we were
really just good enough with whatever
what kind of fitting a 960 width which
is where the UH 960 came from but for
Responsive we have small devices so this
fluid grid becomes really important
again not only because we want to be
able to shrink it down to small device
but we just don't know what the width of
the screen is going to be so we want our
fluid grid to be able to readjust our
content to just fit on whatever the
screen is because on a phone that's
really small or phone that has 10 more
pixels with you want to be able to use
all peoples that you have so it looks
like a nice seamless design that goes
all the way to the edge of the device
secondly we need styles for media that
don't worry about pixels if we're going
to have a fluid grid and we're going to
have vastly different screen sizes like
we do on a phone versus a desktop all of
our meeting is not care about pixels so
we need images that work on the big
device of the small device videos all
that good stuff and we'll any media
queries is selectively adapt the page so
one of the comments consumption is that
response it is that respondent is fluid
right respondent is fluid plus we're
going to use media queries to adjust
things where they don't make sense even
with the fluid grid a lot of designs on
the desktop you start going to make any
sense on the mobile phone or on a tablet
right and we need to selectively take
certain things on the page and serve a
different element or literally change
the navigation when you go to a page on
a browser on a desktop you want the
navigation at top it makes a lot of
sentence provides you're really good
hierarchy right when you're on a phone
the first thing you want to get to is
the content if you have a big navigation
on the top that makes no sense I have to
see how this navigation stuff I don't
care show me the content you got a
scroll past that you probably ought that
on the bottom so the key difference
between responsive design and just fluid
design is that fluid is just laying out
everything in percentages right so that
it flows to whatever size the container
is response it is that plus we're going
to selectively make some changes we're
going to say hey things are different on
the phone then they are on the desktop
and we're going to you know selectively
adapt the page so there's three classes
of devices right we have phones tablets
and desktops and a lot of cases tablets
desktops can be are pretty much the same
thing the biggest difference of course
is touched on a paddle over to the
desktop but the screen is about big
enough on a tablet that most the
affordances that work on the desktop
will work on the tablet as well all
right so that was the start of this
whole responsive thing when he wrote
that article there were no tools he
didn't have a grid in mind he just said
this is how I think it's going to be
right so then the tools came after that
inside of our fluid grid and thinking
about different devices we also wanted
to have tested things that we know we're
just going to work we want to make sure
our typography our forums and our
buttons work really well across the
different devices obviously a button on
a phone needs to be a lot larger than it
does on a desktop if it's not big enough
you'd actually be able to touch it and
have a nice click area so needing the
toolkit like that is why we built
foundation three foundation is totally
open source framework I swear about
trying to sell you anything we've been
using this for our own internal client
work for the past couple years under
number different names but this is the
tool kit that we built there's a couple
other there like that that we use to do
responsive design so this is what the
doc page for foundation looks like on a
phone on a tablet and then I desktop
it's the exact same content across all
three different devices but as you
notice the navigation is a little bit
different so we are selectively changing
the elements for the different devices
and frameworks like foundation of what
enable you to do rapid response or
prototyping so we use foundation to
quickly build out new concepts and then
test them across all three devices and
I'll show you some examples of that
rapid response prototyping helps us make
better products because we can prototype
quickly we can get ideas out there with
clickable prototypes that we can see how
it works crotch ever devices so here's
an example this is the website that we
did for Rebecca's children services
every year we do an event calls herb
wired where we spend 24 hours building a
new website and print material for a
non-profit so we take applications and
then the whole team comes into the
office is about 20 of us and we have
maybe five or ten volunteers come as
well and we work from eight a.m. on
thursday until eight a.m. on friday an
8am on friday we launched a new website
like it goes out and that's it and we're
done there's no more messing with it
it's a pretty serious business so this
is kind of how we did it like I said we
have 24 hours to do this whole thing
these sites aren't crazy and complicated
but there are a lot of pages and we're
doing a new visual direction for them
so this year for Rebecca chills and
services we did a whole bunch of
sketching first we probably did about
200 sketches for all the different pages
and we did this alongside with a
non-profit so we got three or four
designers in a room and they were just
banging out sketches work with you or
from the nonprofit what do you think
this for a home page don't like it throw
it away or recycle it what do you think
about this for the foreign patients I am
right we do this for a donate page going
through a whole inch of ideas really
quickly and coming up with just these
really rough sketches of what all the
major page and the side are going to be
so this gives us a rough idea what our
sitemap is and it just kind of shows us
what's going to be on each page so these
were the final pages that's the homepage
in the top left and we took these
sketches we wield it down to I think
about 20 sketches and we handed it to
our coders right we have three guys and
they took guys and gals they took all of
these sketches and they coated them up
in foundation just as like a really
rough Perth I think that's something to
work with and this is what looking in
the foundation code the is only I think
one line of presentational CSS on top of
the foundation framework that is what
creates that kind of box in late and I
hear unit on top so this is laid out
using the foundation grid if you gather
for me with how a grid works it's a laid
out like this our grid has 12 columns
that you can nest it's a fluid grid
right because we're doing responsive
design and it has an arbitrary max width
so on really large devices we're not
going to blow the grid all the way out
but if you want to go full width then
you can just take one last ESS and say
max with auto and it won't do that for
you it's modified by media queries for
smaller devices so like I said things
are different on a phone then they are
on a desktop I'll talk about that a
little bit more later and it looks like
this we have to do this a row and then
we have two days within it to create our
our columns three columns and nine
columns equals ten columns if you mallu
with the greatest is pretty
straightforward stuff if you're not is
just a great way for us to lay it out so
up here on the top we've got a row with
three columns on the left for our logo
nine columns on the right that our hero
piece across the middle is the full 12
columns and then each of these pieces
down below are four columns each
so in a grid you have you specify your
columns and the grid automatically takes
care of making sure each of your columns
are spaced out it has them called a
gutter so you can see next to each of
those pieces down below which is for
calling for call for columns they're
spaced out a lit by the gutter that's
all inside the grid so all we're doing
here is we're taking this row splitting
it up into three columns that are each 4
columns and we're putting an image
inside of that and that image is flowing
up I do apologize if you a just here
have the pixels written on them that's
the native size of the image that we're
playing for place hold it but of course
that size that image is going to you
know resize based on whatever the layout
of the pages so the images are contained
inside each one of those columns as the
column shrinks or expands the image is
going to shrink or expand with the
column so the Rose look like this like I
said they have an arbitrary max width so
they won't get bigger than what that Max
is specified to be and then columns
inside have that gutter in between them
so here we have our three columns and
our nine columns when we add more more
rows on top of each other the columns or
course are fixed by percentages and then
the height of each row is determined by
the content inside of that row so we can
keep stacking a bunch of rows on top of
each other to lay out the page how we
like and we can also nest rose so for
more complex layouts we can nest a row
inside of a column to split it up even
more so here we've got another I think
as 10 and 2 columns and then below that
end of the row with four and six columns
for four and eight so here's another
page this one is laid out entirely using
the grid and just the basic foundation
elements so on the left we have our row
with our content in it it's got eight
columns and we've nested a number of
rows inside of that each does embedded
Rose is two columns on the left and then
ten columns on the right so you can very
easily do these um common layouts like I
want image on the Left content on the
right you can put the stuff together
very quickly using that using a grid so
we've talked about this being responsive
so when you take this grid layout and
you look at it on a mobile device we
simply take the columns and we stack
them on top of each other so this is the
the default behavior so when I go into
my phone everything just gets stacked
it's pretty common when you're on a
phone to view things in this kind of
linear fashion you think about how
you're viewing your email you're used to
scrolling up and down right better you
present the content on top and let
someone scroll through it then making it
really smart and hard to read small and
hard to read and having to pinch to zoom
in between all of it we also have this
concept of a source ordering so we take
these columns and we put them on top of
each other you may not like the order
that they come in right maybe you had
your navigation on the left in your
content on the right when we stack it
now you get your navigation on top which
of course is kind of a bummer so we have
this concept these classes you can add
to your columns it's called the content
is called source or during the
implementation we have is called
push-and-pull so you can say i want to
take these seven columns and push them
to the left and these three and pull
them to the right what it does is on a
desktop it will flip the order they're
displayed in so we can actually display
our markup in the order that you want to
be seen on a phone or a tablet but then
on the desktop we can rearrange it to
display in a different fashion this is
really good for screen readers where for
a screen reader you want the first
content they see in the actual body of
the content to be whatever your content
is right Read Me the headline read me
the article source ordering and lets you
lay out your content in the way you want
to be seen by a screen reader or by a
phone and then it adjusts it to be
displayed differently on a desktop if
you actually want to keep your columns
next to each other we also have a mobile
grid it's four columns wide so this way
on a mobile device I may actually want
things to stay next to each other right
embedded in a column and they have a
column where I want to be everything to
each other I'll use the mobile grid up
with the mobile classes on there it'll
keep them all next to each other the
classes for the grid look like this one
column two column three columns two
columns offset by four if you want to
take your columns and push them over to
the side or eight columns centered if
you've got columns you just want to
center right inside of that row so let's
go a little bit deeper into the grid and
what makes our great different from
other grids so we learn from foundation
to 23 we change the way that our grid is
built to be similar to what golden great
does with theirs to make it more of an
easily customizable grid so the problem
with customizing most grid layouts with
the gutters is that
you specify your columns like this so we
have our column we're going to float it
men hyetym petitioner relative to keep
things laid out correctly and then
margin left is what actually creates the
the gutter on side the column right that
means we specify each of the column
widths we have to specify them like this
one column is four point three percent
two columns as thirteen percent but this
doesn't actually add up to a hundred
percent what we have to do is we have to
figure out for each column you know if I
have one column here how much of a
gutter do I need right if the gutter
size is fixed how why should the column
be because there's only gonna be one bar
to the left of it so you can't change
the size of your gutter on your grid
without changing all these column
vectors every time you do that so if you
can imagine you pull this grid down and
you don't like the gutter you want a
larger gutter you have to update all
these different declarations right so
you guys I've got a preprocessor like
SAS or you have to rewrite all the stuff
and do the math to figure it out which
isn't crazy less kind of pain in the
butt what you really want is something
like this where one column is 8.3
percent which all adds up to one hundred
percent when you do it so that you never
have to miss these declarations you can
just edit your gutter size and then
everything is good to go you'd love to
write something like this where it's
just like patty and 0 15 that's my
gutter don't muck with it but the
problem with this with doing it like
this is of course that padding is not
part of the width of your column so this
messes up all the calculations right our
patty is not included with the columns
this doesn't work however you can do
something cool like this which is a
border box sizing so what this does if
you say for every element using the star
selector I want to use box sizing
border-box this takes you back in time
to the days of ie6 and the porter box
model where padding is actually included
in the width of your elements so it
turns out this may not have been such a
bad things we thought after all Paul
Irish has a really good article on his
blog about why Porter box size you may
make more sense than the current model
that we're doing so by putting our
browser into this mode we can specify
our columns by just having the width
they add two hundred percent and then we
just have our gutters specify exactly as
they are you can modify that good as
your heart's content and the other
column widths they'll get changed at all
and here's the full declaration looks
like this is supported everywhere except
for ie7 ironically it was the default
mode in 96 they dropped it in 97 and
then they brought it back in ie8 all
modern browsers support it except fri 7
and there's the link to have Paul
Irish's article just very good so let's
all images so like we said in a
responsive design your images need to be
able to scale up or down based on
whatever size your columnist this means
they have with like whatever so you
don't know what the width is actually
going to be as presented because it
depends on the devices you're looking at
because the response to prototype is all
about giving up control right so this
creates some interesting challenges in
which is responsive design they have to
be able to scale for different devices
so this means you need to serve a really
large image that's going to work on the
desktop which will also scale down two
phones the problem of course is now on
your mobile phones you're serving an
image is much larger than it needs to be
the same age is being scaled up or down
and there's really not a lot of great
solution to this problem yet it can
either be large at this handled heavy
load right or you can swap it out with
something like scotch y'all just lost
interest solution so the solution is
cool it requires you to go in a little
bit of Apache configuration and some
other hackery it gets the job done if
you're serving the large image for the
desktop and use want you the exact same
image on the phone the cool thing about
that is it is a large image but you're
already supporting the retina devices
right because the new phones and the
iPads have right end devices della pixel
density if you're having a lot of really
crisp looking elements on the page and
then you have something that's not the
right density it looks a little bit
muddy Apple has a really cool solution
on apple com right now if you go to the
apple com website on a retina laptop and
you refresh the page cache cleared
you'll see that the big like velocity
image shows up a little bit muddy and
then it snaps to the crisp one so what
they're doing is in the source code
they're serving up this single pixel
density image and they're using
javascript to detect okay is this a
double it's a retina device with a
regular device it is the retinal one
it'll load in the high density image so
it looks really nice and sharp right
stuff on the retina device right two
screens on they do look a little money
it just kind of weird problem
there's a link to the scott jealous
false image solution and in the latest
web kit there is an attribute that you
can specify to serve a different image
for double pixel density in devices
right so for your retina laptops other
than that there's really not a great way
to serve the different images um if
you're using anything SVG SVG stuff
works great also icon fonts are an
awesome way to serve images that look
great across levin devices so typography
works really well across all different
devices so if you guys familiar with
using icon fonts you can take an icon
font which is a font but instead of
letters there's all these different
icons as you want to embed right the
cool thing about this is their vector
images so they look really crisp on any
device they're really small unless
you're loading some huge font library
which you don't use all of them which is
kind of a bummer but they're going to
scale up or down for any device and
you're also able to change the color of
them using all the same CSS properties
you'd use to change the color of like it
like text right you can also apply some
of the cool transforms like you can put
text shout-out on them you can blur them
you can do some pretty neat stuff to
create some cool effects different
images if you don't want to serve an
entire icon library it's great for
prototyping you can use one of the
really big ones you can download the
number of free font icon libraries but
if you want to store something really
light you play actually need to go
through take all your individual images
and put them into your own icon font and
generate that and push that out so this
is kind of like the new sprites right
there still some pain here which you get
a lot of gain out of it typography forms
and buttons again in our foundation
we're trying to think through all these
problems how do they work in different
devices you have to worry about it so we
just have classes specify buttons this
is an anchor tag with a small blue
button class and you get a small blue
button large blue button you can toss
some radius on that with a radius class
or you can make it nice and put a little
bit of shine on it right these buttons
all have a certain width the size is
based on the class we show there but on
a mobile device they run the full width
of the columns that they're really easy
to click so going back this example
Rebecca's shoulder services it took us
about two hours to go
from these sketches to the actual coded
up wireframe on foundation and then
about seven hours after that to take
this code base and get to the actual
fully done design right the cool thing
about foundation is that it really has
no styling it outside of the box we're
literally just using it as like a
bare-bones wireframing tool so there's
really nothing to override and it's
nothing to throw away later so when we
use it we build everything on top of it
we don't just toss it and do a new thing
it's the foundational CSS the grid stays
the same you all wanna stay the same we
just add all the presentational CSS on
top of that of course that's every style
sheet it puts together the whole design
the site and you can see what the site
looks like on the desktop on the tablet
and then on the phone so what's next
what are we looking forward to coming
next in responsive design well better
media support responsive images like I
said there's still a big problem there's
not great support custom browsers unless
you're doing some really big hockey Josh
good thing the best solution you have
right now is to serve a really low kind
of like the apple.com hack serve a
really low resolution image when that
loads up use JavaScript to detect the
screen size and then snap in a larger
one so we're kind of going back to like
the old days the progressive gifts it
would kind of like load like you guys
remember those
prabal com what do you say
like intentionally cut your connection
let's talk about this afterwards I don't
you talk about though okay the the
picture tag which will hopefully come
around pretty soon of the spec which
will hopefully let us do cool stuff like
serve different sizes images for
religion images for different sized
devices and then the prevalence at SVG
right so SVG is pretty decent support so
I'll support everywhere but if you have
images that you can do with SVG it's
another option again you're dealing with
vector images that are going to be
really small they're going to look good
on all the different devices to be super
crisp even on those the retina devices
so like em if you guys have seen there's
some pretty cool libraries it's like a J
s library it does a little spinner its
generate using SVG graphic so the AG's
have looked super crisp on every single
device and like I said type of icon
fonts already better more advanced
frameworks you see the properties like
box sizing so I talked about box sizing
most of you guys probably aren't using
this there's other implications for
adding box sizing and they break other
things that you're doing so as more
people talk about that box sizing it may
become a thing and stuff may just kind
of work in box sizing mode there's been
a lot of cool thought about typography
including vertical rhythm and scale so
vertical rhythm is how your page is laid
out right you have your headers you have
your content and how all that stuff is
based out between each other is called
the vertical rhythm of the page and
designers kind of arguing that about how
it should be laid out what are the like
exact ratios by a conta this related how
far should that spacing be compared to
Conda this unrelated so there's a lot of
good thought in the community about how
we should be laying out our pages and
it's tough going to be built into these
frameworks so that when I lay out my
markup it's already kind of done in the
CSS we use vertical rather than
foundation is based on the golden ratio
there the golden rule golden ratio it's
make sure the only thing is spaced
practice if you're using our headers our
paragraph tags everything looks really
pretty when you lay it out it's got a
really nice for a friend of the page and
preprocessors like SAS and less we use
sastre foundation we're huge fans of it
it makes life a lot easier if you're
doing stuff like the Box sizing you just
say hey I want box sizing on it'll
generate the declaration for every
single
put the prefix is on it it doesn't
really need stuff but of course you need
you to do the work of having your
preprocessor running and generating your
code as you're going through it we don't
usually pimp products by Adobe but I'm
actually gonna say that the adobe edge
stuff is actually looking pretty cool if
you guys haven't checked this out I keep
an eye on it they got some neat stuff
coming edge reflow is like a Dream
Weaver that doesn't suck for Responsive
it's a it's really neat so it's the idea
of you you lay stuff out on the page and
I think I've screenshot of it here like
this yes this is reflow so you lay stuff
out on the page and you have controls on
the left so you say like hey here's a
box could take up this percentage of the
page and you can use a little slider and
you can say scroll between different
device size and i'll show you how your
design actually looks under devices so
it's like a WYSIWYG editor for
responsive stuff and it actually kind of
salsa this interaction problems it's
still not done we played with it it was
looking like it could be a thing so that
could be kind of exciting also edge
inspect it was previously called shadow
when it was in its beta release its
packages up on those open source
libraries that lets you have a inspector
embedded on all of your different
devices so what you do is you take the
adobe inspect agent you install it all
of your devices you take them and you'd
like mount them on the wall or something
and then your control device you go
through your pages and it updates all
their devices so you can see what it
looks like all the different devices you
see something that's broken you can
actually inspect the markup on any of
your other devices which is pretty cool
because there's no inspector on most
mobile phones so what's next for
foundation we are going to do a new
plug-in called clearing if you're
familiar the foundation we have a modal
plugin right now called reveal it really
kind of is great for light boxes so we
don't want you have to hack our modal
plugin doesn't look great wasn't built
for images we're going to add this do
you think I'll clearing we have like an
image slider called orbit it also really
isn't a modal experience so we're kind
of adding this this third thing called
clearing and clearing has to do it ways
to use it you can't attach it to a ul so
you drop it you on the page give it the
class clearing and we will take it and
display it like this so it's going to
display the thumbs
of different things it's kind of for
like an image gallery if you want to
show some images and on the mobile
device it will show them large like that
with thumbs in the bottom and let that's
not that will show just a little
individual thumbs or you can say
clearing for up will constrain it to
four up and then we'll stack them below
that or you can just say hey just show
four of them only show four of them you
can fire it from a single anchor so if
you've got like a hero piece the top of
your page and you want to fire the
clearing like the slideshow presentation
you can just attach data clear n equals
banner that will fire the the clearings
catch down there so it'll look something
like this and when you click on it it'll
go into this kind of full screen
experience where we're showing the image
there and the film to the bottom on a
tablet it'll be very similar and then on
the phone they'll just show the image is
one at a time and go the other site
through them when you're actually in the
clearing presentation mode so we are
going to be launching that in October so
yeah that's all I've got I'm happy to
answer any questions about responsive
design or whatever else you guys want to
talk about and thanks for hanging out
