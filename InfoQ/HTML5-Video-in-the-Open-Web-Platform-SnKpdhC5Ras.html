consumption we are we are leading the
web twist full potential we were created
by tim berners-lee in two thousand and
in a 1994 and and we are trying to get
all of the actors that are around the
web nowadays around the same table to
talk and actually sorts issues some
issues out and sometimes it's very easy
and sometime it's very challenging so so
we focus on creating web standards and
they are available freely on the web for
everyone to use and implement as well we
have a royalty-free patent policy that
we are insisting on if you're going to
participate in our working group and we
accept input for everyone from everyone
basically if you go to our website and
you look at one of the specification you
will always find a link in the status
which says this is how you comment on
the document whether you are part of the
working group or not we have 64 groups
bit less working groups that are the
working hoops are the one producing the
receive recommendations and we have of
course liaison with various
organizations depending and more or less
active depending on the moment in terms
of participation and you have several
ways without being a member of the
consortium to participate the first one
is if you have a great idea and you
believe that it should be deployed on
the way then used by everyone we have
what we call community groups that five
individuals from anywhere can actually
decide to create and and we give you
tools which is many lists so that you
can actually develop your idea refine it
and also as well build support for it
and if you're lucky enough you idea is
going to move into a working group later
on and become a standard web platform
dot org isn't it for that we started
maybe six months ago also where we the
goal was that the specifications are
really more towards implementers and
users if you want to learn HTML you
don't want to look at the HTML
specification to start with but we want
users to have actually resources they
can actually somehow trash and also
contribute to as well and that's what
this web platform dot our website is
about this is a big wiki and we are
telling the community out there this is
a wiki where you can actually find as
many information as possible and we have
several organizations that are on board
for this effort as well we are now open
we are not just by ourselves but
organization like Mozilla for example
Google Adobe Facebook Microsoft are also
on ball as well and last but not the
least we've been trying to develop our
testing if all four point sometime and
tessa went forward was an effort that
started by adobe as a succession of
events to actually educate the community
on how to actually write tests and
contribute them to the consortium i
won't say I won't try to pretend that
contributing test with the consortium is
an easy tax yet and we are working on
improving that situation that if you go
to the test web forward website you will
actually be able to learn more as a
starting point and we actually plan to
actually increase our efforts to make it
easier for the community at large to
contribute test and make the web
actually work so so let's dive let's
dive into psychology so the first one
that everyone should know by now is the
basic so html5 introducing html5 video
and HTML video element that was a
proposal to bio bio para I believe in
2007 or maybe even before that and the
goal was to make actually video the
first class citizen of the web so you
have you can actually display control
remove them you can
have a multiple source so that if you
have values codex you can also let the
user age and the browser basically pick
the one that you want to to develop but
you one other thing that we introduced
back in two thousand i believe 11 which
was due to heavy work from our mini
exceed ET subgroup was to address report
for tracks in particular text tracks and
also for media groups so so that works
quite well extracts report is still is
still in progress so not everything is
supported but you have basic support on
all of the browsers including mobile
mobile today one of the things that you
can use and i provide you a link from
that cell is this page that i met back
in 2010 and this page basically show you
three four different area the first area
is a video itself that you can play then
you have a little i'm sorry and then you
have a little set of button that you can
play with to actually change the video
and what you see at the bottom are
basically events that are generated by
the vid by the video here when the video
start playing and at the bottom you have
the properties basically and i apologize
for the scrolling to the screen and do
you have properties that are actually
being updated sometime in real time so
it's actually a very easy way to figure
out which property is supported or not
by the user agent without having to
actually write a test necessarily
doesn't guarantee that if it's green
that the property is going to actually
work as expected for example when you
change a playback rate meaning the speed
at which the video is being played well
for some implementations at least in the
person
be willing to get that is still the case
for son it doesn't actually change you
change the value of the property but it
doesn't change the playback of the video
which is a shame but if you actually
play it you will see the property being
updated in real time
why doesn't it work here we go and and
you see every time it's receiving an
event it's updating its counting the
number of event it's receiving and
underneath you see the property is being
updated in real time as well and you can
change those properties the way you want
you know for example to actually seek
within the video all you have to do is
assign a new value to current time and
you're seeking within the video very
easily as well and you can change the
volume you can pause and so on it's
pretty easy those are those are the
basic that you can do now you can do
today one of the things that I forgot to
show you at the bottom was whether they
be support for tracks or not so here you
can see that there is actually support
for text track in this implementation
there is no support for audio tracks for
video tracks so if my video file
contains more than one of you track for
example I will not be able to activate
or enable it there is thats part of the
HTML spec but not yet implemented and
related to video codecs you can actually
also curry which video codecs are going
to be supported on
so that's a busy API as you can see
current time you can play you can pose
and so on and that's really powerful
underneath because once you have this
exciting to JavaScript that you can
actually do real play with this media
groups where something we introduced as
part of the media xvt effort and we're a
very common use case that you want to do
is if you want to have a video
displaying and at the same time on the
side a video with sign languages and you
need both of them to be synchronized
otherwise you're going to have an issue
and media the major groups were
introduced for that so you are basically
linking several video files video
element together and once you play one
or pose one it will actually play and
cozy others as well let not supported
Italian user agent today but it has been
in this bag for the past maybe two years
something like that another thing that
you're going to see here is the sky of
addresses that I'm using to address the
video and you will see that i'm using
exactly the same video file in both of
the sources and the specs days if you
are using the same video fala queen only
downloaded twice once except that using
what we call media fragments where i
bought to address specific subtract
within the same file this is again not
something which is supported yet but
it's very powerful because you can
address both by name the specific track
or specific chapter you can also address
by a time if you want to stop the video
at the third second for example html5
does not give you a way to do that
except of course if you use javascript
but if you use media media fragment you
can actually do that directly and you
can also address in space and that on
the other hand
I don't think we're going to see
implementation of that very soon it's
very useful for the context of linking
data so gonna act I can actually talk
about a portion of the video instead of
just the entirety of the video itself
and you can see a nappy rendering of my
boss on the screen which I make fun of
sometimes so one poem that you have with
video is codex and that's headache it
has been a headache for the past 45 yrs
and it's still a little bit of a
headache nowadays so so when we started
working on html5 and you had to video
codecs at the time one was mpeg-4 and
the other one would Acura oxy aura is
becoming a little bit of a history at
this point and has been replaced by
weather which is pushed by by Google
nowadays and you can see the deployment
of those in user agent today
web M is not supported in IE you can
only support it using an extension that
that is that it's possible to install
but in general we don't expect users to
install extensions like that there was a
recent meeting in Florida with the ATF
we're basically Google has been saying
that they are going to actually weasel
it really is a license for whether that
is in line with the diversity royalty
free pattern policy and they've been
working with MPEG LA for that and maybe
a few days later nokia sent an email
saying oh by the way we're not going to
license our patents and others in terms
and we're not going to tell you exactly
the exact terms so this is still an
ongoing issue and and we are studying
looking into trying to find a solution
for that but it is not I don't see is
going to be resolved quite soon and
while it's not as much of an issue for
html5 because you have multiple sources
so it puts the burden on the author to
basically provide for all of the videos
one for them and one for mpeg-4 so that
you are guaranteed can be paid
everywhere in the case of real-time
communication that i will talk about
later where you have browser to browser
communications you do really need to
find a common codec that is supported by
both sides and that's where the pressure
is at the moment
so video is are also integrated with CSS
and that's one of the magic of the web
is we are trying to make all of those
technologies working together so you is
an example here when I have a video in
the middle that the blacks like
black-ish square and I actually unused
an opacity on it the CSS opacity on it
so it's partly a transparent and it's
within a section to which i'm using
multiple background and because the
video is transparent you can see those a
multiple backgrounds in the back of the
screen so if i play the video right
there you can see the video which is
being played while the CSS is applied so
and i'm using a resize on the section as
well so the video is going to be resized
and i'm using rounded corners because i
decided that that was fancy and the
video is being resized as i do so so
that show you how the CSS can be applied
to video element like any other elements
if i wanted to apply the transformation
on it I would be able to do so as well
of course if you get a little bit too
fancy you're going to run into
performance issues so be careful with
that but this is something that you can
do today already
another one that you can do is hope come
back here is integration with canvas so
the integration canvas is a javascript
is actually an HTML element to which you
can draw using javascript in it and you
have two api's to do that one is a 2d
API the context to the API and the other
one with the 3d API called WebGL and
both the 2d kpi and the 3d API I've
functions to capture a frame from the
video and is played within the canvas so
so you can see actually this is a draw
image for the 2d version and you have
the text image for the for the 3d
versions and again you can play with it
because it's perfectly integrated so you
don't see much here but I basically to
the same video and I'm inverting I'm
putting the left side on the right and
on the right on the left side and
duplicating each side as well as I do
this is done using javascript purely
javascript you actually don't see the
video element per se what you see is the
canvas element displaying frames coming
out of the video element instead and you
can find a lot of demos that are much
better than this one on the web today to
do that this is technology which has
been up there for quite a few years
already and it's aunt well deploy again
you know if you are too fancy with it
you're going to run into performance
issues obviously these kind of shoes is
you may not want there is not a lot of
choose cases for what I just did right
there so graphic again this time we take
the video element and we integrated with
SVG this is a video this is actually I
was doing a talk on html5 back in 2010
in Boston and a guy named Paul Irish was
sitting in the back of the room and
while I was doing my talk he was not
listening or he was listing another
I'm coding but at the end of the day
that's what he produced and it showed me
he was it was all part to show that to
me at the end of the day and I've been
reusing it since then because I think
it's a great demo and this time we are
what i did is i define a set of SVG free
trying my document so if you do a view
source all of those slides I HTML it's
one single big fly a big file by the way
if you do a view source you will see an
SVG in it which the only purpose is to
define SVG filters and I can change the
filter be by simply changing the CSS
property which is applied the filter is
applied through CSS so and you will see
that as I change the filter the filter
is automatically applied by the browser
in the in the on the video itself and
again is it down using real-time by the
web browser as well and I don't think
there is any kind of hardware
acceleration here by the way so I
despite performing
and also example that you can do with
this VG's that I like to show that is
where is it I can put it well I'll show
you two before the end don't worry about
it let's talk about captioning when we
talk about video service video there is
a video itself there is the audio and
then there is the caption caption is a
little bit more messy just in case it
was of messy enough with my bro effect
before so so we introduce text track in
2011 in HTML and Jack can be used for
captioning video descriptions in case
the person is death for example and not
and you have chapters supported the HTML
specification itself doesn't define
which captioning format must be
supported the same way I doesn't define
which video format must be supported I
doesn't define in any kind of image from
much that must be supported we have to
specification out there nowadays for
captions the first one is a time text as
a second one is webvtt and the broader
support varies because life wouldn't be
easy otherwise so let's start with the
first one pan tax is actually very old
format it started back in 2003 and to
some extent suffers from that it's
actually based on XML and xsl-fo
formatting objects it's not based on CSS
that's what it means basically it's
using a different styling language which
is not that great for what they were
protesting on the other hand it is it
support a lot of features on there
because it came out of originally it was
meant as an authoring format so that
companies can exchange captions so it
was a super subset of what capturing
language are they available to do
including CS 6 8 or 7 wait which
captioning language that you have on the
on television nowadays and and it was as
I said it was originally in the need for
authoring but it has been used on the
client side more and more flash at some
partial support for it silverlight has
some plaster out support for it and now
if you see as you can read an Internet
Explorer 10 as support for it not full
support but as some support for it as
well webvtt on the other hand was
started by a Nixon within the ypg and
then he continued the work within the
community group on web media text track
so it's not a divisive recommendation
but it is a document a specification
which is almost final actually the
community group is going to wrap up
within this summer and the goal is to
actually make it to push into the
recommendation track for it to become a
divisive recommendation and I'm guessing
it's the move is going to be quite quick
because it has been a lot of work done
on that already it's based on SRT which
is a very simple captioning format which
has been out there for quite a while but
you can apply CSS not all of the CSS we
can apply a good portion of CSS within
it as well so as a user generated for
the user generated content most often
this is what you're going to want to use
because you don't want to actually deal
with the complexity of time text the
support is in desktop browsers is it's
implemented in Chrome Safari and ie
Firefox is working on it and but has
been working on it for quite a few
months already
so what is the problem let's introduce
come complexity so we created thumbtacks
in the Dervish we seen Cindy which is a
u.s. organization for television created
a superset of it meaning z2 time text
and they had you a few feature on top of
it and they call it what is called cinti
time text if you are dealing with
television manufactured television
business know that nowadays that the
captioning format that you can hear and
the ago is to move the entire industry
to this format within the next two years
on the other hand webvtt has more
general support from the browser vendors
so we have a little bit of a discrepancy
at at the moment the FCC itself come
into play because in 2010 President
Obama sign a document saying that we
need to actually regulate how video is
actually is happening on the web from
from various aspects the FCC created a
committee called V pack which gave his
results and its ruling last year back in
April 2012 this ruling is coming into
effect in 2014 meaning you have until
2014 to comply to it otherwise users are
gonna be entitled to sue you for not
doing it and so to be clear it only
applies to video content that was
previously broadcasting on television it
has not applied for example to user
generated content which is under which
is a large part of what has been has
been on the web today what it contains a
set of requirements of what your
captioning functionality hard to be able
to do and
for the purpose of regulation it
declared cinti time text as a safe
harbor meaning that if you actually
supporting city that text we don't don't
you don't have to worry about the set of
requirements you are by definition in
the safe harbor so you are complying
with them ironically there are one of
the requirement which is not supported
by city 10 text but let's not go there
so so that's kind of situation that we
find ourselves today where we have still
report from TV industry to what's in
t-10 text we have gravity t of them
which is getting more deployed and what
we're probably going to look at is to
figure out the mapping between the two
so that the community are there figure
out how to go from one to the other
basically because you do not probably
gonna have to do that and it's not going
to be that complex that still someone
has to do it full screen because we all
want to see our video in full screen as
well so there is a document out there
written by an Adventist Iran and tantek
çelik I suit on technology today in the
room in the in the in the audience is
probably lingering around somewhere he
has a talk tomorrow morning and and
they've been working on a specification
to support full screen so the way that
you do full screen is you request full
screen from an element any kind of Dom
element in your tree which is pretty
nice so it applies to video as well but
if you want to apply it to a parent of
the video so that you can display HTML
on top of it while the video is being
displayed you can do so as well that's
pretty nice and then if you want to exit
full screen that you have to go on the
document and says I want to exit full
screen of course if i do that if i
request full screen the browser is going
to pop up a little window saying are you
allowing it or not so that the user is
not being confused in what they are
seeing on the string
the other part of it is it's adding to
sudo selectors to CSS to unlit one
pseudo element one pseudo class and the
pseudo class is actually at poly the
pseudo element the pseudo element is
called the full screen and basically it
define which CSS need to be applied to
your element when it's in full screen
mode which is pretty nice as well so you
can actually adapt to it and you have a
way to query document to figure out
whether there is evident limit in full
screen or not this is developed beyond
extensions both in chrome and firefox
possibly opera as well as well as Safari
I don't believe this supported by IE
quite yet but this is just around the
corner basically media accessibility so
if you're going to develop a website
today with video this is something that
you have to be careful with because you
may be some regulations under some
regulations including 508 and we've done
extensive work back into the in 2010
2011 to come up with a set of
requirements that needs to be support
needs to be done by the content but as
well as user agents in terms of
supporting accessibility for video and
we classified those by different ways
the type of disability that that you
have to actually deal out there which is
very often a combination of those not
just one of those the way the techniques
that are actually being used to provide
access to people with disabilities and I
was mentioning earlier as a sign
language video on the side and that's
one of the SAT one of the results and
the system requirements that we added on
top of HTML to be able to support those
that's actually very useful document to
actually look at this was a very
extensive study done by various
communities now let's move to media
capture you have a camera on your on
your device and what you want to do is
to capture they are put out at camera
within your applications that's what
media capture is doing you allow you to
capture both the image and the sound
coming out of the microphone and it's
actually pretty simple where you
actually request the functionality from
your your your navigator that's what to
get user media function is all about and
when it's ready you get a stream and you
can do whatever you need with the string
including using this create object URL
link it to a video element and displayed
on the web page itself that's how you
would do it to display it within a video
element linking your camera to your
video element one of the things that
we've been considering lately is its own
lies but what if I have two cameras on
my device which is more and more often
the case today and that's something that
we are considering one of the problem
with that is it's adding privacy
considerations because the more we can
differentiate your device on the web the
better we can tell who you are all it
needs it's 33 bits of information to be
able to uniquely identify you on the web
so if we expose how many devices you
have on your device that another bit
that can be added to that so that's one
of the consideration that we have at the
moment on how do we expose that on the
web today an example of such a thing is
this one which is running in chrome
right now and it's very simple very very
simple as you were able to see the code
earlier on the page
where as you load the page it's asking
me if I want to allow access to the
local camera and that because i'm doing
a JavaScript coal underneath underneath
to get user media so if I allow this
here we go what you see on the what you
see on the on the left of the screen is
actually the video element displaying
which I get from the local camera is not
necessarily pretty but that's it and you
know what's inside of I can also take
capture of it and display it this time
it's the actually displayed within a
cumbath next to it as well and from the
canvas I can recapture the bits and do
whatever I want with them as well so
that's a very simple example where I'm
using getusermedia I'm leaking it to the
video element and then I use a draw
image function of the canvas to get
frames out of that video element and
displays them in within the canvas that
works pretty well
all right let's go into this further
this time we want to support streaming
and be able to control the trimming
using javascript for that we are
developing api called the media source
extension and and we are actually
allowing you to add chunks of audio or
video into the video element what we
call the media pipeline so you basically
text you receiving the check that you're
receiving from you from the network
whatever you do however you do that
WebSockets normal HTTP requests or even
p2p and and you are putting those chunks
within the timeline saying this is going
to be from this second twink second and
if you of course if you do that fast
enough you're going to be able to play a
continuous video as such this is team
work in progress you can see some
surfacing implementations in chrome for
example possibly in Firefox I don't know
but it's going to be very useful so that
you can actually fine grained control
over the streaming changing the
resolution if you for example you're not
receiving the chunks fast enough to feed
the media pipeline in time so what we're
going to see is people using javascript
coming with different techniques for
adaptive streaming or live streaming and
in order to keep up with whatever the
platform is about to deliver and what
about your network is about to deliver
as well this one this DCPI is working
progress doesn't you know it's actually
not there is not a lot of controversy
around it so I expect it is going to be
deployed in all of the browsers quite
quickly within within a year you will
find it everywhere of course at least on
the desktop I don't guarantee on the
mobile thanks sometimes a little bit
longer
this one on the other end is a little
bit more controversial and you may have
heard about it already recently at least
that's the are creating media extensions
it sends also known as eme and what we
are trying to do here is far as a use
case of protected contact because there
are a lot of people out there that don't
want to make the current available for
free for everyone so making a business
out of it and they still have a use K to
be able to deliver to you this content
there is one proposal being worked on
within the consumption and that's what
Iam is about and it's an API which allow
you to link your applications to the
underlying content management system in
other words the drm which is underneath
it's very controversial for various
reasons some people do not like drm
important protection at all but also
they are challenges with with DCPI so
first is well all of those drm system
out there are opaque by definition some
extent so from a web browser to
implement this api they're going to have
to deal with those opacity start just as
easy as linking you api to the gps
device or to your keyboard for example
that's one problem the second problem is
what interoperability level do we gain
with search api do we actually make a
great improvement that justified why we
need a standard for that and why we are
owing you to interact with the
underlying system and has the key around
the problem is we don't define what's
underneath we don't define the drm
system and you do have a lot of drm
system deployed out there so to some
extent you're still gonna have to deal
with what your eminence and those
differences so the only thing that we
managed to achieve is just a little api
that actually pass that exposes us to
you but you still have to actually deal
with those values drm system underneath
and operating system do not support
exactly the same yarns
the third problem that we have with it
is the relation and that's something
that's working progress is a relation
with the other technologies I showed you
are aware that you can actually interact
with the CSS you can interact with
combat you can interact with SVG but the
problem with this API at the moment is
it doesn't give you back the frames once
it's inside the CMS there is no
guarantee that you the browser is going
to see the frame back and is that don't
see the frame back then instead the
video with directly display on the
screen then suddenly they cannot they
can no longer apply those nifty SVG or
CSS effects that you have in your page
and so in other words are going to work
is not going to work so we are looking
into those issues and last but long the
list along the sides is the fact that if
you cannot access the content anymore
weather is a video whether it's you or
even the caption how are you going to do
with assistive technologies and how is
someone who is hard of hearing for
example or simply in death he is going
to be able to plug his own system within
the drm system and that's actually not
obvious how to do that at the moment and
that's something that we intend to look
so so the controversy has been arrived
at we are working on this proposal and
that's true we are working on such
proposal we don't even publish the first
flick working draft yet and the group is
going to try to again to previous your
first bring working draft a relatively
soonish adding your first player
congrats Ozzy doesn't mean that it will
be a diversity recommendation at the end
I do believe there is still a lot of
work needs to happen and a lot of
thinking I'm not claiming we're not
claiming that this isn't one and only
option to actually address the use case
of protected content we are sternly
welcoming other proposals as well at the
moment but the fact is at the moment
that the only proposal which is on the
table so
now that you have a way to capture the
camera and the microphones you can
display it on the screen what you want
to do is I want to talk to you and video
conferencing with you and what real-time
communication is doing is giving you
access to a p2p protocol where both are
user region can talk to each other and
exchange the audio and video bit as well
this is being deployed quite rapidly as
well all of the browser vendors are very
excited to actually deploy it like less
than a month ago modular and google
announced as a women aged with which
they are first interrupt between the two
browsers I was mentioning earlier that
there is a problem of the video codec
that still a non result an unresolved
issue but this is actually very exciting
work and it's actually implemented under
flag in athletes in chrome and probably
in a nitrogen in Firefox I want you to
lock it back performance while Steve is
not listening out there o is so first
you heard Steve this morning do not use
too many videos on your website that's
the first trick for good performance but
I wanted to go a little bit beyond that
and talk about measurements and how to
save power they are not specific to
video but that techniques you can use to
figure things out the first ones our
navigational resource timing this is
work that we've been doing in the web
performance working group navigation
timing has been deployed already out
there resource timing is just around the
corner actually and navigation timing
will tell you how long it takes for your
page to load from the time the user
clicked on the link it's much better
that the window unload isn't because you
actually get real time
and resource timing is giving you the
same information but for every single
resource up to 150 i believe available
and link from your web page whether it's
an image a video a CSS an xhr hole
whatever you want you name it and there
is a list of all the resources and you
can actually scroll through all of those
resources to figure out the timing
information from those so if you are a
fine example a video with autoplay on it
you can actually calculate the precise
time where the video start playing from
the time the user clicked on the link up
to get to your page using this
technology
but let me switch to do
another one is page visibility best
visibility tells you whether the page is
visible to the user or not and once the
page is not visible to the user there is
no real point of playing the video what
you doing by playing the video on a page
which is not visible is using the cpu
and the power of the device and so very
easily you can say well when the
visibility of the document is changed
and it's become not visible to the user
anymore I can actually pause the video
and we starting again once the user can
see the page whether it's done because
it changed tab or whether the image the
window was actually minimized and the
last one but not follies you heard about
it is in the previous presentation
earlier today is the request animation
frame so that allow you to do javascript
animations at a speed which is decided
by the web browser so don't like that if
you refresh rate from your screen 60
years this is not going to be called
more often that a 16-time per seconds
basically and and indeed previous
example that I was using for canvas I
was actually using requestanimationframe
to refresh your canvas and it was a
broader calling it as offer it was
possible and also useful as well not
faster than the refresh rate of my
screen this has been deployed is
supported on all the browsers it's
waiting for me to become a divisive
recommendation when I don't do talks I
can
actually do work for some of the working
groups so with this I you so the whole
text travel of what we're looking at
right now in terms of video on the web
and and the support of course varies all
right thank you everyone
