apologize up front this is not a ruby
project okay but you can use it for
movie so it's okay so what's Hank okay
and I have to nuke you with this
buzzword block okay but I'll explain it
so Hank is an open source system for
running distributed highly scalable low
latency bachelor edible only key value
data stores all right got that out so
let's talk about what this really means
case open sources I've got the apache
license and we're developing it
completely in the open on github so
everything is available for everybody to
see and use its distributed which means
it's designed to run with dozens of
servers hundreds of clients like big
data like lots of stuff okay it's highly
scalable so it's got no single points of
failure it's easy to add new machines
when you need more capacity either in
disk space or in number of requests or
whatever so it's it's easy to grow with
your application and your data it's low
latency well we think when we say low
latency we mean low latency it's got to
be around millisecond per request for us
in order for us to meet our API time
deadlines so it's built to be really
fast that's writable only and this is
like this is a key one okay our data are
our path for data to get from our back
end to our front end can support batch
right only so we don't need random
writes and that allows us to do crazy
stuff to make it really fast and
optimized very very heavily for these
massive rights so it's not like 10
rights it's like 100 million rights
that's what we're built for and key
value so is that this is a no sequel
project if you guys are familiar with
that term our keys are byte arrays or
values of byte arrays there's no schema
at all and there's no versioning or
other stuff you might see with more
complicated no sequel projects and more
specifically like we took a brooch of
making this just as simple as possible
to fulfill like this basic
workflow so that we didn't have to worry
about supporting crazy consistency
guarantees or weird versioning systems
or time stamps or anything else it's
just fast simple key value so why do we
need this okay so this is an extremely
simplified view of what our system looks
like we have user actions and data
imports that come in synchronously or
asynchronously and they get batch
process together with just a subset of
the data we already have stored from all
of history okay and so we we've made it
so it sufficient for us to take just
that subset combine it with the new
stuff and produce this like Delta of
data that has to be served by our front
end okay and you might say well you
could do this with my sequel or
traditional techniques and that's
completely true and you can scale my
sequel I would want to say that's not
possible but what's really challenging
is this once in a while instead of doing
just a little data we do all of it now
whenever we change the way that we
analyze our gigantic datastore we throw
all of our outputs out and start over
from scratch okay and no data store we
could find could handle the volume of
just being completely refreshed once a
month once a month or every two months
or so so we built something that makes
this possible okay so let's quickly talk
about some concepts and I think everyone
here is pretty you know comfortable with
the whole relational database / my
sequel kind of world well let's compare
that to what Hank does so in a database
you have a table and Hank we call that a
domain and there's just little
differences basically like a table you
know it has columns and rows well Hank
you just have keys and values it's just
a simplified map like a hash in Ruby ok
so again very elemental in a relational
database you have databases which are
collections of tables we have that same
kind of concept in Hank and it's just
called the domain group so just an
arbitrarily like a wrapping of domains
into into groups that you're going to
use together for a particular
application so now when you get to
scaling relational databases you might
have shards okay which is where you put
the parts of the table on different
actual physical database machine is to
get more throughput or capacity or
whatever we have something very much
like that which is called the partition
you know partition in chartres pretty
much interchangeable we in the tank
terminology it's partition
and that's really important for us to be
able to grow and spread the partitions
over bigger and bigger groups of servers
as we get bigger in a relational
database you have a server and in Hank
we don't really have just one server we
have this thing called a ring which is
like a collection of servers that
together can give you like a complete
view of all the data so like it's really
clear from the ground up that this is
about like many servers working together
to accomplish your overall data serving
goal and then instead of a cluster we
have this thing called a ring group
which is obviously a group of rings so
there's kind of like a this nice
hierarchy of data and deployment that
makes it work well together so a lot of
the same concepts just with different
names and slightly different
functionality so here's that same thing
but drawn in a nice diagram which I'll
talk to quickly so this roughly reflects
kind of like our workflow and how things
happen we have all of our input data and
our existing data stored in a gigantic
Hadoop clusters so we as of last count
it's about one and a quarter petabytes
of storage and we fill it like eighty
percent it's pretty exciting so we do
our batch processing and we get this raw
output data that's like organized really
well for serving but now it sits on 400
machines it's not really convenient for
us to put it on our website right so we
have this process whereby we take this
output data and we publish it to servers
in our clothes to our front end which
are optimized for serving really really
fast small values this is where the
random access happens okay and so the
publishing it's coordinated by this
thing we call the ring group conductor
which is like a single demon who watches
for changes to domain groups as they
happen and then like tells servers to
come up and go down in sequence to get
the data out and something that's not
obvious from this diagram necessarily
but when a ring is updating it's also
not serving okay so it's really
important for us that we had like we
always found that whenever you were
updating while you're serving reads the
read performance of that shard tanks and
that's no good like if we see like a
third of our requests or suddenly taking
ten times as long our customers are
going to notice and we just can't we
can't bear that right so this system
basic
be it it I cyl AIT's the writes and
reads completely like you'll never see a
read on a server that's writing and vice
versa so then once the data is pushed
out to these servers this the leaves
that we use ooh keeper which is an
Apache project for configuration
management and locking and presents and
stuff like that really cool project it
like maps partitions disturbers for us
so that the client down here whether
it's like the website or an API or any
kind of client you might imagine can
figure out okay well I have this key
where do i go to fulfill where do i get
the value for that okay and it gets an
address goes and gets it and pulls the
data through so we've got this really
nice blocked out system so that like
everything is very predictable like the
cluster can get no down it's not a
problem the servers can go down the
cluster can still write data some of our
servers can go down in the Rings and the
clients could still get it from other
ones so we have great redundancy we have
great scalability it's a pretty awesome
system but it started to my own horn
there it's really really excite so to
get a little deeper into kind of what
this looks like and so I mentioned
partitions right so we have a domain and
it's broken up into kind of just
arbitrary groupings right in this case
there's eight partitions but in practice
we use more like a thousand right
physically imagine how big you might
want a one-day scale it too okay and
those partitions are assigned to servers
in like a static mapping because it's
not just like a random hash mob thing
it's literally whatever you want it to
be so you can make really cool
strategies for putting partitions on
servers and get really nifty results as
outcome and you can see kind of from the
lines here you can actually assign a
petition to more than one server so you
have redundancy kind of built in and
that's beyond rings like you can also
scale your capacity by putting every
partition on every server if you had to
but it's fundamental it's just a very
very very flexible system for scaling
and and and scaling sorry and then just
one deeper thing look at like I said
like art it's really important for us
that our requests are like a millisecond
to make that happen we had to work hard
like we tried like a lot of people will
say like Oh try bdb or try this flat
file or that don't do that it's not any
good okay it doesn't work out in the
long run so we had to build our own
thing
which basically is a very careful kind
of stack of some part in memory that
helps us get to where we have to go
really fast and then exactly two places
on disk that we can get to with like
minimal number of Sikhs and get exactly
what we want and like even further like
the I could go into this in depth it's
probably not that interesting but the
the cool part is that even though this
is really fast like you never do more
than two seeks to get a value which is
really quick it's also really amenable
to being merged like big Delta's that
come in because it's basically just a
big sorted flat file you just zipper
together like merge sort with small
Delta's as they come out of the Hadoop
cluster okay so basically we we get this
good mix of really fast random access
performance and really fast bash merging
performance when you put it all together
so what does when we're really proud of
this is a really cool system and it
gives us great performance in it and it
backs are api's and website and
everything so the next steps or the Hank
projects like I said I'm talking to you
guys today because we're trying to get
the word out there about how cool this
is we'd love would love external users
and contributors you know there's a lot
of people watching at that so I mean I'd
love people just to look at it so we're
on github to get a Brian duxbury Hank so
have a look it's easy to find your way
to we want to again like do more and
more performance work on it because this
is like just a fundamentally it's like
the fastest thing that needs to be the
fastener system it's a it's a crucial
underpinning of everything we do and we
think we can make it really fast like
it's fast now we think we can make it
better and something that's been really
important to us from the very beginning
is management you know when you have 200
servers running if you can't manage them
with good scripts or a good UI then
you're pretty much hosed like it's not
it's not reasonable to get in there and
individually manage 200 servers so we
have a there's like a UI already that
we're going to plan to expand massively
to give you all like you know
point-and-click features to make it all
work all right thanks guys you can
follow up with me for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
