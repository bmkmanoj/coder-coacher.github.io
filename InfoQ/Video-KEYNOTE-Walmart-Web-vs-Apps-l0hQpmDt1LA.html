Ben can't be with yes today you get the
you got the role deal there
unfortunately but I'll try and do my
best I also apologize I got a bit of a
chronic cough so I'll be drinking and
try not to splutter too much but yeah
Ben and I fairly recently joined walmart
labs to kind of run the engineering side
of mobile and to be honest if you said
to me 12 months ago you're going to end
up working for Walmart I would have been
a little bit surprised but we had to
start up just before that Walmart was a
client and we got to meet a lot of the
folks at walmart and kind of how they're
really thinking about taking commerce to
the mobile area finally you can bring
the mobile device into the brick and
mortar and do some really exciting
things before that we had our own
startup and before that we were working
at Palm so we focus a lot about the app
economy apps helping developers you know
build on our platform kind of seeing
what else is going on so we spent a lot
of time in that world and before that we
worked at Mozilla where we thought about
the open web in general we build a lot
of developer tools and ran a developer
tools lab Mozilla before that I worked
at Google thinking about api's building
the various Google API is that are out
there and before that I did various
different startup so I've kind of
thought about some of these things from
form any kind of different areas so
today we're going to kind of talk a
little bit about the web and apps it's
actually not going to be too much web
versus apps but when kind of think about
it I'm a technologist and I normally
kind of go into the details of you know
this is what this platform can do but we
took a little bit of a step back and
started to think about you know how do
we get here today we're then going to go
into the kind of different technologies
and how that kind of fits into the
business that you're running and the
technology that you're building so to
kind of start off with this going to put
up a couple of quotes and you kind of
shout out which company you think
said these quotes first one with html5
you can make as rich and experience as a
nap html5 is a beautiful thing you get
lost in the experience and forget that
you're on the web html5 makes desktop
operating system SDKs obsolete you no
longer need to develop a Windows app who
do you think you know said that what
company would kind of espouse those
things what are some Google Microsoft
Apple anyone else Walmart yeah it was
microsoft and and you know again wife
had interest in experiences with
microsoft over the years mozilla has an
opinion on some things that have
happened yo google have actually spent
some time with microsoft this isn't
about bashing Microsoft at all but I
found it very very interesting that
Microsoft will be saying those things
now to be fair they actually didn't say
that one but it's more fun to kind of
say things in threes so we put that one
in and they said they said this this
event that they held up in San Francisco
right next to Adobe's offices I think
maybe a little bit on purpose right next
to Adobe's offices because it was this
really fancy launch event and it was a
launch event of a beta it was the nicest
launch event I think I've seen and it
was for a beta Rho browser that was just
this kind of platform beta so they're
putting a lot of energy into getting
developers you know thinking about them
on the web and they built the showcase
showing these apps that are all based on
web technology and to me it's like what
this feels like an Adobe event back in
the day showing flash technology
incredibly rich experiences and they had
this kind of A to Z of 24 different apps
that kind of worked with different
partners for all using web technology so
they're obviously putting in a lot of
thought into this this web thing right
now so I joked about how we made this
one up and we did make it up but then
after we made this up they actually came
and said it and they said it
in relation to windows 8 and I was
actually at a conference a very very
developer centric conference and hiding
out in that conference for that weekend
was a product manager for the SDK team
and we were out one night at one of the
events and get to know that this is a
windows you know OS SDK product manager
what what are you doing here with a
bunch of JavaScript guys and she's like
well you know things things are changing
a little bit kind of kind of see what
happens with the next version of windows
and you know we've seen that the web is
a core part of their strategy so we're
seeing all of this and it's kind of like
again why is Microsoft betting so much
on the web I thought I knew Microsoft
they had the two worlds of Windows and
Office and everything they did was about
powering those worlds powering that
business and it was kind of the devil
you know there's something nice about
knowing what a company is all about I
find that as a developer myself I want
to work on platforms where I kind of
understand where the owner of the
platform is going if I don't understand
that I don't understand my future as
well so it's been a little bit confusing
to kind of think about what that means I
mean these are the guys that came out
with silverlight hardly embracing the
web came out with their own plugin so I
started to look back a little bit back
into these days and thought about you
know what was the web and the experience
is like back then so this is what the
web looked like this is wired you know
all about design Apple has been known to
kind of think about design not exactly
the sexiest most beautiful experience
out there call web companies like yahoo
kind of drab Disney Disney incredibly
flashy and fancy and not exactly
fantastic Google looks like so again
Larry had built it themselves looks like
some engine is nice and cute but as far
as getting to these experiences what
will be competing with back then to get
an app to get an experience this is what
you had to do you had to go to some
store and find this dude
and I excuse me can I get this shrink
wrap software and know if anyone
recognizes that's mr. ottoman self Lord
what's-his-name very much into it there
you go thanks that's what you had to do
to get software and you had this lovely
install screen that would come out and
could do anything it wanted to your
machine including installing viruses and
malware and everything else to web but
nature had a very nice sandbox so even
though things are a little bit ugly back
then they gave us a lot distribution
matters so this web thing starts to take
off what does Microsoft do they bundle a
browser and try and kind of you know
build maybe a little bit of a monopoly
around that they build plugins that tie
into their system so even today if
you're in South Korea and such you can't
use a bank without having an activex
plugin and then they start to tell this
new presentation foundation as a way to
say look you could build beautiful
things over here not those ugly websites
so they actively go against the web and
try and you know bead it off as it
starts to starts to grow and ironically
some people think that if they kind of
focus their efforts on actually you're
embracing things they had a lot of
amazing assets and and they could have
you know come alone and done some great
things anyway so okay so that's how they
start to kind of attack the first you
know web 1.0 era but then what happens
we get Ajax and web to point out and we
get it coined as this thing Ajax I'd she
ran a blog called a Jackson calm and was
giving talks about dynamic websites that
no one would attend until the this term
was coined and then suddenly everyone
wanted to learn about this a jack thing
it was about this you know little piece
of technology the ironically Microsoft
built themselves as part of the outlook
online team xmlhttprequest and that's
kind of what Ajax was about people
thought wow we finally don't have to
refresh the whole damn page in we in our
experience but what to me it was you
know in some ways more more interesting
was the way the design has got more
involved as you could do these retreats
appearances you could do interesting
things so designs went from you know
things that won't thought of to a little
bit more polish so if we take a look at
where we were before with the yahoo days
we now have something that's a lot more
well-designed apple chains just a touch
you know beautifully designed every
little things are really thought of
Disney incredibly rich experience now
Google was kind of the same but you know
little touches they went even simpler
which is impressive this is my calendar
software back in the day beautiful now
it really is so again this Ajax
revolution web 20 microsoft is going to
get really am bored here and no they're
going to try and kill it again with
silverlight you don't want that stuff
you want to have this plug-in model we
can do better things come come join our
world along with silverlight they do IE
7 iaea basically nothing right they got
that team the IE team move them over to
presentation and these other worlds the
avalon themes and stuff and the team
that's left with IE is kind of a
skeleton team that the you know really
does not do much according to the web
okay then we have these browsers that
come about that are really really
incredibly powerful they're actually
real runtimes so this is where I again
I'm a web guy at hard in a lot of ways I
think this is why ie9 is the big play
for Microsoft they're getting killed by
chrome and to some extent the other
browsers they have to step up so they
don't lose the web through my lens and
the browser lens this is why i thought
the ie9 was the kind of big bet for
Microsoft but then took another kind of
little bit of a step back and realized
that there was a whole parallel world
going on there was this massive
explosion and that's the app explosion
so thanks to two good old iphone we got
this just massive infusion of
applications that could do really great
things the one
stuck in the world of carriers and the
like that we won't use it and all of
these apps are beautiful and amazing
they're phenomenal applicant well not
really but some of them are you know the
the BB poopy ones of all of those apps
there's some really great apps that can
you know change the way that the you do
things and then there's you know some
absolute like this but regardless of
what you think about all these I have to
put this in because at Palm we didn't
have that many apps so we have to kinda
it's all about the quality of the apps
and so the app economy is you know three
billion five billion now whatever it is
it's incredibly large an important
economy that came over night came from
nothing and then a palm we talk to
developers that would do this kind of
math with us that say okay three billion
sighs the app economy I'm a friggin
ninja when it comes to code in I'm going
to build this crappy little I'm going to
make a million bucks I'm going to be
rich on this little crappy app we get
those guys and then we get these guys
they would say okay three billion
there's a whole ton of apps out there
that's going to be what I make ohé cost
quite a bit to actually build the app oh
no I'm actually going to lose a lot of
money developers are not making money at
all and of course it's you know very
much like all the other businesses that
are out there apps a very much like
content of course there's a lot of app
actors in Hollywood that are you know
serving you meals but the ones that kind
of make it you're really making the same
thing music and everything else so absa
content content production is a hits
business and that's just kind of the way
it is so that's a huge so now we've got
this web thing that's kind of taken off
browsers are doing amazing things on the
platform we've got this app explosion
that happens kind of out of nowhere
because of iphone and then everything
else that happen around that and you
really think about it these these words
they're not kind of they're not separate
they're not going on their own path they
collide and we started to kind of really
think about that when we started to see
some of the apps that were coming out
and you look at some of these app
and you've got traditional web companies
but you say that's web DNA eBay Amazon
Google you know Facebook Yelp and you
look at these experiences there are lot
nicer than the web sites and so
something you see wow they're really put
in a lot of effort into these
applications this is a little bit
worrying as a web guy that they're kind
of going beyond experience wise what you
can get on the web there then we also
started to see things like this guy this
is Joe Hewitt he worked on the original
Firefox team he built Firebug this
amazing tour the day to help you debug
your applications in the web then he
went to Facebook and he built the iphone
app we had a lot of our friends from the
web space going over to this whole other
world and this was really worrying again
with with the web had on fortunately now
he's back he left he left facebook after
being there for you know a few good few
years and he's now working on on the web
platform again but we saw a lot of kind
of bleed from the web world to the apps
world was also interesting to us was
when you dig into the mobile web and the
applications here's one example of Delta
at the top we've got their iphone app
every step of the way it's a really
really nice experience great transitions
every scene is well thought of and then
you get to the mobile website the first
thing you get is I just want to check
some flight status I've got a mobile
modal popup this is get the app you
don't want to be here this sucks get the
app you don't go away then you fight
that to actually get to do something and
then you're on a screen that's okay but
then as soon as you go one level deep
it's just a morass of just the stuff
that's out there now technically there
is absolutely no reason for that but
what happened was that up in the mobile
app world that often be a new team it
would be a totally different group they
didn't have you know any legacy
constraints in the same way and we also
saw this in different context when Adobe
AIR kicked off we spent some time with
the ebay team that did this really nice
rich desktop client for ebay and these
guys would kind of be in tears a little
bit because you go like well but your
website is awful like you've built this
beautiful thing
they're like we can't change a pixel we
change like the color and we get two
million people shouting at us like it's
just incredibly frustrating so the whole
app world gave people kind of a new
canvas to play with new things and come
out with interest in things we saw that
in the tablet world where Twitter came
out with this really interesting new
take on the experience so it's very much
instead of just being kind of a list of
stuff it's a layered experience i go
through i personally use Twitter a lot
it's kind of a link bloggy type thing I
want to read things I'm not being sent
out of the app and coming back and forth
it's giving me the content that I want
with in my experience again you've got
these multiple layers it's beautiful to
touch it's just a fun kind of laid-back
experience and you know what happens
when expectations get changed just like
the day that Google Maps came out
mapquest sucked right the day it came
out it's at the day before map versus it
gave you directions you can do stuff but
the day a better experience comes out
your expectations are wrote risen and
you can't go back again and so you're
having a great time with this this
Twitter iPad up and then you go to the
website you know man it's it doesn't
have any dimensions to it it's just a
list of 140 characters with some links
that kind of fire you off and so you see
in these apps are these great
experiences and the websites it kind of
ant keep it up now what's exciting to me
on the website is that we are seeing
catch up so we saw the new Twitter that
some people like and some others don't
but they're very much kind of drawn from
the tablet experience and kind of
brought that over to the website it's
still Webbie it's not trying too much to
be happy which I think a lot of people
actually do and they've also done the
same thing on the mobile website there's
a consistency of how it feels between
the app and the site itself it's a lot
richer it's very much kind of rich
client itself it's not just giving you
back web pages we're kind of seeing this
nice conversion between these these
different worlds another thing that was
happening with the app explosion as well
as seeing people
ebay and Google and the leg doing doing
apps over there we've seen companies
going directly to apps so we've got
Flipboard with a great experience we've
got color with I still don't know what
they do but a path there's another one
there like these these guys just
skipping the web entirely and going
straight to apps and we keep hearing
more and more about you know stats
around how large the app economy is and
how many people are on the web versus
within their apps and it's a very large
amount still on both sides but there's
this big kind of you know thing going on
between the web and the apps now I used
to work up palm and an HP and the old to
CEOs ago now which is amazing where's
this big thing said we didn't buy a palm
just to be in the smartphone business we
had to add this just to he didn't say
that and so everyone in the press
started kind of going around like they
don't want to be in the phone business
but what he really meant i think is we
don't just want to be in the smartphone
business the reason that they bought
palm was because they saw this kind of
convergence on a canary
consumer-friendly operating system and
webos was akin to what you could do with
iOS and the like and we've seen the
beginnings of that with mac OS and lion
and iOS we're just starting to see you
know kind of little pieces look and feel
the odd thing gestures and the like but
it definitely seems like we're very much
can converging our desktop and our
mobile experiences it's going to be
interesting to see so after all that at
first I thought Microsoft was kind of
going off on this crazy we love the web
thing because of competition from the
browser's they knew they had to kind of
compete with chrome and the like but
then after really thinking about this
app explosion that happened in parallel
and the collision course that these guys
are on it seems to me that it's pretty
obvious that that's actually the reason
why they're in this weird position where
they've still got a very strong you know
position with their with Windows but
they know that the consumer world and
the iOS one the Android world is kind of
where the future is and they don't want
to get left behind
and they should know this because
they've seen it all before and in fact
it's kind of their their playbook if you
go back to the desktop era there are a
whole slew of different desktop
platforms this is just a couple of them
that middle ones anyone know without
that middle black one is the Sinclair
spectrum yes rubber keyboard awesome
hair follicles go in you can just wipe
it off fantastic little guy that's the
first first computer i programmed on
back in the day but there's this you
know real kind of vibrant ecosystem
where people very passionate about their
amigas and their Ataris and all these
different things how did Microsoft get
away with things they got away with
things because of the the apps and the
office franchise and things of that
nature they ran away because of the
applications if you look at the
different operating systems that are out
there this is just a couple you could
easily argue that they were superior in
many many ways but it was the app thing
that took the took over if you don't
have my great ABS I need to share and
collaborate with I don't care if this
thing looks better it's got a slightly
different user experience that's
actually not what matters the apps
really do matter and so all of these
guys died apart from apple and it's
interesting how they are they kind of
came back now when that happens and you
have this monopoly obviously the leader
goes and just keep pushing and building
amazing amazing operating systems that
we will just love and rip no you get in
the lead and you kind of go as slow as
you possibly can a lot of the time you
don't have the same kind of competitive
urge to push you on and so that's how we
ended up with things like Windows ME we
don't want to be in that world where
there's just one choice and they're kind
of dictating the pace so okay so
Microsoft one things on the app's war
but then how how did they lose that well
you know they had all of these apps you
send those are really important what
happened I would argue that the web
happen and the web totally changed the
game because it gave us the
basically a virtual machine into these
different experiences and as long as
this machine ran on different operating
systems you'd get access to this amazing
interconnected world so suddenly all of
that office productivity stuff that's
not what I want I want to be able to
Google all of the information that's out
there I want to see you know what's
going on with my friends and get access
to all of this great stuff and this is
what people wanted these were the
experiences that people cared about not
their office productivity suite so just
like that over the course of a few years
what people cared about you know
drastically changed and that's why I
think you know kind of windows lost out
interestingly this is why I think Apple
could come back two things happen one
Microsoft did that big thing where Bill
Gates and Steve Jobs get up there and
bill gave you know Apple a bunch of
money and wrote office for their
platform we also saw a lot of you know
VMware type solutions to run Windows
apps within the Mac but really it was
all about the web and you look at how
Steve when he first came back in what
did he comment about he named everything
I for internet I Mac this is the
computer that's the best possible
computer for getting you on the internet
because that's what matters right now we
don't have the best apps Apple didn't
have the best herbs they didn't have
many apps who cares this is the new
thing that you need and that's kind of
what what kept them in the game okay so
now let's talk a little bit more about
the technology there's all these
different you know platforms that are
out there and a lot of us are trying to
choose you know what platforms do we
work with how do we make those choices
you know what are we going to do what
can these things do one big thing that
you have to think about is you know the
money side of things depending on what
you care if you care about reach or do
you care about money what platforms do
you want to target for that reach are
the things that you're building these
kind of immersive experiences this is
one example where it doesn't really
matter what it looks like it's kind of
the same experience across all the
platforms or do you want to build some
is very much tied to the particular
platform you're on are you building kind
of a casual game and you're working in
the game space or are you building a
really amazing powerful you know you
know game that needs a lot more out of
the platform so there's all these things
that you have to think about when it
comes to what platforms you're going to
choose to talk about money for a second
you're on the web people like Google
want you to make money by doing this
take this beautiful experience and put
some script code that's going to put
some random app random add in your
experience you look at something like
really like this is going to show up in
the middle of my experience probably not
not what you want a lot of the time and
there's obviously different ways that
you can you know do things with ads
different platforms and the like but
that's the way people a lot to think
about monetizing on the web of course
that's not the only way a lot of people
do it in very very straightforward way
which is I'm going to provide value and
I'm going to charge my customers for
that value so we have a lot of
subscription services and the like that
are all doing very very well based on
that very very simple model but they're
also going kind of you know beyond the
web a lot of times right now we've got a
lot of great services that the keep
things simple the base camp example of
just building something you're very
minimalistic you know minimal amount of
value that people care about putting it
up as a relatively cheap monthly
subscription can do very well this car
does anyone know who owns that car yes
dhh the guy that created rails we're
actually at a conference in in Denmark
and there's a car magazine and it showed
that this was the the car that he'd kind
of you know I've got handmade and
obviously not a not a cheap car so you
can do very well in these models now the
advantage that we have now is of course
we have these great app stores they're
curated yeah there's a there's a simple
way my mom knows to click on the app
thing and that's where I get apps and
they can go through and they know
oh that they get in something of
reasonable quality or at least been
checked and there's this great curated
experience the web's trying to copy that
we have things like the Chrome Web Store
Mozilla's trying to do this federated
store that allows you to not be kind of
stuck to one particular store experience
and the like but that's a really kind of
long-term tough thing to pull out it's
always really hard to do things in in an
open way of us is having a closed stack
and frankly you look at the economics
you know the Chrome Web Store
top-selling app 30 thousand dollars and
even on just the mac app store number
six best-selling app million dollars in
20 days so it's kind of a hard sell to
to go purely on the web through the app
store model people aren't used to doing
them they're not used to buying apps in
that way yet at least so that's kind of
a that's awful um then we have
subscriptions and the ability to get
virtual goods and all of this kind of
stuff um I remember one meeting back in
the palm days with this guy who came in
and he he worked on kind of the first
freemium iphone games like he got him
right at the beginning and he talked
about how he do these social experiments
were on this one game you had to buy
certain things to kind of get to these
different levels and one week he doubled
the price of all of these widgets every
single day to see what the conversion
rate will drop off there would be there
was no drop off he would double the
price it didn't matter there was one
point in the game you had to spend
fifteen thousand dollars or something
insane to complete the game and he had
people completing it like it's like the
reptilian brain the gambling side I
don't know what it is but people are
obsessed with with you know paying money
that way and then we have you know
different kinds of in-app you know
pieces it's a park here it's a buck
there who cares I don't even you know
see it I've got subscriptions through
newsstand and other applications and so
there's all these different ways to kind
of monetize so you a lot of people think
app stores awesome they're great that's
where the money is
obviously I'm going to do iOS and
Android natively important thing is to
kind of take apart the business side
from the technology side so there's
technology this is one example an open
source project called phonegap the
company just got bought by Adobe happen
at max a couple of weeks ago that'll
eight enables you to build using web
technology and get it deployed across
all these different platforms so you can
take your web app and put it into all
these different app stores so you can
split apart the technology it's great
for very immersive things like these are
examples looks very much like kind of a
rich iOS application and a nice trend
the we're seeing is that you know the
initial kind of iOS apps all look very
similar they look kind of like the core
apps using UI kit in very simple ways
now it's changing people are
experimenting more much richer
experiences and that enables you to kind
of break out on the technology side
there's another example very immersive
casual games it's perfect for that you
build this game is now in all the app
stores you don't have to choose now if
you're building something incredibly
rich like this guy it's not it's not
quite as easy so here you have to kind
of go to the bone luckily in the gaming
world there's a rich heritage of
building things in C++ and being able to
compile them across through these
different guys so yeah we benefited from
that upon we have this thing called the
PDK which basically let us take all of
the games that came out of the iOS world
from large renders get the you know EA
guys to come along recompile something
and you're good to go so you can now get
all of these different guys and
automatically get them over to all of
these platforms so you can do a lot of
cross-platform through a much lower
level world and then there's you know
particular platformers for things like
gaming so rich games you have to think
totally differently when it comes to the
immersive experiences and casual games
that's when you can think about you know
do I want to use the web to go
cross-platform or do I want to use
native technology so let's talk about
the web a little bit and some of the
advantages that I see
let's start with with cross-platform
leverage we started too early early on
in the iOS world see examples like this
this is one of the better examples of
building an iOS app using web technology
you first kind of blink it and it looks
like an iOS app then you start to see oh
yeah that lenox hotel that's that's a
web page you start touching these
different things you don't get the same
feel and it's just it's kind of this
uncanny valley you're trying to build
something that looks and feels like that
platform in a different technology it's
incredibly hard to pull that off as much
as I love the web that's not the way I'm
going to go probably for my experience
because I know the users are going to
kind of feel like something's not quite
right and the advantages that you kind
of naturally think I build your using
the web and it just works on all these
platforms we started to see one speed
what you tried to do it it's not quite
it's not going to quite give you
everything you want so here's one
example of someone saying hey we tried
to do that using these different
technologies we've actually found
there's all these bugs doing web staff
within all these different platforms
trying to mimic the underlying operating
system is incredibly hard that she takes
more effort than just splitting up the
team and having them use the low level
technology for that particular platform
is well documented is well tested let's
not try and get too fancy we see that
again and again I think there's much in
that there's room for a hybrid solutions
facebook i think is a fantastic example
you take a look at that and that
instantly looks like the Facebook
newsfeed it's the brand that you know
about could you tell me if that's the
iOS app Android app or the mobile
website you can't because it's the same
that core component uses web technology
the experience is totally different
depending on the platform on the website
it's very much a vertical scroll and
experience that's what people used to
within the browser on the left hand side
it's very much an iOS experience they've
built this nice hybrid solution and I
think that makes a ton of sense so you
can know it now make
changes on the web and that experience
is going to be reflected throughout the
entire application so they've got some
really decent leverage in a place that
actually makes sense another great
example that just came out recently with
the new linkedin app we know the the
mobile guys over there we work a lot
with them we actually build our stuff on
a very similar stack a lot of open
source software this is the iphone
application on the left-hand side it's
very very rich those different you know
things are in those those four blocks
are live things if you go and scroll and
then hit home quickly you'll see in
those little windows it's still
scrolling it's a very very nice rich
experience that you'd expect on iOS now
put it side by side where the left which
is the mobile web experience and the
right hand side which is the Android
experience and it looks very very
familiar and consistent but it has
differences where it makes sense the
platform takes over where it doesn't
make sense it's all the same web
technology so they can build all of that
stuff once and have it kind of work
throughout again it makes sense to have
this web and app versus web versus up so
we come to walmart and we've got these
different platforms to target we've got
a mobile website everyone loves to talk
about the apps and the sexy stuff the
mobile website drives way the most
traffic and purchases and everything
else that's the nature of things you do
searches for something search on Google
Walmart happens to have cheap prices you
link over and you're immediately buying
something because of that we really
thought about how do we want to be
different in our mobile website versus
our applications it's very easy and we
made this mistake at the very beginning
to kind of say we're going to compete
with the apps the web is so great now as
a runtime we're going to make it all
these amazing things just like the apps
once you start to do that though you
realize that it may actually be the
wrong move so for example if you send me
an email that has a link to a tweet and
I tap on that tweet and it goes to the
new mobile experience what I is a user
at GC is I see some
I see a little spinner and then
eventually it's loaded the app it's gone
back and I see the final data that's the
thing I actually wanted show me that
right away same thing for us with
products if you go and do a search
somewhere for a product get linked into
the mobile web version of that on
walmart I want to give you the product
information right away and then I can
load the experience around it so what
were you doing more on the mobile
website is focusing on using all the
great new stuff with the web and making
it incredibly fast and responsive that's
our focus let people be task oriented
they're going to come in from anywhere
through links I really enable that the
apps everything's Prince tool that can
be the chrome that's where we can kind
of go deeper it's a deeper relationship
you've installed it that's where we're
doing a lot more of our in-store stuff
there are actually very very different
experiences and we're kind of treating
them as very different but we are
sharing a lot of code and a lot of
technology here's an example of iphone
app we got a cart that you fill out you
had stuff to your cart and then you go
in and you check out the left-hand side
is native technology and the right-hand
side is pure web technology the user
can't even really tell so we have done
the whole skinning thing and I'm really
worried of doing the skinning but in our
case and this example check out is a
very simple thing we're not we're doing
it within the shell of the different tab
bars and the like we're not mimic in any
of that so all we have to mimic is like
the button and that's fine so we share
that that check out code and the card is
card is the same this is the Android
version that right hand side is exactly
the same code but it looks like the rest
of the Android app all of this can be
changed to the dime on our server side
by side same code looks different
depending on the particular platform you
then take that to the ipad right here
the whole fool for low prices thing you
see a little arrow you can swipe that
around and just to the right you see all
these products that's all web based we
update those products based on you know
who you are what you
looking at all that kind of stuff that's
all updated through a website the card
and checkout experience just like the
iphone app this car happens to be native
but once you check out and you get over
to that side of the wall it's all web
technology using the same code base as
all the other platforms we can even do
tricks because we have this native
bridge that allows us to give control to
the platform or the web they speak
bidirectionally similar to how phone
phonegap com work what that means is if
you kind of flip through your checkout
flow you see how it looks like it's
carbs there's a car just to the left and
the like kind of like webos as you go
through these cards can kind of whiz by
in the back end it's actually just one
web view and we kind of do different
tricks to take a copy of the screen put
it there and move the web view over the
user has no idea to them it looks like
these different screens the platform can
do what makes sense for that platform so
sometimes android is keeping to web
things an iphone is doing more things
natively and we just have an easy
contract so these guys can talk to each
other you want it there's a store
locator as part of the checkout flow
that launches the native maps within the
application it doesn't try and do Google
Maps through the web this gives us the
freedom to do the right thing for the
experience and you know again that's a
comparison that's it the exact same code
base looks drastically different on a
particular platform our business is
check out it can't go down we can't wait
for Apple you know to get a new update
in there we need to be able to change it
and do a bbbj testing all these
different things so we'll talk about
another little niche thing on the gaming
side is this thing called impact j/s
what I really love about them is you
build your app using canvas API is
standard ap is but what he's done
because on iphone is now accelerated
that world yeah iOS 5 does on stuff he's
mapped it to open G oh yes so it works
amazingly well on iOS but you write to a
standard API that's what I want as a
developer I don't want to be locked into
a particular vendor I want to write the
standard api's and have
those things map down that's another
great way to build a game that works
across websites and different platforms
and it can be optimized but the code
itself is exactly the same so there's a
lot of cross-platform leverage but
beware of just saying I'm just going to
use the web and I'm going to ignore the
native stuff because the experience just
is not there yet live distribution
incredibly important app stores are
great it's great way to get your stuff
out there but you don't want to be
beholden to it especially if you're a
web company like Facebook this is etsy
they're pushing out new versions 25
times a day there's this whole new world
of continuous deployment where you're
checking code and things get tested and
soon as it's ready it's out of the door
and there's no system in even hidden the
button it just gets out there it doesn't
work in the app store model at all so
what are you going to do that with the
web you can get that model back
mentioned we got this new site function
sauce which is a just a little community
blog thing the first feature that we did
was all about Netflix and how they use
html5 and they do this full a be testing
and so when you log in they'll put you
in a totally different cell and empower
a totally different experience depending
on the cell that you're in so they can
just do testing all day long across all
their user base and then they can take
in the information on how many things
you watched and whatever they're
measuring and then they can use that to
make their product better then they
can't do that if they're in the world of
an app store in the same way that's live
distribution URLs to me and kind of what
the real magic of the web it's not about
HTML or JavaScript it's all about URLs
we have this amazing loosely coupled
system that allows us to write an app
that works with your app without us
talking to each other and it's fantastic
now it does mean that you don't always
know what's on the other side but as you
build these experiences it's just a
fantastic advantage that you get on the
web is to kind of work and they don't
have to force someone to download an app
the experiments the experience goes with
that you
RL versus having to have the application
that's a real big advantage the web has
a fantastic ecosystem so there's a ton
of open source staff as a ton of you
know vendors out there that are really
kind of competing and pushing the bar
sometimes this is frustrating a lot of
developers don't like the fact that
there's this kind of paradox of choice
but there is a really interesting
ecosystem that's out there and that kind
of ties into the souther thing that
we're seeing at the moment which is
JavaScript end-to-end so the way we've
built our software is that we have a lot
of things running everything running is
client-side JavaScript CSS HTML it's not
web pages that get built we deliver the
application and you're running the
application so it feels responsive just
like a nap but what about the server
side we now with things like nodejs and
if you're in the Java well this thing's
like Ringo that allow you to work there
with JavaScript on top of Java you could
build take all of that logic the same
models the same business logic and run
that on the server so one example of
what we do with with function source
it's kind of hard to read it doesn't
matter if you are on a rich client
you're on the nice version of Chrome
Firefox ie and you go to function source
com you do a view source that's it all
it is is just a whole bunch of
JavaScript from then on it builds the
experience for you all of the clicks
there's no page turns or any of that
stuff it's all the app is totally
downloaded but we're a blog we have
content if Google comes to this it's not
going to know anything of the content
will never be inside being a google
search result so when Google hits us or
maybe a low-powered mobile device we
render the full page for that particular
URL the key thing is that the code is
exactly the same because of nodejs
because of the fact that it's you know
totals all the way down the server is
able to act like this client run exactly
the same code base and it just has an
extra step of serializing its structure
and sending that down I think this is
really really going to be interesting
kind of in the next couple years how
people use this another example when I
talked about
how if you come to a URL to a product on
the mobile web I want to show you the
product we could do that with this
technology the same client that we have
download we can say he's coming directly
to a product serialized that HTML and
send it right to him immediately and
then go ahead and download the rest of
the application I think we can do a lot
for mobile responsiveness which is what
people care about so there's a lot of
great things that html5 gives you and of
course the native world gives you a lot
of great things too so they're GUI tool
kits are better than what the web has
right now they've got amazing tools that
are a lot better in many ways efficiency
performance all of that kind of good
stuff you don't have to do this whole
bridge layer you don't have that paradox
of choice so there's big differences
between these these app platforms but we
really think that it's not about apps
versus webs it's about kind of bringing
the right technology together depending
on what you're building I think there's
a massive amount of room for this hybrid
situation that you know we're very much
focused on and the work that we're doing
and we're seeing a lot of other people
in the industry that gives you the
leverage give you the powers from the
different platforms without giving up
any of the disadvantages thanks for
