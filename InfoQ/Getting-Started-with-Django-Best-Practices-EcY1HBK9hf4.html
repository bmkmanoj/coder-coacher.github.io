instructor here at Maracana and I'm
coming to you from Americana studios
today I'd like to talk to you about the
Django tutorial and best practices in
setting up your django environment one
of the great things about being a Jenga
developer is the awesome docks and that
includes the tutorial if you're like me
and hundreds about the developers you
probably got your start by going through
the Django tutorial but if you've gained
a little bit of experience you may have
noticed that the tutorial doesn't always
follow best practices and describing how
to set up your project and install
Django itself so today I'd like to give
you a couple of examples that'll make
your life easier when you create new
projects with Django so the first
example of the best practice that I'd
like to give you is installing Django
itself if you got your start on the
tutorial you'll notice that the tutorial
assumes that you've got Django installed
already and if you actually followed the
link in the documentation to installing
Django you'd notice that the the first
way they recommend you install Django is
to download the zip file with the
version of Django you want and run the
setup that included setup pi file that's
definitely not the best way to do it and
I'll kind of explain the benefits of
using a couple of other tools to manage
your Django installations but I'd like
to show you by example so I'm at my
console and I'm in an empty folder I
want to use a tool called virtual em and
I can install virtual em with easy
install easy install ships with setup
tools if you've got Python installed on
a Mac or Linux you've already got easy
install if you're on Windows you might
have to download the setup tools
installer yourself and you can find that
at pi PI Python org just search for
setup tools and download the windows
installer so I'm using the command easy
install to install virtual end and
you'll notice I've already got it
installed on my box if I didn't it would
download and install it I'm going to use
the installed virtual end command to
create a new virtual environment I'm
gonna call it Django and you'll notice
what that did is created a brand new
Python executable in Django /bin slash
Python I look at my current directory I
have a new directory called Django and
Django is going to be a virtual
environment it'll contain
Python modules instead of my global site
packages new code that I install with
easy install will end up in my virtual
end also as a binary folder so that
programs that I install I can live there
instead I can
can activate a virtual environment
noticing I had the previous one still
activated I can activate a virtual my
using the source command under bash and
running a script called activate if
you're on Mac this would be the same way
if you're on Windows activate is
actually a batch command so you just
running a Windows batch file but when I
run the script you'll notice that my I
prompt changes and it reflects the
virtual environment that's currently
activated and if I check to see what
Python would run right now you notice
instead of the globally installed Python
executable is a Python executable that's
in my Jango subdirectory so now if I use
easy install again I don't need to use
sudo because I'm not going to install
something globally I'm gonna install
locally into this particular virtual end
and I want to install Jango let's just
make sure Django is not installed
okay I have no Django so I'll use the
easy install command to install Django
and let's install version 1.3 1.4 was
just released but let's say I still want
to use 1.3 and easy install goes to pipe
I the cheese shop there posit Ori for
Python packages finds the Django page
points itself to the Django community's
hosting downloads the appropriate
version and is running the setup by
itself but it's installing it in my
local site packages folder now if I run
my Python command to import Django it
runs without error and you can also see
if I say which Django admin PI so the
utility script that we use to create new
projects it's not a globally installed
Django admin again it's just installed
in a subdirectory so let's go ahead and
start a project
and I'll call it example now why would
we want to use this method of
installation
instead of globally installing Django if
I wanted to run two different versions
of Django for instance 1.3 and the
brand-new 1.4 to test out my project and
I globally installed Django I can only
have one version at a time
some virtual ends lets me kind of
effortlessly switch between an installed
set of libraries and the second practice
I wanted to discuss that the tutorial
kind of glosses over is the project
itself and I go into the project I just
created and look at my settings dot py
file
your settings file has a variety of
places where the documentation
recommends using an absolute file path
so for instance if I want to use an
SQLite database I can come down and
specify SQLite 3 as my database engine
and then I'm supposed to specify a
absolute path to a database file to use
like that I'm gonna make my manage p/y
executable and run sync DB and see if
they can see my database sync DB and I
won't bother to install a user right now
and if you'd look where I specified
there's the database file it's created
and it's actually important to use
absolute pads in a variety of places
your template der setting use absolute
pads your media various of your media
settings use absolute pads your SQLite
database string is supposed to be an
absolute path but it's kind of
unfriendly to specify to hard-code in a
path that's specific to my machine in my
settings file what if I'm working with
another developer and want to share my
project if his sister her file setup
isn't exactly like mine that the project
wouldn't run so another common best
practice in your settings file is to
take advantage of the Python magic
variable underscore underscore file
underscore underscore it looks like this
and Python includes this in every Python
module and it's the absolute path to the
currently executing file so that's
almost what I want and a little bit of
manipulation from the OS module should
get me what I want
so the u.s. top pastor named function
will get me the directory portion of a
absolute file name and ABS path makes
sure that I'm actually getting an
absolute path and given this new
variable I've created called der
anyplace in my settings file that I'm
supposed to use an absolute path you can
use door instead and probably a better
practice would be to use I stop path doc
join to join my file components in a
cross-platform way so I'll do that and
delete the database that I created and
run sync DB again to make sure that I've
got everything right
and you'll notice this time I've got it
created in the current directory but in
a platform-independent way this is this
is best practice for Django settings
files and this means that another
developer can use my project without
having to tweak all the paths and I've
encourage you to use this for your
database settings if you're choosing to
use SQLite for for your development but
also look at your template der settings
for instance the comments suggest
absolute paths that are strings like
home HTML Django templates again if we
can know the relative position of our
template ders we can do things like this
instead and I suppose again to be
cross-platform I should use the OS stop
path that join to put together my file
components so any place in my settings
file that I'm using absolute path I'd
rather use my constructed d'oeuvre area
below
so that's just two examples and there's
a few more it's worth looking at
things like your URLs file suggest that
you hard code in the project name and
that's a that's a bad idea it's worth
looking at the practices recommended in
the default project and app creation of
Django and in the tutorial with a
somewhat critical eye best practices
will make your life a lot easier if
you're collaborating with other
developers or if you're writing if
you're writing your code for somebody
else's consumption the Django
documentation is great and I'm not
actually criticizing the tutorial but if
you do follow these best practices
they'll make your life easier
particularly if you collaborate with
other developers or if you intend to
write more than one Django project or
application thanks for watching and be
sure to check out our web site for more
great content I hope to see you in class
