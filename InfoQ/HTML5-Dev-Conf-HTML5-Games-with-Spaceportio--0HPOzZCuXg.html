and i am the founder of space portillo
formerly known as siblings and i'm here
to talk about html5 and gaming the
potential promise and the real-life
problems of making html5 games today so
to begin with I want to start by saying
I'm only going to be talking about
mobile from the perspective of gaming
html5 is about the mobile browser if we
look at growth of where is where are the
users the last big event in gaming was
social gaming which largely means
facebook facebook is now up to zero
point eight billion active users mobile
is going to completely destroy that
number it is projected to be 2 billion
smartphone users by the end of 2015 with
extremely large percentage of them
playing games the number the growth
curves for facebook have already sort of
plateaued so this is where the future
growth is in virtual goods markets and
so html5 becomes a very interesting way
to potentially reach that market there's
a couple of problems the first is that
there has been an explosion of platforms
there's more mobile browsers and more
mobile operating systems than we have
had to deal with on PC web gaming up
until now iOS Android went rim webos
symbian bada and windows Mobile's to
name a few along with that there's come
a divergence of skills if you want to
target the broadest possible audience
with your game then you'll need to
simultaneously be familiar with a number
of different languages like Objective C
Java C sharp and JavaScript
has also been segmentation of the market
it's very difficult to reach everyone
with a single game because there is a
series of walled gardens the iOS App
Store the Google marketplace more and
more different android market places
windows marketplace just to start off
with now when we were making pc games
over the last decade flash was there to
the rescue made working on all the
different web browsers tractable because
it worked the same way everywhere
provided good performance and reached
about 99% of people with web browsers
but flash has not made the transition to
be a legitimate mobile operating game
choice most notably it's not supported
on iOS as everybody is very well aware
there's the various performance issues
that you can see if you try to play
mobile on a mobile browser say android
using flash and the battery life issues
that are imposed by something it's so
consuming of the cpu power and so we all
turn to the browser right it'll be the
solution that will save us html5 for
gaming well i want to temper that with a
little bit of a historical perspective
if we look at the history of flash as an
example of a new platform maturing to
breach the sort of the needs of gaming
this is a ten-year story in 2001 shock
wave com launched you remember games
like addictinggames.com and congregate
and new grounds the sort of simple
arcade games that we saw back then
leading to virtual worlds in the 2003 we
had gaiaonline launched series of things
like that then flash became used for
things like video players youtube in
2005 and pandora doing music streaming i
don't know how familiar everyone here is
but there was a sort of a renaissance of
asian MMORPG games in Korea and Japan
and in China that led to billions of
dollars of virtual good sales and flash
games
and then in mobile in Japan there's been
two major platforms de na and gree who
have done a tremendous amount of gaming
using flashlights desktop tower defense
raise your hand if you played that game
in 2007 when that came out I think all
of us probably did for too many hours
keep finally culminating in social games
on facebook farmville in 2009 it girl in
2010 and more and more demanding games
as time goes on that are doing more and
more things with flash that is never
been able to do before this is a
ten-year story of flash and the
marketplace maturing to have faster and
faster more accessible technology as
well as finding a business model and
with social gaming we found a really
good business model it is an amazing
thing that people will pay for virtual
goods and it is an extremely high
revenue model so the question is where
is mobile html5 if we look at this
platform evolution that ten-year history
where are we in terms of html5 I believe
that the answer is we are solidly in the
simple arcade games section the very
beginning of that track and there's a
long way to go before we'll be seeing
virtual worlds and massively multiplayer
online role-playing games and high
performance social games running
entirely on html5 in mobile browsers
right now HTML games will be most
successful when specifically designed
around the limitations of the platform
that's a very general truth if you look
at successful games through all time on
new platforms they've always been
designed around what was available so
back in the very beginning with pong it
was designed to be able to do what
things were available you look at
asteroids with vector graphics when
things were drawing or the number of
pixels you drew is the limitation so
things were done without lines all the
way along through sprite sheets in Mario
to where we are today in html5 so we can
apply the same historical lessons that
we have from the past to try and find
what works
what works well and to design our games
specifically around that you'd be
cognizant of it rather than simply
trying to take the things we already do
and do them exactly the same way so when
will we arrive if as I have suggested
the free-to-play virtual goods based
business model is a fantastic business
model for gaming it has become
completely dominant in Asia very
dominant in the United States if you go
to the iOS App Store I look at the top
grossing games a larger and larger
percentage of them every month are free
when will we see games like restaurant
city and Tiny Tower and frontierville
and it grow more demanding games with
isometric worlds and many many sprites
moving all over the place and be able to
play them on our iphones and android
phones the main limitation for those
right now is graphical performance in
the browser you cannot render a very
large number of simultaneously moving
objects with animation all at the same
time well when will we get there well
fortunately for us Moore's law tends to
be working in our favor hardware has
been improving dramatically just from
2007 to 2010 if you look at just the
iphone we've gone from about four
hundred and twelve megahertz processors
to one gigahertz processors and we've
gone from having 128 megabytes of RAM to
512 is a very very very helpful thing
but there's also been a massive
improvement in JavaScript execution
speed which is not a purely hardware
thing the competition between engines
like nitro scroll fish trace monkey and
v8 have led to an exponential increase
in JavaScript performance which is also
getting us closer to our our target and
then graphical performance there are
lots of new competing technologies that
are part of the html5 umbrella that are
all offering potential solutions of how
to get high performance graphics WebGL
is an extremely interesting technology
but there are no mobile browsers today
that have support for it or announced
plans to support it in the future so
Oh for the scope of my segment this is
out canvas canvas has excellent support
in mobile browsers but it is very very
slow is not hardware accelerated the
thing that I have found in my experience
to be the best solution for mobile html5
games is CSS 3d transforms which are
hardware accelerated everywhere that
they are present one other problem that
we have with the bringing of games to
mobile is a choice which is what we
build native apps or html5 web apps this
is a very difficult bet to make because
due to the fact that you have a limited
number of resources on your team and
time and money and time to market is
extremely important you'll have to make
a choice in nine times out of ten to
either launch one or the other but you
will not be able to launch both if
you're starting from scratch it's very
hard to not have to choose one over the
other this is why my company spaceport
created our platform to try and help
developers bring mobile game bring games
to mobile in all of the different forms
to try and solve each of these issues
that I've just brought up today to begin
with spaceport you write your code in
JavaScript we chose JavaScript for a
number of reasons first it runs
everywhere you can run it on servers web
browsers smart TVs and all smartphones
and it's fast and the industry is
backing in Google and Facebook and Apple
are all working very diligently on
improving JavaScript usability and speed
with spaceport you write your game in
JavaScript but you can launch your game
on all of the separate platforms with a
single code base as a pure html5
application a native iOS application
native Android application and flash
application for the web to let you reach
the entire audience with a single code
base we also design spaceport to support
the process that game developers already
have in place for the free-to-play
social game developers who have been
putting
on spaceport they have been using flash
to create art assets animations and code
spaceport allows the use of flash to
continue authoring artwork and
animations with the same exact tools no
skill change and we have implemented the
same API is ActionScript 3 in JavaScript
so that the classes that you're used to
using and the type of coding patterns
you're used to will work as well and
spaceport is like a web page it
downloads HTML and JavaScript so that
you can instantly update your
application without this extra overhead
of app stores and publishing binary
submissions and compilation so spaceport
as a native application framework is
here today it's very fast and supports a
very wide range of features so what is
today possible is to launch a
high-performance native application and
with no change as html5 this platform
matures and performance increases and
the set of features that are part of the
spec are more thoroughly implemented
without any code changes your future
proof to be able to launch on html5 of
those things that I mentioned earlier of
WebGL in canvas we have done a
tremendous amount of research into SVG
the scalable vector graphic element we
created a process to automatically
convert swf files created with flash pro
in to svgs so that they can be used in a
pure html5 context in the same fashion
we convert Swift files into meshes that
can be given to graphics hardware for
native rendering one of the challenges
of building mobile games is that unlike
pcs where we could still get by with
fixed with layouts we all have to
support devices of all different aspect
ratios and different resolutions using
scalable vector graphics is the best way
that I know of to reach that problem
space port team also provides you with a
buffer between you and the messy truth
of fragmentation browsers are rather
fragmented just Safari
chrome Mobile Safari mobile chrome and
firefox provide an extreme wide range of
supported and unsupported features and
documented and undocumented crashes and
Android has the same exact issue so
using an engine like spaceport provides
a layer in between having to deal with
that code and writing your game logic so
I just want to conclude with a demo of
what is possible today in html5 using
spaceport feel free to visit html5 dot
spaceport I oh and you'll be able to
play this application this is a pure
html5 application running in mobile
safari on the iPad this is done using
scalable vector graphics SVG elements
everything done with CSS 3d transforms
so that it's hardware accelerated use of
the accelerometer and this code is
exactly the same code that will work on
all the different things so go to html5
bat spaceport IO and see what kinds of
things are possible in html5 today is
higher performance as you'll be able to
find in mobile safari thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
