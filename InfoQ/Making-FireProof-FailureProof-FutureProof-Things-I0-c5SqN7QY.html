I've been moving around a number of
different companies and startups I've
been in the web for about 15 years and I
just went to energy savvy which is a
energy start up in Seattle we have these
really cool dinosaur logos everyone
loves them everyone loves dinosaurs so
John came to me and said so you come
into open web camp I'm said sure it's
like great you're speaking and at the
time I went okay great i'll do a talk
and user experience i looked at all the
talks that were available i'm being done
the past and went that's just gonna
stick out like a sore thumb so I threw a
topic up and didn't know what was going
to up here so a couple of little caveats
here or huge ones perhaps I have almost
no answers for what I'm about to talk
about and I have almost no takeaways
almost but this for me is really about
issues I've been seeing over and over
again first as a web developer and then
as a user experience designer working in
startups working in software and well
let me start here let's start with
Philadelphia right how many of you all
have actually I've ever seen this street
this is broad street it's the
north-south primary thoroughfare through
downtown Philadelphia and what's unusual
about it especially when you know the
age of Philadelphia is it it is a
freaking wide Street right two cars a
huge median big offset from the sides of
the roads big city hall down the middle
of it it's incredibly wide and it all
has to do with that guy who stuck at the
top of the city hall there man by name
of William Penn whom you all might know
is the guy who's on the side of the
Quaker Oats box but was also the guy who
helped found
the colony we now call Pennsylvania and
he and others of his generation had been
through a certain disaster called the
Great Fire of London in 1666 now the
great fire of london and course
destroyed most of what we call the city
eventually led to the rebuilding of what
we call modern london but they remember
what happened and they were not going to
let that happen to the new colony so
they designed Philadelphia with two
incredibly wide streets broad street and
market street to segment this town into
quarters the idea being that if the fire
were to start in the bottom left-hand
corner here once it got to City Hall it
would have no ability to jump it would
just be too far wide so it's perfect
they built themselves a fireproof city
right not exactly see in multiple times
Philadelphia had fires this is the 1865
fire which destroyed two city blocks
this was during the middle of Civil War
and killed a number of people big big
issue but mind you they had three fires
the destroyed small number of blocks
compare it this fire in 1865 to another
notorious fire in 1871 which as you all
know destroyed pretty much most of
Chicago Philadelphia was built with wide
streets and brick chicago and seattle
and san francisco were built a lot
around wood and chicago and san
francisco and seattle all learn their
lessons and we call these things
building codes they have the rules for
how you do built environment in terms of
seismic in terms of fire prevention in
terms of egress in terms of basic rules
in seattle a house has to be 19 feet
back from the street why to allow not
only that offset but also because they
don't want houses crowding right up
against the side of the road it's an
aesthetic thing these rules are the
rules that govern the built space
everywhere in the world every place
every major industrial place has these
rules we even have rules as a
you know it on a higher level so what
about the web right I mean we've been
building this for 20 years right well
well hang on here hang on building
building codes would never work for
building CO right right I mean it's
different right I mean the built
environments planned right I mean think
about it right you want to build
yourself a tower right you want to park
this up in the middle of a major city
well you have an architect you've got
engineers you've got structural
engineers you've got everybody who Gaul
gets together with the person who wants
it built and the end of city planners
everyone else in it go we want to build
100 story skyscraper here's how it's
going to be and in the case of the
Freedom Tower it took them a decade but
there are rules and when you're done
you're done right well development that
that's not pre-planned right I mean
after all what is development but a
certain thing down the road from us here
called the Winchester Mystery House
right which how many we all know the
story the Winchester Mystery House yeah
right and everything the door to nowhere
and any of us who write code any of us
who designed we know where the doors to
know where lie inside of our code we
know where the door is to know where lie
inside of her design right and it could
be anything from internationalisation
where the moment you put a word in
German it's going to blow up the top
navigation to you know there was that
one idiot who didn't really know how to
code back-end database query and they
sent it through as a clear string on the
URL I actually saw that my as an aside
my sister-in-law tried to get me to sign
up for this book club and I started
punching things in and I discovered it
was sending my username and my password
as part of as part of the open query
string it was really hard to explain to
her why refuse to sign up but why don't
we deal with these things well it all
comes down to the basic rule of all
things what's on fire today right
well what is on fire today let's go over
our hierarchy of startup code needs
right we're going to do our startup we
got to get through our day to day with
our millions of dollars of investment so
what's the first thing you're going to
do well obviously you're going to ship
working code right I mean it's got to
keep working all right that's good what
are we going to do let's go fix some
bugs good ok now we're doing well if we
get time we'll fix those bugs what else
should we do well if we can get those
things done we'll do it build some new
features ok sounds pretty cool and then
we get the time will do all for
technical debt or whatever doubt that
comes with it so to understand why these
things are the way they are let's look
at these things for financial
perspective shipping working code that's
money right fixing your bugs near
working code that's more money building
new features well as any product manager
will tell you it's all about making it
rain so it does that leave the technical
debt well it doesn't really do any of
these things so it's just no money there
for many many problems right and a
broken slide let's talk about debt
because we all know dad right we all
know about work Cunningham's original
metaphor which was we start with this
problem of technical debt and we defer
and we defer and it's just like that
you're actually paying things down with
the idea that lady you'll have to pay it
back with interest so as an example one
of the developers in my last
organization told me this one day six
years ago I was asked how long it take
for me to internationalize a codebase I
said two weeks but we didn't do it now
it would take months of work with
multiple developers and why is that
because when he started he had only a
few lines of code a few pieces of Java
to work with now this thing was hundreds
of thousands of lines were long and you
know it's not just code it goes beyond
that right I mean we talked about tech
debt but
there's also designed debt there's
accessibility debt internationalization
debt security DevOps if you can think
about any number of pieces of debt
around this right feature debt I mean we
know tech we know tech debt right code
upgrades refactoring the temporary hacks
we have to do because it's four thirty
in the afternoon we got to flip it out
the door going through a going through a
stack of code and looking at all the to
do's that are marked all over the place
that's always fun and of course just the
basic not staying up to date so on my
side of the house on the UX side we have
the same sort of things poor usability
right we just leave it suboptimal user
flows I can show you any number than the
products that I've used where it's just
why are there 47 steps to do something
every other product only takes three the
mobile problem right I mean how many
what's Mobile's how many of you all get
the thing that the endless loops and
it's like there's just not a lot of
thinking about that the concept of
experience rot where you keep adding
more and more features and note update
the features that are there before and
pretty soon you've got eleventy million
buttons on the screen right and then
what I call the patch and paint versus
the knock down the wall problems right
which spins back into experience rod
well the best thing to do is to refactor
the the information architecture and the
taxonomy well we don't have time for
that what we're going to do add another
button no accessibility has the same
problem right doesn't work of a screen
reader that's a problem a lot of these
Ajax and post Ajax sites don't have Aria
hooks to pull in screen readings as pull
to it I'd be able to let people know
that things are changing on the screen
oftentimes accessibilities never test
it's never even a priority and which all
stones back to that great old are they
the eighty percent case problem right
which of course we know what that leads
to you start saying things like that and
you get yourself sued which the National
Federation for the blind is more than
happy nowadays to do which more power to
them I wish they did it more but it's a
horrible place to be but here's the
awful truth right you're never
not you will never not have debt why
it's easy right there's research then
there are not infinite resources and you
don't have infinite revenue you have to
make a choice you're a startup you want
to just get to market you just want to
sell what are you going to do
accessibility or put an hour build the
base number of features need to do to
get the the VCS to say yeah I'm willing
to put some money behind this right you
have three hours to fix a problem with
the navigation what do you got to do
right you have 11,000 things that need
to get shipped out the door because
people are breathing down your neck are
you going to do that are you going to
try to refactor for html5 right so it
leads to these this this is one of my
favorite buildings I went to the
University of Colorado and there's a
building on campus called temporary
building number one temporary building
number one is over a hundred years old
it is made of brick it is very much not
temporary why is it called temporary
building number one well because they
were supposed to knock it down it was
used originally as a hospital but then
they decided that they needed the space
for other things so they decided we're
going to get rid of it so we're going to
call temporary building one and it'll go
that was nineteen fifty-nine it's still
there it's now considered part of a
clear small building it's because they
built the clear small building onto it
but it's still called to bury building
number one think about all the things
you do in your code where you're like
this is a temporary design no one's ever
going to do it and then ten years later
you're still shipping it so we go
through all these things at the same
time though we know right poor
architecture it kills velocity it kills
sales at times too you know we have to
keep up with every change in market
every change in user every change in
device we don't plan for
internationalization we know its costs
lord help us if we have to do it in
German you know bad security mistakes
have cost us money and face how many
times does that happen every week and an
accessibility side it costs us face and
it costs us money i mean you know i was
talking to somebody about linkedin
having an article rhesus week about the
inaccessibility of their mobile site
with our mobile app sorry jenison so
what does that lead to well we're right
back where we started weren't we what's
on fire today well the whole damn town
so what are we going to do so my thought
really was and has been for a long time
that we need a building code for the web
right let's think about the principles
of what a building code is right in any
situation in any building you have to be
able to make one of three decisions
right where you're going to retrofit
whether you're going to replace whether
you're going to have new construction so
if you think about retrofit this is an
example here of a bridge pretty much
every bridge in metro Seattle has had to
do this the support columns below the
crossbeam of this road bridge have been
put in what's called a jacket and the
reason why it's put in what's called a
jacket is because when they made the
columns they were hollow why were they
hollow because it was cheap to make a
kalo concrete column what's the one
little problem with Congress humm hollow
concrete columns one little earthquake
they go so what's the solution you go
and you actually wrap them in these
metal jackets so that the metal keeps
the column from popping it's actually
cheaper to do this and it is to replace
the columns so this is an example of a
chef a classic retro fit right replace
well you guys pretty much know this one
right I mean the Bay Bridge was outright
replaced why was it replaced because the
old East's link was structurally
deficient what's the solution you
place it and you get rid of the old one
and then as for news construction well I
can tell you about South Lake Union in
Seattle which originally was just a
bunch of houses and industrial parks and
now is nothing but Amazon biotech and
any number of condos these have all
popped up in the last decade but every
one of them is built to withstand an
earthquake of seven or more which by the
way we are due for as part of the
subduction fault the Cascadia quake that
we all are dreading and fearing and it's
the reason why I refuse to now go on
vacation to the Oregon coast I've
watched one too many tsunami videos but
every one of these things is built to a
new standard in new practice when you
build a new building you follow the
rules and with that come things like
standard sizes and standard practice
which we all know about insight in terms
of building right i mean would for
instance right i mean what comes in
standard sizes two by four do by six
cetera et cetera et cetera and we know
that if we do that we can also have
standards for instance on doors right
what's the fire resistance of a door
they're rated they're known they're
actually tagged and marked on the door
which and if they're all standard and
they're all under a certain practice
then old Tom Silva from this old house
will tell you how to install a new one
why because installing a prehung door is
exactly the same in my house as it is in
your house mind you there's some
shimmying and gyming that's fewer things
you're going to have to do and of course
in the case of my house one side is a
quarter inch lower than the other but
let's leave that aside for the moment
the point being that great now I can
build all this stuff it's awesome right
so you know it's we need to think about
this though if we're going to do a code
we have to get beyond web standards and
beyond frameworks right this is about
true practice right I mean practice
as allen iverson once told us indeed how
are you supposed to make the web better
when you with practice so I'm not saying
this is somebody who does not support
the w3c does not support what dumb what
CAG 508 or any number of things that
we've done over the years to standardize
code I am a huge standard Easter but
we've got to take another step right we
set the rules so when are we going to
put the rules where they belong which is
in how we build everything I mean
accessibility you have to sue somebody
right now this is a problem that we've
dealt with an accessibility for a long
long time and it all comes down to well
you educate and you sooo right
internationalization we kind of have
practices and that people can run around
and fix these problems user experience
do you know how many user experience
people amazon now employs it's like a
third of the company I know because they
called me for interviews about once a
week we want good practice that's beyond
the idea of having rules right I mean
yeah jquery is good but are you going to
keep by jquery updated what happens when
you do and it break something what's
going to be the cadence for doing that
right so what can we do that's the hard
question right we have to come up of a
way of doing best practices of
integrating them all into some sort of
code and providing it to people in a way
it could be regularly updated regularly
understood and people have to keep up
with it and I'm not really sure there's
a good answer and I can tell you part of
the reason why I don't think there's a
really good answer i used to teach at
the university level and i used to watch
kids walk in who were learning web stuff
in school and they were still learning
how to design in tables and they were
still learning
font tags and then it got worse when I
actually saw the syllabus I was supposed
to teach from which included things like
using current and up-to-date web
standards like XML to build websites I'm
staring at this thing going xml it's
2011 we're behind we're not pushing good
practice and we're expecting people to
keep up and we change every five seconds
and a lot of us who've kind of reached
my age which is getting longer in the
tooth and have been in this industry for
a long time get that feeling of can we
keep up can we learn so I'm not really
sure there's a perfect answer but I do
think that I have one answer for one of
the problems I've been running into so
here's my little part for you x and for
how we do things and I call it
StoryCorps mind you I'm from Seattle
it's hella Microsoft and therefore I
feel obliged to actually call it I'm
2014 home edition live365 pre-alpha
preview so this actually is very very
unfinished and I'm not willing to
provide it yet but let me walk you
through what I'm basically right into in
my last job I discovered that a lot of
what I was doing was just repeating
things over and over again up here you
see a line for nuts and bolts as an epic
and its bare bones requirements for
products what a nuts-and-bolts well it
turns out the blocking and tackling
pieces of building any website are
pretty much the same right you need to
if you're going to have a web
application you got to have log it's
okay if you have logins what you have to
do with law against you there's crud
operations okay that's pretty
straightforward thing what about
security well that's actually pretty
straight forward to what's the lost
password pattern well there's a few of
them but they're all pretty standard
that's just the basic pieces of things
you can go beyond that what's what's on
the homepage there's a structure that's
there in terms of how we lay these
things
how we write the user stories so I
thought that's perfect i'll just start
writing to user stories so this is the
principal here of being able to do the
classical what we call persona store a
persona goal value structure in stories
as a speaker i want to give a good talk
so people won't walk out on me right and
then be able to give the steps around it
to say well what's the acceptance
criteria for that i'll know it's done
when none of you get up it's okay not
going to hurt anybody so what is story
so the idea is it's essentially a
bootstrap for applications right so I
put the nuts and bolts pieces in place
for basic web application it's important
so you know we'll throw it into github
we'll do what we need to do the P the
key pieces for user experience are going
to be there but on top of that we can
bake in things like accessibility and
security and internationalization and
all these other things we don't need to
be there maybe there are things you can
still defer but there are things you're
going to have to face and if you face
them earlier you know you have to I can
tell you the biggest problem with
technical debt with design debt of any
of these things is that is the unknown
unknown right we know that especially
with security the unknown unknown kills
us all the time because the unknown
unknown is something we cannot plan for
but we know there are known unknowns
when it comes to things like design we
know there are known unknowns when it
comes to code we can plan for that so
what am I going to ship this soonish
I'm still going to try and no i'm hoping
to get this done i I was chucking my way
through it set it aside last night and
went you know what I should just go
ahead and tell people about what I'm
trying to do so I'll throw it up and get
hub soon and I'll put something up on my
Twitter account to let people know about
that so that's what I'm going to do what
are you guys going to do I mean we know
about the dead issue right we know all
these forms of dead we also know we're
confronting all these doors so how do we
get to this how do we get there and
that's kind of what I'm looking at you
for I don't have an answer the question
I've answered one part of the question
for myself but look at everything else
we do we have got to figure out how
exactly we're going to start building
the fire breaks into the code we're
going to figure out how we're going to
bake accessibility in is it by building
better frameworks or improving the
frameworks we already have perhaps is it
by being more stringent about standards
perhaps is it about education perhaps
but I'm not really sure because I can
tell you that over the last 15 years
we've tried and we've tried and we've
tried and we get better every day but
we're still a long way from being able
to avoid great fire of london scenarios
and in our web in our applications we've
got to get away from that we've got to
get towards small fires small issues so
we can start getting the velocity we
need to really move this forward right I
mean after all this is for everyone
right the entire point of the web you
could argue is the lovely and
democratization of the world now the
problem with the level in
democratization of the world is that
people write bad code why because it's
level of the Democratic you can make bad
decisions so how do we how do we build
good decisions
how do we enforce good decisions my
argument would be we got to figure out
how to do it from the start we got to
figure out how to build a real building
code around these things but the rest of
it honestly is up to you I'm just a user
experience designer what do I know
anyway thank you so that went a lot
quicker than I thought it would but I've
got plenty of time apparently now for
questions arguments and threats so I
think you mean you're right building
codes do the question being you know
building coach took out innovation how
do you avoid that well it's true they
typically do at the same time we also
have seen any number of buildings that
meet code that are quite innovative and
I think really the best way to do it is
to is to split that difference right
between we can still be innovative and
we can still build the code you can
build a beautiful building that's
fireproof I mean that's going to be fire
is it and give people the right egress
is you know there's a there's a building
in outside where I grew up in Oklahoma
called the price tower that that Frank
Lloyd Wright built 14 stories tall it
does not have fire escapes that would
work for a skyscraper it is a beautiful
building and utterly useless in the
modern era right that's a decision that
you have to make you have to figure out
how to thread that needle do I think it
chokes on innovation sure but the same
time it doesn't choke out that much
innovation because clearly everything
that's built around here does not look
identical it all looks a little bit
different I think we can still get there
I think the real question is going to be
at what point and how are we going to
maintain that innovation because we
aren't still done building the ideas of
what the web is for only 20 years in
right
perhaps but also perhaps not right I
mean oh poor Leigh built poorly deployed
emergency website will kill people if
they can't get the information out fast
enough right so so let's turn it this
way theft right why do we lock our doors
in our house right I mean I got broken
into a few years ago because a guy
climbed through the bathroom window I'd
left it open adequately forgotten about
it it was a little thing right I always
look at that as like that's just like a
software hole you idiot software being
some punk kid maybe it's you know fire
is primal but so is theft I mean how
many times quick question how many of
you all have had your credit card number
changed twice in the last year of those
how many of is it cause of target yeah
right I mean that's what that's
obviously off to the side a little bit
but sorry go ahead yeah yeah you know I
think for me it's I've been through
those battles with marketers with
product managers and when those things
are going to keep popping up left and
right they're going to push out real
issues and the more we can get ahead of
the issues of keeping things up and
running and maintained the less they're
going to get pushed aside by crazy angry
marketers who are afraid of things going
on or product managers who really want
this thing shipped yesterday yeah you
know that's always it's always a pain in
the rear I can tell you I had some of
the other day asking me so how long
should it take for should we wait to see
if somebody's actually read the web page
and I said well Don Norman says 10 to 20
seconds is the average time someone
spends on a web page link so what number
were you supposed to go with I'm like 12
why I don't know I just pulled the
number out of my head
the there are some things you can
measure in terms like in UX we measure
us all the time in terms of like what's
the response of how responsive is a site
we can measure things around say color
contrast for accessibility so there are
some things we can measure but you're
right there is still a lot of opinion
and there still is a lot of what I ball
I didn't figure out what the best thing
to do is but even in building we do that
right one end of my door is a quarter
inch lower than the other end of the
door it won't take it won't take a
standard frame so how do you deal with
that well in the case of the of the guy
who was installing the door for me he
took a sledgehammer and tried to beat
down a quarter inch on one side of it is
that the right way to do it absolutely
not right because the next thing I know
the inspector we were gonna think about
but we were renting everything about
buying it he looks at it and goes yeah
what's the spalling off of the
foundation there and I go it would looks
like somebody took a sledgehammer and
hit right there a few times and I'm like
yeah I think that happened so like in a
case like there are there cases like
that where yeah there are certainly
opinions but there are there are
decisions that you can take and then the
decisions you probably shouldn't take
and I think that part of the practice
isn't yet built out right putting it to
an exact number it needs to be 19 feet
away we will I think we'll eventually
get there in terms of responsiveness
right in terms of things like how do you
deal with a particular set of browsers
and particular set of website a lot of
other things and what colors should it
be etc that I think will always be
dealing with those problems but building
is a bit building is as much about
aesthetics and opinion as it is about
doing it right
yeah i'm not anti frameworks i think
doing that aid it's easy to do it at a
university or a corporate level right
it's hard to do it on an overall level
and the other thing too is you got to
keep up right in how many jquery updates
do we have and every time they do it it
was easy a security thing or their
deprecating something else and it's
changing the code that you've written on
top of it so I mean I'm not I think
there's a there's a big spot for
frameworks in this puzzle huge spot for
frameworks I think the key thing around
frameworks is that we have to do them in
a reasonable and sensible way to and
make sure that people are willing to
take them and use them right i mean we
we need to get to a point where
corporate standard is reasonable as a
 you know as people using the web
right we're all cool if using bootstrap
the bootstraps built right you know I've
seen what the code annular produces the
regardless of the previous session we
all kind of look at it go that's not web
standards so you know it's the same sort
of we've got to figure out how to split
thread that needle and split that
difference Dennis did you we're going to
rent or I yell at me
I know the same feeling but I would
actually like to tie your and Dennis's
comments together because I think you
just threaded something through
interesting which was we've got to teach
these people God hwt sorry anybody here
from google I'm really sorry we have to
teach them how to build good HTML how to
actually when their framework seemed to
spit out good things right and we've
done a really poor job of that i can
tell you yeah so so so who here's a
licensed web designer or developer could
i get a show of hands I'm who here is
AIW american institute of web designers
nobody oh great great yeah sure sure I
just made it up but yeah I mean and you
know that is that is one of those good
points it's like we're we're still not
it isn't really that that the pain point
where if a website goes down it's going
to kill hundreds of people by the sheer
fact it caught on fire and collapsed on
top of them at the same time these
things are becoming so integral to our
lives that perhaps licensing may come
you know we are already seeing the
closing of this first age of the web as
companies these big corporations come in
and start taking over you know the end
of net neutrality is might be soon and
if so then you can see a situation where
we're going to all get licensed so it's
a it's a two-edged sword right on the
one hand you have to actually have
something to do this on the other hand
the gates going to get awfully small and
we're going to lose that democratization
yeah I mean I know for sure that OPSEC
especially in large enterprise companies
like I've worked in there are clear
rules that you have to follow in order
to get certified so you can actually bid
on our on our piece and
in some companies we now know you can be
insured against security issues I mean
part of how target is go is making up
for their idiocy last year's insurance
is paying for part of it but the
premiums just went up and everyone's
looking around them going well it's
going to be who's going to be next so
there's got to be a way to tie that cost
to it you know and you know the idea of
lost dollars I mean the one problem that
course is like accessibility it's really
hard to tie lost dollars to it we tell
stories that well you know twenty
percent of people have a visual visual
deficiency and that's going to cause a
problem but the same time you know
that's that's that's the problem are
going to do the right thing or are you
going to figure out a way to actually
monetize that in a reasonable way so two
things around that one is that the place
i'm currently working at i was hired on
because they never had anyone who did
design before and they are now in a
position where they understand the
problem that they're in that they need
more design and they also understand
that the visa the venture capitalist
everybody else are expecting that now so
the solution is put someone in charge
who can help drive that accessibility
I've heard similar things with
organizations but that's a money
question right I mean that's really how
you know our market the people who are
going to pay for our stuff right on the
other side though I would almost turn
back to frameworks right we know what we
use to build with can we when we start
generating new frameworks from scratch
is it possible for us to get a set of
best practices in place at the start so
that they are being built correctly I
mean there's this you know it's that
balance again between do you want to let
an organic thing rise or do you want to
try to do it pre-planned right do you
want to end up with more PHP even though
PHP pretty much dry as most of the web
nowadays but we all know what a pile of
fun that is
structurally or do you want to let get
something it's more planned but then
when you're planning are you going to be
able to pick everything up at the start
I'm not really sure but I'm starting
with the sense that we have to get to
the point where we understand what the
basic nuts and bolts are of things
overall so that you know when we start
building frameworks we know what to do
so that when we start doing these
startups when we start building new
sites when we start pulling things out
of the box we know exactly what needs to
happen part of that is education part of
that is just knowing what the right
thing to do is I mean like I said I
don't really have an answer my feeling
is it's a mix of everything we've done
before and trying to find another
another path through we have you know is
it mobile is it something further along
the way haven't seen I don't know but if
we keep going down this road you know
we're going to be in the same place in
ten years for ten times the tech debt we
had now ten times the design debt
because every time we start when we're
going to be in the same damn position
how do we solve that your answer like
one more question yeah that is I mean
I'm not really sure I mean we need a
best practice around that for sure I
mean how many did three different sites
help me that I had a you know with
bleeding heart or was it called
heartbleed thank you sorry about that
one of those things at three different
ways they came to me one of which I
didn't even find out about until
somebody had sent me a page it's like oh
yeah and they probably got compromised I
mean there's a pattern that we haven't
even figured out yet no one seems to
have a good best practice around it I'm
not again I'm not really sure is a good
answer but we need to figure that part
out to and then that comes actually back
to emergency preparedness right i mean
that's the fire happens elsewhere in the
system how you're going to deal with it
so sorry we're over so thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
