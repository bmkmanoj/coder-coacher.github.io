story show hands Wow joke is not going
to go so well okay so uh let me just
give you a quick recap so this intern at
gizmodo goes on a date with this guy she
got set up to okcupid and after the date
finds out he is one of the top ranked
magic players the United States and she
flames him in this article saying like
what a loser you know magic player Nadia
even though he works at a hedge fund
cute guy Blue Magic can't do it and the
Internet's obviously like you know how
shallow how terrible but I learned a
really important lesson for reading this
article which is I needed to close
certain things before I meet new people
because I don't any of you writing a
flame post so I do need to tell you that
in a moment of youthful indiscretion I
played magic and I lost i did really
poorly i'm not a good magic player by
any means so bad they didn't take a card
after me and you get if you tell the
story the guy John Finkel who's in the
story actually have a magic card named
after him because he's that good at
magic but if I did have a magic card
created after me it would look just like
this for those of you who aren't
familiar with the format I kind of break
it down so that's my name I'm Matt Kelly
this is what I do I design interactions
by actually building them so I'm not a
designer but I'm an engineer I build
interaction that sir which is an
interaction design strategy company down
in the south bay and again i'm not a
visual designer i don't do anything with
photoshop i'm a coder on the front of
the back end but I work with a lot of
designers ads herb I one of three
engineers out of prominently design
company so this talk is somewhat
unfortunately named interaction design
engineering for JavaScript Wow what does
that even mean I could try to break it
down this is interaction design crash
course for engineers who heart
JavaScript and I can kind of talk about
it a little more maybe some of you guys
are thinking well I'm not a designer
what do I care about you know
interaction design I'm just here to see
Paul Irish give this talk about html5
right i'm here to see paul irish and
they asked me to talk so I figured why
not so I'm going to make an argument
that if you guys are working on products
if you're coding product you are a
designer so and I'm going to kind of
explain this through Lego people if you
can you saw already I kind of have a
little Lego theme I like Legos my kids
like Legos so thick Legos are a good way
to communicate with engineers so I'm
going to talk about what we call the
design process observe this will be the
only kind of process part of talk don't
get more than nuts and bolts so the
first step of the design process when
you're building something is called
strategy so we're going to use a Lego
analogies this is the Lego keying saying
we're going to make a lot of Lego money
by sacking out of Lego countries and
taking their lego gems if we're
following like actual product example
this could be something like we're going
to build a social site post deals every
day and people going to go to them and
pay us money for this this is kind of
your your strategy for your business it
doesn't really talk about the nuts and
bolts of it that's the very high level
in larger companies you know the
engineers probably aren't involved in
this if it's a start-up maybe you're the
king making the decision either way as a
matter that the second phase is kind of
tactics so again if we're following the
Lego analogy is where the King tells The
Wizard you need to go sack France and go
steal all their lego dollars if we're
following the groupon example we are
going to have a page that has the deal
of the day we're going to have a
mechanism people can put in their email
addresses so we're kind of defining what
the application is now but we have an
implement yet but we pass the strategy
level so in good company is this where
the engineer's kind of get involved and
talk these things through so maybe if
you're this wizard you're like no we
can't sack France they have lots of
French people and they're not going to
like that the King says no no it's easy
just take the sword and stab them no
problem and then the engineers to the
out ki can do that right which leaves
this is a third phase which is
implementation this is where we actually
have yeah this is where you actually
build a thing you're going to build in
the Lego analogy here we are sacking
France this is where all the talk
becomes becomes an actual product where
the rubber hits the road and this is why
I say you're all designers because this
is where any decision that wasn't made
in the strategy or the tactics phase all
has to get made now because now you
actually have to build something and do
it all these kind of questions like well
what's on each page how is the
navigation in a structured validation
maybe just got to find before if it
didn't this is where you
to define it now as an engineer maybe
you work for a large company and there's
a lot of people between you and the king
you have you know a product manager a
race car driver and a chef but still any
decisions that they don't make you still
have to make now as the engineer it
could be more granular stuff Brett the
augmentation though just like how does
this form validate what page does it go
to anything it's not defined ahead
you're defining now and sure you could
go back and forth and just constantly
ask people ahead above you what should
this do how should this act but you're
probably making a lot of these entities
don't even know it so i would argue you
are a designer but i'm going to go out
on a limb and say you are probably not a
great designer the last okay and the
only reason i feel comfortable saying
that is this is kind of what pushed me
over to I realized this one day when I
was working for a larger company I knew
that I really liked working with small
teams I want to work on a starve
environment for small team environments
and to be successful at that I felt like
I had to make myself a better designer I
still wanted to be an engineer I wanted
to write code but I wanted to be a
better designer because the work with
small teams you don't have all these
other people doing all the definition
for you but I still wanted to build
really cool products so I felt like I
need to understand the design process
better so that's why I left that company
and I work with a whole bunch of
designers doing crazy stuff with them so
this talk is kind of again a crash
course in the things that I learned over
the last three years working at ZURB so
being one of a just a couple engineers
at largely design based company what
I've learned about building product and
really small team environments so the
first and the most important thing is
designing for workflows I think this is
best illustrated to an example this is
google analytics it's quite a familiar
with this team and so if I'm thinking
about how many design google analytics I
want to design it for a workflow
whenever anybody comes to this app they
have a thing that they want to do right
I want to see some analytics so let's
say I want to see analytics for an app
called verify so what do i do i click on
the axis and alex button right there and
I land on this page I have my two
accounts I've never used that pie ranch
one but it's there every time I reserve
once I click on that one okay and then
now I see a bunch of my thing but the
one the sites that i want isn't listed
here because oh yeah I have to show more
down here on this little drop-down that
resets every time I come back to this
page and I show 20 and then now I can
find it so we've made it in four clicks
so I get that a very sad face the Sun
that I do every
single time I come to Google Analytics
for clicks just to see the analytics
none of that was any decision making us
and like what kind of analytics so I
want to see what's my workflow it's just
these four terrible things that I have
to do every time I go here right so I
give that a sad face um sure I could
like memorize this URL and just type
this in because that's a super memorable
URL that's sarcasm or I could add
bookmarks for each of the sites that I
want but bookmarks are like so 1980 and
we also have in a delicious so bookmarks
you know maybe not that cool so i put on
my designer hat and I redesign this page
remember I don't use photoshop so I just
took the last three sites that i have
been to i put them up here on the top so
i can click on them and why not get rid
of all the stuff it just seems like
corrected mexa dump all that so I mean
but the guys at Google they're smart
they'd actually done a redesign you can
switch between the old version and the
new version so i'll show you the google
analytics new now which is greatly
improved if i click on this button I
land here and now I just get a listing
of everything it's all flattened out so
I can just click on it and we're hearing
to click so i'll give it i'll give that
a yay that that's that's much better but
again you can see how when they designed
this they weren't really thinking about
workflows they were thinking about this
other kind of stuff that engineers think
about they were thinking about object
hierarchy data hierarchy framework
convention right if you look at that it
looks just like the data does we have
accounts accounts have sites and sites
have profiles and even though they
flatten the solace would get here in two
clicks I don't think they were thinking
to workflow they were just thinking you
know let's a jack safai this and flatten
it all off interest in Java cuz it'll be
cool and it does a good job of cutting
the number of clicks in half but it's
still kind of that same thing other
problems this page this up here PI ranch
is still the default selected profile
even if i change that i found my log in
at recess again doesn't even matter so
they have this the design kind of by
engineers is always around these three
things and you can't think about these
things when you're doing design work I
mean this is awesome this is how we
program are really good at this mexican
engineers we see the world in terms of
relationships and object this is really
important we're coding but if you're
designing you have to kind of turn that
around and think about how is the user
using the site
find those pieces and then go back and
do all of your you're awesome is to hook
up and make it work so again like i said
is accounts it's very database so let's
look at another implementation of google
analytics because they offer an API
other people can build their own front
end on top of this this is an iphone app
called analytics pro and they've taken a
kind of a workflow based approach to
design eunice so as soon as i open the
app I just have a list of all my
profiles they get rid of the concept of
sight it's just here's your profiles and
here's the accounts if you understand
what those are I click on one of those
I'm taken to a page where they present
me with all the basic workflows let's
see today's summary let's see
yesterday's summary seven days I click
on that and here i'm already at the data
into cliques clearly i have some SEO
problems around the site but you can see
how taking that workflow approach to the
design makes this so much easier to use
and actually prefer to use the iphone
app as opposed to the web app if i want
to go to this workflow and get it
obviously from trying to dig through a
lot more data more real estate on the
computer work but just to get in check
something really quick this iphone app
has done a much better job implementing
that workflow than the actual tool at
Google put out so the next thing I want
to talk about is speed users have very
specific reactions to different response
speeds from an interface you guys are
all josh with developers right so we can
do things really fast with javascript
because we're not waiting for the whole
server to do a response the speed is
really important really important to
understand what these i'm going to break
it down to three different intervals to
kind of explain it I'm not making these
intervals up these have been tested and
this is proven this is stuff i'll post
the link to the data and the slide you
down them later but i want to walk
through times of three intervals and
explain how users perceive each one of
those response time so in the interface
that responds in less than 100
milliseconds the person using an
interface feels like they're directly
controlling what they're doing so when
you're typing on your keyboard you know
every keystroke you expect the letter to
show up very quickly right i'm typing it
is see something's showing that there's
no shared controlling you looking you in
the computer this is just you in putting
stuff you expect all the interactions to
be less than 100 milliseconds so this is
a app we have a call verify we have
different
steps that you go through at you're
taking these tests and you wanted to
feel really seeing look like you were in
control and moving this through so
rather than having each step be a page
load which it was an original
implementation we rewrote it so that
each step was just one of those old is
to fly the way you can see how quickly
that goes away so if that's an
interaction that's under 100
milliseconds as soon as you click the
interface immediately reacts what you're
doing right and then you can see across
it on the number of steps how nice that
feels we have the animation as well it
slides it up and as you're going through
it just feels like it's really seamless
thing you're directly control what
you're doing there's no stress as like
oh wait this page to load it just kind
of move step two step is very nice so we
wrote a quick blog post on this on the
implementation is we just took a whole
bunch of divs and stacked them because
it's a test there's not a lot of content
there's no real problem with loading the
page too much markup so we just load the
entire page with the test we load the
entire test from the page loads we have
a bunch of divs they're just hidden and
we just flip through them the job is
pretty straightforward either do
anything kind of creating with Java
templates we just stack them there's
some downsides of stacking templates we
talked about more on this post if you
interested than that we'll post that
like you guys can check that out so for
mobile this is a capture of an ipad for
mobile it's the same kind of problem you
want to make sure that anything that
doesn't have a shared control component
to it it needs to come respond in less
than harm milliseconds so this is
another app that I can't tell you what
it is yet we're going to launch it a
couple weeks when I click on this tap
title button a modal is going to pop up
and ask me do title this right and i'll
show you how long i take so that's the
tap and it comes up so it seems pretty
quick but it's actually a little
sluggish if you're on the device and
tapping on it it's about 300
milliseconds for this thing to come up
and as you're doing this it kind of
feels like a little like why is it
taking so long you know this is a very
expensive ipad 2 why isn't stuff just
kind of flying through why is this a
native app this you know no is it slow
because of the web app right it's
actually not a problem with the the ipad
all of the taps on the least on the iOS
devices they wait 300 milliseconds to
see if you're going to double tap to
zoom so when you bind click handlers to
any of the elements
isn't going to fire for at least 300
milliseconds if you buy into the touch
end event or the touch event you can see
that it's actually a lot quicker it
feels way more responsive it just pops
up immediately right I've actually bound
both events so when I'm clicking on that
it's using the touch event when i click
on its X to close that's still the click
event so you guys favorite next to each
other what are they just super snappy
feels really good that one's just a
little slow right and if your product is
being used by developers there's already
kind of a the idea of the community that
native apps are faster than apps in the
browser and this really makes had a lot
worse because if you have an app where
every single link takes three deimos
like us to click on that just makes it
feel like this is really kind of crappy
experience so we can't take credit for
figuring this out Ryan you're avanti's
awesome guy over at Google we're what a
really good article explaining this if
you just bind the touch event you're
going to have all kinds of other
problems because what if they touch drag
and release you want to make sure that
it still works on non mobile browsers so
he wrote up all the code on how to
implement the I could click through the
touch of it we just took his code and we
poured it to really quick jquery special
event so you can just bind to our event
fast click and then they will do that
the only downside is that you won't be
able to zoom when you click on that one
element because it's capturing the touch
end event it's stopping their
propagation so it fires immediately you
won't actually capture this does anyone
that all right anything it takes more
than 100 milliseconds in less than one
second there's now kind of a shared
control between the person using the
interface and then the interface itself
so that's like a explains you know our
person is chasing the victim with the
Act there I starting to get away a
little bit right so I'll show you two
different cliques can anybody tell me
the difference between those two clicks
right the second one's just a little
slower it's about a 800 milliseconds so
the first ones down like close to 100 so
when we first did the inlet this
interface we had you click on next we
meet Lee slide that div away we show the
other div and then on the next screen
when you click to say this is where I
want to click on the screen we do the
same thing as soon as you click we slid
it away it's asynchronous JavaScript
right why should we have to wait for the
server to come back around respond the
feedback that we got from people using
app was they felt like it was too quick
they're like oh what happened you know
it did my thing get saved so we found
was when there's a little bit of a pause
when we did the age Act request to the
server to record the click and then
waited for the response and then to the
transition it created about you know a
hundred I can delay it was now perceived
that okay this was saved just having
that little space in there as opposed it
aeneus change made the whole thing feel
differently anything it's recording data
if we make sure that it takes at least a
second for to come back around you could
also include like a set time out if we
do some crazy like that I don't know so
anything it takes more than one second
but less than 10 seconds the user is
starting to lose focus on the task and
starting to lose flow so as you get away
from one second you're kind of losing
your content tradition what you're doing
right here but about up to ten seconds
you're not going to leave the task so
you're not going to go and check Twitter
until it's been about 10 seconds for an
interface to respond back to you so if
you're in this range you need to show
some kind of progress is something
happened but you don't necessarily need
to say oh this could take up in 20
seconds to come back after 10 seconds
you can just show a spinner so again for
verify when you upload an image we know
it's going to take up probably up to 10
secs pin how large the images so rather
than just doing posting this whole forum
to a page you have no idea what's going
on as soon as you select the image you
want to upload you show a spinner right
away so okay something's happening I'm
waiting and then when it finishes will
replace a spinner with the image so you
kind of build trust with your user by
having interactions like this throughout
the application just going to take less
than 10 seconds just show a spinner and
when it's done it's done and they kind
of trust it when i see the spinner okay
this could take up to 10 seconds but no
longer and you build that trust and they
don't start walking away from your app
or getting frustrated because they know
a spinner is going to take about this
long for this to finish the one thing i
want to point out on the code around
this again we'll post this in the slides
is when you do do this after the 8's
request completes you to make sure that
you buy into the thumb load event
otherwise get this really weird flash
because you switch the thumb the thumb
hasn't actually changed yet we have you
know sample code is that this link here
and we're using just the balam's ajax
upload plugin for this one they think it
takes more than 10 seconds it's just
kind of depressing right this is our
poor lego guy he's been waiting all day
for his flickr images up below he's
turned to drinking and he
need to shave there on the side so if
somethin takes longer than 10 seconds
you need to either tell the user it's
going to take this long to finish so
they can make a decision go do something
else check your Twitter make a coffee or
give this thing else to do so this is
one of our free apps called bounce you
type in a URL and then we have a
back-end process that goes out actually
captures the URL the problem is we have
no idea how long it's going to take
right we know it's been roughly in the
five to sixty second range but within
their we can't really tell you how long
it's going to take so we need to do
something else so we kind of distract
the user so when you click grab
screenshot we just show a cute little
bouncing ball hey chopard animation if
they click they can they can drop it
again right so go that's nice and before
you know it 15 seconds to the lab Senor
on the page so this is kind of how we
cheat and get past this and obviously
the coast of this is very simple we're
just pulling our back-end and say is it
done when it's done every dash to the
page and that's it and we had some fun
work writing a little JavaScript
bouncing ball which is always pretty
exciting to do and that's what we cut we
call wow moments this is my third and
last point is it's pretty quick so it's
okay to do stuff in the app is just for
fun you can't build the entire
application around just worthless
features but mean the bouncing ball is
is a bunch of JavaScript it's not
functional to the app but it's cool and
people like that kind of stuff it makes
them happy as developers it's fun to
code up wow moments and do things like
that so don't be afraid to just throw
something in there because it's cool
this is for another top secret app the
tiled redacted but not redacted anywhere
else so you can probably guess what this
is this is the same problem we have our
back-end service is capturing the URL
and when you click on it we have this
big josh with animation we did this
horse kind of moseying along and javed
animated windmill cactus pops in the
sunset fade so as the cowboy kind of
moseys across the screen I'll take any
questions that's all I've got for you
