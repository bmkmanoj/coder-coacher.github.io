stuff in the database let's show it
let's show it on the page one last
change to index post j/s inside of our
routes folder we have added yet another
call back within a call back we're using
our bread crumb we are going to search
for all the bread crumbs that we have
previously saved every single time
someone posting your data to our
database we're going to display them all
not very tied to a user everyone gets to
see everybody else's but it's effective
for this out now that doesn't make it
visible that makes it available in the
data payload if we navigate over to
views home handlebars we have one final
bit of code that we've added to the
bottom of the page which is if the
application has added a bread crumbs
object to our page we are going going to
iterate through all the breadcrumbs
display the date and the address that we
visited at each spot and if this all
works we will have completed our sample
app let's try I check in and indeed we
do we have geo-located ourself 2324
howard street san francisco not bad
that's actually pretty accurate and we
can see where I was previously at was in
a couple spots in San Francisco roughly
in the same area all one of them is
actually in the same exact area there we
have it our completed application so you
can see what we were able to develop in
a very short amount of time shall I say
with nodejs I hope you enjoyed it and I
hope I turned you on to a few things
that you didn't know about before I wish
you a lot of fun and good bugs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
