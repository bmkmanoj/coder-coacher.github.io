developer advocate working at Google
entirely focusing on web games which
means while the rest of the company is
off trying to optimize your search and
you're sharing and your mobile I get to
sit back and play video games all day
which i think is a pretty good gig so
what we're going to talk about today
which i think is a very important term
moving forward over the next few
generations of gaming that we've seen is
the future of web games we've seen since
about two thousand nine a large boom in
interest from sort of small budget game
developers coming into the ecosystem in
2009 we saw the rise of mobile gaming we
also saw the rise of social gaming and
an influx a massive amount of money and
attention and time diving into those
ecosystems trying to monopolize and make
a lot of money because they were new and
emerging and today we're going to talk
about sort of the web as a gaming
platform and what it means looking
forward now historically speaking I need
to give you a little bit of background
of where I'm coming from because they
think it's kind of set the tent for what
we're talking about today so I'm
actually from the games industry it's
been about 10 years working and making
video games as a hard core graphics and
systems programmer so when I got hired
on at Google to work on web games I
bring a unique perspective to it quite
frankly I had never written JavaScript
before working at Google so let's keep
that in mind when I say some things a
little bit later um this is typically
from the games industry what we view
most web development like right it's
very casual very easygoing I promise I
do wear shirt at work and most people at
Google do wear shirts but I thought this
guy was pretty incentive of it so web
gaming today is really where these two
things meet right you've got the casual
nature of open web and easy development
interpreted languages making it very
easy to manipulate the Dom to create
data structures to really create
graphics and make something that looks
very pretty but yet we're sort of not
really bridged over to the very
technical aspects of game development
yet the things that a lot of us like to
forget have been around for about 30 to
40 years we've been doing 2d game
development for 30 years right and a lot
of the techniques that made those
original games on those hardware run
fast are still applicable today in the
web but for some reason we forget that
that knowledge is out there and that
literature is out there and we're kind
of rediscovering all these things
so when I joined Google a little bit ago
this is really sort of the hype that I
kind of got in my face was html5 is
awesome html5 is everywhere html5 is the
future of cross gaming right write once
run everywhere and as a C++ developer I
kind of didn't I didn't believe it right
like I understood a lot about it
interpreted languages and binary coding
and anyone who comes to the table and
tells me you know one language is the
future of all things I kind of got like
okay why don't you have some beer we'll
talk in a couple more minutes right so
but being at Google I had to step back
and say let's figure out if this hype is
real and figure out where the boundaries
are sort of Mythbusters style so I set
out and actually created a game from
scratch I took about five engineers from
google who were all X game developers as
well these were guys that came from the
industry who had also written hardcore
graphics engine pathing engine server
technology for mmos I got them all
together in about six months we actually
wrote a top-down PvP shooter game
entirely in html5 the game's called
grits and we actually talked about this
and debuted and open source the entire
application at Google i/o just a few
months ago so the interesting thing
about grits was it allowed us from a
very unbiased standpoint to take a game
developers look at html5 as an ecosystem
again we are game developers who have
shipped console games and PC games and
mobile games taking a look at this
budding ecosystem that everyone says is
the most amazing thing since sliced
bread had been virtualized in a
holograph system so what we really found
is you can check out the game it's live
right now good scam appspot com you also
see the Lowell what icon in the corner
will actually teach you to the source
code we've got the whole thing open
source including a node.js back-end
that'll do matchmaking pvp gaming canvas
acceleration all the fun buzzwords that
you html5 guys like fuse so the cool
thing that came out about this was that
once we got the game done once we got
the game up once we did all the talks we
came to some conclusions right again
different different sort of perspective
here what we found were some very large
hiccups in the architecture of html5 as
a technology that really kept us from
exploring and stretching the boundaries
of what games could be performed the
first was garbage collection pulses you
need to understand that javascript is
actually a garbage collected
language right that's why can declare
VAR anywhere you want and you know
everything happens under the hood like
magical pixie does what will happen
though is if you notice when you start
doing tons of allocations over time and
you're not really nice to the memory
system sooner or later you're going to
start seeing large performance pulses
that are taken away from you by the
underlying javascript vm that are
dominantly based on garbage collection
we're trying to figure out what isn't
needed in yada yada these things are
actually spiking 30 to 60 milliseconds
every couple frames in situations where
we weren't being nice with memory right
so we just kind of came to the table and
said hey javascript should take care of
this we shouldn't worry about it but
once we started allocating about a
thousand objects two thousand objects
you know started doing 50 60 allocations
of frame we started seeing this tick up
a lot very very quickly in fact we
actually couldn't we had to take our
particle system entirely out of the
engine because it couldn't handle the
overhead of that many objects being
thrown around and of course there's
different ways around that but I'm just
talking about the naive approach that
you would typically see with your basic
welcome to JavaScript tutorial the next
thing is number of drawers per frame
this one actually surprised me we
noticed that JavaScript canvas even
hardware canvas maxed out at about 200
to 300 drawers per frame we were
expecting to get closer to what you
would get in WebGL which is around 2000
and to put this in perspective on
hardware like you're writing a native of
DirectX are opengl application you can
get about 16,000 to 30,000 and if you
schedule everything right with
instancing probably close to about a
million draws a second to be able to
generate your scene so the fact that we
were capping out about 200 or 400 was
really scary to us we actually had to
put in and you can watch my google i/o
talk about how we actually got around
this but we had to put a lot of stuff in
to actually get around it the third one
was compression Tyler did a fantastic
job of highlighting issues of asset
sizes since you know the games industry
began one of the biggest things we've
always fought with is size of the asset
versus size of the asset on disk what's
the size on the GPU how resident is
memory html5 really does not help us
with this at all html5 brings a lot to
the table allowing us to just
arbitrarily load JPEGs but a lot of what
to DJ need our texture blending so we
need an alpha channel that JPEG doesn't
support because of that we're forced to
use PNG's at a lower resolution or a
lower compression ratio of course
there's a web p on the horizon which
should hopefully fix this but that's not
yet been a standardized thing and
the browser's will adopt it but that's
to be determined in the future and then
finally is blending one of the most
important things in a 2d game is the
ability to blend to color tint
unfortunately html5 especially canvas
has no concept of this this it's nowhere
in the spec that you would actually need
to draw a bitmap tinted a color what I
don't get it right like this is one of
the big problems we ran into very
quickly in grits right we have a PvP
system where you've got team a VS Team B
for all the things we actually wanted to
color tint takes for extra draws per
item of your avatar so if you've got the
legs and you want to color tint the legs
that's four drawers into a separate
buffer that has to be then composited
back in the main screen if you want to
draw the top of the robot same thing god
forbid you you try to do any sort of
rotational variance inside of that too
so these four things when put together
kind of create a very limited picture or
more specifically it paints a picture of
success and where the boundaries are
very quickly now grits is up you can
play it you can actually see the
successes that we had and where we sort
of got the failures but the conclusion
we came to hopefully a pragmatic one is
with our sad panda faces because we
realized that html5 was maybe not the
greatest thing since sliced bread on a
holodeck but the main thing we came to
was that write once run anywhere is
really a pipe dream now before you guys
throw cabbage at me let me just step
back and say it again I'm a game
developer from C++ land right so to me
platforms are things that i explicitly
code for i expect to have a pound to
find somewhere in my code base that says
are you windows or are you mac or are
you linux right so for me having
JavaScript and not having the ability to
pound to find out sections of code
because knowing that my platform is
different is really really weird but for
some reason it seems like everyone
believes that html5 is magical unicorn
dust the truth is this html5 is a
fantastic standard but what we forget a
lot of the time is that html5 is running
in a web browser web browsers are native
applications most the time written in
C++ code the reason that your html5
emits unicorn dust into the universe is
because there's a whole series of
programmers sitting in a pit pounding
out C++ code on your behalf they're
putting in pound defines they're putting
in code that will make sure that your
javascript when written poorly at
a huge quickly that does not make a
platform that makes a standard right I
think we should all be aware of that and
I think it's worth saying that html5 is
not cross platform already anyone in
here written in html5 web site where you
had to say crap this doesn't work in
browser X that should be everyone's hand
like come on come on audience
participation you're an html5 summit
know you got pizza you got beer you're
not going to raise your hand come on
guys I'll raise two hands the fact is
this is that people say html5 write once
run anywhere html5 is a standard html5
is an adoption but in reality there's
this big ? like wait a minute why do I
have a different CSS tag for gradients
on rounded rectangles that can only be
used in Mozilla then I have one in
chrome versus WebKit versus XYZ it seems
like people forget this people like to
come to the table with this very
pragmatic you're a very hyperbolic
statement about how amazing html5 is
when they forget what's under the hood
they forget that it's already a
fragmented ecosystem this is a great I
don't even have to say anything about
this yeah hopefully you guys all got
this in your Twitter feed right someone
else presented this that should say it
all right html5 is not a write once run
everywhere technology if it was this
slide wouldn't even exist right I'm not
even a web programmer so what we're
seeing probably the most important shift
in html5 over the past six or seven
months is the exposure of hardware
accelerated items in a safe and secure
way to JavaScript what we're realizing
is that the interpreted language part
we've kind of got down you can do stuff
really fast so people want to do more
advanced things they want access to
webcam USB TCP UDP WebGL the problem
with this is that we're now taking
heterogeneous hardware which is known to
be troublesome and already platform
fragmented and we're exposing that to
something that's supposed to be
standardized and run on every platform
as though it were unicorn dust in the
environment right we all saw the unicorn
farting rainbows that's not how it works
and so this is fragmenting our ecosystem
even more because as web developers
approach the platform they're coming to
it with the mindset of the web rather
than the mindset of a hardware
programmer hardware programmers wake up
every morning to go
ah what do I gotta fix today on Linux
right web developers wake up and they go
sweet I get to ride a JavaScript API
like well that's my view I don't know
web developers have that voice or not or
if like either way but I know that I'm I
when I started working in the game
industry's I had a full lush head of
hair it was long and it was beautiful
and then I spent about six weeks
optimizing shader code for the
PlayStation 2 and it just all fell out
right anyhow anyone know this guy yeah
round of applause for John Carmack bring
it up for those of you guys who do not
know John Carmack John Carmack invented
the modern gaming industry he's the dude
who wrote doom who wrote quake quick two
quick three if you're still too young to
know what quake one was this guy
invented a lot of the original
algorithms and put them into practice in
video games that gave us the industry
that we have today you would not have
the xbox 360 and gears of war if it were
not for John Carmack John Carmack hosts
a will host there's a convention every
year called quakecon and John Carmack
kicks it off every year the keynote
where he basically comes up in rants for
about 45 or an hour and 45 minutes about
whatever he wants the cool thing was
that someone this year actually asked
him hey what'd he think about WebGL I
thought it was a great question right
Carmack and his company actually came
out of number of years ago trying a new
product called quake live where they
actually had you download quake 3 as a
plug-in and run it in your web browser
at the time they believe that this was
the correct monetization model for their
existing software right they had all of
this time all this energy pumped into
quake three why not put it on the web
unfortunately the web wasn't ready for
it yet and the product kind of fizzled
even Carmack came out and said ad is a
big flop now it's up today you can still
play it they're still getting
advertising money from it carmax view on
web GL was I think this is a great idea
but at the end of the day you know what
I want out of a rendering engine oh I
knew it I knew it I woke up this morning
I said Mac pushy you are gonna do
something to me today John Carmack came
out and said you know what I want in a
high-performance system the ability to
manipulate binary data and get straight
to the hardware with his least steps as
possible I'm sorry to tell you that's
not WebGL alright that's not JavaScript
I think we should all recognize that
typed arrays were added at the end of
JavaScript right it was not built that
way originally
okay webgl was added at the end it's not
necessarily a nice language if you want
to actually iterate through a million
item ray I think we just need to all be
okay with that so John Carmack actually
said you know if you want to do these
advanced things there's other
technologies out there that allow you to
do it in browsers and I think you should
embrace them right this is the same sort
of thinking that came to the table when
we decided to do this so when we talk
about the future of web gaming you need
to understand or my personal view about
the future of web gaming coming from the
industry spending time at Google talking
about the technology singlets forward is
the future of web gaming is about
experiences anyone know this this is a
human body viewer in WebGL now that's
actually a trick question this actually
isn't in JavaScript it's actually is
barely in WebGL all of this rendering is
actually being done on the GPU
effectively all the points are
compressed put together placed in a
texture sent off the GPU the shaders on
the GPU are handling all the heavy
lifting you could do this same thing
take the shaders take the data and
import to directx or opengl as a native
application would actually be very
minimal the amount of lifting actually
being done in javascript is small so
someone could say hey this is a great
experience to have in the web the
ability to give someone a link and say
here please explore my colon right we
write magic school bus goes to colon
town horrible book do not buy that for
your kids really weird stuff that
magical School Bus sorry so this is a
fantastic experience right it shows what
WebGL can do and what WebGL is capable
of doing but in reality again this isn't
WebGL this is in JavaScript this is
WebGL bypassing the heavy lifting off to
the GPU again for those web guys in here
who have never done native programming
this is a concept called GPGPU that's
been around for about eight years in
native graphics programming we've been
trying to offload as much the GPU as
possible in the games industry for a
very long time in fact when the xbox 360
first came out this GPGPU is actually a
big thing is the fact that it's just now
making into WebGL shows some progress in
the ecosystem unfortunately even though
we can do some things like that this is
sort of the experiences that were
limited to with html5 and I think
Tyler's talk was a great example of this
he talked about what the limitations are
you saw some of the limitations that I
that I saw with grits and what it does
is it for
you as a developer of an html5
application or or as a html5 web site to
kind of program for the lowest common
denominator right html5 should be about
reach that's what the web is right you
want to reach all 17-point umpteen
million billion people on the planet and
get your product in front of them well
you can't always do that if you're
targeting for the bleeding edge this is
the problem with game development well
not necessarily the problem is that it's
a triple orthogonal axis you're always
fighting against features versus
performance and cutting edge vs. reach
if you want to put your game on the xbox
360 and take advantage of the hardware
there that's fantastic but someone can't
play that same game on the web without
serious Rio architecture coming to these
conclusions about the hey dart anyone
dart anybody fans oh and so they coming
to these conclusions about what the web
was doing led to the development of dart
so for those of you guys who brother
taking step back let's look at this
again when javascript was invented it
was not designed for the web that we
have today I'm going to say that again
but a little bit slower when javascript
was designed it was not designed for the
web that we have today we're in a
completely different place than we were
when this was invented right we have a
lot of new constraints a lot of more
data streaming video didn't exist back
then it doesn't out YouTube how many
people watched you two today how many
people looked at a YouTube video today
thank you audience participation yes I
like it the beer is kicking in that's my
favorite part so the reason that dart
was invented by a lot of people was to
approach from a new direction hey what
if we take all of these limitations that
JavaScript has and what if we approach
you from a different direction instead
of attacking more things on to this
existing architecture that may limit our
ability in the future let's approach it
from what the web is today and take a
look at it from a new language
perspective and this word art comes from
it's a structured web programming
language you can find it at dartlang.org
if javascript angers you as much as it
does me like the fact that you can type
like player dot health- 10 and then
underneath it player dot heath plus plus
where Heath has never been developed
anywhere in your code base and Java
scripts like yeah that's cool you got a
new variable that's awesome I like new
variables and put them in anywhere you
know meanwhile I spend 10 hours trying
to figure out why would my rocket
isn't killing a dude when they hit some
the faith like is it now dart helps with
this stuff right so for those if you
haven't seen dart I'm going to introduce
you to a couple important pieces of it
first off is dart has as a nuance the
class hierarchy it comes with
object-oriented programming right this
is this is a concept game development
for a long time has been built on
object-oriented in fact that's the way
things work right having an entity as a
base class that a player inherits from
that a missile inherits from that a
bouncing missile inherits from this is
how we kind of do stuff because game
programmers are generally lazy right in
addition to that you'll actually see we
actually have the num class the num
class is optional typing you can still
come to the table and actually use var
and just let VAR be whatever you want it
to be at any time of the day but if
you're in the situation like I was in
where you need health to be an integer
and not turn randomly into a string
somewhere down the frame for some random
reason you can actually declare it as a
number and the dart VM will actually
come back later and say hey hey you're
trying to assign a string to an integer
that's not cool so it kind of adds these
boundary checking into the system to
keep you as a programmer legitimate and
hopefully reduce your porting time
addition to that there's some other cool
things I like about this and again I'm
not the dart guy I'm the web guy but but
I wanted to do a quick walkthrough here
import dart HTML this is interesting the
concept of being able to import other
libraries the concept that there's
modules of code that you're going to
want to pull in how many of you have
typed script source equals jQuery Minjae
s right I a million times right that's
the same concept we're already bringing
the concept of modules to JavaScript
we're just sort of tacking it on dart
makes that a first-class citizen and of
course they've sort of tackled the Dom
again from sort of a first perspective
like hey what do we do with the Dom how
we do it the point of dart is that hey
maybe JavaScript works for a tier of
experiences and maybe we need other
technology to get another tier of
experiences right if we can only draw
200 to 500 canvas sprites a frame
because of the limitations of JavaScript
maybe we should take it to another level
and this is where native client comes to
the table those of you who don't know
what Native Client is native clients a
technology that runs in chrome that
allows you to run C++ code in a web page
as native code
as securely as JavaScript and that's the
kicker right there's been efforts in the
past to try to run C++ code and web page
that may not have been the most secure
implementation maybe there was a lot of
malware involved with that process
Native Client from the ground up his
built first for security now the cool
thing about Native Client what you're
looking at here is an actual Native
Client game that you can play in the
Chrome Web Store today called Airmech
Airmech is a full player versus player
realtime strategy game so if you're a
fan of starcraft your fan of warcraft
command and conquer go try Airmech it's
fantastic fully 3d rendered all hardware
acceleration using simdi you know l2
cache optimization and actually running
assembly code hand optimized assembly
code because Native Client allows you to
do that this is a separate tier of
experience that you can only get when
you embrace a new tier of technology and
that's what Native Client brings to the
table now here's the really cool thing
that I want to spend a little bit of
time talking about in the concept of the
future of web gaming right so we talked
about these classifications so today
nakal just compiles to x86 and it
compiles down and that's what's cached
on your machine and that's what's
ranting exactly we don't necessarily
like that because there's a whole
classification of devices coming out in
the future I mean we've already got arm
out in the ecosystem who knows you may
get our mical or something in the future
the board may design some new thing so
we actually have something coming down
the pipe that you'll see the first drops
of hopefully q1 of next year called
pinnacle or portable Native Client now
pinnacle works a little bit differently
pinnacle take your C++ code and actually
compile it to llvm which is sort of a
open standard virtual bytecode system
and then from that when you actually
download it to your system it'll hot
convert it to whatever your lower
underlying architecture is which means
it'll go to arm or x86 or whatever comes
out in the future right it's supported
it's sort of the our version of the open
standard right here's the really cool
thing about this this means that you can
now use any language that compiles to
llvm to program web pages and
high-performance web applications you
like Python cool put in a web page you
like Ruby cool put in a web page you
like Lowell code my personal favorite
put in a web page have fun with it as
long as it goes to LOV m you can now put
in your web page which means the future
of web gaming is not about the language
I think the web community has
it too long arguing about does knakal
work should it be adopted what is
javascript how important is that
JavaScript us will get us so far it's
not about the language it's about the
technology matching to the experience
right especially when you look at it
this way what if we allow all these
technologies to work together let's say
we've got a game code you know sitting
around running dart or JavaScript let's
say it's doing some interesting stuff
and let's say we have a module running
3d physics and Native Client and these
two can communicate to each other now
you're in an interesting situation you
can do the flexibility of writing your
code in JavaScript or in Dart all the
dom manipulation you want but the
physics are actually calculated in
Native Client and you can get the
results back and update your scene
hierarchy in WebGL so now we're getting
the ability to accelerate the parts of
your web application with the code
that's going to actually do that you're
not locked into one language these
things can communicate back and forth to
each other this is an actual demo done
by one of our DP es at Google named John
mcCutchan and what he's actually doing
is this is literally a dart engine
running all of bullet physics in Native
Client and then bullet physics all it
does is just pass over the objects and
the rotation and the hierarchy back to
WebGL and WebGL displays it on the
screen this is really cool imagine if
instead of including jQuery on your page
you could include an entire physics
engine or a video decompressor ffmpeg or
what if you have an audio modulation
system that you can including your web
page for your users now we're starting
to get into really exciting parts of the
web we're not bounded by one language
we're bounded by what the experience
should be for the user and that's what
we should be focusing on can we do this
embed source equals bullet physics
Knakal that would be really cool if
jquery if it was easy to implement these
things as it were including jquery this
is my big vision if we step away from
the language and we focus on the
experience then we realized that the
games as an industry has been growing in
the number of assets over time today it
generally cost about 40 to 60 million
dollars to produce a game on the xbox
360 unless your indie arcade and then
you really just live off of peanuts and
pizza but that's a separate discussion
because those costs are so high because
of how much it costs to
produce the data involved right and I
think we can all agree that this is not
unique to game development I think it's
okay for us to admit that the web has
and always will be all about data gaming
has been all about data especially that
guy especially if you grab him in the
raid he's actually pretty hard but with
a new expansion pack he's not the raid
anymore he's off wandering the existence
trying to find the ethereal you know it
just played again anyhow the point is if
the future is all about assets and
experiences for the user then we have to
come to the conclusion that data drives
that experience which means we as
developers as web applications need to
understand how data changes the way we
look at the ecosystem for instance world
of warcraft i think is around 40 gigs of
content right now let's say you were to
make world of warcraft a web application
and somehow it got it into one gig of
data sending that one gig to a user if
you require them to have the full one
gig before they are allowed to see a
single pixel on the screen we take about
seven minutes on a 20 megabits per
second connection if you're lucky and
within 100 miles of the data server and
have perfect up connection with no
caching yeah I think I got all this
right if you gzip that hopefully your G
zipping the data right like you're not
sending raw text around you can actually
get that down to about 196 Meg's which
of course will change it to about 2
minutes transfer time so now here's
something that the web knows about right
it took a long time for web developers
to understand wait compression is
important bandwidth is important how
long it takes an asset to get from my
sight to the user is super important and
everyone started putting in this
compressed gzip stuff so you can set a
flag on your server to gzip the assets
it'll gzip it on your behalf and the web
clients will decompress on your behalf
the problem is that this is using gzip
which for all intensive purposes is not
the most aggressive one out there if you
look at the cutting edge of compression
probably my most favorite is LZ ham it's
actually an open-source thing you can go
grab it off of github it'll take that
same one gigabyte of the data actually
that's inverted sorry that supposed to
be 2044 gzip and 134 LZ ham can we cut
that out of the video
no we're live Oh everyone who applauded
for the live internet I guess I don't
one guy awesome my point is still the
same it's the beer anyhow LZ ham with
the proper value actually takes about
women in 18 seconds to transfer now
here's the important part we're not just
talking about transfer times which
directly relate to user experience by
the way right who everyone knows that
the web is ruled by three seconds if
your data is not loaded on your page by
three seconds everyone GTFO s because
they know the thing goes to go somewhere
else and get pictures of Laurence
Fishburne or whatever the flavor of the
month is I'm not even gonna say so we're
not just talking about transfer times
we're talking about costs too right to
transfer one gig to 3.4 million users a
day which by the way is the average
number of users that may how do I say
this without saying this the number of
users that may visit a very popular
social game that involves stacking pink
cows on top of each other right if
you're doing a good social game like
that you're generally seeing about 3.4
million users add a unique or not let's
just use that as a number now to
transfer that one gig to every one of
those 3.4 million users is about nine
thousand six hundred dollars a day now
hopefully if you're getting 3.4 million
users a day you can cover that cost but
this isn't a big number compressing that
down to with gzip gives you about two
thousand nine hundred dollars and LG ham
gets you down to about nineteen hundred
dollars at this point you have to start
asking different questions about your
data does the one gig need to go to
every user we have to think about the
data differently based upon the
experience right here's the most
important part about this is that
because of the fact that we have gzip as
a default implementation the browser
let's took take a look at this from a
different angle so what you're looking
at here is a graph of gzip ported to
JavaScript versus gzip ported to Native
Client ok so the y-axis here is the
micro seconds it takes and the x-axis
here is the number of runs over time so
basically we just decompressed a bunch
one gig compressed of a bunch of
different data sets right you can
actually see that not only is the
JavaScript version way higher it's
really spiky you can see that the
underlying hardware is try our the
underlying virtual machine is trying to
figure out what the heck you're doing
what are you doing with this binary
erase stuff this is
no we don't do this we like Dom it's fun
where the Knakal stuff is very
consistent and very low keel right so
when we start talking about the
evolution of the web and the data that's
coming through it we have to look at the
technologies that are going to enable us
to experience that so having the ability
to do LZ ham in JavaScript can't do it
putting LZ Hammond Native Client that's
cool stuff you're gonna have a good time
no South Park fans in here if you bring
LZ ham and you put in an akal you're
gonna have a good time great game realm
of the mad God anyone played it round of
applause for a realm of the mad gun this
is a gaming meet up and like six people
have played around with mad God realm of
the mad God is an amazing serious games
you shoot orcs what just come on serious
ok serious games I'm gonna shoot an orc
with an arrow and then go loot the body
for a bone from a ferret huh and this is
my Saturday night really we're gonna
talk about serious games sorry diatribe
alright realm of the mad god rel the mad
God is a fantastic game out on the
internet if you haven't played a go play
it's a great monetization system coolest
part about it it's only 1.29 Meg's for
the whole game it is an endless MMO it's
actually a full 2d massive multiplayer
game where you run around and shoot
people right it'll actually host
probably but i think they said their
numbers were above sixty four thousand
people on a server at one time like it's
a huge thing all fitting in 1.29 Meg's
if you transfer that to 3.4 million
users a day this cost you twelve dollars
this is thinking about data and
experiences differently right they're
coming to the table their understanding
what's important 1.29 Meg's transfer to
that many people it loads up quickly it
gets down there and it costs little
which also brings us to the next point
the future of the gaming is about
connecting with the user I love this
story in the modern ecosystem gaming
today unfortunately is about digital
distribution silos people spend a lot of
time as a game developer trying to
figure out how to get optimized and and
featured on this little 96 pixels by 128
pixel screen on your phone and they
spend a lot of energy and a lot of money
in a lot of time fighting to just get
that little piece completely ignoring
the fact that they can advertise to you
as a user directly right gratuitous
space battles is a fantastic game that's
distributed through a service called
steam the maker of the game apposite
Trek games
actually allows you to buy this game
their game that they've made from their
website in fact this is what have been
one of the big things about their
success over time if you go to their
website he has tons of buttons that you
can click on to give him money he makes
it super easy to click a button and hand
him your hard-earned cash because you
can get that right he is enabling you as
a user to get his content through the
internet he's connecting you with to you
in a different way and I think this it
has been the future of web games but
we've been locking ourselves into social
silos and digital distribution silos and
really missing the fact that as a game
developer you have the ability to
connect to the user how many people are
marketing majors awesome perfect i'm
talking the right crowd then marketing
majors are idiots and okay marketing
majors spent a lot of time talking about
region of interest and how do i track a
user and how can i make more users get
to my product marketing people hate the
current state of the gaming industry you
want to know why because if i spend ten
thousand dollars buying an ad to publish
to promote my game that exists on a
mobile ecosystem I can't push it in my
game I got to push you to someone else's
hub that has details about my game that
then you got to go through a
click-through flow that maybe you'll buy
it after that wouldnt it be better as a
marketing person to put that money and
drive you right to the website where hey
look you want to bite with Amazon cool
paypal cool Google cool give me your
money please I'm an independent
developer pasta tech games goes even
farther I love this he says on his
website hello I'm a human if you buy it
from my website I make ninety-one
percent of the money right I think we've
all seen that a lot of social platforms
as well as mobile platforms take cuts
and percentages he comes out and says
plea buy from me I get 91% I'm a human
guess what I have cats I need to feed my
cats
this is literally on his website you
should buy from me because I have cats
better yet here's a great thing he says
right here even if you don't buy for me
give me your email i'll send you some
cats that's internet marketing 101 right
when half cats will get email even if
someone just says sure I just want cats
he's now got an email address that he
can market to overtime hey by the way i
just added a new cat unit in my
gratuitous space battle game and i'll
sell it to you for fifty percent off
because you like cats too this is
marketing and a lot of game developers
are coming to the table today knowing
nothing about it completely forgetting
about it the internet and the web is all
about marketing and game developers can
break out of the shackles of these
ecosystems that are keeping them from
being successful if they only embrace
connecting with the user at the level
and the real reality is that the future
of web gaming is about connecting users
together here's a great flow and some of
the some in the audience is going to
raise their hand after this I know it
but I'm not gonna call on you let's say
I'm on a website random website don't
really know what this website is just
randomly like a picture of the internet
and photoshopped it unless say I've got
a button on the website that says start
a game let's say randomly that start a
game gets sent to some user who may have
another device don't know what this
device is just randomly took a picture
for some device that allows me to click
cool I've been invited to this game and
then I can play these two things
together across devices this starts to
get interesting Native Client enables a
new round of playing here right what
you're looking at is actually a game
called star legends that's running C++
code on Android as a native application
running native client code in chrome
right because of the same floating point
model because of the same system you can
actually do this I'm not saying they do
I'm not saying you should go Google how
to do this but I'm saying like what
you're actually looking at here is this
player is actually that guy right there
allowing multi-screen device this is the
new trend in the industry that we're
seeing single narrative multi-screen
single narrative multi-device and with
technologies at these experience levels
that we're talking about you can
actually start allowing users to connect
with each other in ways that we never
thought about before well the warcraft
has another great example of this they
have something called the mobile auction
house right so you can go kill this
massive 30 legged creature right and
then get the loot and then pick up your
phone or you know turn off your computer
go stand in line at the DMV wait to get
punched in the nose because that's
all the dmv's therefore and while you're
standing in line waiting to get punched
the nose you can sit there on the
auction house and sell the things that
you just got this is connecting users in
new ways with new devices and the fact
is that this isn't anything about the
client-side technology this is all about
the back-end technology this isn't about
the language it's about the experience
it's about the data that's what the
future of web gaming is and so with that
last slide and I know this is where
someone raises their hand I'm going to
add this caveat write once run anywhere
is a pipe dream for now right being able
to write in C++ code and distribute on
Android and write in C++ code and
distributed Native Client that's kind of
right once ish I'm going to have to have
a pound to find I'm gonna have to wake
up in the beginning of the morning ago
what do I have to change today to make
sure that this will run in a 16 by 9
ratio running on a raid on from six
years ago that may only have 60 for
memory 64 megs of memory on a GPU that's
the future of web gaming game
developments hard we should understand
that by God to him is it fun thank you
for your time my name is Colt McAnlis
this is how you get a hold of me I think
we got room square yo you can pause yeah
plus yeah climb it up I love it you got
time for questions yeah cool questions
please speak in the microphone because I
hear horribly and I'm bald so the
question is where is Native Client I
haven't been hearing a lot about it over
the past 13 months we've shipped over
two dozen games to the Chrome Web Store
that using Native Client technology and
you can actually go to go nakal calm
we've got a brand new updated developer
kit that includes a visual studio add-in
as well as a clip support that allows
you to develop this stuff and going
we've also got post mortems from all of
these developers that talk about their
experiences the pros the cons the where
they hit speed bumps and how you can
actually learn from their mistakes
moving forward the fact is that as a
development platform we are hyper and
aggressive about improving the developer
experience because right now it's a
little too hard and we'd like to fix
that so you're a second part of your
question was why am I not seeing in
another browsers to that one I just kind
of gotta go like this chrome is
open-source native client is open source
I think we can all agree that since
chrome has been open source we've seen
other browsers adopting some of the
things that chrome really does well how
many of the other brothers have
automatic update now that's kind of cool
right all we can do at this point
I mean we can't force these other
browsers to implement Native Client
right we can't go to the table and
expect me to do that all we can do right
now is show them how amazing this
technology is and what it can do to
change the way people experience the web
and hope that they see the value their
follow-up question is it going to be on
WebKit on Android anytime soon those are
two words that i am not the right guy to
talk to about so if you want talk about
games and the word chrome i can help you
out there now we got to question the
back here then i like your style I like
your style even more yeah that was an
uneasy laugh golang in pinnacle oh
that's a great question yeah so so I
don't have visibility into golang I
think it uses clang as the backend
compiler right no what does golang use
oh cool so cool it uses Frankenstein
mode that's awesome Thank You person in
the front room so really we don't know
just yet that's the cool thing about
portable Native Client is that if as
long as you're llvm code comes out to
obey these specific rules will be able
to hot compile it to whatever the
underlying architecture is again Native
Client and portable Native Client are
all open source if you happen to be a
genius in golang and llvm and you would
like to contribute that to our ecosystem
we will welcome you with open arms
again go Lange's not in my vocabulary
ring sorry he was asking you know
Google's got a bunch of geniuses are you
specifically working out that no
reporter from the New York Times I do
not know about that sorry I get those
weird questions like is Google taking
over the planet and games thanks Peter
great question he said in native game
development if you're shipping xbox 360
or any of those things there's usually a
rich set of tools that you use to create
content create scripting languages what
are you excited about in web games and
what tools are available out there you
know what I'm super happy about I'm
happy about the same tools that I use
for my native client for my native game
development there is nothing keeping you
as a developer from using Maya or 3d max
or your scripting language and exporting
it to a data format that can be read and
in JavaScript or Native Client or dart
like I want to make sure everyone
understands that like there's nothing
keeping you from using these existing
rich lush editors and content creation
systems that have made video games so
popular over the past 30 years and
taking that data and putting it on the
web there's no barriers there right you
just got to transform some data so if
there's nothing really exciting i see
like sorry I said that wrong like when I
look at it from that perspective I kind
of ignore a lot of the stuff that's
geared only for html5 or geared only for
action script or stuff like that because
from my point of view you know that
that's sort of a domain-specific thing I
can still use my I can still use
scripting I can still use max I can
still use all of these things that i put
together that i've known and game
development has used and there's a
million books &amp;amp; tutorials and examples
of out there there's more education out
there than you'd expect for game
development I think you had a question
are we all done we're done no sorry I
should okay all right hey thank you all
so much for today I appreciate your time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
