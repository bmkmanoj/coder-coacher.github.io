all right so can everyone hear me all
right yeah great
perfect all right well my name is Eric
I'm and my talk today is about intervals
and interval arithmetic so the title of
my talk is that intervals are unifying
uncertainty ranges and loops there's a
bit more to it than that but that's sort
of the I guess the big idea um so first
I should just briefly introduce myself
I'm members type level and one of the
maintainer zuv Speier along with Tom
Switzer who's also here and I like to
say this as that I have a sort of a dual
interest and expressiveness in
performance of this I would say this
talk is almost more about expressiveness
but I try and keep both in mind I feel
like that's a that's both are important
um and I do a lot of data science and
sort of data janitorial work at meet up
so that we're using some of this stuff
there I don't know if we're using
interval specifically but but we aspire
and if you want to look at some code
that I've written you can check out my
github page here great so just to get
started I try and make sure all my
slides are runnable Scala code at least
the ones that are Scala codes so you
should just assume that these three
imports are happening um this basically
brings all the types all the type
classes all the implicit operators just
like the works and it's really handy for
playing around and just seeing all the
different stuff you can do and you can
find the code for spire in the spy repo
so what will this talk cover well so
first I want to give a basic description
of the interval type and kind of more
just like what intervals are not just in
Scala but like in the world you know and
then talk about interval arithmetic
uncertainty error propagation a little
bit and then kind of talk about set
operations on intervals thinking about
them as set since an iteration more
generally they'll be like a little demo
I actually left my real demo on my other
my other pants or other computers so to
speak so I have like I sort of smaller
demo that I was planning but it'll still
be cool and then a conclusion intervals
and so some of you may who's like an
engineer who studied intervals or
interval arithmetic like for real so
like a few people so the early
this talk might be less interesting to
you all but hopefully the implementation
will be interesting the rest of you are
going to hopefully learn what this stuff
is early on
so the definition we're gonna kind of go
with for now is the intervals represent
a range of real numbers um so you might
say all numbers between 3 &amp;amp; 6 and so
already this probably sounds pretty
familiar because Scala actually kind of
as a DSL to express this idea in some
sense which is Scala dot range so we've
got two different ranges here on the
board you can see one of them is
inclusive using two and one of them is
xclusive using until so those sort of
seem like they fit the bill you know all
the numbers between 3 &amp;amp; 6
like I said there's two modes both cases
includes three there's really not a good
way to like exclude three from your
Scala range which there's a little sort
of an asymmetry there that's maybe a
little bit displeasing like I guess the
real question is do you think that all
the numbers between 3 &amp;amp; 6 should include
3 &amp;amp; 6 or not like what do you think
intuition wise who says it should
include it okay so we got dick may be
saying no okay
well look let's not do a poll it's fine
so anyway I'm sort of gonna argue that
actually range is not really the right
abstraction there's a lot of reasons but
maybe just the fact that the first is
always inclusive it's like a clue that
it's not really gonna work and just to
take a step back I mean there's in in
math class or various places you might
use intervals there's a sort of
established notation which I'm gonna use
throughout the talk um the thing that's
a little bit weird about it is that it
sort of conflicts with notation in Scala
so like that three comma six isn't a
tuple I want in the context of our
intervals I want you to think about that
as sort of an interval between three and
six but excluding the endpoints it's
exclusive so it doesn't have three
doesn't have six but has everything in
between I'm gonna try and be clear on
which stuff is Scala SIMEX and which
stuff is math notation but I do think
that this notation is really helpful to
talk about this stuff it's way less less
cumbersome so square brackets are
inclusive so that the Scala range with
two is pretty much what you get and we
can combine these so you can have one
side of the closed
the one side be open one side be
inclusive and one side be exclusive and
there's also some special cases that are
intervals that I just want to introduce
the notation so you can kind of
understand them so we've got the empty
interval doesn't contain anything empty
and then single values we can kind of
treat them as like degenerate intervals
there's you know it's an interval that
only has one thing in it basically and
then there's these other interesting
intervals that have the infinity symbol
and infinity is not a number right we
all know that but we can sort of think
of it as like a limit or a bound so when
we use infinity we're basically saying
that there is no bound on this side you
know it goes from 3 on up towards
infinity or from 0 down towards infinity
or it's just everything and those are
called an unbounded intervals so anyway
going back to range there's like a weird
sort of thing and this is kind of an
intuition that I want to get at which is
that someone already alluded to the fact
that Scala collections have a contains
that sort of bogus right wicked I think
my most of us can agree that Scala
contains is sometimes focus and you can
see here that it returns false for 4.5
and that's definitely not what we would
want I mean like you might want it to be
a type error but if it type checks we
definitely want this to be true I mean
for the definition of an interval I'm
not saying range is wrong to have this
behavior just then range is an
unsuitable interval for this reason the
interval 3 from 3 to 6 should contain
4.5 and you know one of the reasons for
that is range was written just to
support me and I mean it's very limited
I'm sort of picking on range like I feel
a little bit bad about this
you know it's like kicking someone while
they're down a little bit range is fine
it's just not very general like it only
does one thing and it doesn't do the
thing that I'm talking about here and
let's give a numeric range from it it
pretend like that doesn't exist so the
goal for our implementation in spire is
to support any numeric type you want not
just we're not going to settle on one
and then force you to live with the
consequences we want it to work for
everything so it could work for int or
double or anything that it basically the
number there's sort of another problem
another reason why range isn't very good
and that's actually that like I said
range range intervals have to be all the
real numbers between two bounds I don't
really want to get into much what
all means but basically that means not
only is there an infinite number of them
but like you could never possibly hit
all of them using like an algorithm that
we would write so basically what I'm
saying is you shouldn't have a size
method or a length method that just
doesn't make any sense for an interval
like it couldn't possibly do anything
and so since all Scala collections
pretty much have to have this stuff it
kind of assumed that you can like
iterate through and hit all the values
and sort of assume that you can call
length on it like we just shouldn't we
just shouldn't think of this as a
collection I mean maybe intuitively it
seems like a collection but I'm just
arguing that that's the wrong intuition
so yeah design goals should be defined
in terms of these endpoints not a
container should support the unbounded
intervals that's just because I think
they're cool and we should support them
and I wanted to be generic I want to
parameterize the number tight um I think
maybe some of you have heard this idea
of intentional definitions versus
extensional in terms of like sets or
something and so what we're talking
about here is an intentional definition
we want to describe an interval in terms
of like the constraints that values must
fulfill to be in the interval we don't
really want to like list all the values
out on a piece of paper because we do
that forever
everyone kind of with me so far is this
all making sense yeah mostly okay
you should feel free to please like if
you get confused or you think even if
you're not confused if you think I'm
saying something confusing please feel
free to stop me or ask a question but
anyway moving on let's say that we're
saying this open interval XY as an
interval of type a so what's the thing
that we really know well according to
the way intervals get talked about we
know that X is less than Y if they were
equal we wouldn't use this notation
we've used that point notation that I
showed you so we can sort of assume that
this is like an invariant that all
intervals have to obey you know with the
understanding like infinities not really
a value but maybe it's sort of you know
negative infinity in some sense is less
than all other values so that kind of
fits so but we definitely need to be
able to compare these a values to know
you know if our interval is valid or how
you know which numbers are bigger or
less than our endpoints and so in spire
we would use in order to do this you
know in Scala you might use ordering
Scala said I think has like I forget
what they call and think all the
ordering or
you know something like that it's the
same idea we just need to be able to
take any to a values and know if they're
equal or ones less than the other great
so that's pretty much we're going to go
straight into interval arithmetic
because this is what makes intervals
cool I mean intervals right now they
maybe seem like a glorified predicate or
a glorified type of set or something but
actually they're pretty they're pretty
awesome
so why bother creating intervals at all
and so a big reason like I think you
know the reason that this stuff got
started in maybe in the 50s or 60s was
for uncertainty about values in
engineering so you would say you know we
have something that's like three but
there's at all and error tolerance like
plus or minus you know some error
threshold like our machine is supposed
to cut things to meters but you know
there's a little bit of wiggle so maybe
there's we have to take into account the
fact it might be off by a few
millimeters or something and so that
that's kind of where you get this idea
of error tolerance and those can be time
as intervals you can also use it to work
with a set of values efficiently that's
that's another thing and there's sort of
other stuff which is that sometimes you
have a problem that's very hard to
answer exactly but you can kind of put
you know you have like upper bounds and
lower bounds where you know stuff is and
so sometimes if you just do the math
with these intervals you find you don't
need to know exactly you can say oh well
we can skip the hard work of determining
exactly what's going on by just using an
interval and seeing if the whole
interval happens to be you know like
above or below some value or something
like that or we can prove the two things
couldn't possibly be equal then we don't
really have to do the hard work finally
this is something I'm not really gonna
get into but there's a bunch of stuff
out there about how certain kinds of
distributed calculation really to take
advantage of intervals where due to the
fact that you know stuff's being
evaluated in different orders it can be
hard to unify the values you get at the
end so if you don't have intervals you
kind of have to start over if you if you
hit these conflicts but with interval
arithmetic there's a way to kind of
incorporate all the different inputs
from different workers to create you
know an interval output that ends up
being a really efficient apparently
that's not something if you're
interested in you can investigate more
so how do we use intervals to do
arithmetic the basic the mathematical
intuition here even though intervals
have an infinite number of stuff in them
you know this is math so we can deal
with infinity so we basically the idea
is you would just do the operations for
all the individual elements and
basically build the interval that
contains all the results so for this
example here I've got the interval 1 you
know wanted to with containing both 1 &amp;amp;
2 and I'm gonna add 1 to it what that
really means is that if you imagine kind
of like all the values in that are going
to have 1 editon what sort of shifts the
interval down so from 1 2 it goes to 2
to 3 basically does that sort of make
sense to people
you can i've got like a nice little
ASCII art diagram there that kind of
shows you like there's a number line up
there and you can kind of see that we've
got an interval from 1 to 2 at a point
and we add the point and then kind of
shifts the interval over that hopefully
it's not super confusing but um right so
I think this is a really if you're if
you find yourself being confused about
why interval or the peak is producing a
result I think thinking about this in
terms of these number lines it's really
helpful where you can sort of say oh
well what value could I take from the
first and take from the second to get
some value in the output interval
because that's really all the output is
it's just all the possible things you
could get given the inputs and so as you
can see here we don't just have to add
constants we can actually add two
intervals the same way so here's you
know from 1 to 2 from 1 to 3 you add
them the smallest value you could get is
you take one from both you get to the
largest you could get if you took 2 and
3 and get 5 and then just you know using
some common sense you can kind of see
that everything else is in between but
that's that's the way that's the way you
do and so even though we have an
infinite set of values we don't really
do an infinite mount over if we know
that because of the structure of the
interval we know that if we just handle
these endpoints in this case that's all
we really need to do we you know add the
lower end points at the uppers and
you're done some of the other operations
actually a little bit harder than that
but that's kind of the idea is you just
sort of rather than doing an infinite
amount of work over or doing the work
over a really large collection we're
just figuring out kind of logically what
are what are the possible things that
could happen and then just check those
and then and then be done so I say that
it generalizes to those other operations
like multiplication and stuff and so
basically we need we need what I'm just
going to kind of hand waving the call
well-behaved operations so obviously we
need the operation to be deterministic I
mean if let's say if you had a random
function they could do anything then I
don't even really know how you would
model that because you know who knows
which value in the middle would get
would get hit by some random branch and
produce something output you couldn't
they produce a deterministic interval
eyes and outputs so interval operations
like this shouldn't really rely on
mutable state or on non-deterministic
effects I don't think you know you could
maybe argue with me about that depending
on what kind of non determinism you're
talking about but in general I don't
really think it would work
and basically it to be more specific I
think what you really want is you'd like
the range of outputs to be determined
just by the endpoints and zero and like
maybe some other a few other points that
are that are known ahead of time so a
lot of times you know you can just check
a few cases and then and then get a
result we sort of need to be able to do
that and finally you just need to know
what to do in the unbound case so if we
have like an interval that contains
everything that doesn't actually have
specific endpoints so what do you do and
usually there's a pretty obvious thing
to do but I just mention it because you
could imagine a function where it
wouldn't really work and so spiars
interval right now supports all of these
functions I put at the bottom so you
know absolute value min and Max you can
ignore why there's a fee on the front
for now and then plus minus times divide
reciprocal power square roots and n
roots so a lot of I mean a lot of stuff
you might do with numbers you know not
everything like we don't support sign
right now because we sort of could
actually that would be fine but we just
don't and so let's jump to actually what
this fire code would look like so this
is some code that just builds four
different intervals using kind of four
different ways of constructing intervals
these are all gonna be intervals of
doubles and I've just been - own you
what the sort of two string output over
those intervals is on the on the right
and comments but there's four different
ways of specifying it so as you can see
in one case we just provide the bounds
and might default it gives us a closed
interval we can ask for a specific point
we can use this interesting sort of
error threshold plus or minus operator
or you can just basically say give me
everything above some value which you
know gives us the interval from you know
above zero to towards positive infinity
and so then there's just some simple
stuff we can do like checking to see
what's going on which points are inside
if it's empty or not and so on and then
here's some actual like you know real
interval arithmetic going on so I put
the definition so this is the same
values as the last slide I just put them
here so you kind of remind yourself and
then I'm just going to take a moment to
kind of walk through some of these too
try and motivate you know why we got the
result we did um you know I think the
first one's pretty straightforward you
know if you look at W we just we get W
times X by just multiplying both bounce
by two that's pretty straightforward you
know three goes to six five goes to ten
everything in the middle goes to the
middle of the output and then we can
take that result and we can shift it by
another interval so why why you see that
we now it introduces that little point 1
error threshold where it goes from
fifteen point nine to twenty point one
and so I think a lot of the engineering
applications of intervals are gonna be
more like values more like while you're
gonna have like a larger value with some
small error tolerance but those error
conscious might add up like when you
multiply or do stuff and so this gives
you a way to track that through larger
calculations like these couches are
still pretty simple but it could be
arbitrarily complicated right could have
lots of stuff and then as you can see we
can take the minimum of two different
intervals so Z is this interval that's
you know shoots off to infinity where as
x times y obviously doesn't shoot up to
infinity but you can see that we take
the minimum value of those intervals and
what we end up with is we know the
values gonna be greater than zero
because neither of those intervals
contain zero anything below it and we
know that the highest possible value it
could be would be twenty point two it
couldn't be larger than that because if
you know as you can see x times y is
upper bound is twenty point two so if Z
is somewhere up before its infinity we
just ignore it and take the smaller
value that's again that's kind of how
this works you know you you imagine all
the cases on one side on the other and
come up with a result and so finally
here's sort of a more interesting
looking calculation where you could
imagine like if Y is the side of a
triangle we're calculating the
hypotenuse basically of like a sorry a
right triangle where you know the two
the two sides are the same length so
we're y squared plus y squared you know
take the square root of that and that's
going to give you the length of the
hypotenuse so we can see that you know
if we wanted a triangle whose sides were
exactly 10 units but there's this error
threshold in our machinery you know the
the the hypotenuse the sort of smallest
it could be is this number and then the
largest F so it's maybe like a you know
point to a unit slippage there that we
have to you know our customers might you
know experience that that's like an
example of you know what might look like
do people kind of follow this I feel
like this
you know hopefully still pretty
straightforward but definitely let me
know if you were confused or something
and so actually even though I just said
the intervals are real numbers and I
sort of reified that now I'm kind of
saying that spires intervals actually
work for anything within orders so we
can make an interval of strings so this
is all the strings that are LexA
graphically between bats and cats
including the endpoints so cats with a Z
would not fit but batter does we can
also create intervals of option integers
you know if for some reason you wanted
that I kind of don't know why you would
but you could and we can have empty
intervals as well so there's an empty
interval of lists Long's because it is
possible for us to order order list logs
and so as I said you know you're
probably like why would you do that or
why is that even allowed shouldn't
everything have to be a number and the
answer is that basically we the way we
handle this is rather than restricting
interval creation to requiring like a
field or something like really
heavyweight powerful type class we
choose to do instead is let you build
the interval right off the bat but we
don't give you access to the
capabilities unless you have the type
class in hand that works so you know you
can't unless you have a way to add
intervals like a you know some kind of a
you know semi group or mono eight or
something we wouldn't let you add them
but we would let you create the interval
and you could then test to see if steps
ended or not
similarly if you want to multiply you
know you need something more powerful
take square roots and same thing so as
you can see you know none of these
things compile like you'd get an error
and to be clear the things that you
would you would need to see kind of tell
you what capabilities you need so
hopefully you all have sort of been
exposed to type classes I'm not really
going to explain if you haven't ever
used type buses in Scala then I
apologize but I'm kind of just gonna
assume that you understand the idea it's
been sort of around for a bit feel free
to come talk to me after the talk if
like you're confused better and want
some help with it but the idea is for
this purpose type classes are really
capabilities I think that's how you
should think about them in general is if
we have a generic type we want to be
able to do some stuff the type class
provides those capabilities so in this
case if we want to multiply intervals we
need the capability we eat is a semi
ring we need the properties of the semi
ring has want to take the square root we
need to both have a ring
and root instance and if we want to do
division we need a field instance so the
compiler will tell you that your type
doesn't have those things and maybe if
you think we left them out because we
were just lazy you can implement them
yourself but maybe you would find that
you actually can implement them because
the type just doesn't work that way and
and you know that's what functional
programming is all about basically so
there so we've got interval arithmetic
done and now we're gonna jump and talk
about intervals as specialized sets
because that's like another interesting
use of them and so I showed you how to
combine intervals using arithmetic but
you can also think about them as sets in
fact maybe it's more natural to think
about them that way
so as I've shown you I've created some
intervals here and we can obviously do
contains tests on them but we can also
do a whole bunch of other stuff too
which is kind of neat and most of these
operations only require the order so
they don't require like rings or fields
or that kind of stuff so you know you
could use a string to use it with an
interval of strings or what have you so
we've got like an intersection like a
Union we can we can test to see if
intervals intersect so that's often
really useful like if you have a
calculation that are supposed to be
equal a thing you can do is you can
evaluate them with intervals and then
see if the solutions intersect and if
they intersect that means that they
could possibly be equal you haven't
proven that they are equal we've at
least proven that's plausible if they
don't intersect you can be sure that
they're not equal there's no chance
right those intervals are disjoint and
we can also take like the opposite or
like the complement of an interval so if
P is an interval tilde P they're kind of
means every give me the intervals that
contain all the numbers not in P and so
you can see that instead of producing
one interval of perusal this because you
know you might take a chunk out of the
middle of the number line but you need
the bottom of the number line and the
top and that ends up being two intervals
rather than one so I mean you're never
really gonna get more than two intervals
but list was just like sort of a
convenient type to return and you might
actually get nothing so for example if
you have this interval that's all
numbers you compliment that there's no
intervals you're getting back so rather
than give you an empty interval we just
give you nothing because that's in some
sense like just as correct and here's
sort of a visualization of that again
another one of these great ASCII or
dagger
you've probably come to love for heat so
basically as you can see when we take
like the compliment of tea down at the
bottom we're taking a bite out of the
middle of this number line in other
words it goes off towards negative
infinity goes off towards positive
infinity but there's this little bite
eat now and you'll also notice that tea
included its endpoints which means that
it's compliments don't include their
endpoints right tea claim those
endpoints and so when you take the
compliment
you have to exclude them one of the
things if you if you implement
everything in interval arithmetic
yourself you're going to spend find you
spend a lot of time losing sleep over
you know how the bounds end up like if
you've got what kind of balance here
then what kind of bounce do you generate
on these new intervals that ends up
being you know very important obviously
to do this stuff correctly and as you
can see we can intersect to unbounded
intervals to get a bounded one because
each interval constrains one side but if
we Union them then we just get the whole
number line because one of them provides
all the load the negative numbers and
one provides all the positive again is
this kind of making sense yeah awesome
so then you might be like I really want
to something it's even more like a set
like those lists bum me out I just want
a single type that I can treat like a
set and maybe maybe there's two
intervals but I don't really care that
would be awesome and in fact if that's
what you want then
rudiger clan at least I hope that's how
he says his name but he's got you
covered he's got like a really nice
immutable interval set implementation
that efficiently stores sort of like the
various end points of a set of intervals
basically so you can you can you can do
this kind of stuff you can also get
spire intervals out of it if you want
again it's got its got good spire
Interop so I definitely encourage you to
check out intervals set if this is
something you're interested in and we
might try to include it inspire or
possibly like a contributed so this is
some of you maybe are worried now that
I'm talking about mapping over sets but
the question is can you map over
intervals if it's sort of like a set can
you map over the answer is you sort of
can't you can map over the endpoints so
here's like an obvious method that we
can write it does it great and you might
be like well why did you call it Matt
bounds
stupid to make up this name we could
call it maps perfectly well I don't
really want to call it map because it's
not really a map it's it doesn't really
behave like map and if you use it like
map you're probably gonna get burned so
you know if you're like an enterprising
functional programmer you're like great
you know let's use as few abstractions
as possible you know what you saw ruin
our stock and you're like yeah I'm gonna
do it and so you decide to implement
rather than use the built in or is
mystic stuff that I wrote you're like
I'm just gonna do it all with map bounce
map bounce is like super general let's
just use that and you're gonna find
yourself in a world of pain basically
because as you can see all these
functions that you might wish you could
just use map bounce for actually return
very different intervals and the reason
for that is that you can't just consider
the endpoints when you're doing their
intervals and you really have to
consider the zero and kind of how the
signs are affected and whether things
are getting reversed or not so like just
to look at the first example when we
square this interval from you know
negative two to two you know you and I
looking at it we can say that well you
know if you square negative 2 you get 4
squared 2 you get 4 but you square 0 you
get 0 so 0 is clearly like it's got to
be at least as low as 0 so it turns out
that 0 to 4 is the correct interval for
that but if you do only two endpoints
you'd say well negative 2 squared is 4 2
squared is 4 4 to 4 looks good right you
know done and that's just you know
that's probably not what you want I mean
it's certainly not like value normal
resume tick and similarly with negation
you might wonder what's going on here
what's happening is that map balance is
indicating the end points and now the
lower bound is greater than the upper
bound and you know just according to the
definitions or the way intervals work
that's empty I mean it can't contain any
values and so that you get the empty
interval when in fact you know you
probably wanted the same interval you
started with in this case I mean you
know negating - - negating to
essentially just flip - flip the
endpoints so map balance doesn't really
work and you may be asking yourself well
what can we do like fix a can we make
map bounds like consider you know like a
zero and do some other stuff and like
sure maybe you could I don't know I did
I didn't really think that was a good
plan so there's maybe a better way so
I'm gonna introduce Paul ANOVA and we're
springing it on you this talk didn't
have it in this summary but here we go
so polynomials are basically functions
of a single variable
we'd like a limited set of operations so
it's not like a function that can do
it's can it's a function that can only
do certain specific things it's sort of
like the stuff you might have done in
like high school algebra or something
like that so anyway here's some
polynomials that I wrote out their
functions in terms of X and that's
obviously not valid Scala code that's
more like sort of math notation that I'm
using just to kind of show you so as you
can see they just take X and they do you
know math stuff to it like they take
powers of X they you know add you
multiply by scalars add add other values
and so on
and so we can aspire has support for
opponent was just very cool and we can
use that in a couple different ways here
so there's this fancy string
interpolation which is kind of the
easiest way to use it but it's like a
little bit ad hoc I mean if you want a
polynomial rational number as I said I
think it's like by far the most readable
but there's also these two other ways
you can build polynomials if you want as
well and basically the idea is you're
basically saying for each power of X
what's the coefficient for that power
and in polynomial use generics so the
coefficients can be long or double or
rational or whatever you want anyway and
thanks to James Thompson for providing
quality law so what we can do here is
basically translate our interval through
the polynomial and because of the
structure of the polynomial we know that
the polynomial is well behaved therefore
we can be sure the intervals we get out
are correct so in terms of the stuff we
were trying to do with like minus X when
we translate through the polynomial we
get the right result and we can be sure
that translate will preserve the
interval correctly so so that's pretty
great I gotta rush to save some time but
on I was gonna show you how this works
maybe we're gonna skip it actually I'm
kind of low on time but um it's like a
pretty simple implementation from what
it does actually the idea is basically
you turn a polynomial a into a
polynomial of interval a and they just
evaluate the polynomial so pretty
elegant intervals of suped-up ranges in
two minutes all right so basically we
can think about what Scala uses is
ranging we can talk about the same
intervals so we can construct intervals
corresponding to scholars ranges I say
this again but basically if you're
looping over it and probably shouldn't
do this it's not going to be as fast but
there's a bunch of advantages over like
numeric range which is that you don't
need to specify a step intervals
be happy to just talk about a range and
you can once you decide what the step is
later you can use it but you don't you
can still do other stuff with it
contains checks are very fast much
faster than looking through a collection
you do math operations
there's overflow checking so if you're
using like double or I mean inter longed
for some reason you don't have to worry
about you know running off the top if
we're like a large step and you can
write infinite loops if you want great
so anyway so here's some folding in
iterations so we've got an interval we
can fold over it which ends up looking a
lot like a full left on a range we can
also just build iterators do the same
kind of thing and we can write this loop
that you know takes a step by 25 and
prints all the stuff so you know kind of
a g-wiz but it's interesting but there's
some fancier stuff we can do so if you
want to want to you can express your
loop conditions as intervals then you
can union them or intersect them or
whatever and that might be for you that
might be a nice way to do it um here's
like a method that I think lots of
people want but don't actually ever
implement correctly which is dividing
sort of us you've got a you know integer
number of steps like say like a hundred
or something but you want to divide it
by some weird number and you want to be
sure that the buckets are all the same
size and you don't really want
floating-point you're like you really
want the ends to be right and there's a
really nice way to do this with spider
so this is a problem you've had as you
can see like even with a divisor of
seven it like pretty much it hits all
the stuff correctly you end at three and
you've got infinite loops great so there
was gonna be a cool demo but I'm like
literally running out of time so caveat
s' don't use this with int if you wanted
to be really fast it's it's not
specialized and there's a couple other
problems like your order needs to obey
some extra laws when working with rings
and there's a few rounding issues of
double that come see me if you want to
know about them there's a few more
slides but that's it so anyway hope this
was interesting maybe encourage you to
check this stuff out and feel free to
talk to me about if you're interested
thanks
