technically 30 but I know there's gonna
be some questions so gonna do this fast
so if I talk too fast somebody could do
some gesture or something I hope this
will be this will be a ride for you
so I'm Victor clang I work for typesafe
anybody Know Who I am then I don't need
to do my bye oh yeah that's nice I'm the
tickling of vodka and I'm gonna talk to
you about scaling up and out with actors
today but technically I'm gonna talk
about ocotilla though because we
released it earlier this week so I might
as well just upgrade things a bit so
akka comes from the Sami language and
it's the goddess of wisdom and and and
all the good things in the world also
happens to be a bad word in Finnish and
that's the view from the summit so it's
it's pretty awesome so in case you
didn't know the problem that really led
us to build akka was that it's it was
just way too hard to build correct
highly concurrent systems and to make
truly scalable systems and to actually
make them fault-tolerant the self
feeling without making everything feel
like a duct-tape piece of junk so state
of the art tools right so the vision is
to have concurrency scalability and
fault-tolerance made simpler it's easy
to do it so how do we do it well we want
to manage system overload because
there's nothing as bad as you wanting to
log on to your internet banking system
because the stock market crashed and
everybody is just dying to get in there
and nobody gets in there
and we want to be able to scale both up
on one huge box or scale out on multiple
boxes or even scale down so you can run
a con an Android phone or whatever so
scaling in the sense of up and out and
elasticity and we want to replicate and
distribute for fall photos because you
can't really have fault tolerance
we have a single single place breakdown
right so this also leads to be a good
thing to have transparent load balancing
because if you have a big system and you
want to be able to manage failure you
want to be able to move things to where
there is least traffic at the moment or
where there's more RAM available or more
CPU available so who uses akka what is
it good for and where can you use it so
this is just like a sample of things
like a sample of market segments or use
cases but mainly like finance banking
betting and gaming telecom and TVE
ecommerce simulation social stuff which
is essentially like a common denominator
for where you have lots of transactions
happening and usually varying amounts of
transaction so payday is probably going
to be more transactions at the bank or I
don't know social things probably gonna
happen some some stuff at certain points
of time so arca to that oh why did we
make a tutor though what what is it and
and what did guide us during the process
of going from one @ix to - Turo so to
really make a tutor though you have to
have some vision on how you want to
improve things so one of our visions was
to design for distribution so if you
design for distribution then in vm stuff
becomes an optimization opportunity so
if you build it they're designed it for
distribution it's way easier to do
distributed computing and then optimize
when things are local we also wanted to
take a synchronicity at heart which
means even in the control things so
creating things destroying things
because when you make it a circle it's a
heart it doesn't feel like it's some
sort of hybrid thing that works
differently in different ways and it
becomes really hard to reason about how
it works so even for control things you
want things to be asynchronous
locking and performance on the JVM is
really bad when you have contention
so Casas mother and Casas father so
everything should be handled you seem
like volatile reads and writes or
compare-and-swap instructions this has
led us to have several locks in the hot
path which the difference in performance
is astonishing also a problem with the
one that x-series was that fall pterence
was sort of a thing that you could
choose the formulas that people normally
don't choose things they don't have to
choose so you would write something and
then at the end it was like okay now we
make it robust no you can't do that so
we want to have full tolerance as the
default so we introduced something
called enforced parental supervision
which means that all actors have a
parent and the parent is in charge of
supervising the kid also one guiding
mission is that there's always room for
improvement so simplify things we factor
things replace things that are that are
bad there's always room for improvement
of course you have to pick and choose
your fights but question everything and
try to see what could be done better so
would that be like a simple version bump
like 1.3 like yeah we just bumped the
number and let's be over with it no
technically we closed 700 tickets we
have changed over a thousand files we've
added approximately 100 K lines of Scala
code removed 57,000 lines so to get to
like the scaling up and out part of this
presentation of making looks like a list
of new things added how do you scale
things up well akka has actors but it's
only one tool in the toolbox so we have
futures we have data flow we have tight
actors we have agents but actor actors
is a good way of scaling up so it's one
tool in the tool
box but it's not necessarily D tool in
the tool box there are no golden hammers
not here anyway so in case you don't
know what an actress I'm gonna try to
bring you up the speed within this
within the time limit so how many of you
know about actors awesome so this will
be like just refreshing you guys so an
actor is just an entity an encapsulation
of some behavior and potentially some
state and it has a mailbox full with
with messages and the the circles here
are messages so a thread gets allocated
to the actor to take one message apply
the behavior of the actor to that
message and then potentially updating
some state creating some new actors or
sending messages to other actors or a
combination of all of those new messages
can be added while this is happening
concurrently since there is elasticity
between the processing of messages and
the addition of new messages and then
when the processing of the message is
done the thread gets it D allocated from
the actor and it can go on to process
some other actor or even go back to this
actor to process the next message
so in our Cathedral we decided to take
like remove all global states there is
no global state we want to be able to
have multiple actor systems within one
JVM without having to do all this nasty
classloader magic so we introduced
something called an actor system which
is the context of your actor application
so this is how we create it in in in
Scala you'll notice that it will say
skull API everywhere because I filter
out the Java stuff because your about is
interested in that as there's no guy now
the thing is that the Java API is really
good it sort of looks the similar assist
but we don't have time today so what you
do is that you specify a name for your
actor system so what is this what is the
name of this actor system and then you
can feed it an optional configuration
and this uses the the whole Khan library
the typesafe config library really nice
embedded into akka for your use all our
defaults are in config files there are
no default inside code which means that
if you want you you can override
anything and we've tried to be really
slick with choosing what goes into
configuration and what goes into code
because it's really important that it
doesn't become like a new thing where
you program in your configuration but
you really want to have things that you
would like to change when you're
deploying your application depending on
what kind of hardware you're deploying
on are how you have spread your logic
out on a certain cluster of machines or
whatever so things that you would like
to change when you have built the
application should be changed in the
config and not in the code make sense so
for you that have used akka before this
is very very similar like line by line
similar to akka 1 or X and this is how
you create an actor so you just extend
the akka actor actor thing and implement
the receive method which is essentially
just a partial function from any two
unit in this case we make an actor that
just received thick messages update some
counter and print out the current value
of the counter then to instantiate this
actor we have something called actor of
and in 1x it was like a static factory a
global factory now it's a property of
the system so this creates one instance
of the counter actor in that system and
gives you a handle back and act
reference when you can see the props
thing there so an actor that doesn't
have any props is probably doing some
sort of adult movies or something so an
actor in akka usually have props so this
is like how you configure how this actor
should be created this is like the type
of the actor what dispatcher it should
use there's
or configuration that will show later
but this creates a top level actor and
this is important because I'm going to
show you how the structure looks later
when the actor is returned to you it's
already started or it's going to be
started asynchronously so you send it
messages and it will process those
messages after it has started you can
also stop your actor and you just do
system stop and the reference of the
actor and then the actor will be stopped
asynchronous so you won't do any block
in there either but it will also stop
all these children so you can
essentially eliminate a sub-tree in your
application so sending messages still
looks quite a bit the same
so bank this is blatantly stolen from
Erlang it's the asynchronous send
operation so it's just far and forget'
move on it's like the tail pattern so we
have given you an alphabetic name for it
as well for those of you who do not like
symbols and it's a bit easier to use
also when you want to explicitly say who
is the sender of the message and the job
api essentially looks the same we have
removed bang bang and bang bang bang
because at the end it sort of got silly
right so we only have till and this is
asked but it also has the name of the
question mark so it's essentially a
request reply pattern so you send an
actor a message and then get a future
back with the response to this to this
message should be used with caution
because if you use this everywhere sort
of get an RPC style application if you
also use ask like this if you want to do
that and sort of pimped on we because
we've added it to the akka patterns this
kind of reads better at times when you
want to specify different timeouts for
these things alright so in one that X
reply was like there was probably like
three or four different way to do
replies getting channels out getting
sender future options and sender options
and now you have sender that's that's it
you have sender and you can send it
messages it's an actor s so even if you
used ask you have an actor if
representing that endpoint that will get
the response back we also still have the
become operation to have the actor
change behavior and we have the Java API
for that which looks a bit more
interesting on become to swap back to
previous behaviors because it's a
behavior stack so you can choose when
you replace your behavior you can stack
the new behavior or you can just replace
the behavior so you can also unbecoming
the stack a new thing into todo is
something called routers and they
essentially replace actor pools and load
balancers so we have round-robin routers
so it will when you send a message to
your router it will just round-robin
over the children by passing that the
mailbox of the router to have it
high-performance things that doesn't go
through one serialization end point we
have the random router which just since
the one random child smallest mailbox if
you want to make sure that the guy with
least work queue it up gets the message
there's broadcast if you want to send to
all children
there's scatter gather first completed
which is essentially saying send to all
your kids and the first guy who responds
give me the result there so it's good if
you have set up some sort of cluster and
you want to have a result of Aquarion
whoever responds first wins you can also
implement your own custom routers if you
have like some special special needs and
the way you use it is that you have your
props as we talked about earlier you say
with router you specify your
and then you specify the configuration
for that router and that's all and then
you get an actor if back that represents
this thing abstracts over some actors
five of them and it will round-robin
over them you can also combine them with
resizes and we have one default
implemented so you have the actor pool
the elasticity of the children so you
can grow and shrink on the demand and
the way you do that is that you just
specify a resize or to your round-robin
router or whatever router you use simple
so scaling up how does this scale up
well we did some performance benchmarks
because we were using thread pool
executors under the hood to execute
things and sort of a pattern emerges
after after some messages there can you
see the pattern that's not the scale-up
pattern so we scratched our heads and we
we elicited some advice from from some
people and we had a look and we saw
that's an incredible amount of context
switches that's extreme that's
essentially just thrashing your machine
so we elicited the help of Doug Lee you
might know him to improve the fork/join
pool for Java eight to be more scalable
so this is the results we had on our 48
core box
compared to the thread pool executors
quite a big difference and it it will
probably be in Java eight but it's
available from the jsr one six six y
package but we've embedded that into
akka so it's the default executor so
around 20 million messages on that 48
core box it will definitely be different
how you use it what type of messages and
what the processing overhead is and
whatever but it's still way better than
the thread pool executors and it looks
way better in the context which
Department
so yeah so the question is whether this
measurement is only for the message path
you know for actual work so yes it's
only for message passing because
otherwise we'll just measure some adder
in the C key or whatever yeah it's a
very bad use case it just measures what
I can you do we've optimized things a
bit so an actor is around 400 bytes so
essentially 2.7 million actors per
gigabyte of heap of course you will have
to add extra memory for messages on top
of that but says how many actors you can
use now we come to the fault tolerance
part of the presentation and we have
approached this from a let it crash
perspective and that comes from Erlang
and essentially means that you shouldn't
try to prevent things from going wrong
you should only have good decent
procedures to handle failures so in a
normal application of all applications
you would like okay if I look at this
applications which parts have critical
important state and explicit error
handling and it usually looks really
really bad because it's just scattered
across all these objects in this graph
and there is no real order or
responsibility here so there's something
called the error kernel pattern it's
essentially like an onion so you have
the core part that you need to protect
and then you have layers on top of that
so if things go wrong at the very core
then your application is host anyway so
you have add layers of protection around
the core and what what that means with
actors is you have actors being parents
of other actors and supervisors for
other actors and they spawn children
underneath to delegate the risk to
somebody who is expendable so
if your kid if your kid sort of messes
up it will signal its parent and the
parent will decide what happens to the
kid right you can also have so that when
a kid fails it notifies the parent and
the parent can decide to say that all my
kids they have some implicit thing that
they have in common so they have to all
be restarted if something goes wrong
there their couple in some way and you
can also escalate problems so the middle
manager doesn't know what to do
so he fails and he escalates to his
manager and this manager decides to just
recreate whatever was underneath
so unless failures escalate to the
actual kernel of the system you can
always deal with them so how do we do
this innaka so we have the parental
automatic supervision in your actor you
have access something called context and
your context can also create actors
which essentially means create a child
from me
so system actor is create a top-level
actor in the error kernel and this is
create a child for me and you see the
name afterwards this is the name of my
kid I have to name my kid otherwise I
could name it for you and it won't be
pretty and also we've removed you you
IDs from any output because you IDs are
horrible in output so only names and
paths so this parental automatic super
supervision means that you have a
top-level actor that's the Guardian that
system Guardian for this system and when
you create a top-level actor that will
be created underneath the Guardian so
you create a foo and he goes underneath
the Guardian and he creates a child
named a underneath him and he creates
other child's and other children and do
you see what this looks like looks like
a tree right so when you have a tree you
have this really interesting thing in
computer science called path
where you can like get to things through
paths and we thought that was a really
smart thing so when you look up actors
you do it by path so you can really
reuse what you're used to when you work
with computers from the system level you
can just look an actor up or within an
actor itself you can do relative lookups
who is my parent I want to go to this
who is my sibling and you can also get
to the actual path over the actor this
also means that we can do some really
interesting things like doing selections
on top of the tree so I want to have
something that represents all things
under services and when I send it this
message it will go to all of them so for
the supervision like how does the parent
decide what to do the kid so there are
two different things that won't for one
strategy and all for one which
essentially means do all the kids suffer
when one has done something wrong or is
it just the kid itself and this is the
how you define like how it will handle
failures so in this case whenever a
child has the actor killed exception you
will stop it if there is an arithmetic
exception I will just resume the actor
because if he divided by zero and that
guy but he can probably do something
else you can also decide to restart him
which will essentially recreate him and
repopulate him so something could have
gone wrong within him we need to create
a new one of them and restart them or
you can escalate to say okay I don't
know how to handle this let my parent
decide yes
this is message you know all the
messages in the mailbox are retained in
restart if you have multiple je tiens
supervisors
we can talk about that afterwards yeah I
don't have it in the slice so and to
switch between them it's fairly simple
just replace the wording you can also
specify like how many number of times it
will actually try to do something about
it and also like the time window that
things can occur within so within the
first failure like within five minutes
after the first failure
I will accept you to restart ten times
if that things go wrong more than that
something is terribly wrong and I want
you to escalate this and within restart
you have two hooks that you had back in
the One X series pre restart is called
on the old actor and post restart
excrete is called on the new one so the
question is which thread the these
messages are called on these are called
on the actual dispatcher
so whatever dispatcher the the guy is
using so it will depend on how you
configure it up we have something new in
our kotero which called Deathwatch
and since supervision is only once you
can only have one parent and the parent
supervises but you want to be able to
observe when somebody else dies so if if
buddy dies I want to know and you will
get a terminated message with the ref
that died so then you can match here
said if it was exactly buddy then I will
do this you could also unwatched to say
that I'm no longer interested in Buddy
because he's a douche or something
so scaling out in five minutes
we have new remote actors so sending
messages to actors that recite on other
machines this looks the same as before
like we just create an actor with a name
your code is agnostic to whatever like
how it is deployed so the actor name is
virtual and it's d-cup of amount is
deployed if you don't have any
configuration for a path or for a name
then it is assumed to be local so you
can have the same system the same code
deployed differently depending on how
you want to deploy it so you write your
application as if it were local and then
you can deploy it like distributed this
also will allow us in the future
releases to dynamically and change the
type of the topology of your system to
scale up and out on demand and this
looks like this in the configuration
this path has this configuration I want
it to be have a be a round-robin router
it will have three instances and I want
them to be created on these nodes in my
topology this also means that you can
have remote supervision so one sub tree
is on one machine and another sub tree
is on another machine and some more news
in the tournedos stuff is that we have
an event bus API for making it dead
simple to do pub/sub there is something
called an event stream within your
system that is the the firehose of your
application so you can publish messages
to the event stream and other actors can
listen to the event stream if you want
to decouple your actors from each other
so that they do not need to know about
each other
we have extensions you can extend akka
itself typed actors for example is an
akka extension the sierra ly station
used for remoting is an extension
essentially there is no limit and how
you can customize your arc application
add functionality we have replaced the
use of SDM to the Scala SDM
it's like a like an API standard so you
can use whatever implementation that
implements Colosseum and we have
reimplemented typed actors to use JDK
proxies instead of weaving
so there's they are now in the akka
actor jar there is no external
dependencies and they just work so
what's happening after to that oh so
what we want to release as soon as
possible is our camel module and our
AMQP bottle and our spring module we're
going to wait until they are ready but
they will hopefully be ready within a
month or two so that is what happening
into that node up whatever they will
probably be back released to to that oh
so it was as if they were there the
entire time because they don't need any
changes in akka itself there are
extensions as well this is where we're
at we have a brand new website at akka
io check it out check out type safecom
and that's it for me thank you
yeah so the question is in a multi
machine environment how will akka help
me if I lose a machine so in in akka -
righto we don't do any sort of trying to
find out which node failed how because
it's really hard but in 201 we're gonna
have a brand new cluster which is based
on on the Dynamo paper on some thoughts
behind react but we have adopted it
because clustering is normally just
trying to cluster data and we're trying
to cluster live objects here so there's
gonna be some differences but then we
have a much easier way to have consensus
on failure because it's just not
responding to you is it responding to
everybody what one or is there some
other problem so that we will address in
the tutor one release when we have a
bigger picture of what's failing because
if you only use remoting you have
machines connected to each other and
then that's a nice applause for that and
then it's it's hard to know like he is
communicating with him but not me
anymore what happens if he sends a
message to him and then a message to me
there is no consensus on who is alive or
dead yeah so the question is if typesafe
is gonna have like a platform
as-a-service collaboration with with
some of the I don't know it's it's time
will tell it will be really cool to see
like ad-hoc scaling of Arc applications
absolutely okay so the question is when
you're starting with alka how do you
choose between typed actress and and
untyped actors so typed actors see them
like a doorway between normal request
response code and asynchronous code so
they're more intended to be like the the
interface between different different
kind of paradigms of programming I would
try to avoid typed actress because it
easily becomes you you try to have the
same thinking but you're doing something
completely different so they don't
really harmonize so pick and choose
where it makes sense to have a static
interface and always try to either have
like a void return type
or return a future because that means
you're not doing any blocking you're
just forwarding stuff so try to see if
it makes sense to use type actors or
just go for untyped actors immediately
so the question is what happened to the
OSGi support the thing is that OSGi is
something that you have to like
continually test and run and there
hasn't been really that interest that
there has been any parties that wanted
to use a which di during the test phase
that really didn't really make sense
then also the ARCA actor jar itself is
really tiny so if you want to just
deploy the ARCA actor jar I'm sure it's
just like two or three lines of
configuration to just use that bundle
could be harder because we're using some
misc unsafe for example you will have to
do something some stuff is really hard
to do in an OS GI world so hopefully it
will be there I don't know if there is
enough interest there will probably be
there yes so the question is if we have
benched my own different JVMs
technically yes but formally no we run
on different machines with different
versions of JDK s and for example the 48
core box is running on Linux so we do
benchmark testing but we don't really
have like a formal set up where we have
like the exact same hardware different
operating systems because it's it's way
much overhead but it's always I would
love to see numbers so if you guys put
up numbers I'd love to see them yeah oh
so the question is if there is like
built-in support for versioning innaka
so you can have different versions of
messages or actors so the thing is that
for the types of subscription you have
the the APIs monitoring for your
application and we also want to support
provisioning so you can roll out new
releases technically you don't want to
do that with with a live system you
always want to create some new nodes and
take some notes down because it's always
sort of hard to do a compare and swap on
code but that's definitely something
we're working on okay so the question is
if akka is mostly geared towards
stateful architectures and how it
handles stateless architectures so
there's nothing really that says that an
actor needs to have internal state but
since you have messages you have state
already and since you're sending and
receiving messages you're actually side
effecting in you're actually sending
States somewhere or receiving state from
somewhere so you can do completely
stateless actors and just have your
state in your messages and have your
messages be on some some storage
somewhere so there's there's really no
need to have stateful actors if you
don't want to or whatever the
requirements are so yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
