and longitudes which is just numbers and
there'll be times that we want to make
that human friendly and human readable
so we're going to drop some code in
that's a chunk of code that'll help us
do that we're going to make use of a web
service called YQL and we're going to
actually piggyback on top of Yahoo's
query language that does some reverse
geocoding which is translating latitude
and longitude into human friendly
addresses let's take a look at the code
take a look at the index post J's file
that we add in a quick overview is we
are requiring this request module which
we haven't yet added we'll add in just a
second this is the rest api for making
the request turning our latitude and
longitude into something that's human
friendly we will be exporting from our
module a what we're calling reverse geo
or rev geo function that takes a lot of
tune longitude asynchronously figures
out it's that magic word a synchronicity
finds out if we actually have an address
is it a good address and is there
something we can do with that address or
not and then we make this function
available to anyone who uses this module
we need to plug this module in to our
code let's head back to op je s towards
the bottom we're going to add one more
and what we can see here is also a peek
into how express works Express is pretty
human friendly when setting things up
we're going to set up a post versus a
get interceptor
plug in our function we just made save
and before we test we need to do one
thing we are including a really
wonderful module called requests that
allows us to sort of humic human
friendly requests HTTP requests inside
of node.js so we're going to NPM install
request at a particular version and
magically save it to our dependencies so
that when we save our code in our repo
we don't have to remember to write it in
ourselves in just a matter of moments
let's test things out our code runs we
check in and we can see back in the
terminal that yes we are getting the
information from the browser there is no
error and we are at San Francisco
California 94 105 wherever that is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
