keynote at Q con London what is it about
it's about software engineers from what
they need to know for successful
projects with machine learning and
artificial intelligence I hate to think
that there are software engineers out
there who are not getting into ml
because they think it's not for them
when in reality a good machine learning
project is just as much software
engineering as any other software
project we're working on today curious
about that use you said machine learning
is software engineering can you expand
on that machine learning is not the end
it's the means to the end you're trying
to build value for a user or for a
customer or for a group of customers and
getting that value out to those
customers requires just as much naught
so for engineering practices as any
other project you might work on not to
mention that actually building the
machine learning model itself requires
immense amounts of iteration data
preparation and just engineering rigor
it's just software engineering with
different algorithms absolutely you also
mention as we were kind of talking and
prepping for your talk a relationship
between DevOps and machine learning
what's that relationship there maybe the
best way to describe it is the ante
relationship which is the anti-pattern
of having a data science team or a
machine learning team who are one two
three four steps moved from the actual
products being built now of course
that's just completely dysfunctional the
team building the software delivering
the software don't know what it does and
the team working on what it does don't
know how it's built or delivered so it
doesn't work to segment the valuable
business logic from the delivery of that
logic you have to you have to co-locate
those teams do it's cross-functional
teams kind of cross-functional teams
it's exactly that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
