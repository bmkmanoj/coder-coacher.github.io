something else so let's talk about the
database so so far what we've got is
we've got this part going on right we
have some kind of service and we can
verify the data is there well we don't
have a way of putting that data in the
database right we don't have a way of
persisting that data now Android chips
with the built-in database it's a sequel
I database anybody use equalise before
okay so sequel light lives on its sequel
I work and it's basically a very small
database some of the key features are
its you can meet in Tanner but this is
basically these are the key features
right here so it's basically
self-contained service zero
configuration transactional sequel
database it's in a public domain right
so in other words it it's the entire
file is all you need if there's no
server there's no process running right
it's just a library there's nothing to
configure unlike my sequel right not
much gas to be configured there's
actually nothing to be configured at all
it is transactional and it's a public
connected domain so these are all the
good things I guess what's missing is
another feature is that it's portable so
the faster or supportable across
partners now I would add that to the
list so but that's about that's a little
bit about support so Android built
bundles this thing in so what we are
gonna do is we're going to create a
an object it's gonna provide us with the
data for our database it's gonna allow
us to basically put data data in the
database and I usually call this object
status data so it's not gonna be a it's
not the main building block it's
something that's part of this project
right so let's do this let's create a
new Java class in this case it's just a
forger they know Java object to status
data right so stylus data doesn't have
it's not extending anything yet but what
solace data is gonna do is it's gonna
have to define some constants it's gonna
need to define a whole bunch of things
that we're going to use later on so
we're gonna define it's gonna be a
simple file but it's gonna have a lot of
constants right so let's take a look at
first of all the data that we're dealing
with what we get from Twitter I look at
the documentation this with your status
guess
it's got a timestamp when it was created
but it's got the idea of the message I
replied to retweet count source text end
user I usually ignore these three
because they're not that relevant right
so focus usually on just on when it was
created what the idea is the text
message and the user that the user okay
now user in itself is a as you can see
is an object as a class right so if you
go into that you can then find various
things about this user so I usually use
user dot name the display name right you
can also do use a screen name and so on
so far so good so so let's define those
as columns that we're gonna need right
so we're gonna care and these are gonna
be bunch of public static final string
usually the identified the call measure
CC kasi underscore column right column
ID in the naina score ID
created at with the timestamp
and then we have final monies the column
text which is gonna be you know you
can't name it text because that's a
reserved word so it call it's status
text
someone got
so far so good um in addition to this I
would define a unusual static final
string so final string tag will be the
status data all right that's it for now
so those are our columns now what is our
database how do we open up our database
probably manage our database how do we
deal with the database well so to do
that Android actually framework provides
a bunch of frameworks or you know
classes that make make life simpler with
that so there's something called sequel
I'd open helper it's basically a class
that helps you open up your database and
upgrade your database when your database
doesn't exist which is our case we don't
have a database right so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna define this
class is an inner class so we're gonna
implement it but since we only need to
know it and use it in the context of
status data I don't really want to
expose it to the world and that's why it
makes sense to be an inner class right
so I'm gonna create a class within a
class or DB helper extends sequel Lite
organizing parts
so DB helper is the one that's gonna be
responsible for helping us open up the
database right so DB helper in itself
you mean it we need to add an
implemented methods so oh I the
constructor and then we need to still
add unemployment methods so a couple
clicks and you get a bunch of code
so far so good so let's start with the
constructor so this guy here so this guy
wants we need to construct the DB helper
and we need to pass in context name
factory inversion so we're going to need
to have a context for force Alex data
status data itself is going to have to
have a context so I'm going to create a
variable called you know context on
context context
okay
so named name of the database is
something that doesn't really change all
that much so might as well put it as a
constant when you create another
constant called public static final
string DB name and we can call it
whatever you want like timeline dot DB
for example in addition to that we're
also gonna have the version so we're
gonna say public static final string DB
version and again you can start with one
or some number like that I'm sorry it's
not the string it's me
so now when we create D in the
constructor the context is gonna be
given to us right
the name is gonna become DB name the
version is going to be DB version so we
are calling that right in factory is is
some stuff that is it's really if in
this case it's really a check it's
basically I have to deal with the fact
that you can't have nulls
as part of the and as a part of a
constructor so so you must start with
one so that's most cases this factories
is going to be enough we don't really
need it it's an hour contact
so basically we can now simplify this
constructor to be like this much simpler
because we define stuff as constants up
from there
yeah so presumably when I create status
somewhere we would create DB helper and
pass the context then we don't really
you're right
we could also just do this yep whichever
way you want okay so now we have a whole
bunch of constants and as part of that
we have a whole bunch of we have two
methods we have on create and on upgrade
right and the DB helper so let's talk
about these two methods so on create
happens only once first time you are
creating the date that the database the
database does not exist right so on
creates gets called to create a database
so this piece of code whatever you put
in here it's only gonna run once ever
for this particular user right if you
uninstall the app and remove the data
then if you run again right yeah but
typically if you do not remove the David
it's gonna run only once initially to
create the database from that point on
what happens is on upgrade is gonna get
called every single time there's an
upgrade to a database schema like you
change the database like remember right
now we for support for fields for
Twitter status but we could support like
six or more seven right and so on right
so you may change schema in the future
and in that case on upgrade would run by
Inc it in this case its own created runs
so you don't create you got the you got
the database object
right so what we normally do here is we
create a we create our string that we're
going to use to create the database our
database sequel creation string right so
usually looks like something like this
string
sequel and then you know we need to at
some point du DV dot exact sequel
so far so good now the question is what
goes into this drink and this becomes
just a simple question and whatever goes
into here it's gonna be a long spaghetti
sequel code right so it's gonna let me
look something like this string dot
format right and then the same create
how does it go create table percent s oh
I guess we're gonna need table name as
well right public static final string
table statuses are status that's a new
name information
right and then you can start typing your
your sequel so it's going to be percent
as int primary key
that's our ID % as int that's gonna be
our created that timestamp right % as
text percent as thanks
and then we're gonna have table comma
phone ID we created
all user
so first again well not so so this can
easily fail so for that reason what we
would normally want to do is we want to
log dot d so that we know why it's
filled before we execute
what are we doing on an upgrade what
would you do when your when your version
changes what would be a smart thing to
do you're changing the schema is that
how you upgrade a database explore the
data draw the table of the database I
mean what's a typical sip of flood
yes
and anybody well typically we I mean
this is not they so much so much hundred
question but typically what you do is
you would alter the table right yeah it
feels itself defaults and go from there
right
usually this is usually you know usually
alter table statement right but for our
purposes the poor man's way of doing
this would be database dot execs equal
drop if exists and then ROM DB dot late
you're not really supposed to do this
but this is one way to do it right for
development purposes yeah so basically
whenever the system detects that the old
version and the new version of the
database are different all the version a
new version right and it's going to fall
this guide and you do whatever you want
to do in there to propagate this because
you may have users using like you may
have used some of your version of it it
version your database tree somebody it's
570 at 7 and so on
now you gotta update them to the latest
rate so you gotta you can't just drop in
a new code and blow up their existing
data usually one of my greater data up
to the latest database standard so
that's that's basically what goes on so
so that's that's why you typically do
alter all the table but like I said you
know if there's a poor man's way of
doing it as well so so now that we have
all that we are ready to give this a try
we just need to instantiate our DB
helper okay so to instantiate our DB
helper we need to create so we're going
to create DB helper instance and then
I'm gonna create a constructor here I'll
say status data so public
I'm gonna keep context around because I
may need it for other purposes right
so first again
so so basically now that we have this we
can go installed in we can basically
start inserting stuff into our database
so what's a good place to insert well
what's a good place to actually
instantiate this object start this data
we could write in the service it's only
that a lot of people are gonna be using
so let's see what's that yeah we I mean
we could yeah we could do it in our
application on create as well right so
that's another place so yeah my app we
could basically can get off of Yamba app
and say there's a there's a property
called status data
and then in oncreate we could say
starters data is new studies
so for good so now that we have this
stuff as data we could now call anything
in the status that we want but we need
some some helper Mattox right one of the
helper methods will be to insert so what
would this thing what with the signature
insert looks like so something like
public void insert right what kind of
data do we want to pass into insert we
could pass him a status table because
that's what the outside world knows
knows about Twitter status object right
so yeah so you could do a status service
is the Twitter status object so we care
from an imported
with that oh there's a little plus sign
there
well you've probably got second place
awesome I'm just trying to keep it all
in one screen so you guys can visually
see it okay so we're gonna insert so to
insert we're gonna need a database to
insert in okay and then we're gonna need
to to do the actual insert so the
database that we need is gonna be sequel
Lite database DB right that's our
database reference yeah that's a yeah
it's a Twinner class yeah status is a
twitter class it comes from Twitter and
J you know this location
yeah so what we need to do is we need to
open up the database first so we would
say DB is DB helper
so remember DB CalPERS a guy that helps
us do all the opening and all that stuff
right so we would say DB helper dot and
basically care about these two methods
get readable database or get writable
database right so if in this case
presumably we care about the writable
database right should say get writable
database that gives us access to the
right believers right so now now that we
have the right to build database how
would you insert something into this
database you tell me I'm talking
so you're saying something like this DV
dot exact query and then you would say
something like this in certain well it
already has the connection rights
presumably so so you were basically
saying DB insert into status and then
you would put like for example you your
stuff and then you say values maybe put
your other stuff right so this would be
like ID comma created don't do this you
know etc cetera right and then you would
put your values like 123 from so Maya
stamp what's wrong with this approach
what's that well yeah there's a DVD
insert but what's what's the fundamental
problem with this approach and I'll give
you a hint there are two fundamental
problems one is performance relate to
the other insecurities late and yeah I
think do it Android it's just as this is
your security loophole 101 yeah sequel
injection yeah yeah what if some of the
posts are tweet like we're expecting a
user we're expecting text here right so
somebody is smart enough and put some
values you know user you know hacker and
the value that we get from this user I
need to escape this now right the value
that we get from this user is the
following
the value is blah and then basically
escapes this and starts insert into you
know a cetera cetera right so suddenly
this guy is not just giving us a plain
old stuff but he's actually typing some
kind of some kind of it's since equal
into our stuff right it's not just a
message is actually a sequel injection
into our system right security loophole
101 it's very basic so this is bad you
don't do that
the that's a security problem
performance problem is that if you have
to do database would have to parse this
every single time for every single
message and what you know I don't care
if it wasn't in parsing ones but we're
doing this in a loop so we're talking
about many many times right so if I say
this is bad why wasn't it bad when we
did it just seconds ago
in in this case
yeah cuz it's not coming from the
outside world so there's no user input
and it only runs once who cares about
those 0.2 milliseconds that you're gonna
say right not even we're talking yeah
you guys right so it's a different beast
so in this case we do care about it and
as such we're not gonna use this but
we're gonna use DB dot insert okay
so table oh that's easy we have the
table now column hack is just now it's a
hack and values is gonna be that it's a
something called content values we
basically have to convert our status to
values right so I'll leave it as value
something we're doing we're gonna define
so what the heck is value so let's do
let's do it like this so what my dollies
are is so basically content that is
values new content values organizing
ports right
now you're simply mapping database or
you know some web stuff like tweets into
a database stuff that's what valises
it's sort of like a data structure that
kind of makes it straight forward you
know defines what what is what right so
we are gonna have values dot put and
then again have a bunch of these pots so
ID value is gonna be status dot ID right
easy values dot put create that it's
gonna be stars dot created at valleys
dot put
so user and I'm gonna put that yeah yeah
we're gonna get ya we're gonna discuss
that yeah dot user dot name and I will
put found text it's gonna be status dog
tags so so we copied the ID right so I'm
copying the database stuff into you know
the server stuff into a database stuff
you know username gets into username
text goes into text pretty
straightforward wanted to becoming a
problem here is the stance created that
right why
well creepy that is actually a Java date
object right so database doesn't know
how to store a job at date order
so how do you want to store it we could
swipe the string but you want one thing
I'm gonna want to do down the line is
they want to say you know the notice
when this was posted but don't say this
was supposed to ten minutes ago half an
hour ago like relative time it's mean
it's user friendly so if I put in a
string it's not gonna be possible
necessary yeah yeah January 1st 1970
yeah so so that's a good so yeah so we
can start this in milliseconds so you
know get time get time so returns the
timing date is millisecond values the
value is the number of milliseconds
since January 1st 1970 in GMT right so
this is what this is good this is gonna
work till about 2035 I think yeah so we
we got a couple of years to mill kabal
in disaster so it's good this will do
the job I'm telling you no overflows
number so this way we can compare one to
another we can it's better than piece of
text right oh so so this is good like we
got we got our insert and we got all
that stuff yeah how does this stop SQL
injection this is it's a great question
these statements are what's called the
prepared statements so they internally
what we are basically saying is I'm
gonna have a box that is only gonna
accept an integer and so only integer
can go into I have a box it's only gonna
accept integer only integer goes there
I'll box it's only gonna take text only
text sanitized text can go into it
because the problem where the sequel
injection happens is when you escape it
so you escape it by doing like semi call
a backslash quote for example right
that's typical so you want to prevent
escaping of that so you basically you
know poor man's way of sanitizing this
would be just to go and replace old to
quote all the ports or to replace all
the back slashes right that sort of I
know we don't trust you to try to there
but so whatever the test text is we
don't trust it in sanitize
but this this structure values in in
this we do know it works as a prepared
statements are supposed to do yes if the
context values or they actually insert
statement I'm not sure exactly which one
but I think on the flip side what
happens is it says get values get value
and that actually gives you the clean
stuff so if there's any you know attempt
to escape something it's it's not yeah
okay
so we can now call this guy passive the
status so we call this from where yeah
we could do it from update I'm gonna do
it from refresh because I wanted to run
gazillion times but anywhere here you
could like this is where we have the new
status right so this is what we were
just printing the status to the log
right we're just doing the boring boring
part printing into the log so we see it
works
so what I was doing here is I would say
something like you need to go Yamba
young but app right get the young behalf
get the application
I mean if presumably you could do this
outside of the out of the loop right
like if you really wanted to do this
outside then we make more sense so this
would be Yamba application and status
data so I could basically do something
like this now is data starters right
just I'm not doing I mean it doesn't
really matter you can do that if it's
long enough chip all right so in here i
cannot do status status data dot insert
status oh that should do it
that's it and that's enough for the
intro David
but the magic of the actual inserting
cap is in status data but the Yamba app
is where we hang it as an object to
share cross all the bits and pieces of
our app right because I know there was a
question on Monday somebody had like why
would you store certain things like that
all right so let me run this and see
what happens
so if you click on menu refresh I'm
gonna go to my locket only to lock it
and everything tube is about there a
bunch of messages candle destroy right
but I'm gonna stop my service session
okay so so we did to gather data the
question now is the data in the database
where's the database hmm yeah data there
so let's go check that out so if I go so
if I go one back
I'm in my I mean my data data for
example amber right so now after do our
last oh look there's a new folder called
databases so you know you notice that
this folder is actually pretty
structured you don't get to create
random folders inside of it something
else does like I did not come up with
the name databases a satellite so you
can go into that folder databases unless
in BAM there's our database timeline
okay I'll look into that in a second let
me know do you guys all hear the
database files can you identify them so
guess what about many of you health
problems we'd create the create table
and I'm not surprised by that because
that's that's to be expected whenever
you have like a spaghetti code like this
right
I mean it's unfortunate if we have to
type this kind of stuff but we do the
good news is that once you get it right
you get it right right so you just have
to get it right once so that's why I
usually like to print it out and kind of
verify that this actually went through
the database right so just gonna print
that piece out I'm gonna do log yet
status status data star star ass so that
was my career that was my sequel
statement when it was all said and done
that seems to have worked
silence everything else so another way
to verify the database got created is to
open it up now the linux shell first so
how many of you are like comfortable
with Linux 12 bash or anything like that
all right yeah for those of you who are
not I mean it's very useful and it's
nicely tuned and we can get down into
the shell of the device so we can
actually see what's what's going on and
the good people who build a shell they
didn't include a lot of useful tools
unfortunately but one totally they did
include is the sequel I'd database so I
can actually right here open up this
database from the live device sequel
Lite 3 timeline dot DB right so so you
type this in and you're now inside of
the database the database right so keep
in mind that as long as you have a
sequel sequel thing here you are inside
the database right it expects certain
commands so if you're not familiar with
Linux surely probably even less familiar
with it's the sequel Lite stuff so let
me give you a crash course in sequel I'd
you can do there there's the two kinds
of comments you have the commands that
are standard sequel right so for example
if I did the select star from status
semicolon it will work
look there's data that's what I wanted
to do to verify so any standard sequel
command will work right but they're also
the commands that are not standard
sequel and they start with the dot so
you first one should be dot health
there's no semicolon dot health tells
you all the dot commands or whatever
they're called I call them dot comments
so
so for example a couple of useful
comments well dot quit is very useful
because you get out of here if you you
you log out but I like I like dot schema
it tells me what the scheme of my
database is in other words what the
database structure is right and I like
dot dump that just tells me that there's
data BAM there's the dump of my data
it's equivalent of like you know the
data that you would need to read
statements that you would need to
recreate this database from scratch
right so if you're gonna back it up just
dump it into a file txt file and you're
done so for good Oh so mine worked I
gather data everything's good couple
words of caution if you start doing
select star from status and then it's
like whoa what's going on
god help dot dump dot quit you know
you're totally like it's all confusing
right that's because when you start a
non dot command it's waiting for
semicolon so I'm telling a type of cell
phone it's not gonna do anything right
so keep that in mind okay second thing
that you is a common mistake I mean this
file oh there's no database and I say
sequel i three-time DV i mistyped it
there is no error it just creates a new
database and you're like dump no I kill
my data there's no data my date in the
application is not working so now you're
often like you're searching in a totally
different place right next thing you
know it's five o'clock you get gray hair
and all that stuff so be mindful of
those couple errors so that's the method
data that it uses for
I'm sorry yeah we did there's our status
there's another database called method
another table called Android metadata
and if you can't get it if you select
star from Android metadata that's when
it's got a locale so it's presumably
supports some kind of you know I'm not
sure I never use it a localization or
something of that nature so far so good
all right so this is how many everyone
got it to work go to data alright 3 oz
of you could do and get it to work I'll
come around Kelpie odd for those of you
who'd got it to work
run it again but on its second time
let's see what happens I'm gonna run it
I'm gonna go another menu refresh
wait why is nothing showing up oh I want
ya menu refresh and what you're gonna
get is gonna be a gazillion errors or
not gazillion but approximately between
10 and 20 right so tell me why and what
to do about it
and let me see this we didn't work in
this opinion so okay so since I closed
to you guys so the problem the the
problem that we are having now it says
fail constraint right so that means that
you put a constraint on a database table
and this is failing at it and the
constraint that we put was this
constraint here we said there shall be a
integer primary key so our e ID shall be
a primary key and by the way there's
something special about this underscore
ID like in other words yes you should
always yes you should always scare up
the you should always get the ID right
but you know some of you may call it ID
some of you may call it ID etc it's
there's something special about the
underscore ID there's some stuff that
Android gives you for free later on so
there's even even to that point there's
actually a base column constant called
ID with columns
they're on so either way it's it's just
a lowercase underscore ID again so
whatever you guys already have there is
right so the the problem was we want to
do we want to keep this private primary
or not your database table design says
you should have a primary key right now
we could also say Auto increment and
manage primary keys ourselves but
Twitter is already doing this worldwide
pretty well right so why do placate the
job I have one ID here not righty there
that we told mismatched match right so I
remember if when we talked about it argh
the purpose of a database in the world
of the mobile phones that recently lost
or stolen is to merely be a cache an
image right so we would want to keep the
ID from the remote place right so then
the question is how do we deal with this
insert well if you look at it since that
is failing right here so there is insert
but there's also a command called insert
or throws insert row right that actually
it's gonna fail but it's going to try an
exception you could catch that exception
and then go you know go ignore it right
you could do that but this exceptions
are expensive so you may not want to do
that especially it since we know we're
gonna be throwing this exception left
and right right
the alternative is actually a built-in
it's called insert or on with or on
can't they be dot insert with on
conflict there we go and it's basically
the values are the same except there's
except except for the very last conflict
algorithm in conflict algorithm is gonna
tell it what to do in certain cases so
you can say see I think it's equal light
conflict ignore says when a constraint
violation occurs when the constraint L
violation occurs the one road that
contains the constraint polish is not
inserted or change but the command
continuously exists in normally other
roads before and after the road it
contain a constellation instantly
normally no errors it turned that's
exactly what you want
well like okay we already know we got a
tweet right so just just ignore it
right are you just you just let the
mouse sit there like if you just put
your mouse over something you normally
yellow window comes up no no you do it
like this you keep dot then you you
slowly as you do it through this you see
how choice I think it's in the touch but
now I should work oh by the way you know
one thing also didn't tell you what well
might have told you but what what this
matter does the pool from Twitter or
poor get but get public timeline get
public time and returns twenty most
recent tweets from people in the last 24
hours
so if we hit it back-to-back chances are
that you're gonna have duplicates right
because that's how it's defined right
you you get there well I don't have a
documentation for J Twitter I guess so
but it's define is twenty most recent in
24 hours
so that's that's that so basically now
if we do the if we just do this the only
thing that they've changed is in this
line
I added we don't conflict okay any added
conflicting nor oh sorry this and that
fixes that and we are done with it so
far that's worked so this stuff making
sense
oh yeah we well we well yeah you can do
that this homework
it's a one-liner right but but sure well
we will do that I usually retire update
service because I don't like it but but
yes
so if you wanted to insert it was the
same point here write it so we got the
status and we just got to do Yamba app
and then get application right and get
application and then it was basically
dot status data the insert status feel
like I'm programming analyst for
something so that was it and I will now
actually inside it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
