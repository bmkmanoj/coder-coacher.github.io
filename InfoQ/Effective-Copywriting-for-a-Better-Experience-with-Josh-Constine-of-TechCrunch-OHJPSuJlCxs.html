of Cascade SF and we're an organization
dedicated to teaching the latest tips
and tricks in web design i'm also a web
designer and I've worked for a lot of
startups I've designed a lot of products
including company for companies such as
directv for Cisco IndieGoGo and smeal
just to name a few and I'd like to
introduce you tonight to Josh konstan
who is a writer for TechCrunch he covers
a lot of startups and he has also
conducted an on-stage interview with
Mark Zuckerberg and CEO drew Houston as
well as many other Silicon Valley stars
prior to TechCrunch Josh attended
Stanford University and designed a
master's program and cyber sociology to
study how humans interact through
technology so he's he's got a master's
in UX pretty much so come on out Josh
mugler interviewing everybody
you guys all so much for coming i know
is like a lot of cool things to be doing
on a pretty day like this so nothing's
cooler than this okay we're going to go
ahead and get the interview started and
then we will have a QA so if we ask you
guys to just hold your questions until
till we let you know but I'd like to ask
you Josh just to get things going why is
it so important to have good content on
a website ah I guess that's about as
broadly as you can start but i think
really content is what draws people you
know you you can set up a skeleton and a
framework and functionality for
something to be useful but the emotion
comes through content and that's where
people get a have like a real connection
to what you build and so if you if you
try to minimize your UX so much that
there's no there's no life or there's no
flavor and what you do you might
actually be helping the people that you
might be helping your audience but you
don't end up resonating with them and
that's how you create them like the
memory and that emotional connection
that makes them want to come back and so
I think it's critical to not only build
something that's useful but to build
something that's lovable so let me ask
you do you when you go to a website if
there's a large amount of copy do you
read it or would you just maybe scan it
or ignore it how do you handle I mean it
really depends on how I come into the
site if I knew what I was getting into
and there's a big block of texts
sometimes that might be what I expect
and so I'd be happy to go through it but
if I'm suddenly surprised by like a
giant block of text I'm much more likely
to skim through it I'm much more likely
to just skip it if it doesn't seem
interesting especially if the first few
lines are interesting i know i'm i'm
really busy a lot of people are super
busy these days there's so many
different sources of information and
entertainment that you can find online
that if you don't build something that's
immediately interesting to them it's
really easy for people to tune out and
so i know that i write my articles for
TechCrunch with that in mind you know my
perspective is that I want to respect my
reader the most possible i know that if
i if i write something that is really
flowery or i try to like
set the scene in this kind of
philosophical way I can a lot of times
just immediately come off as like to
hippie dippie or like to you know to
poetic or something and people just
immediately say this isn't going to be
informative and so I really like to
tease as much of the content as I can
early and yeah sometimes that doesn't
make for the the most beautiful opening
but I think that that's the real
challenge is trying to find a way to
make something seem both beautiful and
informative as quickly as possible and
draw them in because once you can get
them to read a little bit they'll become
invested and they're much more likely to
stick with you as you get through the
nitty-gritty stuff and get some more of
that poetry or that emotion later so and
so you focus a lot on startups and
writing about products and and new
technologies that are that you've
learned about how do you quickly
summarize or learn about what a start-up
does and explain that in one to two
sentences that's it's a wild process I
mean sometimes I'll learn about a piece
of news and I'll publish something
within four minutes which seems crazy
and sometimes that's about something i
don't even know a ton about but you
learn really quickly how to do this
research and so you know for me it means
immediately looking up their crunchbase
profile on TechCrunch because that's
just a really great way to learn a lot
about a start up really quickly you get
everything from an intro to what they
are who's in whose works there what
they're invested or who invested in them
you might get some screenshots I'll try
to read a bunch of the news articles
I'll search Technium which is like my
favorite website on the internet for
that it's called tech meme it's a sort
of the aggregator of technology news
it's supposed to be the front page of
tech news on the Internet so instead of
going to one website and you get you
know everything from that same
perspective Technium will pull in
articles from all these different
sources whoever wrote the best version
of an article or the best analysis or a
piece of opinion about a certain subject
they'll pull that in and so even if that
means I'm reading something from other
writers that didn't come from TechCrunch
like that's totally cool we know we're
not always perfect and that's a that's a
really quick way to research you know
and if possible like I really like to
try to just call someone up and get
on the phone that's a great way to learn
about something but you know I think for
for the people here like a that might
not be quite as relevant but you want to
understand said I feel it feel like you
want to understand your audience and you
want to be learning as much as you can
about your audience throughout the
process of writing for them because
that's that there's often a feeling of
disconnect when you write online because
there's just you're looking at a screen
you're not looking at a human you don't
get those emotional cues in response to
what you say to them and so it's easy to
forget that they're even there and you
start writing for yourself you start
writing for your own goals instead of
writing for the audience that you're
trying to serve and so trying to keep
that in mind as much as possible and
then learn about it I feel like is the
the best way to make sure your writing
copy that's really effective and do you
believe that they're in journalism
there's a concept of not barrent burying
the lead and putting the main point of
the story like four to five paragraphs
in is what burying the lead is I hate
that and well as a tech writer I'm
guessing you have to try and bring that
main information to the first one or two
paragraphs can you describe your writing
process to create a story yes I mean a
lot of articles you'll read online are
sort of written from the perspective
almost as if they're like an online
magazine piece and when and really I
think of that writing style developed
from yesteryear when there wasn't all
these distractions like yeah if I open a
magazine and I start reading your
article you don't really have to worry
about me suddenly flitting somewhere
else and so you had more good more
leeway in building sort of a soft
opening to any piece of content and a
lot of people try to emulate that style
because it comes with this air of
authenticity and respectability people
think though if this article is really
long and it starts with something really
flowery and not very you know hard and
informative it means that though this is
going to be like a big thought piece and
it's like really well it's not it wasn't
hastily written and people just assume
that it's going to be good I disagree
with that holy I think that that's
really just this vestigial wing that we
have when we write online we try to
write as if we were writing in a
magazine because that's what we think
sounds the most authentic but you have
to remember that
audience is changing it's a lot of kids
were younger maybe hardly have read
paper magazines and so they don't get
that same illusion so when I try to
write really the a lot of people will
tell you that the the way to think about
something or like to crystallize
thoughts about an idea is to go through
that who what where when why how process
so I like to flip that around so in my
perspective the best way to do this is
to talk about why what who and then how
and so to run through a like an article
that I've rimmed fluences today I wrote
about a new company called air pooler
they're kind of like lift for planes
basically pilots can put empty seats on
their airplane on their private
airplanes up on the this website and
sell the seats almost like you would
sell your room on air B&amp;amp;B and and so
when I when I thought about that I was
trying to think I don't I didn't want to
go in and just say okay like who like
here's this guy you've never heard of
who's building this thing like who cares
like what here's this thing that they
built it's like but I don't understand
what problem it solves and so I like to
go back and think about it starting with
why what is the problem that you're
solving if you're if you're writing apt
copy this really applies for if you're
writing an app description or a splash
page even a Twitter bio can come in in
this form so you start with why what is
the problem that you're solving so in
this case planes or pilots want to fly
but it's expensive to fly travelers want
to travel but they hate driving through
traffic or going through security and
getting it to the airport really early
those are the problems that's the why
and then I go in with the what air
pooler is a website that allows pilots
to sell the empty seats on their
airplanes so that what has so much more
context when you start with the why
because suddenly people already know why
it's important to them it's not just
this free floating piece of utility out
in the world they understand that
there's a problem that it's directly
routed to once I've really explained the
why and what that's when you want to get
into the how sorry I'm sorry that's
anyone you want to get into the WHO and
the who gives you the credibility to say
this
is why this is going to be well built
you might not have used it yet but if it
came from these people who have
expertise in this area you know it's
going to be good and then once you do
that you can get into the nitty-gritty
of how something actually works and so
let's take this through is like an app
store description you might immediately
start saying you know let's take another
another example is a great app called
will call that's a you know born and
designed in San Francisco it's a great
app for well I'll just run you through
what it sounds like we have a lot of
free leisure time and we don't know what
to do at night there's lots of concerts
going on but we can't find out where
they are when they are and we miss
getting tickets to them if you guys is
that like an experience and you guys
have had right so that's the why then
the what is will call as an app where
you can buy last minute concert tickets
to the best events in the city it's a
curated list of events they take care of
finding out what's cool for you then
there's the who the design the founder
is a designer it's built around the idea
that night life is something that's
supposed to be stylish and immediately
and so it's built by a really design
focused team that know if they're going
to fit into that night life part of your
world they can't be something that feels
like a nine-to-five utility app it has
to feel integrated into that lifestyle
and then the how is they use bluetooth
low energy to be able to recognize when
you come to the door of a concert so
they pull you up immediately on the
guest list they do the same thing so you
can buy drinks at the bar they have a
team of curators that looks through all
the concerts in the city and only picks
the best ones and so those are the
nitty-gritty parts of it and I think if
you structure it that way it comes off
way better than saying there's a whole
bunch of designers and they built this
app that helps you find concerts and
it's for you know its refining them
right now and it's in San Francisco but
then the Y is the last thing they get to
I find that that's a really poor way of
describing something when you start with
the y you immediately get to a
generalizable emotional connection with
a product all right so let's just recap
so you start with why when you're asked
when you're trying to come up with
collect information to write a summary
of a product you start with why yes
start with the problem the why why does
it need to exist and then you get the
what
what does it actually do how I what is
the problem that it's solving what is
the actual product what is the meat of
it then there's the who which is why it
you think it's important why is it sorry
who who is the person behind it who is
the you know who can you trust that this
is going to be something that's good and
then the how which is the the real deep
functionality will get it so like most
app stores descriptions are written very
similarly they start with the problem
and they decide say what the app does
they say a little bit about who built it
sometimes and then there'll be a big
feature list of the how okay um very
helpful so um just you you talk now
first well I'm actually really enjoying
your teaching everybody a lot it's
everybody looks very engaged right now
you guys are all learning a lot of
information yes okay feel free to tweet
mean things at me I love it yes attack
of the journalists no okay um so when
you how how do you prepare for an
interview when you're going to interview
somebody to hear their ideas behind the
product well for me I want to know I
want to get that emotional resonance out
of them and it's really easy to just go
in and start talking about the what and
the how but the why and the who is often
the most interesting part of a story
it's something that has a lot more human
connection to it because it's not about
the products it's about the problem that
it's solving for the humans and the
people that built it so most of the time
the first question I asked before people
even tell me what their product does is
I want to know why did they want to
build it like what was what was their
part of their life that made it
essential for them to build this and I
think the best startups all have this
kind of superhero origin story it's like
well why does Batman fight crime it's
like well crime killed his parents it's
like that when you if you if you get
into you want to get to the bottom of
why somebody built something and I think
that you end up with a lot more
emotional resonance so so for us to
instance like take Jack Dorsey and how
he built square so you go in and ask
Jack dorset he was like what is square
do how does it do it but I think the
much more interesting question is why
did you build it in the first place and
he did a talk at TechCrunch Disrupt and
he talked a little bit about this he
described that when he was a kid he
grew up in his dad's pizza restaurant
and he saw his dad getting frustrated
that the credit card companies were
demanding these high fees from him and
it was a complicated process and you
know more and more people wanted to pay
with credit but he felt his dad felt
like he was losing part of hit this you
know the the money that he was
rightfully earning to these credit card
companies that weren't really providing
much utility they weren't making it
especially easy for him or his customers
and they were to sort of like taxing him
for for what was becoming a really
important and essential functionality
for any any piece of Commerce and so
what did he do he built something that
you know cut a lot of that like that
credit card transaction process out of
the flow and he made it really easy for
any merchant to offer credit card
payments in a really simple way that was
always affordable for them even if
somebody bought something for really
cheap like a single slice of pizza you
know when you buy a single slice of
pizza suddenly 25 cents or that 50 cent
credit card fee adds up really quickly
and he wanted to build something that
would work for any size merchant because
he saw that pain in his father and so we
ended up building something that with a
flat percentage rate which works even
for small merchants it's clarissa so
that's that's the first thing I usually
ask people when I want to learn about
why they built something or you know if
for a lot for a lot of you guys if
you're marketers you can do this same
process to sort of reveal the identities
of your team members to your audience or
you can reveal sort of that you can
frame your entire product around this
sort of superhero origin story and so
after that I want to I want to know
about sort of okay how do they get to
the place where they were able to build
it where were they were before it's like
oh you were working on search at google
and then you realize there was some big
hole in the search infrastructure they
you know how did you gain the X the
domain expertise to be able to tackle
this problem correctly once I've asked
them the what and the how of how a
product actually works I want to get
into you know what are the biggest
challenges and I think that a lot of
times in copywriting we want to present
things as invulnerable or invincible we
want to sort of cover up all the
problems but a lot of times if you do
that the audience the reader is filling
in those holes for themselves they're
not stupid they know what's wrong with
your product if you try to gloss over it
if you pretend like nothing
none of this exists they're going to
immediately assume that you're
disingenuous so for instance today the
the founder of secret an anonymous
sharing app wrote a blog post about the
first 60 days as a company and in it he
talked about all the amazing things that
people are doing on secret they're you
know they're supporting each other
through life losses they're opening
themselves up and being more creative in
their expression they're you know
they're talking about like big problems
at the workplace or at home that they
didn't have an outlet for he didn't
mention a single thing about cyber
bullying which is a huge issue on this
app everyone who uses this app knows
that it's not hard you you scroll
through a few stories and you're going
to see somebody sort of get defamed or
bullied in the app and the fact that he
glossed over this entirely is something
he was even like cyberbullying is a real
issue we don't think that there's much
of it on our app we're still really
vigilant about making sure this doesn't
happen the fact that he glossed over
that entirely immediately made me lose
some respect for him and he's a really
smart guy I've met him I ty did a
fireside chat with him at South by
Southwest he's a good human but when you
get into copywriting it's easy to fall
into those traps of trying to pretend
like you're perfect and the reader knows
you're not so if you if you're willing
to expose a little bit of your
vulnerabilities and instead of saying
instead of glossing over them you know
recognize your vulnerabilities and then
explain why you're actually fixing them
people are going to be a lot more
confident that what you're telling them
overall is much more truthful it
actually works a lot like meditation
when you're meditating a lot of times
you'll get distracted and if you get mad
at yourself and you keep on and you like
dwell on the fact that you keep getting
strange like oh I suck at meditating I
can't stay focused or if you like try to
pretend like it's not happening and you
just end up getting caught up in these
random thought patterns you stop
actually meditating you stop attaining
this state of no thought which is really
cathartic and really relaxing and
instead you follow one of these thought
trains you end up you end up losing a
lot of the value but instead if you
recognize you say yeah that fly buzzed
by me I got distracted that's a human
thing to do I'm going to recognize that
that happened and i'm going to
categorize it and say okay I'm going to
try from now on not to be distracted by
the random bugs that fly by me while I'm
meditating and the sounds really weird
right now
I'm going to just going to stay focused
on what I'm doing by doing that mental
categorization and that recognization
recognizing of your own flaws I think
that you end up doing you're able to be
a lot more a lot more believable and a
lot more truthful and people will
resonate you more with you more when you
seem human instead of seeming infallible
because people can relate to you a
little better exactly yeah and then the
same time at the end of any talk I
always ask companies who are their
biggest competitors and what are their
biggest challenges like what is the
thing if you know if your competitor was
in the hot seat right now and they were
saying this is why that other guy's app
is going to fail I want you to tell me
about it and then tell me why you're
fixing that and similarly it's like I
want you to be to recognize that the
other other people doing it if you try
to pretend that you don't have any
competitors people are just not going to
believe you but if you say yeah these
are the competitors but actually they're
focusing on this niche segment and we
actually nailed this other use case for
this other entire audience people are
going to be able to say yeah and they
are there they're in it for me they're
not just trying to big up themselves
that actually it's not really
necessarily like user experience but it
is important to to recognize that a lot
of people who are pitching apps to
include your competitor is really really
important and know what they do so that
way you can kind of say okay well what
can we offer and how can we do it better
all right it's the same way with in a
lot of a in you in UX design like if you
have an error in your app and you just
try to like you know shoe that under the
rug and just be like oh sorry that
happened and like try to be is like
super succinct as possible and refuse to
really acknowledge that anything
happened you're just basically trying to
get them out of that error flow as much
as possible you lose this great
opportunity to sympathize with the with
the user that's an opportunity a time
when you can really be like hey you know
what you really want to convey is like
hey we are really trying to provide
something great for you and we know that
you're relying on us and we screwed this
up but we care about you so much that
we're really working on is we want you
to file a bug report we have a team
working on these kind of things or even
just provide them with a joke or some
piece of of content that sort of rewards
them for stumbling into this bug that is
sort of a you know like yeah reward or a
prize or or really just like these
almost like reparations for people for
doing something
and the more that you can you can take
those opportunities and say yeah we've
heard up what we're doing better we're
working on this all the time I think
people are going to endear themselves a
lot more to your app so you're saying
that transparency is encouraged in when
your copywriting yeah I mean you don't
need to do well and say like oh we
screwed up we're terrible but it you
know trying to admit that you're doing
that like everything isn't perfect I
mean most most most users will
understand that they're working they're
using a product that isn't you know it
hasn't been around for five years most
of people's products in this room
probably haven't been around for five
years always not in the incarnation that
they are now they hope that they're
constantly evolving and so I think that
there's often a lot of sympathy for for
developers more than you would think and
yeah you might not see that in your App
Store reviews where people are going to
like lose their mind about some app but
there's you know for each one of those
people there's dozens more who were like
who just thought that you know that's
the that's the cost of using something
that's on the cutting edge dude do you
have do you have a specific example of
wording to create empathy for the user
because I do remember my father had said
he was using a few airline websites to
do some research and he said the sites
were so difficult to use that it made
him feel stupid so say that you're going
to and you're going to a page and then
you get some kind of error how would we
how would a UX designer word it so it
would not so they could relate to the
users mistake so here's a great one if
you've ever had like a chrome page crash
or like failed to connect you'll get
this weird little drawing of this t-rex
and you're like what the hell is this
cute little dinosaur doing but like if
you think about it t-rex's have short
arms they literally can't reach it
couldn't reach their website and like
chrome is like admitting that in such a
funny way instead of like trying to
blame it on somebody else they actually
are conveying that in like a really cute
way that once you understand it if it
comes to sort of in joke and you're
almost like delighted when you see that
and like to turn a moment of error into
one of like glee is a really impressive
feat in UX design that we should all be
all be striving for and yeah and at the
same time you know they could have tried
to convey that in words and it would
have been a lot more stumbly it would
have seemed a lot more like an apology
opposed to something that was just
recognizing and movin on and I think
that's what that that little design does
so you know you can do that in words too
but another another great principle I
have four for UX design is whenever
possible don't use words try to use
imagery and symbols to guide the user as
much as possible to what you want them
to think and use words when absolutely
necessary and in the end you can often
design your way out of a lot of the
problems that would have taken multiple
sentences that would have looked really
clumsy in your app and so and also you
act or that UX copy is certainly a lot
easier to change than UX design so if
you focus on getting the design right
before you add the words in you end up
having to redesign fewer times it's
interesting that you say that because I
actually I have a cute little graphic
that I found online i'll post it later
that says well I can't one of the
designer says well I can't start the
design until I get the content and the
content person says well I can't start
the content until I have the design so I
do believe that the design centers
around the content and around the
writing I disagree disagree it in order
for you to have pictures and copy work
together you need to understand the
message right so you're doing maybe
there's a simple fact is that you're
never going to have there's not gonna be
designs inside your word but there's
going to be words inside your designs
it's really more of a layer on the top
of the design and so I think that that's
it's usually an easier step to work on
the last than first doesn't mean you
don't do anything you don't weave the
buttons blank when you're in your
prototyping phase but the more that you
can get that you can get some rough
draft in there and then work on the
design and then finalize the words at
the end you'll end up what you'll end up
doing is designing to answer as many of
the questions that you were trying to
answer with the copy and then you'll
have fewer things to try to answer to at
the end with the words and in the end
you want to be as concise as possible
when you're talking about like microcopy
inside of a nap
there could be different approaches to
know I only- right oh my josh's i am not
a designer I'm not only one who knows
but never everyone knows everyone has a
different style I mean really what you
have to do is find the style that works
for you and your team but this is a
general framework that I think we use to
fewer headaches well okay well we'll
pause on that continue that debate on a
pure and a later occasion follow that
debate it with me on twitter if you
think I'm wrong about anything I'm
saying right now I'm trying to learn to
so please hit me up it i'll send you
like 10 megs josh concept is not up
there but yeah at josh con steam yep
tell me why I'm wrong tell me I'm right
point because our resources hashtag UX
night at Cascade us up at and Eagle Pern
at hashtag selfie yes right now um I
want to go into like some technicalities
based on your master's degree know it at
Stanford that's respectable and I just
want to go half and half well it's only
respectable I mean I designed this
master's program so there's no one's
have really vetted it but me so it could
have been really stupid but I think I
enjoyed it they improved it though they
did approve it but I'm come unpersuasive
so we blame the person who approved it
down here yeah ok but so I would like to
ask you more of a technical question
we're gonna go into like some sendin
structuring so say that I'm taking notes
and I'm interviewing somebody and I'm
just writing down a bunch of lists what
is a way to combine sentences in a
seamless way and then make it all slow
very smooth I think one thing is people
have seemed really afraid of apostrophes
in UX copy and like I think that's silly
it's like unless you're writing an app
for scientists don't talk like a
scientist I did this for so long in my
own writing for my articles I came from
this academic background so everything I
wrote was supposed to be exactly in
place and there could it be any like
colloquialisms or any like culture or
flavor in it and what I ended up
realizing was that the more you write
like that more the more you write like a
robot even if the like total number of
words is smaller it's harder to read and
people are more likely to tune out it's
like
any of you have ever read Marx it's like
you know you know some of marks is the
big of you know most important treaties
aren't that many pages but it is like
exhausting to read them just because
every word matters like he spares not a
single there's no there's no flower eNOS
in anything every single word means
something and while it might end up
being short in page count it's really
tough to read and you have to really a
persevering writing when i first started
a writer that i really like to look to
for inspiration in terms of improving
this was mg Siegler he was an old writer
of TechCrunch and he is willing to his
articles will frequently his bigger ones
will end up being multiple you know
thousands of words but they feel really
breezy to read you like you like speed
through them and they seem like heard of
like a joy it's more like reading young
adult fiction than it is like reading
some philosophy textbook and like that
and I don't mean that in any demeaning
way it just means that he's able to
convey these these concepts in ways that
are culturally recognized and are easy
for people to ingest and digest and so
even though the articles are longer you
feel like you read them quicker and you
feel like you had a lot better time when
you finished and you a lot of times the
ideas were totally packed on top of each
other so you don't feel like it they all
blended together there was space in
between the different ideas thanks to
his you know Whittle cultural ramblings
or his little tangents that make it feel
a lot more it's a lot easier to remember
in the end and I think you can bring a
lot of that to UX design as well like
you don't need to write something so
it's the minimum number of words you
need to make it feel like it's the
minimum number of words and so really
that a lot of times that can mean using
apostrophes or using colloquialisms or
just you know feel and talk you know
right like you talk if you were to
explain a product to someone imagine you
were narrating it to them instead of
writing it and a lot of times you'll end
up with a with copy that will read much
faster even though it's more words it'll
take less time for the mind to digest
the oh I'm like I was looking when I was
doing research to
figure out which questions to ask you I
came across a lot of reporters were
using like a text text-to-speech program
to take notes or to write do use any of
those like dragon or Evernote has one
for the Android know my personal process
now I've started to record more of my
interviews just in case I want to like
be sure to nail an exact quote because
I'm pretty good at being but some really
what I normally have been doing for the
last few years is I will just write as
fast as I possibly can i will type
everything somebody says because by
doing that I feel like I ingrained that
information into myself and at the end i
end up with this huge block of text that
i can skim really easily and like a lot
of people i know just do their audio
recordings it is so agonizing to go
through an audio recording and try to
pull out any insights especially if you
talk to someone for a half hour and are
only going to write a few hundred or
like a thousand words about something
it's just it's a it's a total mess it's
horrible to have to pull that out of an
audio recording so i just try to take as
many notes as i can i have like a lot of
weird little short hands that i use like
you know think i got few like a you know
FF EA is feature to me it's like i
shortened a lot of words in my own
little like scroll and that helps me but
I yeah so there is an app called audio
note and it's I used it a few years ago
but it's still awesome you press record
and you can type notes and it will
actually you can it will sync up to a
timeline and it's very good for I just
like occasionally I'll just like look
back at my own audio recording and like
occasionally i'll just add in little
anchors like oh i'm at 20 minutes 32
seconds right now and so that i can
easily jump around if necessary yeah but
let's let's talk to more about writing
instead of listening because you don't
want to hear about me listening
listening is a big part of writing
because you need to gather information
to be able to communicate it sometimes
but a lot of times I feel like the the
identity of your brand or the product
that you're building is already inside
to you it's like it's all in there it's
a matter of coming up with new ways to
refract that same information into new
patterns it's about taking you know
taking that one what
beam of light and breaking it into all
these different pieces and looking at
all these different angles and so all
the times I think you actually know a
lot about what you want to say it's a
matter of figuring out how to say it
that's the hardest part and you know
that's where a lot of great a be testing
can come in so i think that's that's a
really good way to learn more about how
did how to do that is you know don't
assume that you ever know the answer to
anything if you have the option to
gather data about what people actually
do do you have any references as far as
a book or an out or something that you
use for researching is this correct
grammar am I putting my sentences
together in a way that people understand
it do you have any tools that you back
to this app called friends I'll talk to
about my whenever I write something like
there's a few people who are just really
like I know that are just killer writers
you know kids who were debate champions
in high school or you know they've they
write fiction they write a completely
different thing than I right and they'll
they have such amazing perspectives on
language and how to use it and so I've
tried to create a little brain trust of
those people around me to to bounce
things off of when I need to and you
know I think that a lot of great you
know if you're all if you're you know if
a marketer or community manager or a
copy writer or designer you should be
trying to create that same kind of brain
trust across other companies that your
friends work at instead of just doing
that all within your own company and you
know it yeah it might seem little weird
like I'm working on helping somebody
else at another company during my own
work time but you know you would hope
that your boss would understand that
it's this value exchange and that you're
getting more heads on the problem by
doing this so you know if you look at
any of the like though a lot of the best
writers in technology right now if you
look at their their essays take Paul
Graham for instance at the bottom of any
of his essays are is like thank you to
these seven people who read drafts of
this post and that's a go such a long
way I personally don't I think you
should write something that you feel
through that's really just true to your
heart first but once you have that
initial expression don't be afraid to
pick it apart and have other people get
their eyes on it and massage it from
there
because you your it's amazing that you
know I think the most emotional in the
most powerful writing comes straight
from the heart and like a lot of times I
know my best writing is the one stuff I
never edits the stuff I wrote the first
time and it was just like I don't know
it was just vivid and like passionate it
was like I don't know I felt like my my
mojo coming out when I wrote it and like
I wanted I try to keep as much of that
as possible but at the same time like a
lot of times you'll show that to someone
and they'll be like all of this is great
except for this one thing doesn't make
any sense and they'll and in
having those other eyes like you can't
always see that yourself and having the
more people that you can get a look to
look at your writing I think before you
you press it out the better and that
doesn't mean you have to be slow there's
a very there's a big difference between
like agonizing over your writing and
having someone take a quick scan of it
and instead of maybe doing line by line
edits and them actually editing the text
you should just give them you know an
uneditable copy and have them give you
their impressions afterwards because
that's a similar vibe that you're going
to get from the readers after they read
something you want you want to have you
want to be controlling for that end
perception yet say you know you're not
asking your audience to rewrite any of
your product you want them you want to
know how they feel afterwards and so
that should be the same thing you're
looking to get from your brain trust
good could you give us an example going
into more of the technical academic side
of things an example of an active
sentence and active verb versus a
passive verb and nope no cannot i have
no classical writing background by the
way I'm a sociologist by trade I was an
undergrad and sociology and then a
graduate in cyber sociology never wrote
for the school paper never wrote fiction
yeah and and like I want to read more
books but I honestly don't have time to
read out even that many books like the
the way that I learned to write is just
like is from the heart and if for me
it's like if I read it back and it makes
sense and it feels right that's what's
right not like what some style guide
tells me is the right way to say
something like I speak in fragments I
start lots of sentences with like but or
and or so because that's how we talk
that's how we convey things to people is
a lot of times the ideas we're trying to
come convey in the technology industry
are almost
too complex to compact into a single
sentence and so you need to break them
up in ways that make them feel more
comprehensible and so a lot of times
it's not about like having the perfect
sentence but a group of sentences that
together convey the idea but also do do
you think that listing almost bullet
points in terms of when designing for of
the web or going to visit a website
that's there explaining a product or
trying just to explain what sorry Ken
we're jumbled when a product is being
explained to you on a website and they
need to get it to get the information to
you very quickly do you believe that
bullet points are the best way to go
about that or would you suggest like one
clump sentence how do you think is the
most what do you think is the most
effective way okay I mean they both
other time so if you're trying to convey
a bunch of distinct different ideas then
bullet points will work and you can
really make them as short as possible
like really short bullet points but you
know if you have one big idea trying to
like pick at it from a bunch of bullet
points doesn't make sense and sometimes
like starting your app with like one
long sentence can actually be the right
move if that's the best way to convey
the emotion and identity of what you're
building yeah okay alright so moving
into your process what how long does it
take you to come up with a headline is
that the first thing that you do or do
you write up the article first and then
add the headline in later so I write all
of my thing everything I write is almost
entirely written in exact order that you
read it I start with the headline
because when you write the headline then
you know what words not to use in the
first sentence you're not going to end
up tripping over yourself whereas if you
write the first sentence you might use
all those juicy words that would have
been awesome in the headline and so I
try to I try to write the headline first
then I know okay I can't use maybe those
three words for another like two
sentences and I can find another way to
come at the same a similar concept in
the first sentence and then I'll try to
write the the first part like a first
paragraph of anything i read i write
will be essentially it's like why is
this happen what does it do and then
I'll end it with these are the sort of
very pertinent details of today like why
is this news ear why is this important
right now
and then I'll tease sort of the longer
vision of what I'm writing so I try to
get into to hint that oh it's not going
to be all facts there's going to be some
of my identity and some of my analysis
and opinion in this later because if you
don't if somebody already knows what
you're talking about they might assume
that whatever your writing is going to
be completely old to them whereas if you
tease a little bit of that really
personal subjective analysis you create
this hook that I oh there is something
that I couldn't possibly have thought of
all already in this story and so I got
to work my way to it so I think that you
can do it you can do that a lot of that
with if you know if you're writing press
releases I think that that's also a
really important way of doing it it's
not about just laying out each fact in
order it's about giving a general idea
of why something is important and why is
it important right now and then teasing
what the like deeper second level
understanding is that you're going to
sort of extrapolate on later in the in
whatever you're writing but for right
when you write when you go to write for
Twitter like explain the product or try
to get a message with in 140 characters
do you have any tricks yeah do that so I
right when I'm right when I tweet I
generally right however I would imagine
like I thought myself no matter how many
characters it is and usually it'll end
up taking you know like 180 your 220
characters or something and then I'll
start going back and I'll say I'll look
at hey that word was unimportant that
didn't make any sense that can be
abbreviated that can be shortened this
whole idea is is too much to try to
impress on people really early and I'll
keep on cutting back and back and back
and you know sort of hacking at it with
this social media of machete until I get
done get down to like a really really
brief and punchy phrase and something
that that not only you don't want to it
will their shoe is you know if you write
something that is does not include a
link then you want to embody the entire
idea at once and you know and in those
cases I think you can take a little bit
more room you can use more of the
characters like it might be acceptable
to use like 125 130 of the characters
you don't need to leave as much room at
the end whereas if you're posting about
a link there's going to be so much
information behind that link that people
are going to be able to form there
own opinions about what you're saying
and so you'll probably want to leave
more room for them to be able to you
know manually tweet with their own
impression or their own interpretation
of what you're writing so that's that's
just my way of writing them for tweets
but a fascinating tip that I've heard is
that in some cases if you put a link in
the middle of your tweet instead of the
end of the tweet it will actually
perform better it'll get more clicks
just because it looks different it
doesn't feel like the same tweet that
they've read a hundred times where it's
like I'm promoting this thing and here
it is instead it's like there's this
thing and here's the wing and here's
what I think about it and it becomes
more of AI it feels more like a
conversation than a broadcast it's a
good tip but does Twitter automatically
when they shorten the URL does it go to
the end of the sentence or the end of
the to me not a few I mean no generally
it doesn't you you can place the link in
wherever you want it does that with
photos which I really don't like cuz
sometimes I want to put that photo link
in the center but you know we're giving
them a tip so they can better take
action plenty of things Twitter could do
the way that any of the big social
social companies have tons of things
that they could iterate on but like you
know I think that's an important way of
thinking about like anything around
product design but also UX is it's easy
to get into the it's a to fall into the
trap of writing something or designing
something for you and that is the R not
the audience the audience is the
audience you have to get out of the
building in a lot of cases that's like a
core of the Lean Startup mentality is
you need to be building for your
customers or building for your audience
and so think about what is this what is
going to resonate with the widest group
of people not just what you think is
right and you have to get out of out of
your own head a lot of times to be able
to do that and I think that it's really
important to get as much of that outside
feedback into your UX copy as early as
possible when you're working on
something and so that means when you
when you when you're doing like beta
testing and you're doing focus grouping
and you watch somebody use a nap you
don't want to just be watching what they
do you want to like listen to how
they're talking through them things a
lot of times people like sort of talk
out loud or you can ask them
like talk out loud what you're doing and
you'll see them if they if they read a
sentence in your app like a piece of
your UX copy and they like hesitate on a
word it's probably that that word
doesn't feel natural to them and could
be replaced with something better or if
you hear them calling something a
different word like they call it their
own version you're probably trying to
like top down a sign unnamed just
something that already has a sort of
bottom-up name to it inherently and so
the more you can try to think about it
that way and get that that that outside
perspective into your UX copy as early
as possible I think you end up with
something that feels more more
accessible to a wider audience and you
know most apps these days I really think
the biggest problem is not the app
itself it's not about the functionality
it's about traction there's a million
good products having a great idea is not
enough anymore to succeed in Silicon
Valley or in anywhere in technology you
have to build something that that by
feels and it can't just be a kid just
you know be as a this piece of utility
has to make people feel something as
well and it has to be simple does as
dumb as possible people know not as dumb
as possible do not talk down to your
users ever know when I say dumb I mean
keep things like as simple as possible
so everybody will understand it right
well allow smarter people to add their
own interpretation of something while
making it accessible to people who are
less well-versed in whatever you're
talking about but no one is stupid it's
just a matter of they haven't gotten the
education about whatever you're talking
about yet or maybe using Universal terms
that everybody will understand not just
mmm not just one no you not well I mean
it's it's you want everyone in your
audience to to understand it so like I'm
gonna pull out my phone for a second to
show you to read off some examples that
I took of some really good ways that you
can describe things in ways that don't
feel like you're a robot so like you
know for instance that will call this
app they had a had a concert that they
worship that they they had and the
concert sold out but they had extra
tickets so they could have been like
concert X has sold out but we you can
still buy tickets on will call instead
they're like get your tightest pants on
mr. little jeans is sold out but we
still got the skinny be quick and like
that sounds kind of ridiculous but at
the same time it's like pretty and
evocative of the brand that they're
trying to capture and the audience which
is like very much the like 16 to 30
audience and so when you're thinking
about that's your audience that's who
you're writing for it doesn't have to be
generally accessible to everyone on the
planet because like unless everyone on
your planet is a possible user of what
you're building that's that there's no
point to write for them right for
whoever it is that you really want to
use the app and honestly a lot of times
you want to go with an itch to win
strategy nail a certain demographic or a
certain customer segment and then from
there allow them to help you build into
a wider audience so like some other ones
on another one like I can I think it's
kind of funny like Lulu which is this
app where women can rate men as romantic
partners when somebody views your
profile you don't get a notification
being like somebody viewed your profile
it's like smile and wave somebody is
looking at your profile right now and it
feels much more like there's this human
connection even though there's like this
giant barrier in the app literally you
can't directly connect with the other
men and women cannot directly talk to
each other in this app but it they
bridge that divide with this
notification with really good ux a
copywriting and it feels like it feels
what it's really about which is you know
breaking down the barriers between men
and women so that so that they can they
can understand each other and it from a
more transparent perspective and
hopefully you find happier relationships
and like that's what it's about it's
about making that connection to people
and I think that you know by using
something a little colloq like smile and
wave like that works a lot better than
Yahweh in some countries like waving at
people is offensive but you know that's
not who their audience is so that's why
how they wrote it the eat 24 hours of
you any of you guys ordered food from
there e 24 hours are they have when
you're done placing an order they have
really cute pre-made tweets and they're
like no I'm not feeling this one let's
randomly see what else they have and
they're really well written and kind of
clever and so I give them props but I
want to go ahead and open this up for
the audience QA and we have somebody we
have one of our volunteers is going to
pass around a microphone and raise your
hand if you have a question you sir yes
right right there so I got it yep you
stand up and then we'll bring the
microphone to you well we get over there
one of the stuff that we talked about
was around like UX design or like
marketing design but you know a big
issue for a lot of startups is
fundraising and a lot of these tips come
straight from top investors people like
Fred Wilson at union square ventures who
really says whenever anyone pitches him
he wants to hear about the problem first
and then how you solve it opposed to who
the team is or like the nitty-gritty of
how it works or how popular it's going
to be one day starting with that
emotional resonance works across a
really wide range of writing please
thank you hi so can you please give us
more oh I really like this last part
that I gave us specific examples are
good examples can you please give us
more good examples and bad examples I'm
sure I mean specific examples read from
so you know here's one example it's like
when you tip in lift the the driving app
they don't it's it's not like oh thank
you for tipping they don't use copy
sometimes it's about not using copy at
all and so instead what they do is every
time you press to add a dollar of tip
this little balloon that's like attached
to the top of the car in the center of
the screen starts to inflate and it
rises up and if you like add enough
dollars like the fireworks start going
off and it just gets like it's really
pretty and delightful and there was like
no there was no amount of words that
they could have used in that situation
to be able to convey that like that
delight and so I think sometimes it's
about understanding when not to use
words at all another thing is like I
really like it when
when apps lift also does this is that
they they say things very directly but
then they also add like sort of like a
thank you or a please at the end of what
they say so it'll be like you know the
you know for them it's like we they need
they need like your facebook
authentication so that they can for
their no trust system so that there's it
you can't like you know go on some
murderous rampage and then just like
start a new lift account and do the do
it all over again and so they'll be like
they'll be like you know connect connect
your facebook account please and even
just that like that little please like
you're asking for something and so you
know thanking the user for it or saying
please i think is like a really critical
way to do that we see you know so
manners apply yeah manners definitely
apply I mean again it comes back to tot
light writing the way that you would
talk to someone you wouldn't ask for
someone to like give you something out
of their pocket that's like pretty
important to them and not thank them
forward or say please for it it would
just come off as really as blunt and
even if you like oh great great UX
design and ux copy is always super
concise as few words as possible that's
something we like i said it's not always
true adding a little bit of a motion and
flavor into it can make a can make a
longer sentence seem shorter think about
some other ones i will come back and if
you can always a son Josh can come back
and quote does anybody else have like
good examples that they really like in
in UX copy design or like bad or
negative opportunities things nobody
wants to on anyone come on it's
like your big opportunity to just like
it I found the other day was funny i had
my GPS turn off on yelp ha and the
hermes error message I guess era not
error message was uh hey are you a ninja
katsia this is little and it is is
little ninja guy I'm like I'm not a
ninja but I don't have my gps on cute
well one example I really like is in
Hipmunk the flight search engine when
you search for something it takes a
little bit of time because it has to
query all these third-party sites for
the flight details to make sure that
it's finding you like the best price and
what they do is as they do that they
actually run through the name of each of
those sites it's like you know searching
at like you know searching expedia
searching orbit searching all these
things and instead of you just waiting
there and looking at this blank screen
as it loads it's actually giving you
something to look at in the meantime and
it might seem like well nobody cares if
you're like searching alaska airlines
and frontier airlines and all these
things it's like well they do care if
they don't have anything else that they
can do while they wait and so I think we
trying to look at those opportunities
wait wend when is there like a roadblock
or a stopping point in your app where
there's something that has to happen on
the backend and using that as an
opportunity to do better branding on the
front end there there have been a lot of
presentations that I've seen a lot of
presentations where they referenced
Hipmunk as having great user experience
design so that is a good good reference
to would like to open it up for one few
more questions picking us some more for
you that um Baris back there please
bring him the microphone right just if
you have a question stand up and let me
get back what's funny is like I think
the way the word all the worst ones it's
like sometimes you think like Oh
terrible things always stand out in your
mind I think I just forget those apps
entirely when they have bad ux what do
you do when somebody gets to write the
when somebody scoops what you're writing
you know um say it say like oh my god
Pando daily came out with the app story
before I did what's your strategy well I
think it's about knowing that you have
some subjective opinion or value that no
one else on the planet can offer and you
want to make sure that whatever you're
doing in your life you're applying that
little unique DNA to to your purpose and
so if I'm writing something that
somebody else could like completely
scoop me on that I'm writing a shitty
article personally I think I think if
there
you know anything i write i would hope
that there would be like a deeper second
level analysis or a piece of opinion
that would make it unique to me so even
if they wrote it before me it wouldn't
matter it's like I don't care if they
wrote it before me I'm gonna write it
better and I'm gonna write it in a way
that people really and understand and
resonate with and I think the same goes
with with design is you know it's not
about necessarily always being first
like yeah being first is a great example
or sorry as a great advantage but you
can you you just have to find what is it
unique that you do and and you know
focus on that and highlight that instead
of being like you know like getting down
on yourself or saying somebody else did
it first you want to just always be
thinking about how to do it better and
how to do it your way because hopefully
people aren't just using your app or
whatever you do for the functionality
they're doing it for the emotional
resonance as well and like that's that's
how i feel about using Hipmunk it's like
there's a bunch of different you know I
could use kayak or all these other ones
but a lot of them feel you know what kya
came way before hipmunk but I don't use
it I use hit month because I I feel
something when i use it i feel like
they're actually working for me and it's
like this cutesy character that
understands my agony and traveling
that's like their big thing is they have
this agony index that a like calculates
not just what is the cheapest flight or
the shortest flight but like make sure
that you know it you know it down ranks
flights that you know you have to wake
up at three thirty in the morning to
catch or that have like our terrible way
over in like a stupid town somewhere
like they they will they factor that in
a way that makes me feel like they are
emotionally cognizant of what i need and
what I'm looking for and so I think that
you can do that in design to make to
one-up anyone it's just like the same
thing when they're there must be so many
startups that come up with an idea and
so many people are like oh I have the
idea oh but they could be they could
have the same idea but it's all about
how they present the idea and how they
execute it and yeah it's like they say
modern art is I could have done that
Plus what you did in two it's like yeah
it's like yeah you once you saw that you
sure we're able to think of it but the
whole thing is like the understanding it
and having it bubble out of you like
originally and the same way it's like
yeah somebody else could make a
cool-looking cube but like you want to
have your cube have its own texture and
it's a
and you know its own luminosity it's
like so that its own properties that
make it different we have a question in
the back there yes yeah my questions
with regards to SEO and using
appropriate key terms it's probably not
so much an issue for TechCrunch but for
me with trying to find my community
through natural searches I've been told
this stuff a lot or use certain ratios
and I don't know if you ever dealt with
that um yeah so like some you know
sometimes when I'm writing something if
I wanted to reach the maximum number of
people i think a lot about like what are
they going to search like what are the
order of the words that they're going to
search in and I try to like structure my
headlines to fit that and if I can if I
want my headline to be something more
like more touchy-feely I'll put all
those words into the URL slug instead
which helps for SEO as well but one
really fascinating thing that I have
found is that if i write an article and
I just you know put a bunch of SEO terms
into the the URL like that's the sort of
end of the URL a lot of times that yeah
sure I think it might get me more search
traffic but what really happens if I put
like something really funny or like
insightful or some little like joke
almost the way that you would like use a
sort of I you know sarcastic hashtag at
the end of a tweet if I put that as my
url slug instead I find that people a
lot of times will like certain will like
share it for that exact reason so like
one time I wrote this article was like
this is some boring boring stuff this is
about this is a the the director of
Facebook Sri targeted advertising
platform leaving to go to an ad startup
like who the hell wants to read that
turns out there's a few people who
really care about this but this guy's
name was Antonio Garcia Martinez and so
I made the the slug of the of the
article add Tonio Garcia ads Martinez
and like for some reason all these
people in the ad community thought that
was really funny and like it got way
more traction and way more retweets and
shares and people were like commenting
on that and they like all of his friends
suddenly like had this like more this
emotional resonance with it and they
wanted to share it as well and so
sometimes doing something that sort of
contrary to what you would think would
be a best SEO practice if it really
embodies
is your identity and the like the brand
that you're trying to convey it can go
farther than just trying to play it as a
scientist okay we have time for two more
questions so make them good people ok so
I'm interested in your own emotional
experience especially when you talk
about resonating with your audience
knowing your audience and getting to you
know connecting with your audience and
getting outside of your head I'm you
wrote for like a million people
so how do you relate to such a large
cross-section of humanity at once um I
try to keep my ears open as much as
possible like whenever I write something
like I really like get into it in the
comments and I'll like to fend my piece
on Twitter and I'll search for the wake
up not just for my own name but I'll
search for anyone that but that tweeted
the link of it and I'll look at what
they're saying and if they're saying
something negative i'll engage them and
ask them like how i could do better and
a lot of times you know being willing to
uh know that you're not doing everything
right and to go out there and
proactively ask how you could get better
that's a really great way to understand
what's going wrong and also like we have
this we have you know we have an amazing
platform so like when we tweet enough
like when we publish an article it
immediately gets tweeted to two million
people and so we get a really really
good real-time feedback and like I'm not
afraid to go back in and add an update
to an article that I wrote 10 minutes
ago because I could learn a lot in that
10 minutes when you think about it's
like well if you have 10,000 smart
people read it then like them and the
1000 smartest of them leave a comment
and you read the 500 smartest of those
like so much content so much
understanding so I think being a really
good listener and trying to proactively
go out there and request people to
defame you like tell ask them what's the
dumbest thing you did in this product
choice or in this article or in this
pitch you'd be amazed at how quickly you
start to see the web your articles from
a third perspective and you you're able
to improve them a lot better so don't be
afraid of criticism no embrace it I mean
it's so much more fun to that way if
somebody is like objectively trolling
you like just like laugh them off like
send them some ridiculous reaction
if or like or just some silly meme or
just completely ignore them but like if
somebody's giving you really good
critical feedback like they're actually
saying something that you did wrong and
make like you look at you like you get
this sort of like sinking feeling in
your gut like yeah I did that up
like that's those are the times when you
like that's how you wearn the most I
think so being unafraid of that because
what you want to be you I would hope
that all of you are doing something with
your life that your profession is also
your passion it's something that you
want to do for a long time if it's not
go find that thing but once you've found
that thing treat it as a craft treated
is something that you suck at it first
and you're going to you're trying to
shoot for how you're going to be at it
in five years or ten years like I'm
thinking about doing this for like
minimum five more years ten more years
so I say what do I want to be then and I
know it's going to be a lot a lot
different than I am now and the only way
to get there is to find out what I'm
doing wrong so you know until until
you're a grandmaster you should be
actively embracing your criticism I have
one more question all right you resume
I'm real scene hi um my question is C oh
ok so for those of us who haven't like
who aren't currently doing like our
passion so say we want to do more
writing what are the different avenues
you think that you could go through to
be a successful writer in the digital
age and then how would you build up your
body of work if maybe you're doing some
stuff at work that's writing but it's
not really like demonstrating that your
great writer so the Internet has
democratized the platform of writing to
the point that if you're writing about
something that anyone can write about
what you're writing has already been
said and there's going to be so many
voices mimicking the same perspective
that you're never going to be able to
get traction w the the market or the
audience for whatever you're trying to
say is super fragmented across all these
people so what I recommend for anyone
trying to like to do more writing in
their life pick one thing but like you
could never get bored of the one thing
that way you could learn day in and day
out and like when everyone else is
rolling your eyes you're like opening
them even wider and for me that was that
was like Facebook marketing like it was
something that I was just really
fascinated by because it was like okay
my god there's like all
businesses that are suddenly have this
in this huge platform but they have no
idea how they're how they're going to
use it and you know how can how can what
I you know so I I try to specialize as
much as possible around this very narrow
segment of like social identity and
cyber sociology and so I just kept on
hammering and writing about that
specifically so you know after i get at
school was like yeah i could have done a
sociology master's degree or
communications or psychology or
something that like everyone has heard
of but then i just be one of another ten
thousand or ten million psychology
majors now there's anything wrong with
it but like what i tried to do was find
something that i could be the best at
find the thing that you can be the best
at and then just write every day about
it because if it's narrow enough
everyone else will think it's boring and
that will just the whole pack will fall
away and you'll end up rising to the top
and then you be amazed the Internet has
created this marketplace for people with
expertise there's always somebody out
there who wants to know the really
obscure thing as if you're an expert at
it so pick that one tiny little thing
and it like it gets really narrow like
really narrow if you think you've found
it already then like think of like try
to break it out into ten more things at
all but not fit under that umbrella and
then pick one of those and do it again
until you found something so niche that
you're sure that you can be the best in
the world at and then just write every
day about it and eventually the people
who need that information will find you
and you will have you will have a dream
profession of being able to write
straight from your heart and do
something that where you can learn every
day and never get bored and to me that's
what wipes up yeah put on a blog I mean
right now I think you should own your
audience as much as possible like medium
is great for distribution you know being
like a big about writing on Twitter is
great but like you want to have some
property where you can have full control
of the emotional feel of what you're
writing and it can really be like a
whole you know a shrine to your own
contribution to the world not a shrine
to you but a shrine to your contribution
and and own that space as much as
possible and you know with time you can
use all those other social platforms to
funnel people there
use as many of them as possible I mean
there's a lot of obscure ones like Korra
blogs is a great one you can like you
know Trump might write a little blurb
about what you're one of your blog post
and publish it on Korra and anyone
looking for some knowledge about that
topic will end up getting funneled to
your site you know try to create as many
of those inroads but own that end point
where your writing is and then when no
one will get lost in the identity of who
it is that's really writing this and
they'll know to come to you very good
thank you josh where we're just about
done with all the questions and we want
to thank you so much for this thank you
so much for having me here is really fun
you too great job muttering to everyone
will give it up to Andy I think she did
a really good job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
