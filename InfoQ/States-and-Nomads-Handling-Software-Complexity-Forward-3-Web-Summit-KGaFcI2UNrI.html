in hg wells the time machine he
describes a world populated by two races
the LOI live above-ground in a garden
paradise and the Morlocks toil beneath
the earth to serve the ly but sometimes
at night they come up Neath the LOI and
this can and has been used as metaphor
for all sorts of things but I like to
think of it as a story about knowledge
and innocence the LOI live in a paradise
they don't fully understand and
sometimes what they don't know comes up
and bites them and as software engineers
this should sound familiar because we
build on foundations that we don't
understand we sit atop 60 years of
accreted abstractions and when we start
out we try to dig down we try to
understand but at some point we have to
realize that first principles are not
within reach at some point we have to be
content with what we know and build
upwards and so from the beginning of our
education we're taught ways to cope with
this to deal with the fact that we don't
understand the systems that we can't
understand the systems that we build in
their entirety and chief among them is
the hierarchy or the tree and the tree
has some very specific invariants very
specific relationships that are allowed
that of parent and child and that of
siblings and with the siblings it's
notable that they are only connected
through their parent they have no direct
relationship they can be considered in
isolation from each other we can
decompose the problem we can divide and
conquer it and for some problems is a
completely accurate representation of
the problem space we're trying to play
tic-tac-toe the game space of all
possible games is a tree it starts with
an empty board at the root and goes down
with moves and countermoves but I would
expect that no one in this audience
writes gaming eyes for a living and so
the systems we build look more like this
they have components and sub components
and they're connected in sort of varied
subtle ways and of course we still treat
them as a hierarchy here if you ignore
all the dotted lines then it's still
something that can be decomposed it
still has pieces that can be considered
in isolation but we only got here by
choosing to
nor things by telling ourselves that
they don't matter for the problem that
we're trying to solve and so we spend a
lot of our time pretending that these
two things are the same and of course
they're not that's a polite fiction
right that's a story that we tell
ourselves and it's a necessary story
because otherwise we can't make progress
we build systems that we can't
understand fully but sometimes it's easy
for us to forget that this is a story
it's easy for us to forget that the
model that we have is not the world as
it actually is and we're not alone in
this we can go and look at something
like scientific forestry as it was
invented in the Prussian Empire in the
1860s and scientific forestry is roughly
the process of going from this to this
and the reason that they tried this was
because of Russian Empire needed lumber
they needed to build ships and other
things and forests which they had many
of or not necessarily very efficient at
producing lumber there are lots of trees
that didn't make useful number that grew
too slowly and also the forests were
very irregular they didn't have a sort
of predictable layout and so the only
way that they could estimate the yield
of a force was to survey the entire
thing and so their solution that this
was very straightforward they discovered
which tree grew the fastest produced the
most lumber and they planted them in
regular rose so that they could look at
a subset of the forest and extrapolate
the state of the rest of the force
without ever having to look at it and at
first this was very successful the trees
had record yields they got the lumber
that they needed but over time the
nutrients that had been put in the soil
by the previous force the previous
ecosystem that existed there were used
up and so the trees began to grow
stunted and diseases hit the monoculture
that they had planted and the force died
out altogether and so one really
straightforward conclusion we can make
mrs. at forests are complicated right
force or not just the trees but I think
a more interesting sort of thing to
think about here is the perspective of
the bureaucrat somewhere in the heart of
the Prussian Empire that had an idea of
a force as a means of reducing lumber he
didn't think of a forest as a shelter or
a home for wildlife or as a means of
reducing medicinal herbs or lumber for
the nearby villages he thought of it as
a means producing uh just wood wood to
build ships and when he went and saw the
forest understood that his model was not
the forest as it actually was his
response was not to create a more
complex a more nuanced model it was to
make the world conform to his
understanding of it and at this point
many of you may be wondering what this
talk is actually about and why you're
here and before I get to that I want to
define a word that we use a lot which is
a system right we build systems the
force is an ecosystem and there's no one
true definition of this but one that I
like is from Gerald Weinberg's an
introduction to general systems thinking
and he defines a space with two axes
complexity is how many moving pieces
there are and randomness is a degree to
which they are all independent of each
other and he points out that anything
which is sufficiently simple and
sufficiently structured on a nonrandom
can be formally analyzed we can
understand it as in its entirety and
anything which is sufficiently random
where all the sort of actors are moving
independently of each other we can use
statistical analysis kind of independent
of how many moving parts there are but
there's a very large gap in between
where neither of these approaches are
sufficient and so this is where what
Weinberg calls systems thinking is
required where we need what he calls
heuristic devices which are a lossy way
of looking at the world they are an
effective model but not a true model
right there are things that we ignore
there are things that we sort of blind
ourselves to in an attempt to understand
the system but the point that he makes
is that heuristic devices don't tell you
when to stop no model which is
simplified acknowledges there's
something outside of itself the forest
is a means producing lumber does not
acknowledge that there are other uses
for a forest and this is something that
we wrestle with right these heuristic
devices they are the medium that we use
to make systems to make software the
source code and the frameworks and the
libraries these are
svet but really what we wrestle with on
a daily basis I'd argue is the inherent
trade-offs here choosing what to ignore
and want to pay attention to and if we
look at what we do from that perspective
there's not just the last 60 years of
computer science we can learn from
there's last several Millennials worth
of human thought because everything that
we build eventually exceeds our ability
to understand it and so this is a
problem that we see repeated over and
over again this is something that people
have written about at length and so what
I want to talk about here are other
places where people have wrestled with
this problem and some of the pitfalls
and some of the approaches that they've
looked at in the hope that this will
sort of inform what you do for a living
not directly but indirectly and so we
begin with mid-century critical theory
which was a roughly the sort of attempt
to take the works of Karl Marx and
Sigmund Freud and use them as dual
lenses to understand all of human
thought it was a very sweeping sort of
grand vision of analysis and like most
things that are grand and sweeping it
had logical holes you could drive a
truck through which led to these two
guys Gilda Liz and Felix guitari sort of
pointing these things out and deleuze
and guitari were the first postmodern
critical theorists and most of you who
have heard of postmodern critical theory
I probably heard of it as something
which is slightly ridiculous it's hard
to tell whether or not it's one big
practical joke and it is hard to
understand I think that there is
definitely substance underneath all the
pros but one excerpt from a thousand
plateaus which is a book written by to
lose and guitari reads the layers are
the strata they come in pairs one
serving a substratum for the other the
surface of stratification is a machine
ago semblance to stinked from the strata
the assemblages between two layers
between two strata on one side it faces
a strata in this direction the
assemblage is an inter stratum but on
the other side faces something else the
body without organs are plane of
consistency here there's a meta stratum
and I could probably take the rest of
this talk and try to explain to you what
this
passage means I might even get it right
but ah the essence of what they write
about is not really tied up in the
language the essence is this recurring
theme that they talk about which is the
interplay between the state and the
Nomad where the state is something that
tries to sit atop the world to
understand it to control it and it does
this by establishing hierarchies because
hierarchies are the only tool we have to
understand something as big as the world
and in trying to model the world it also
tries to make the world conform to its
simplistic model conversely the Nomad is
someone who tries to understand the
world as it is but only locally only a
little bit at a time and they talk about
the rhizome or things which are
rhizomatic arise ohm is a biological
term for an organism which is connected
at the roots they seem sort of
disconnected but underneath they are all
one big organism and the losing atari
talk about the interplay between
rhizomatic structures and arborescent or
tree-like structures and if they were
computer scientists instead of french
critical theorists they might have just
called these trees and graphs right but
the point that they make is that the
things that we call tree is the things
which we use hierarchies for are often
just degenerate views of the world as it
actually it is they are lossy and this
is crucial right this is again a pattern
that we see repeated over and over again
and if this sounds interesting I would
not recommend that you begin with a
thousand plateaus it's a interesting
book it's a rewarding book as you kind
of go through it the second time but the
first time is a bit of a slog and so
instead I'd actually suggest someone
else who I think is much more
approachable Jorge Luis Borges was an
Argentine librarian in the early 20th
century and he wrote short stories about
infinity about taking an idea and sort
of stretching it to its extreme until it
breaks down in fun and interesting ways
and one of his stories is a paragraph
it's one of my favorites is called on
exactitude and science and it reads in
that Empire the art of cartography
attained such perfection that the map of
a single province occupied the entirety
of a city and the map of the Empire the
entirety of a province in time those
unconscionable Maps no longer
satisfied and the cartographers guild
struck a map of the empire who sighs was
that of the Empire which coincided point
for point with it the following
generations were not so fond of the
study of cartography as their forebears
had been saw the vast map was useless
and not without some pitiless pneus was
it that they delivered it up to the
inclemency zuv sun and winters in the
deserts of the west still today there
are tatted ruins of that map inhabited
by animals and beggars in all the land
there is no other relic of the
disciplines of geography who here has
heard the phrase the map is not the
territory okay so that's basically
saying what this story says at greater
length right we use maps because they
are reductive this is why you can have a
book full an atlas full of maps that
does show the same place but in
different ways right they take one facet
of the world they raise it above all the
others and what this means is that as we
sort of asymptotically approach a map
that describes the world in all of its
nuances it ceases to be useful right it
no longer describes the world in a way
which we find more approachable than the
world but at the same time as we become
more reductive as we create a map which
has less and less detail we also find
that the utility of his map sort of
falls off very rapidly and so the
equilibrium between these two things is
what we're searching for and it's very
hard to find it's very mired in what
we're trying to do with the map and yet
it's very easy for us to believe that
the map is the territory right we
interact with our maps so much more
often than we interact with the world
itself and so we lose sight of this and
we can again look at the sort of school
of modern urban design which began in
the 1860s with Baron Houseman's redesign
of Paris where he tore down the slums
and built these structures which are now
iconic like the Arc de Triomphe and the
reason they they tore down the slums was
in part because the slums were crowded
and unhealthy and unsightly but it was
also because the slums were so dense
that they could effectively wall
themselves off in the rest of the city
they were impossible to control they
could seed from the city within the city
and so they tore down the slums and they
replaced them with these big wide roads
which could not be walled off which
allow
the city and the government to project
force into the city and you see here
that the roads radiate outwards from the
Arc de Triomphe or this is saying that
we see time and time again in modern
urban design here this is the
theoretical Garden City which at the
center has the central city which is
responsible for the administration and
like spokes around it are a lot of other
specialized cities which deal with
specific needs and in between there's a
huge amount of open space because the
urban designers in this school felt like
the people left of their own devices
would never ruin the city they would
build everywhere they would fill all the
open space all the available space so
they felt it was their job to save the
people from themselves to give them a
rational design that they could not find
emergently one of the most visible
members of the school was a french
furniture designer and a mature city
planner named Luca boosie a who
submitted this sketch to the new Soviet
Union in 1920 as a idea for the new
centre of Moscow these large buildings
here are called super block say where
everyone is required to live and due to
the economies of this scale the
efficiencies of the scale there's room
for huge amounts of wide-open space in
between and you'll notice that this
looks nothing like Moscow has no real
sense of the Russian culture that
preceded it and this is by design Luca
Pitti I'd had no concern for the context
for him good planning was good planning
which is why when the Russians turned
him down a few years later he scratched
out the labels and submitted to the city
of Paris as a new city centre a more
successful attempt at creating a
rational city was the construction of
Brasilia as the new government center in
Brazil in the 1960s the contract for the
design was awarded on the basis of this
sketch alone which shows a vertical
access where all the government
buildings would be and to outstretched
wings where all the super blocks would
be
and because they again they controlled
where everyone would live they could
build arteries these great big highways
that would allow for efficient transit
they controlled everything because
everything was constructed in advance of
their even being a population and so
they built it and after they were done a
few things happened all of the workers
who were brought from all over the
country to construct the city had no
place in the city they were not part of
the plan and so they were forced to
settle on the outskirts of the city
which had no affordances had no power
had no plumbing no sewage no roads
because the city had not anticipated
people living outside of its plans this
was not an extensible city but even the
people who were allowed to live there I
reported a feeling of disconnection look
at this wide open space here and notice
that there are no people this is because
the spaces are not for people this the
spaces are a declaration of control of
power of the mastery of the plan and so
they reported this feeling which they
called Brazil ETA or roughly Brasilia
itÃ­s the the syndrome of living in
Brasilia and while this remains the
government center it is to this day
vastly underpopulated a more successful
attempt to kind of deal with these ideas
comes from Christopher Alexander who was
a planner and architect who wrote two
books called a timeless way of building
in a pattern language where he attempted
to describe something that he felt was
good about certain buildings that he
found and he called this the quality
without a name because there is no one
word that really encompassed it but he
said that it was alive and whole and
comfortable and free exact egoless and
eternal and noticed that some of these
are sort of attention with each other
it's hard for something to be both free
and exact be both alive and eternal
these are not dimensions that we can
simply move up into the right on and
find this quality this is a balance that
must be struck and Alexander was very
careful to say
this is something which is wholly
contextual he says it is never twice the
same because it always takes its shape
from the particular place in which it
occur excuse me which it occurs and so
you can't take a house that has this
quality and move it a mile down the road
or move it halfway across the world and
expected to retain this quality this is
something which is ephemeral it is not
sort of reducible and so when he talks
about it he does not talk in terms of
pieces of homes he talks in terms of
their totality at the beginning of a
timeless way of building he says the
first thing that comes to mind when he
talks about the quality without a name
is a cottage in the British countryside
and he says the wall runs east to west
the peach tree grows flat against the
southern side the Sun shines on the tree
and as it warms the bricks behind the
tree the warm bricks themselves warm the
peaches on the tree it has a slightly
dozy quality the tree carefully tried to
grow flat against the wall warming the
bricks the peach is growing in the Sun
the wild grass growing around the roots
of the tree and the angle where the
earth and roots and wall all meet and so
there's a wholeness to this a holistic
quality to this it is not easily reduced
but of course we're software people and
so we did at the height of the sort of
popularity of Alexander's ideas some
people got together and wanted to come
up with what the design patterns what
this sort of would lead to this quality
and software and they called it the
design patterns book it's a gang a four
book it's very well-known and was for
time very popular but it misses
something crucial in that it tries to
give you Lego blocks it does not talk
about the context it does not talk about
the particularity is your problem it
presents itself as a collection of
universal constructs which is not at all
what Alexander was trying to communicate
a more successful I think attempt to
distill Alexander thoughts come from
comes from Richard Gabriel who is one of
the authors of the Common Lisp spec was
the founder of one of the AI companies
back in the 80s before the AI winter
killed them all after that he became
or went to get his MFA in poetry and now
he writes poetry and write software that
writes poetry and he wrote a book called
patterns of software in which he
attempts to talk about what the quality
without a name for software is and it's
a very short book I highly recommend it
but a theme that he returns to over and
over again is the idea of habitability
habitability is the degree to which you
can take a codebase that you did not
write and make it your own adapt to
changing circumstances because that is
the only sort of guarantee right
Brasilia thought that it could plan a
city that would be eternal that would
never need to change but there's always
a reductive pneus to our plans there's
always something which we think we can
ignore which we can't and there is a
fragility to the expectation that things
will never change there is an
unpleasantness to code bases that force
us to stay within these very tight
strictures these assumptions which have
long since been invalidated and so I
think that when we look at these sorts
of things when we look at all these past
plans all these past assumptions that is
maybe one of the largest lessons that we
can learn is that we're always going to
be wrong eventually and we should plan
for that and so we've gone through a lot
of different examples sort of skimmed
over their surface and I don't expect
that all of you will necessarily be
convinced that the things that I've
talked about are relevant to your
day-to-day sort of jobs but I do want to
just introduce one more idea which is
that the Greeks had two words for
knowledge they had a word techne which
meant knowledge and it meant timeless
knowledge it was the Pythagorean theorem
it was the harmony of the spheres it was
things which were true outside of the
world and this is a root for technology
right this is this is the sort of word
that underpins this but there's another
word matisse which also means knowledge
but it means cunning it mean it's the
thing that allowed Odysseus to fool the
Cyclops it's the thing that allows you
to walk down your hallway in the dark
not trip
or anything if we transplant you to some
other hallway in the dark you will not
be able to do that right this is mired
in the specifics of your experience and
when we're in school we're taught the
mathematics of computing we're taught
things which are universal but when we
actually begin to perform our job
nothing is universal everything depends
everything is dependent on the domain on
your knowledge of the domain and when we
make decisions we do not make decisions
which are provably right we follow our
intuition we make choices which will be
wrong and we try to fold that back into
our experience try to further inform our
intuition and so my hope here is not
that learning about City Planning or the
advent of scientific forestry will
somehow let you write better code in a
completely direct way but that it will
inform your intuition that it will give
you a vocabulary with which to discuss
these things and so there are some books
that I've read that have resonated for
me and I'll post this a little bit later
but a few that I'll call out are
invisible cities which is by Italo
Calvino it's a work of fiction it's
probably my favorite work of fiction and
it describes cities just a few pages
each chapter different cities which are
all facets of the same city Venice and
it becomes clear as it sort of goes on
that these are all sort of pieces which
come together as a whole which is more
than some of its parts seeing like a
state is where a lot of my historical
examples came from it talks about the
interplay between governments that want
and need control and the sort of ways in
which that affects the people who live
in the world as it actually is and data
and reality is a really interesting
belong that was written in the late 70s
back when sequel was sort of on the rise
is written by a research scientist at
IBM and it is a very readable very
practical analysis of some of the
shortcomings of relational modeling and
I think that is probably one of the more
directly irrelevant books on this list
and without we have quite a bit of time
left for questions
well I so the question was how do these
sorts of ideas go into working with
other people who may not have read the
same things or be familiar the same
concepts and I think that many of these
concepts are not necessarily immediately
obvious but they're not that hard to say
that a code base is habitable I think
that that it feels comfortable to live
in that it's something that you can make
your own that's not hard to explain
right it may not be immediately apparent
to someone that that's an important
thing to have that's a much broader
conversation and I'm not necessarily
going to be able to prove that I'm right
or even be right that that's the thing
to optimize for but that's a it's a word
it's a some vocabulary that you can sort
of contribute it's a thing that you can
introduce into a conversation and sort
of call back to in future conversations
once we all agree that we sort of
understand what that means and so I
don't like go to everybody that I work
with and hand them a stack of books and
say talk to me once you finish these
right that's not going to happen but I
think that you can you know do your own
reading have your own ideas and then try
to communicate that right that's
actually a really important piece of
understanding something is a degree to
which you can communicate those ideas as
someone who is not gone as deep on these
things as you have and you know you're
going to succeed you're going to fail
but I think that again that's that's
part of the value you you can enrich
these conversations you can try to
encourage people to look at it from
different perspectives yes sure yeah the
question was are there any scientific
approach sorry software approaches that
sort of resonate with this in my
day-to-day job i use closure which is a
lisp and has a ruffle and you generally
develop things sort of from the bottom
up you make small pieces bring them
together sort of a make sure that
everything works as expected and sort of
build up words from there and I think
that that arguably makes it easier to
not at the outset say here is the center
of the world and then build forward with
that from as the sort of you know
primary assumption right it becomes much
easier to create something which is
loosely coupled which allows you to
change where your center of the world is
when you do that and that's something
that I think is easier to do in closure
because that's just sort of the general
approach which is encouraged but by no
means is it limited to you know lists or
even ruppel based languages I think that
that's just a thing that you could do
emergency like at the emergence properly
yes I I don't think i can say anything
particularly broadly true about that the
question was you know how do you deal
with the fact that circumstances change
and that you know anything that you make
will become obsolete due to changing
circumstances is that about right okay I
mean I think the only inside i can give
there which is not much of an insight is
that things will become obsolete right
and if you have a framework for instance
right the sort of definition of the
framework is that it calls your code for
you right which means that fundamentally
this is the skeleton by which you
structured everything that depending on
sort of how it's structured can or
cannot be easy to change right it may be
that that is just sort of this calcified
structure that defines all the code
around at all the code has to sort of
glom on to the available points and i
think that people often so there's sort
of this interesting pattern you see on
you know places like hacker news where
people will say you know i use this for
one project and i use it for another
project which is slightly different and
so just by sort of projecting that
outwards right then it works for
everything right it's just inductively
that must be true and i think that you
know there are always boundaries to the
utility of anything right because
they're lossy because they make certain
assumptions about the world and i think
that in a lot of documentation you see
people talk about this thing is great
it's great for this but very rarely do
you see someone saying and here's where
it breaks down this is the boundaries
this is where you should not use this
and I'd really like to see more of that
right more of people saying that
something is good for one thing and bad
for another thing and not having that be
sort of the reverse in
production where if it's bad for this
must be bad for everything because only
a good abstraction must be perfect for
all possible applications and so I think
that there's a conversation that can be
had there which would be very productive
where we when you're kind of trying to
figure out obsolescence or if you're
trying to map out where things might go
that you understand which of your tools
are going to fail should you take a
particular path and that's okay that
doesn't mean that you shouldn't use it
it just means that you should be aware
that that's something that can happen
and you can you know plan for that
