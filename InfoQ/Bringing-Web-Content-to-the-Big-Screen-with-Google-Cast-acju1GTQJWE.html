engineer at Google I run
all team there where we actually help
partners so we help people like HBO Hulu
Netflix Pandora all the usual suspects
who have content on the television are
the people that I help and we're
starting to get into other things that
you wouldn't normally think of on the
television possibly like recently I
think a few weeks ago we launched daily
burner which is like a workout things
you can workout in your living room so
there's lots of lots of neat stuff
coming along so I'm the team lead
there's a few of us and you know we end
up helping the partners possibly writing
their apps for them so next week I'll
actually be in New York helping some
folks out there cool so this is about me
I'm a Java champion lots of Java stuff
over the many years three times Java one
rock star wrote a book web tool
fundamentals with Oswald who's going to
speak sometime later today
I saw him I'm probably most known for
the group's I run so I started the first
Google developer group
I run the JavaScript Meetup
what else the Java user group and
recently I've started doing a DevOps for
kids which is sort of my son here in the
front rows getting a little older a
little bit more interested and we run
workshops that teach kids about coding
so if you do have a kid check out DevOps
for kids or if you know someone who
might be interested
that's great place cool so what are we
going to talk about today so we're going
to talk about chromecast in the cast SDK
and Google cast and we'll talk about
some you know just general tips for
coding for the TV no matter which
platform you know Roku or Xbox or Apple
TV or chromecast some general kind of
guidance there and then we'll start
diving into more chromecast specific
things talking about the developer
console writing receivers which is the
code that runs on your television
senders from Chrome and then we'll talk
about samples and
and some of the design checklist stuff
that we have all right so what is
chromecast so chromecast is a is a small
dongle I think I have one here yeah so
this is what the chromecast is you can
think of it you know it's HDMI plugs
into your television and it's kind of
like a small Chrome browser basically
that you're plugging into your
television you know you can think of it
like a blu-ray player something that
you'd plug into your television works
similar similar kind of concepts it
works on any HD television it's super
low power so it has the usb on the back
that you can plug directly into your
television like they're showing here or
you can plug it in the wall whatever you
prefer I like to plug it into the wall
but it's it's everybody has their own
preference their supports CEC so
basically if you're watching your your
Comcast or whatever your regular cable
and then use cast something from your
phone it will on many TVs it will flip
it will flip the input to the input of
the chromecast it doesn't work on all
TVs you know that's a standard that's
not implemented so well across the world
like many standards but but often it
does work and what's really nice is it's
super cheap so it's only 35 bucks and
and that's what you get and actually
it's $30 everywhere but we make this
kind of guaranteed to be 35 so it's it's
super popular it's been the best seller
on Amazon for over 200 days pretty much
since it launched so it's you know and
you're competing with things like Kindle
that are only sold kind of in that in
that place so it's just doing really
really well for the top electronic so
what is Google cast right so we talked
about chromecast being this piece of
hardware right but that's more just a
piece of hardware that implements Google
cast so Google cast is the technology so
when you write software either for
Android or iOS or for the
web that are for chromecast it was it's
all google cast and then it can be
played on one of the devices which is
the chromecast we really recently
launched the Android TV the first model
of that and you can also cast to that
and you can envision in the future this
technology being built into televisions
or possibly automobiles or whatever it
is you know anything you know can be
built into this projector and I just
cast up to the projector to send that
content out so we have the sender which
is basically your iPhone or your Android
or your desktop Chrome browser those are
the the senders and then the receiver is
the code that actually runs in your
television right so that runs on the
dongle it's an html5 sort of you can
think of it like a single page web app
in a lot of cases and things like the
video is often done with like a video
tag or an audio tag on a you know done
full page full screen with with CSS
finally casting is is basically sending
content up to television so any
questions on that no it shouldn't be so
what is it these are the sender's like
we talked about before Chrome Android
and iOS and then the receiver is is the
chromecast device and that's html5 and
it's actually chrome running running
there so we get all the nice features so
Google cast is a little bit different
than things that is you know Apple TV or
Roku or things like that where it kind
of minds together this super immersive
experience that you get at the 17-inch
you know you're really good at using
your phone I would much prefer to use my
phone than a remote control right where
you've got this lean back 10-foot
experience where you know you're sitting
relaxed looking up at a screen and you
can do that comfortably you can do it
shared with others
and it kind of brings these two things
together and so the idea is as you're
using you know an app on your phone you
can imagine your your on the train
coming home you're watching a movie you
come into the room you want to share it
with the rest and your family or you
want to come finish the viewing on a
larger screen you just click the cast
icon and it goes up on the television so
it kind of brings these two worlds
together and then if you want to change
what's playing or change the volume
things like that you actually use the
app in your phone so think you're using
HBO GO and you're using the HBO Go app
to cast to the television you're
actually using the HBO Go app rather
than your remote control so how does it
work just like this you can imagine
you're on your Android phone you're
watching YouTube you're streaming it
directly from the cloud you look up and
you see your television you say wow I'd
really you know would much rather watch
it on this much larger screen you
remember oh yeah I've got a chromecast
maybe I can do that you look down at
your phone and you see the cast icon and
and and at that point you'll click the
cast icon where your phone connects to
the chromecast connects to your
television and from that point the
chromecast itself connects out to
YouTube
and it streams directly from YouTube so
you notice it's it's not you know it's
not coming through your phone or
anything like that so that it saves
battery things like that the YouTube
shows up on your television and then if
you'd like you can actually put your
phone in your pocket
background it you're completely saving
you know battery and you're just your
television is streaming your electric
from youtube if you have kids like I do
you can send it to the TV you can leave
and go do something and let the
television babysit your kids whatever it
is you'd like and then later when you
decide you want to change a video or
change the volume or whatever it is you
get your phone back up it automatically
connects to the television opens a
socket there and then you can make those
changes
that you'd like and you know you can
disappear so it's a really nice
experience in the way it works and it's
not limited to a single user multiple
users can connect to the same television
at the same time so why would you cast
enable your app you know Americans spend
an unbelievable amount of time in front
of the television it's a really huge you
know five plus hours every day and
that's a you know a combination of
television viewing and gameplay right
and a few weeks ago at Google i/o we
announced a lot of the work that's been
done around gameplay on chromecast so
soon you should see a lot of game apps
that are cast enabled very soon so what
can you cast this is a the list of kind
of what's out there as of a few I don't
know a few months ago so it's a real
small set of things you know HBO Go
Netflix Hulu I think there's a good you
know opportunity for folks for being one
of the first kind of apps out there so
you know now's the time to jump on it
but but this is the discoverability in
the Play Store so like I said before the
apps that you know that you're casting
or just the normal app you know it's the
normal YouTube app the normal Netflix
app the normal HBO app you don't need a
a separate app that's like HBO for
Netflix you know you don't need anything
like that
cool so here's some general tips for the
television and this is a sample I just
because of my travel isn't because the
last-minute notice is not able to flip
the slide to say hello open web cam but
that's okay you'll forgive me so so
here's an example of a simple receiver
so this is the code running in the in
the dongle and the chromecast and it has
this simple HTML this is hello html5
Devcon but then when I look at it on my
television so this is my old cube where
I used to sit that's what I see
so does anyone know why yeah so we had
at least two people who said overscan
right so the idea is basically there's
kind of margins around the side that do
to older televisions rapping and older
standards and things like that you
actually shouldn't use that area so you
so so that's kind of what's what's
happening here another thing I'll point
out is the chromecast defaults the
background to black even the life of the
background could be black it defaults to
black so you basically should set your
color to white otherwise you know if you
just try to throw some messages up there
you're not gonna be able to read them
cuz it's gonna be black text on a black
background so here's some information
about overscan and this is just off of
Wikipedia you can see the the kind of
margins for the four by three and the
sixteen by nine and that's kind of
exactly what your if I flip back to the
previous slide that's kind of exactly
what your you're seeing where this is my
television that I use at work for
development that we bought for me to use
and it's default out of the box setting
so that's what happens so make sure that
you've Center taxed or you know anything
that the user really has to see make
sure that it's it's out of those out of
these margins and then you know all the
producers of content they know that and
so when they film movies or TV show
episodes things like that they make sure
that the characters faces and things
like that or not on those outside where
they chop off parts of their face so
interaction this is kind of fun so you
know I've got a another little one
twenty one month old and and he
sometimes he tries to touch our
television so this is not him but but he
doesn't do it because I yell too much
now but but he he definitely we have
lots of fingerprints on the television
so the interaction model is is like I
said before when you're actually using
your phone for doing things and not the
television and what's different about it
you know some people sometimes have
trouble to understand this where when
you're making changes when you're
interacting you should be looking at
your phone not like a remote where I
look at the TV and I press things
actually look at your phone and you know
you get all the nice functionality the
the iOS and Android gives you for doing
that and then no dialogue things like
that that you know so you can't just
take your existing kind of webpage for
viewing videos and throw it up on the
television it doesn't doesn't work so
well for that so like I said before the
device is your remote so people know how
to use it quick and easy to set up
there's usually no learning curve
because they're already using those apps
right so here's another thing is burn-in
right so is anyone familiar with with
this kind of concept i mean definitely
with old computer screens but in modern
televisions does anyone know where this
is like a huge problem I think it's a
problem in airports yeah what yeah
plasma screens so plasma screens are
super bad about about burnin so where
you have to watch that is if someone
pauses on chromecast and you freeze that
that screen you need to after five
minutes you need to take it back to a
splash screen and then you're kind of
splash screens need to rotate through
stuff like that yeah so does anyone know
how long they should wait or not wait
for for plasma screens people to get
angry yeah
yeah they call it jitter right yeah so
some of them do yeah yeah but still not
everybody has them and you don't want
people's screens it actually looks a lot
worse on my screen than it does up here
through the projector but I guess this
is like a flight that was always late
here or something I don't know yeah but
yeah there's definitely new you know
newer LCD screens things like that don't
really have any problem and the plasma
is the new ones kind of it's constantly
shifting to try to prevent but yeah at
five minutes supposably
burnin begins so it's something you
totally have to be aware of even you
know splash screens that have you know
your logo making sure that's flipping
around and moving or resizing and all
kinds of things you have to do so now
let's jump into chromecast and kind of
where you'd get started if you wanted to
build something sort of a nice starting
point as a developer console that we
have you can go in there create your own
apps
register your dongles your chromecast
devices and do all the things that you
need to do there how does it work we
have a few different types of receivers
a custom and style the custom is
basically you write all the JavaScript
yourself you write the HTML the CSS and
you write everything yourself and you
have full control and I'll tell you that
basically every featured partner that we
have you know HBO Hulu Netflix all these
kind of people that's what they do right
that's what they do they want full
control they want to be able to do all
kinds of super interesting things or
things related to DRM and content
protection and things like that the
styled receiver is really nice for folks
who they they want an experience that
feels like it's you know built for them
but they don't really want to write code
to do it and so all you do is define
some CSS and you can customize things
and make things look really nice like
it's like it was built for you but it's
a it's a sort of a very
generalize player that will play content
and allows you to customize it with CSS
so this is the the styled receiver all
you would you can take a default styling
or you can you can pass in a custom
styling and this is kind of what it
would look like here you can see some of
the CSS classes you define a splash
class and that would be what shows on
the splash screen watermark progress bar
so that you could change the color of
the progress bar to match the theme of
your company so you just define a few
CSS classes and things just magically
look really nice
the next thing to talk about is is
dongles so what you want to do is
register your device so that basically
it gives you the ability to debug things
on your device
but not everyone in the world can debug
and it also lets you propagate your app
out there in the Play Store in the App
Store before you're ready to publish so
when you're ready to launch you think
you're good to go the devices of a
register here will be able to see your
app but no one in the world will so it
lets you deal with that you know
three-day propagation delay around the
world in the App Store and things like
that and then this is an overview of
just from my screenshot where I have a
bunch of apps some are published and
some are unpublished
and I can remove those and then I have a
bunch of devices that are ready to be
used that I use for testing so you put
all your QA team you know all your
developers things like that in that area
so let's start now talk about the
receiver oops so the receiver is is what
runs in the dongle it's what's running
in your television it's actually a
Chrome browser in there so it's it's
it's like a single tab chrome browser
that's running supports all the the nice
you know web technologies that were used
to html5 JavaScript CSS and then we've
got
support with eme right for doing
encryption things like that and we use
MSE the media source extension so
basically it's using all the optimized
things inside of Chrome for playing the
videos works out really really nice and
support for Web Audio and what's nice
about that because it is Chrome you can
use all the chrome developer tools with
you know with chromecast that you're
you're very familiar with you can do
breakpoints you get all the chrome dev
tools and I'll show some of that here in
a bit so the receiver we talked about
previously the styled in the custom
receiver there's another one called the
default receiver where you don't have to
do anything you don't even have to go
into the console you don't have to
register you don't have to do anything
you can just use this and and you get
that for free there's constants in the
in the libraries you can say my app ID
is this constant right and kind of
stepping back why do you need an app ID
basically when you when you will show in
the code here in a little bit where when
you decide you'd like to launch a cast
application you know when your your in
your your app think HBO go or Netflix or
Hulu or YouTube and you click the cast
icon you tell the television please
launch this Apple ID and that app ID
gets decoded into what URL is your
receiver app that runs in the television
so here's a super super basic custom
receiver it's almost like the least
amount of lines that you can do to run a
custom receiver so let's go through this
you understand a little bit you start by
defining the receiver JS file right so
this is the code that runs in the
television and then you'll create a
single video tag in the page right and
that's where it would show your actual
content and then when the window loads
or you know when the browser is ready
and up and running you go ahead and look
up that that video tag your media
element and then from there you'll
create a media manager and so this is
with
chromecast is the manager that deals
with all the media events and tell it
where your video tag is and then you'll
get an instance of the receiver manager
and call start and that's all you have
to do once you do this if people use the
media control channels they can play
videos they can pause them they can do
everything and this is all that it takes
but you can add additional callbacks you
know tell me when a sender has joined
tell me when the senders left you know
when the phone's connected or
disconnected you can tell me when videos
loading all those events are there as
well and you can get all that data but
this is the the least kind of how you
how you'd write that code another thing
I want to talk about is messaging right
so in the receiver there's two types of
messaging bus or there's two types of
messaging you have a messaging bus and
then you have channels so the messaging
bus is more broadcast it send to all the
connected devices so you can imagine
we're all sitting here and we're all
playing a game right imagine we're all
playing poker against each other right
for the face-up cards I would show them
on the television and it would broadcast
those out to everyone with a messaging
bus but you all would have your own
private hand sort of your facedown cards
and those I would send to you on a cache
channel so that it only goes to you it's
more of a point point point to point
communication rather than a broadcast
now let's talk about the sender so the
sender as we know is the code that's in
either Android iOS or in the web and
since this is a web conference I'm just
going to talk about the web stuff but
afterwards I'd be glad to to talk to you
about any of the others so my my focus
actually at Google for a long time was
in the iOS space which people find
interesting that like all I did was iOS
for about six months when I worked on
chromecast at the beginning so so that's
probably where I'm the strongest but
but in general that's like the platform
I know the least about but that's where
I know the most about chromecast so so
what is the send sender like I said it's
it's the browser and much of the work is
actually done in a Chrome extension so
we have a chromecast Chrome extension
and all the code about connecting and
things like that instead of including
you know a JS file that has all kinds of
code in it that you have to download
it's actually already there in the
Chrome extension so html5 we talked
about that
and all you need to do is just include
this one J's file so now let's go
through kind of how how you get started
and how you do that so you start when
the window loads and you first get the
you know the load event happening you
need to check if Google cast if that
object exists and if there is a cast
device available so what does this mean
so basically the Chrome extension itself
adds windowed chromecast sets that
object you know sets that object defines
it on your window object and so
basically you're checking do I have the
cast extension installed that's really
what that means then the next piece is
is is you'd want to know is is there a
chromecast on my network because if
there isn't a chromecast on your network
we don't show the cast icon because we
don't want people to you know what is
this they get frustrated I wanted to
cast I can't so the cast icon would only
show and so this is how you actually do
that check this or the first thing you
do to get things up and running what's
that oh yeah what he said is that should
be an and which is how I presented it
make sure that you have the object and
you have devices on your network and it
it clearly says or I'll fix that another
day or we're gonna leave it in there
it's like I'll give the guy next game
finds it a chromecast you get a Kleenex
yeah sorry
next time so the next thing you want to
do is create a session request and this
is basically where you know you're
initializing everything you send it your
app ID so you want to create in a
session for your app so you want to
create a session for HBO or you want to
create a session for Netflix or Hulu
whoever you are whatever your app is you
know and that's your custom app ID and
then you'll create an API config with
that session request and then you you
add listeners so it knows who do I tell
that I successfully joined who do I you
know who do I tell when people have
joined you know when senders have come
and gone and things like that and then
you'll call initialize and then that
initialize you pass at that
configuration and then additional
callbacks for when it was successful
when it failed this is a little bit
about you know being able to check with
for receivers knowing if you have
devices this is another way and it's
kind of a weird listener that actually
returns a string with the string
available and so that's that's how that
works
so that gives you that information as
well and then here this is actually how
you you launch receivers right so you'll
request a session right I would like to
start a chromecast session and then this
is just an inline function here for you
know having updates and errors right so
did people you know session starter in
and things like that but when you when
you call this what happens is the Chrome
extension gives you a list of receivers
right so this is I've requested hey I'd
like to start a session and then this is
my callback that I'd like like you to
call this update listener to let me know
if that was successful and what happens
is here when I requested that the
session it pops down from the the Chrome
extension up there pops down this list
of devices that you have your
or whatever it is all the devices on
your network and then you can select one
of those and once one of those is
selected then you know you're at the
point where you're able to start playing
movies and and things like that so the
next step will be defunct
to start defining metadata about the
movie that you'd like to play or the
media so here you can pass in the URL
and the mime type so we know is this an
image is a video whatever it is and
you'll create a load request so load is
like it's kind of like play the video
you know this is a video I'd like to
load and then usually there's an
autoplay true/false that you can say but
typically it's like load it and play it
this is typically what I don't know of
anyone who doesn't do autoplay who's in
the regular movie stuff and then here is
the finally on your session you'll load
it and you have callbacks for when it's
exceeded and when it failed so
disconnection is actually done you know
you don't have to deal with any of that
it's all done through the Chrome
extension so the Chrome extension itself
you pull pull down you can see this you
know here where they say stop casting
this is uh looks like I'm playing
something with no title there but that's
that's kind of the idea of how it works
so so much in the in the web cinders
handled through the extension it's kind
of out of your way but it does have some
drawbacks so if I go back here like I
can't style this and things like that at
this point in time because it all comes
through the extension all right so now
since the John's very accessibility
focus I thought I'd throw in some some
closed caption stuff make John happy
make all of us happy it's good stuff
so actually this week we launched a
whole bunch of closed captioning
enhancements but I like the I shouldn't
have had that extra burrito
it's kind of fun I don't know if we're
having those for lunch or not I
apologize if we are the fleece doesn't
happen to you so the the functionality
so we've had support for closed
captioning
since the beginning you know web tea tea
and stuff like that
that you can all support you can define
closed captions where they're out on the
screen you can style them you can do all
that but it required quite a bit of
heavy lifting on anyone who wanted to do
that now what we release this week is
full support so that it takes the the
native phones configuration you're
getting in your phone you can say I this
is the closed captioning that I like
when I watch videos on my phone and then
it just inherits those and whoever cast
the the video it inherits those in the
television and uses those there so and
that's without adding any anything
whatsoever so that would define color
schemes and font sizes and fonts and and
all that is all kind of just auto
magically brought out there for you cool
so now let's talk about samples so you
want to kind of jump in and start doing
things so all the samples are on github
github.com google cast a whole lot of
great stuff out there the the top one
there is cast videos which is designed
to be sort of a fully functional app
that'd be similar to something that you
would write and put out there in the App
Store the Play Store Chrome Web Store
whatever a very very complicated app and
then it's across all the platforms and
they all work well together so you can
start casting on Android and then pick
up your iPhone and change and pause and
they all work together really well and
then we've got two others that are more
hello world so it's like a hello world
video what's the least amount of code to
get a video playing on the television so
you can start to understand the life
cycle and so that's a really good place
to begin and then we have an even
possibly even simpler one or maybe not
maybe it's more difficult is a hello.txt
which is how to get text up on the on
the screen and what that's all about is
custom data channels so instead of you
know that all the video stuff goes over
common media control channels for
sending media but the the text stuff you
can define your own channels you can
send JSON packets back and forth or
string packets back and forth and that's
how you would do things like games you
know if you want to implement poker if
we all want to watch a movie and we all
raid it while we watch it at the end of
the movie it tells us who rated the
highest or something like that some app
like that would be kind of fun this is
what the cast videos reference app looks
like we've got a real extensive design
checklist and I'll talk about pretty
soon here that basically you know we
want every cast app to behave the same
so that when a user goes in they know
exactly what to expect it feels like a
cast app it feels you know very native
and comfortable and they don't have a
big learning curve for your app so
that's one of the things that this does
kind of does everything right in that
regards or the other hello world ones
all the code to do things right it's
gone it's just helping you kind of get
things understood implements lockscreen
notifications things like that so that
if you lock your phone you can still
pause it from a lock screen you have
notifications that you're casting to
kind of be able to pull you right back
into where you were before and then here
you can see a mini player it's a little
blurry on this but it basically tells
you what is playing so that you can
navigate back in from wherever you're at
so debugging we kind of briefly
mentioned this earlier so one of the
things if you do want to debug the code
in the television on the first thing
that you have to do is check a box here
this says send my serial number over
when I'm you know connecting because
what happens is when when you know
things communicate they do it in a very
anonymous way for your privacy but
because of that
we're not able to say oh this is a
developer device please you know give
them access to do developer things on
this account so you need to check the
box to not be anonymous so that it can
be not necessarily be tracked but so
that it can be identified as a developer
device you may need to reboot sometimes
you do sometimes you don't I think today
you don't actually have to but you used
to have to so I just tell people just
repeat it and like be that's it's a much
safer thing to do and then one thing to
call out which was in one of my earlier
slides but I didn't mention it is when
you are making changes in the console
not here but in the console it does have
like the the configurations that you
make on the server are cached for six
hours on the dongle so when you make
changes rather than wait six hours just
wait five minutes and reboot the dongle
and it will repol the configuration but
it does require like a five minute for
it to get through all the to propagate
around the world to all the servers
so debugging so to debug your receiver
you can do Chrome remote debugging with
ADB so has anyone done that before no
nobody's use ADB to remote debug Chrome
so let me tell you why you want to like
forget about chromecast if you write
websites and you want to test you have a
bug that only happens on your Android
phone you can use ADB which is Android
debugger I think Android developer so I
don't know whatever it's it you just
type ADB connect and then the IP address
of your phone and it connects and then
you can use your desktop chrome dev
tools to connect to the browser here and
set breakpoints here and you can fix you
know you get your console on your
desktop browser
debugging the website on your phone so
it's super super awesome even if you're
not doing chromecast you should totally
check it out yeah
it are you talking about ADB is so ADB
is you know if I USB connect my phone I
would do ADB connect and then the IP
address of the phone and that kind of
opens a socket between the two and then
you open up Chrome desktop and for
chromecast you go to port 9 - 2 - that's
a default you know the IP address 9 - 2
- and then Chrome just starts up a
session with where you're debugging your
actual your your actual chromecast or
your phone just set breakpoints and
everything yep on the phone so it's
super super powerful like tool for when
you have all these bugs that you know
scrolling performance is slow on Android
in Chrome
that's a great way to to do it some
things to point out here for debugging
stuff on your receiver set the max
inactivity - to a really big number so
anyone have any any ideas why would we
do this
anyone any iOS folks in there let's it's
very iOS specific but so basically we
have a heartbeat that happens between
the phone and the television and it's
sort of polling like are you still
connected are you still connected and if
it doesn't answer then we think it's
left the room and so basically iOS is
very single threaded in nature so if you
set a breakpoint in iOS it doesn't have
like the notion of like services like
they have any Android or you know any
sort of a background daemon and so what
happens is when you stop on a breakpoint
if you stop on a breakpoint for more
than 10 seconds it'll close your session
and like everything you were trying to
do gets gets killed so just normally
that's an optional parameter that you
shouldn't pass in but if you pass it in
with a big number it allows you to debug
much easier without losing
Russians and then because like I said
for the receiver debugging it is just a
Chrome browser so all the the wonder you
know you can put debugger statements for
manual debug as if people use debugger
statement the last point there you guys
are familiar with that it's like a
forced breakpoint in your code so when
chrome gets to it'll it'll pause right
on that console log all the stuff there
then another thing that the receiver
does cache sometimes so sometimes you
want to flip your images you can do
window dot reload and pass-through
window location reload true but I
personally it's actually faster just to
power cycle it so so this does like a
clean shutdown III power cycle and it's
faster so that's what I do
so I set up my environment where my my
USB is on my kin my chromecast is
connected to my monitor so I can get to
it really easily on the cinder same idea
right it's just Chrome so you get all
the chrome dev tools for doing that cool
so now let's talk about the design
checklist right so we have a really
extensive design checklist that tells
you exactly how you should build a
cast-out and one of the things that
Google that we don't do is we don't
typically review apps and then tell you
you can put this in the store you can't
put this in the store you know if you
think like the Android Play Store
everything can go out there but we we
publish a huge design guidelines of how
we'd like you to do things
so my recommendation to you either for
building a cast app or building an
Android app is to absolutely treat this
like it's required and like you
absolutely must do it and the reason I
tell you is is sort of a tip and trick a
lot of people say you know ask me my app
is so great so many downloads and it's
always been number one but it never gets
featured by Google and the and they
always ask me well how can I get
featured by Google and I say have you
read the design guideline and they say
no we don't like that well that's why
you don't get future mayor
we wanted app to be different well you
know Google's trying to build an
ecosystem where all the users feel
comfortable you know you can push things
a little bit but really you need to feel
like native apps they want everything to
be the same where Apple would reject you
and tell you come back again later after
you've made things be compliant we let
you launch with non-compliant things but
you'll never be featured so just a tip
for everybody is like you know treat the
stuff super super seriously because you
never know when your app would be
selected for some sort of featuring and
this not following this stuff would like
definitely it would definitely make you
not get featured and then I guess more
importantly it would make your users
feel like confused like why is this app
behaving not like all the featured apps
so this is some of the examples of what
you get where it tells you the behavior
of how the cast icon when there's not
devices on the network versus when there
are but you're not connected versus when
it's connecting it has a nice animation
effect and then when you're connected so
and then it goes through things like you
know here we've got a yellow state
that's because the theme is yellow but
if your app is you know I work with Red
Bull TV and I help them a bunch and the
Red Bull guys made there's red obviously
right here's some more stuff where you
can see various you know the details
where it has call-outs and tells you how
to do various things so useful links if
you want to go out there and kind of get
started the first one
developers.google.com slash cast that's
the website where you can kind of find
all the all the information you'll find
a little YouTube video from me on the
iOS cinder in there lots of good stuff
and then the samples are all on github
feel free to fork them feel free to do
pull request feel free to make feature
requests for the samples no not the SDK
out there
good samples out there there's samples
of how to do closed captioning samples
of how to do DRM all kinds of good stuff
out there the next one is the developer
portal that's where you register your
app and you can publish an unpublish
design checklist that's what I talked
about you know go out there figure out
how to write your cast app and that's
actually a really good place to start so
if you're just getting started and you
want to kind of start writing code or
you want to start designing your app if
you read through that design checklist
you kind of understand how cast works
really well and what are all the edge
cases that you're gonna have to handle
and the final thing that we have is a
Google cast developer community so this
is a you know a G+ community where you
can share with other developers you know
sort of what you're doing you know it's
it's a really great place to go to learn
people asking questions or getting
answered things like that it's a really
nice community so so how to begin go out
there get the sample apps get them up
and running read the documentation
centers or receivers run the sample apps
and then you can modify the sample apps
to put your streams in there so take
your content that you have and see if
it'll play in our sample apps and if it
plays in our sample apps then read the
design checklist and and get up and
running and with that many thanks to
everybody for coming out on a Saturday
morning
