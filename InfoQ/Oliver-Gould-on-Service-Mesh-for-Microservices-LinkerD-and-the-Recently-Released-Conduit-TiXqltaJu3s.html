talked about two concepts that I want to
kind of come back and focus on just a
bit you talked about the control plane
and the data plane what does that mean
yeah great question so we talked about
the data plane being the communication
between your services right so you have
service a call service B that traffic
goes through the data plane by the data
plane we're really talking about proxy
if you didn't have a proxy if you're
using history or search for NATO the
data plane is the libraries that are
managing that communication the control
plane is the set of services or api's
where we put all of the policy and
configuration for that and so what we
think of in the control plane are things
like service discovery what IPS and
ports are part of the service or well
you might think of things like routing
rules so when I see a request to this
host it's actually this other service
instead things like timeouts policies
and success rate information at all of
the policy information should be stored
somewhere essentially in conduit that's
actually built into the kubernetes api
and so we'll be storing those things in
kubernetes itself and linker D we have a
control plane as well which is named or
D which is a route managing process
where end of service discovery and so
you can use that to change the routing
rules but it's it's not as full featured
or a is API first as I think we wanted
to be it was a much more incremental
approach and so I think will be much
more API focused on conduct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
