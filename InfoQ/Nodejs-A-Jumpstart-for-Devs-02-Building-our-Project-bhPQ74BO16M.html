in ten minutes
in fact nodejs isn't good at everything
out there anyway but what we want to do
is we want to focus on what noches is
good at so we are going to build a web
application first things first we need
to get ourselves some tools to work with
so we'll use the node package manager to
do that the NPM repository is a
collection of third-party software that
is available for everyone to use we're
gonna make ourselves an application
folder called app sprint and we want to
work with is well there's many
frameworks out there I'm gonna pick one
something to get started with and I'm
going to npm install Express at a
particular version just because I know
this version works there are better ways
of managing our application which we'll
see later but this will get us up and
going because we will be able to create
ourselves a web framework without having
to actually build everything from
scratch I would like you to notice that
we have a node modules folder one thing
I think NPM got really really right was
it as opposed to having a centralized
location where all of our packages get
installed - by default packages are
installed into the local directory which
means that we have all the rights to use
them and they don't collide with other
people's packages let's make use of
Express to create a project scaffolding
not that I can spell there we go yes I
want to continue in my non-empty
directory now this is where we can see
how node Jas and NPM work excellently I
have a package that Jason folder which
we'll take a look at later this allows
me to manage the dependencies of my
program wherever I'm at I can do a
simple NPM install everything I need
gets downloaded and get a cup of coffee
we can hang out I can pretend my code is
compiling there we go we're done and now
we have enough to do a basic hello world
program and make sure everything is
working most programs in node actually
are begun by running the node
interpreter on a particular file we do
that with our application
we run node on a pas expressed by
default runs on port 3000 and let's just
test this out here hello world expressed
welcome to Express we have achieved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
