joining this webcast so my name is Marco
Gorgon Toby I'll be talking about open
Android and what that means to you and
how Android is open or isn't open so
we'll discuss those issues just couple
of also couple householding items the
slides for this talk are available at
this URL so you can download it in PDF
format and will also make the screencast
available as well but I think or I'll is
also doing the same thing so either way
you're going to get everything recorded
which means you do not need to worry too
much about taking notes or anything like
that now in terms of going forward feel
free to ask questions at any point we
have an hour which is plenty of time and
I will try to figure out how the the the
chat /qa thing works so I'll look for
questions as we keep on going but I
really encourage you to make it
interactive I'm going forward so just a
little bit about myself so my name is
Marco like I said I started my career
back in the day on in Java before Java
was Java it was a project at sunny in
those days and I did that for the past
10 15 years until I came Android and
came around when I saw Android I got
really interested in that and started
playing with the very early releases of
the SDK out of that they developed
Android boot camp training program for
Maracana and out of that I ended up
doing a lot of training for engineers
some of the biggest mobile companies in
the world such as Qualcomm Cisco
Motorola the Department of Defense etc
all over the world so last year I was on
four continents 11 countries 36 cities
about 170 days of Android training for
engineers around the world
so out of that I sort of saw things that
work and don't work in terms of training
and having people pick up Android so I
wrote that in a book called learning
Android that was recently published by
O'Reilly
I also frequently speak at conferences
such as Oscar and ACM I Triple E sprint
developer conference Scandinavian
developer conference and DEF CON etc
together with my brother I started San
Francisco Android users group which is a
meet-up in San Francisco and I am also a
co-chair together with Brady from
O'Reilly of an upcoming conference
called Android open that's happening in
October in San Francisco two over nine
three eleven so that's a little bit
about me so this is a little bit about
what we're going to talk about today so
we're going to talk about a a little bit
about 400 came about what its history is
and the goal of the history is mostly to
kind of give you an idea where he told
that started and where it may be going
because that's sort of a part of our
crystal ball trying to predict the
future we're going to talk a little bit
about Android stack the reason for this
is that we need to understand what
Android really is when we say Android
operating system what do we really mean
by that what are the moving parts or -
the components that that comprise the
operating system then we're going to
talk a little bit about the meaning of
opening open is one of those things that
means different things to different
people
so I'm gonna kind of double click on
that and see what other opinions are
there I'm gonna talk about open source
software open standards I'm going to
talk a little bit about community
leadership and finally I'm gonna look at
what open Android means to you from
different points of view so depending on
what kind of hat you're wearing at the
time we're gonna look at what that would
mean to to you possibly so with that
let's start a little bit with the
history of Android where I told that
started and how we got to where we're at
today so back in 2005 there was a
company called Android thing that was
started by
and did organ at the time it was a
little startup in Palo Alto and we
didn't really know much about it other
than it was making the the software for
mobile devices in 2000 so in 2005
basically Google announced that it was
purchasing that company and along with
it most of the management team and at
that time we didn't really also know
what Google's goals with that were
Google wasn't really buying as many
companies at the time and it was
everything just sort of happen really
quickly and everything sort of just went
silent from there on until 2007 in 2007
Google basically announced the creation
of Open Handset Alliance which is the
governing body that technically owns
Android and at that time the the Open
Handset Alliance announced that one of
its first product is going to be this
thing called Android and with that they
announced the first software development
kit so that's roughly when we got the
SDK 0.9 1.0 since then Android basically
got to a point where it's the dominant
predominant platform for mobile devices
so pretty much all the devices out there
you know are now running Android and
this year we're seeing a lot of
development outside of the mobile phone
device frame set per se so we're seeing
Android in a lot of gaming consoles in
tablets in TVs in cars in wearable items
and so on so what it's seeing Android
proliferate beyond the phone so that's
sort of where it all got started
one thing that I wanted to point out is
the early vision for Android back in the
day when into an end Google acquired a
company there was a speculation on the
street that Google was gonna come up
with a G phone that's what people sort
of thought was gonna happen
Google is entering the mobile market and
they're gonna create their own device
arish me at the time came out and he
basically said look our goal is not a
single device our vision is much bigger
than that
our vision is basically to have a mobile
platform that's gonna run on
many many different devices so this
vision is actually very important
because it ends up trickling down into a
lot of both business and technical
decisions that were made subsequently so
I think it's historically this is one of
the very important sort of North Stars
for for Android platform in general so
with that I'm gonna talk a little bit
about what Android is what comprises
Android and what's you know what are the
parts of the Android operating system
so Android stack sort of looks like this
and again this is a very simplified view
of the stack you know the the you know
keeping it very simple with the lines
and circles there's a lot more details
that go into into the picture but
essentially at the bottom we have Linux
kernel then we have some native
libraries this is mostly C C++ code that
makes the transition top of that Linux
platform and then we have the specific
Android framework that allows us to
build apps using the platform and
leveraging the the features and
capabilities of the platform and finally
we have applications that run on top of
all that so it's important to understand
this tag because when we talk about
openness various parts of the stack you
have different properties so that's
that's why this is important I'm going
to sort of explain the various parts of
the stack going from the bottom up so as
most of you know Android is built on top
of Linux so at the bottom of it all we
have a Linux kernel and it was initially
a standard Linux kernel but subsequently
it's been changed you know talked a
little bit about that later on but there
were a couple of you know good reasons
for picking
Linux as the foundation for the entire
platform for one Linux is fairly secure
so we know a lot about Linux you know
Linux operating system it's a system
that's been in harsh places over the
over the years and it's been fairly
secured over time also Linux is very
portable we know a lot about the driver
model
in Linux so it's fairly easy to port
Linux to different devices and remember
that was one of the goals of the Android
project it build a platform to transcend
many many different platform devices and
finally Linux is open source so there's
the good things for Linux choice Linux
provides things like carbon abstraction
memory management process management
networking and some very low-level
features of the platform are embedded in
there on top of that we have native
libraries native libraries to a certain
extent are things that were needed to
basically provide a fully featured
comprehensive offering 60 system right
so in an operating system you need a way
to play movies so you need video codecs
you need a way to play audio video you
need a way to render HTML so we need we
use the WebKit library for that you need
a database so we got a sequel white
database for that purpose and so on on
top of that there are also certain
things that were developed specifically
for Android such as Bionic which is
essentially a optimized and licensed
friendly version of Lipsy library that
enables developers to build on top of
that without license issues and as well
as the the hardware abstraction layer
which is a very important feature of
Android which allows developers to
basically easily build or port Android
to their particular chipsets and devices
etc so this hardware abstraction layer
is a very important component of the the
whole library set so a lot of pieces of
that going to the library part of the
stack are often copy/paste
from other open source projects so not
everything was invented for Android a
lot of it was leveraged from other open
source projects which is a good thing
and makes it makes it possible to use
the Best of Breed when it comes to
certain libraries as well one of the
components that we had also that part of
the stack is dalvik dalek is basically a
a
in implementation of a virtual machine
that's purpose-built for Android so in
the early days when the team was
deciding on the language and so on they
chose Java because Java is a you know
fairly full-featured language but also
because John Locke has a lot of
developer community out there so a lot
of people know Java and so that makes it
really easy to adopt Java as a language
for developing for Android
now while Java language is for the most
part quote unquote free insert the
libraries and tools the java virtual
machine was not free at the time it was
owned by son now it's owned by Oracle
and basically any vendor that would want
to use Java Virtual Machine would have
to do a licensing deal with those
companies well if you remember Irish
maids goal of having a mobile platform
to transfer many many devices this
licensing model would not work very well
in that case so basically right from the
get-go the team decided to build a
purpose-built utilize the friendly
virtual machine and that's what all the
kids that's from the business standpoint
from technical standpoint dalvik has
been substantially optimized for the use
inside of Android in our mobile device
so basically the team kind of looked at
what are the constraints that we're
going to have going forward for a long
time that are unlike on unlikely gonna
change anytime soon so battery for
example is one of those constraints and
so is the size of the actual you know
chipsets that we can put into a mobile
device so as such they decided to
optimize dalvik substantially for for
mobile devices that that are
battery-powered and that basically means
going with registry-based chipset versus
tag-based and cheaper architecture such
as arm over Intel and so on so dalvik
seems substantially optimized from
technical standpoint to work very very
well on mobile and as such is very
fairly it's very open unlicensed
friendly to to the community on top of
all that we now have application
framework this is the Android
application framework so
the application framework is basically a
brand new piece of code and it's the
code that allows developers to develop
applications that run on top of the
android platform
so unlike libraries and Linux pieces
that were often copy pasted from other
projects and put together to make a
whole application framework was designed
from scratch and was purpose-built for
Android and it is it is it that makes
that exposes the power of the underlying
platform up to the application stack and
finally what we have is are the
applications so we have a gazillion of
applications out there running on
Android but also interestingly we also
have many many markets so this is
another player I think that we need to
consider when we talk about being open
and which is unique to Android ecosystem
is that we have many many different
markets up until recently Google's own
Android Market was probably the only one
that was kind of dominant and although
we couldn't get many others we didn't
really know about them because just of
the economics of the marketplaces but
today we have Amazon apps is another
marketplace and some other marketplaces
are also emerging so that's a good thing
it means that there's a sort of more of
a competition with when it comes to
ability to distribute your application
so there are many different channels for
distribution giving it giving it more of
an open access to the Android Market
ecosystem so with respect to jar up I
can't want to touch touch on that as
well Android like we said before is
built using Java so we write Java
applications in it in Java and that gets
compiled into an Android app at the end
of the day in Android is for that
purposes Android is using an Apache
harmony version of Java so it's not
really a son or not Oracle JDK so it's
it's it's an Apache open-source version
off of Java and like we said before that
Java really gets compiled into dalvik
executable and on some dalvik virtual
machine so it doesn't run on
Java Virtual Machine from Oracle as we
know it so in terms of getting you know
being open it's as open as it gets and I
kind of wanted to point out that this
whole choice of Java but also choosing
Java the transform a different virtual
machine that slightly modified actually
did quite a few improvements to the Java
platform in itself because it made it
more suitable for mobile environment we
didn't have that before with j2me or
Java ME environment so that's been sort
of a big benefit to the Java community
in a way so with that I want to kind of
talk a little bit about open open is
being open is one of those things that
everyone agrees that we should be open
everyone agrees that open is good but
many people have different idea of what
open really means to them so I kind of
wanted to explore from a couple points
of view what those ideas or opinions
about open are so this is the open
source initiative view of open basically
this is sort of a you know a governing
body over open source and and this is
their declaration of what it means to be
open beyond just getting the actual
source code so for one it means that we
can we can have a free distribution of
the code so if I can basically take that
code I can not only see it and I can
also modify it and distribute the source
code itself is viewable in a you know
human readable fashion what that means
is that it's not going to be
intentionally obfuscated or scrambled or
in any way made hard for us to to see it
we can create the derivative work so
basically we can take all an open source
code we can build on top of it and we
can create a new piece of code and we
can distribute that as well integrity of
authors source code is protected so
basically what that means is that if I
cannot distribute the code with the same
license terms at least I can provide
patches to the original so
in that way maintain the integrity of
the code no discrimination against any
specific person or group that's kind of
obvious no discrimination yet against
any specific field of endeavor so
favoring mobile over desktop for
instance distribution of license so
ability to specify the license for the
derived work license not being specific
to a product per se no license
restrictions license must not restrict
other software and basically unless must
be technology and technologically
neutral so those are those are some of
the key points that Open Source
Initiative basically lays out as they
see what open source software means
beyond does getting the source code now
I wanted to kind of bring in and the
rubens definition of open this was a
this was a tweet that I believe it this
was a very first tweet from Andy and it
was basically in response to Steve Jobs
comment that Android is not open and
basically Andy responded by giving us
this command line and philosophy that
they're not familiar with this but that
this command line would basically make
create a directory change to the
directory initialize repo repository
which is where the source code is so
that's that this is the location for
actual Android platform source for the
entire source code this will download
the source code and this would make it
so by the end of this command which
would take many many hours on what we
would essentially have a downloaded the
entire source code for Android we would
have compiled it and we would have a
version of Android platform that we can
now run on an emulator so that's
essentially what that is so in that
sense you know we meet a lot of
requirements of the open source
initiative with respect to the source of
being available being a visa to download
it install it and build it into working
product so this is an this definition of
open in addition to that I wanted to
kind of bring in Jonathan Rosenberg
post in in 2009 in December 2009 on
meaning of opening this is not so much
related to Android as it is related to
Google at large so just basically sum up
the post that Jonathan did basically he
sees open as couple components so open
technology for one which means being
built on open standards so you know
using open standards wherever it's
possible if open standards are not
possible are not available then
basically working with the governing
bodies to create those standards so
being involved with the standard
committees in publishing those standards
so that's what it means by being open
standards now open source wherever
possible making the code available in
terms of the actual source code Jonathan
also touches on open information and
that has a lot to do with Google's other
products such as search and Gmail and so
forth but basically what he's saying is
that it's got to be valuable to user so
users gotta understand that they're
trading say privacy or something else in
exchange for a product that is very
valuable for them and they basically
have a choice
to to make that trade or not and that's
that's basically it very relevant for
things like Gmail for instance being
transparent about the information that's
collected so you know that's what
basically is one of the components of
open information knowing what
information the organization has on you
as a user in control over that
information so Google accomplishes a lot
of these things with the dashboard
Google dashboard which may not be as
relevant to Android but they kind of
wanted to give it put in a context of
the bigger view of what open really
means and ultimately a lot of us agree I
believe that open systems when but but
again it's something that's worth
double-clicking on going forward so
finally I came up with my view of what
open means for purposes of Android
basically what I'm looking at are a
couple of things that that we have the
source code that it's an open source
project right so that's what I mean that
that's one of the key components key
pillars of being open in my view of
things that it's based on open standards
wherever available and if not making the
standards available as the new opens for
open standards and also the community
leadership
so basically making sure that the kind
of community that is involved in
cleaning this project so this is again
just my view of things it's somewhat
subjective but it is what this so with
that I'm gonna look I'm going to kind of
double-click on the open source what
that really means and to understand open
source we got to understand open source
licenses open source licenses come in
many many different flavors there's if
you're interested in actual licenses
included the link here that outlines all
the details of the major and some minor
and some proprietary open source
licenses but at the bottom of the key
air we basically cap some of the key
licenses that most of you have heard of
such as Apache License MIT license BSD
license and then we have various GPL and
LGPL licenses available here it's
essentially the decision tree and this
is again oversimplified view of the
licenses on it essentially looks like
this so the question the first question
that we have is does the derivative work
fall under the same license in other
words if we take a piece of open source
code and we start building some
something on top of that open source
code do we have to license that open
source code under the same terms do we
have to license our derivative work
under the same terms as the original
work or not so if it's the case that yes
we must license under the same terms
right then another question becomes
dueling link to the code under another
license and distributed can we do that
can we basically link to this code and
distribute it under a different license
so if it's a yes then
that will basically have either LGPL to
or LGPL three so basically the lesser
general public license lists so the only
difference between two and three is can
a company bring claims against its users
that are using this code and in version
two you couldn't in version 3 you can
it's very similar with GPL where a
version 3 you cannot bring the claim in
version 3 you can but basically in with
the GPL code we cannot link to so it's a
no to linking in distributing GPL based
code now for Android one thing that we
are trying to do is remember the mission
many different device a platform for
many and different devices excuse me
so to accomplish that we got a cab
something that is friendly for vendors
to innovate on top of so in other words
the license must be such that if I am in
om I can basically build custom code on
top of that and I can if I choose I can
keep that code secret sauce so that's
why a lot of code that we want in
Android we're basically saying no we do
not necessarily want to Capitol licensed
under the same terms we can but we don't
want to be forced to so that basically
opens up couple rising stresses Apache
MIT and BSD right and with respect to
that the differences are more or less
subtle so basically apache code means
that every single piece of code will
need to specify the top of the code that
it's you know the information about its
patents copyrights is such so it needs
to be fairly clean piece of code that we
can use it's probably one of the most
generous sort of open source licenses
out there so they're patch eliza's now
if it doesn't have to do that the
question really becomes can we use the
the brand for promotion or not and MIT
allows that and B as the doesn't so
those changes are more or less subtle in
the green scheme of things and basically
for Android we're trying to come
use this set of licenses wherever
possible for the code in order to
accomplish the mission of getting many
people be able to sit
are you guys having problems with the
screen again do we need to let me sounds
like some of you everything's good okay
good okay so then he must have been an
old chat got it sir so with that let me
then move on to the next slide and
basically now that you understand the
stack we can now take a look at where do
specific licenses licenses fit in the
big scheme of things of Android so at
the at the top of it all we have some we
can apps right so of course users can
developers can build their own custom
apps in those apps are extremely
proprietary to those developers and they
you know they do not want to distribute
them but the absolute that should come
with Android Open Source Project are
open meaning the source code is
available they're licensed under apache
license and we can we can we can study
them we can learn from them we can
repurpose them build on top of them etc
so it's fairly open for the apps that
come with Android Open Source project
which is not a lot
it's a handful of apps so the standard
homescreen contacts phone browser
settings etc so these those default
applications are available but certain
applications such as Google Maps or you
know Android Market are not those are
proprietary apps belong to Google so
they're not a part of the Android Open
Source project and as such they don't
it's not really something we're
considering here in terms of the
application framework this is fairly
open its as open as it gets it's a
pretty much everything license that the
Apache 2 license and we have the source
code and it's very well documented etc
so that code is open and there's really
not a lot of concerns about that piece
of code at all when we come to the
library section of the stack keep in
mind that a lot of these bits and pieces
here have been copy pasted from other
open-source projects
as such they can carry various licenses
most of them tend to be Apache bsd or
MIT licenses so in other words one of
those friendly licenses where you can
build a derivative work on top of it and
not not worry about that too much so but
but there are various licenses because
of the nature that it came from many
many different places when it comes to
dalvik dalvik is is open the source code
is is available it's unlicensed and
apache 2 and more so dalvik is fairly
portable in other words it's a it's
something it's a piece of code that we
OMS should easily be able to recompile
for their particular chipsets just just
so you know so that's fairly good in
terms of that one thing that I would
mention when it comes to libraries is
Bionic Bionic is basically more or less
a replacement for Lib C library so let's
see library is based as the standard c
library and it's based on LGPL license
license which would mean that any code
that is linking to it would have to
qualify under LGPL terms right so that
would not work very well with vendors
who want to build on top of Android but
keep their secret sauce secret so as
such the Android team basically rewrote
most of that into the Bionic libraries
that's so and that's now licensed under
BSD license ability so finally we have
the lower part of the stack where Linux
is and a lot of drivers are and this
part of the stack is is mostly either
proprietary when it comes to drivers or
it's licensed under GPL code and when it
comes to kernel itself the linux kernel
itself right so basically this is where
it gets a little tricky to to
essentially take Android and just pour
it a lot of people say hey you know
offender it is so open and I have the
source code available how come I can't
just download build it and you know put
a new version of my
evil or on my zoom or whatever device
you may have and the issue is really the
drivers the drivers that happen to be
proprietary so HTC Motorola Samsung they
they have their own chipsets they have
their own drivers for the strip sets and
they tend not to want to open those
things to do the rest of the world so
what happens is in theory we can easily
build Android and run it on a device but
as long as that device is something like
an emulator or a device that for which
drivers are very very well-known in so
that's in theory in practice a lot of
consumer devices we do not have these
drivers so we cannot just simply port
onto the device and that that you know
something that's been kind of slowing
down the you know that's call discipline
of developing custom custom roms and
installing it on proprietary devices so
that's basically what's going on with
respect to that with respect to a
hardware abstraction layer that's
basically the piece that comes here that
tries to make it as abstract as possible
for the actual cover implementation so
that the rest of the system doesn't
suffer from this proprietary Thanks so
essentially this is a sort of a happy
medium of keeping the system open yet
giving some power to the actual OMS to
control their devices and make sure that
you know they they they have some
proprietary things in there as well but
that's basically openness of the stack
now honeycomb is an interesting black
sheep in the family of Android releases
and with respect to that basically
honeycomb doesn't we don't have the
source code for honeycomb
as a matter of fact we never well
apparently so initially what we were
told was that you know by the team was
that they were just super busy working
on the honeycomb code and it was a
substantial difference in the actual
version of Android so they were just you
can see their heads down working on this
and they had not no time to polish the
code and make it available that was in
the initial thought the initial
from Google subsequently they have
actually said that look the code is
probably never going to be available to
general public now from everything that
you know I gathered in research it seems
like that this is more an exception than
a rule so going forward in Ice Cream
Sandwich things should get back to
normal so we should have the source code
available and for general public and
able to download it and build it and so
on so it seems like that this is more of
an exception then at all going forward
but as SATA but currently honeycomb code
is not available at all when it comes to
Linux you know things are also
interesting and it's also a it's it's
something that creates a certain
contention in the community with between
the Linux community and the Android
community so like we said Android is
built on top of Linux but Android steam
you know basically forked Linux and
Linux and made a different version of
the kernel they have extended it for
purposes of the mobile and some of those
extensions include power management way
clocks things of that nature now
subsequently the since a Linux is GPL
code that would require the the changes
to the code to be published back to the
community apparently Google initially
wasn't very good at doing that and the
reason for that it was that they were
essentially too busy or so you know so
we here and essentially a lot of the
changes weren't initially pushed to the
community Google did address that by
hiring a couple of people to focus
exclusively on working on pushing the
changes back to the kernel but by that
time I believe that the Linux community
sort of didn't like the behavior and
they even started rejecting some of
those changes and in a lot of the
changes have to do with the power
management so currently a lot of those
changes are still in a separate fork and
are not accepted by the the links
community so that's that's sort of
what's going on in terms of that with
respect to Linux and
right so that's the meaning of you know
open-source software the next thing that
I want to talk a little bit about are
open standards open standards are
obviously very important especially when
you're building an ecosystem if you have
the you know different standards then
the power of that ecosystem is
dramatically diminished a good example
of initial open standards was the
railway network we initially had many
different widths for the railways and
that would basically not allow for a
train to travel from one part of the
country to another this this initial
standards war was resolved by an actual
War of the North himself and basically
the South had to convert miles miles and
miles of its railways to obey a meet the
standard which is I believe eight feet
and even four feet and eight and a half
inches in width but it just shows the
power of of a standard so I wanted to
kind of explore what happens with
Android with respect to standards and in
terms of that I'm going to look to the
prison of you know basically using open
standards wherever possible when the
standards are not available but
proprietary solution exists essentially
leaving a slot for so that the
proprietary solution could be plugged in
and used as an alternative and finally
creating standards wherever they're
needed so we're in a new round a lot of
standards do not exist so they need to
be created and they need to be exposed
as standard so that that in this this
kind of view of things on sort of
matches Jonathan Rosenberg view of the
meaning of open as well so it's it's a
close approximation of what it means to
be based on open standards so I'm going
to kind of give you a couple examples of
standards in android and got two one is
media support so as we know there are
many many different products and media
formats out there both for audio video
images and so forth and essentially
Android wherever possible
provided support for those media
products so everything essentially
everything that was available in the
open source community that is licensed
under the terms that make sense for the
vision of Android were basically tossed
into the mix and made available as part
of the platform however their bits and
pieces that are not available in open
source community there tend to be
proprietary right so Microsoft may have
a proprietary media framework Apple may
have its own media frame etc so in that
case what Android team basically did is
they left a slot open for those dos
formats to be made available in other
words they did not want to pollute the
stack with join in some proprietary code
but rather they left a slot open for
other integrators to basically build
those plugin those those codecs and
support for those in that media in this
case we are using something called
Chronos openmax al to provide the
extensibility of the platform when it
comes to media but I kind of want it to
just kind of give you this as more of a
flavor of how things work inside of
Android and opening things that are
potentially proprietary another example
that is often being you know ask the bar
by the enterprise customers is the
support for a VPN so according to Google
veep android supports VPN for a while
now but according to enterprises the VPN
that Android supports are nothing that
the enterprise customers actually use or
care about so enterprise customers they
want to use Cisco VPN Juniper VPN etc
now it's not possible really to put in
support for Cisco proprietary VPN into
an otherwise open-source project so for
that reason Android team has essentially
left the slot open in this case in a
form of a open source framework called
racoon that enables it to to add a
support for that so what that means is
that the vanilla Android open source
project does not have support for any
enterprise great VPN however if a
specific
om such as Samsung or Motorola want to
do a side deal with Cisco they can and
they can easily plug in and extend their
version bandwidth to support that VPN
solution so these are just sort of two
examples of you know open standards and
opening slots and keeping things
available where they're not necessarily
available in the open-source community
finally the third thing that they have
here is look at the community leadership
what that really means in how Android is
doing in terms of that I think it's an
important component of any open project
open open system on so Google did
initially in 2007 create an alliance
called Open Handset Alliance they
basically said look this thing Android
is going to be much bigger than us if
you're going to accomplish our vision
and as such we're going to basically
create an alliance that owns this
project so in theory there's an alliance
of initially 30 some now 80 plus members
comprised of all sorts of om chip
manufacturers when there's superior
software companies and such they care
about mobile and technically Open
Handset Alliance owns Android project
right so the Alliance is the goal of the
Alliance is to improve mobile experience
for everyone and they are jointly
working on Android
now that's theory in practice Google
seems to be the one who has a lot of
muscle behind this Alliance and a lot of
things in terms of how the Alliance
operate are simply unknown to us we do
not know about a lot of licensing terms
we do not know a lot of about a lot of
basically deals that go that come with
the membership in the Alliance as a
public so that's the Open Handset
Alliance one of the things on
considering the community leadership is
the roadmap in a standard when you think
about open source project you basically
think about a group of people who came
together with the same with a common
need or building a better something that
could be an operating system it could be
a web server whatnot and they basically
share their needs and
distribute the work among themselves and
things get done
Android is not like that Android
basically has a very private roadmap
it's actually Google has its agenda
where it's going with Android and we do
not know a lot about what's gonna come
in the next list until the big tunnel in
our moment and the actual release of the
SDK so we're not privy to the roadmap we
were not privy to the source code in
terms of the nightly builds or anything
like that
until the actual moment when the product
is released so this is one point where
Android is quite different than other
openings and open source projects in a
classic way of open source projects in
Google does solicit community input and
the jaw does nodes down somewhere but in
terms of promises or our priorities none
of that is really known to us at at this
point so basically they do get our input
but they still keep their own Maps some
of the private and come soon where it's
going one thing that kind of came up
recently is the deposit of bear-hugging
essentially picking a favorite om for
each release so in the early days
Google worked very closely with HTC on
g1 that one phone
the very first Android phone the Nexus
One and so on later on Google switched
to neck Samsung for Nexus as release and
most recently to Motorola for for its
zoom platform
tablet device so it seems that the
different OEMs get different terms
according to the there was a lawsuit
recently that involves Sky cook and so
certain proceeds of that lawsuit
essentially leaked out according
according to that in the terms of the
deals with Samsung are different in
terms of the deals with Motorola and and
it doesn't leave it's unclear why but
that information seems to be private
it's an interesting view it's an
interesting how Google sees themselves
with respect to Android I initially
thought of Android more like Microsoft
Windows where it's an operating system
turns to many many different platforms
regardless over the platform is but
and the Reuben recently said in an
interview that he sees Android and
Google more like Apple essentially
working very closely with a specific om
making sure that they get it right for
that specific device and and that's
basically their entire focus for each
release is one single device and that's
essentially they work so closely with
that device manufacturer so that's
basically what's going on in terms of
how the releases get shipped out on
particular particular devices there's
also something called compatibility test
suite which is essentially one of the
leverage points that Google uses to
essentially you know quote-unquote force
manufacturers into the creating a
certain type of Android device this for
users is a good thing because from user
standpoint coming to many different
versions of Android would just create
confusion and by cutting it somewhat
unified via CTS it's a good thing for
you for users it is a leverage over OMS
basically forcing them into certain
behavior that may they may or may not
care about and there was a there was a
recently a leaked email as well from Dan
Merrill saying how basically it's a club
to to force or um certain behavior that
the way I seek the CTS is also as a sort
of like a crystal ball to to kind of
give us an idea what may be on that
roadmap that we don't know much about by
reading through CTS and understanding
the difference between that some
features should be there must be there
or is optional you can sort of
extrapolate what the goals of the next
release of Android are so that's kind of
my view of things it's it's a crystal
ball into the future of things to come
so Google's motivation for this
initially was to basically create a
level playing field for the mobile so
Google was very successful in in the
internet because Internet is such as
open session
platform but when it came to model you
basically have carriers in OEMs
controlling the platform and it's very
much an oligopoly out there so it makes
it hard to compete fairly and Google
wanted to create a platform that makes
it easier for them to compete fairly in
the mobile space which is the fastest
growing space at the moment and again
money comes from mobile ads but in other
services provide the leverage in terms
of accomplishing the level playing field
there was an interesting talk by Bill
Gurley of benchmark capital and he
quoted basically warren buffett how he
sees google essentially warren buffett
says you know in business I look for
castles that were surrounded with
unbeatable modes to protect that
specific business so in Google's case
the castle is Adwords that's where the
money comes from and essentially one way
to look at what Google strategy is that
everything else is essentially is a big
moat to protect that castle so Android
is something that controls the access
between the user and the search and it's
such a place critical role in in
protecting the AdWords business model
this is it this is an interesting view
because it also tells us that Android is
not something that ever has to make
money for Google so as such it's a very
strong play against all the other
platforms which took after money make
money from licensing fees and or selling
gizmos Google doesn't it says
essentially it's it's a less than free
product for them that that is just there
to protect something totally different
so what does all this mean to you what
does being open mean to you at the end
of the day and I'm going to look at this
for a couple of different presence and a
couple of different points of view so as
a user being open is is great I can
customize my device I can make the
device all about me right that was a
whole t-mobile advertising it's all
about you kind of thing I can even
change the
flavor of Android if I don't like what
my carrier gives me I could put another
version of of Android on the device
altogether so as a user things are good
as a developer being open means that in
this concept of being open that that we
have with Android means that my apps are
going to run on many many different
devices so unlike Linux where an app is
not going to run from a flavor of Linux
to flavor next links on Android it will
for the most part right it also means
that I have a huge platform huge market
to distribute my apps through and it
also means that I can also study a lot
about how the platform works from seeing
the ins and outs all the platforms this
isn't it's unique from developer
standpoint in Android unlike other
platforms as a manufacturer is an OEM on
one hand things are great I get to I get
an awesome operating system a fully
featured operating system and I
basically just get to load it onto my
device and off I go so things are great
because I get to innovate at a much
higher point as opposed to rebuilding
the wheel I get to just basically plug
into my device so those are good things
about about Android foreign oil yet on
the on the flip side of the coin if
unless I'm on the favorite I may not be
the one who is privy to the source code
so in other words you know if certain
OMS get essentially early access to the
code and in sometimes even up to six
months which is the case with honeycomb
and that means that's a very long time
in in mobile industry so that is not so
not so good for OEMs similarly OMS may
not know what's coming in the next
release so they can't really plan well
for the neck of the upcoming releases as
well so that's kind of like the flipside
were calling for OMS and being open as a
carrier carries love Android basically
because their users love Android it's an
alternative to operate or to iPhone so
unless you get the deal with Apple this
is a really good alternative there are
many different Williams available
so lots of different phones to choose
from but it's actually a good supporting
injury and how do we do a lock a device
down for customs for the enterprise
customers so this is something that I'm
hearing a lot from from the enterprise
customers and finally for enterprises
things are good because there are many
productivity apps available for Android
so it's a platform that it's fairly easy
to develop productivity apps makes your
staff your employees more productive and
your employees also bring their own
best-of-breed
devices into the organization which is
great but on the flip side how do we log
down a device how do we make sure that a
employee doesn't bring in a rogue device
into a company or he has a virus and a
device or something of that nature how
do we make sure the data is not leaking
by that device also if I'm an enterprise
IT manager how do I build a custom ROM
okay I created my own image if that's
the direction that I'm gonna go down on
on so that's something that is not very
easy to date technically primarily
technically doable but practically hard
to do also do we have a company issued
phone or do we allow devices to come in
from personal devices to come in from
users that's another debate out there
currently youth it's that is the
standard policy is to have a company
issued blackberry and a personal iPhone
or similar but going forward Google sees
that as more of a single device strategy
where people are going to bring single
device into the organization and it's
gonna basically have their company and
it's going to be able to connect to
their company method so how do we get to
that that's sort of unclear at the
moment as well but third parties are
working on that and that's where being
open sort of helps although it's
incomplete at the moment so overall my
summary in terms of the open source
I give Android a three stars basically
most of the code is open and it's open
source certainly everything that comes
from Google is open source in terms of
the Android Open Source project however
the big deal is that OMS still keep a
lot of bits and pieces proprietary so
yes you can build for emulator but
building for e
or zoom what is going to be extremely
hard for for somebody to do in terms of
open standards I think Android is doing
pretty well when it comes to open
standard it's trying to be very open
about everything
wherever openness is not available slots
are made available for particular
devices and so I give it four stars in
terms of adhering to open standards in
terms of community leadership
I give Android two stars at most and
basically it's mostly due to the lack of
public roadmap we don't know what's
coming out next we don't know much about
Ice Cream Sandwich or any other release
and we do not have access to to the
source code so this is something that is
very atypical
for an open source project not to know
what's coming up and not to get the
nightly to build available to us so
let's know if your own ratings aren't
friendly these are the references and
attributions for this and essentially as
a summary like I said bits and pieces
most of the Android is open source and
it's friendly and but the devil is in
the detail running it on a physical
device and building it is going to be
hard and it's not a typical open source
project it's quite quite a different
beast when it comes to Android and how
its organized and and you know that's
sort of striking the balance between
being open but at the same time
protecting the users and also protecting
their OMS and carriers in terms of their
existing business models so so that's
basically my view of how Android is open
and what that should mean to you so I
guess we are at the end of the thought
but I'm still open for questions
great ok Michael we do have some
questions that came in and I'll gladly
read them to you we have an attendee
medes on ask is the license assigned to
Android not strongly based on JDK life
so in terms of JDK as in Java developer
key that comes from Oracle
Android doesn't really have anything to
do with that so Android is used
the Apache harmony version of Java which
is licensed under Apache License 2 which
is one of the friendliest open-source
while the licensing licenses out there
I mean it's running on topic so it
really doesn't have a lot to do with JDK
although this is something that Oracle
would strongly disagree with me on or
with Google or anyone else okay and we
have Alec after any possibility of using
Creative Commons classification for
open-source Creative Commons I'm not so
sure how Creative Commons licences work
with respect to open-source Creative
Commons licenses based on the u.s.
copyright law and as such it protects
the actual code but it doesn't really
have anything to do with things like
what happens when you create an
executable out of that original you know
code what happens when you run the
executable what happens when you link to
that executable so as such Creative
Commons is much lesser of a protection
because it's only protecting the actual
code base itself no derivative work and
one thing that's very important to us
here is how do we relate to the actual
derivative work of Android so how do we
build on top of that you know can event
can OEM build secret sauce can innovate
to the higher level those are the things
are very very important not just
protecting the actual words which is
what Creative Commons does promises more
structures for you know basically
protecting you know other words of
authorship out there but not too much
software
those are all the questions that came in
today so at this time Marko we would
like to thank you for that wonderful and
informative presentation we thank all
the attendees that joined us today and
we hope you've benefited from today's
webcast we would like to remind you to

20th that will be our
Ã¶zkan webcast at 10 o'clock Pacific time
titled what's new and cool in Google
seven again would thank you all for
joining us today
