basically started saying okay you know
this is our design of the the
application at some point we need to put
our data into a database right so that
we can create a cache of what goes on
outside in the outside world so what we
did is we created something Paul status
data it was a brand new class it was a
pojo meaning plain old java object it
doesn't subclass anything as you can
tell right now right so what we did in
here is we define a whole bunch of
constants right in some notable ones
their database name in table is our
database name inversion table name and
then column names right I mean the
reason why we did do it like this it's
just that once you define it as a
constant it's less of a chance of typos
because compiler checks directory any
clips does self completion then what we
did is we created the this class called
DB helper right DV helper is basically
responsible for helping with the
database creation and upgrade so
typically typically what's going to
happen is you're going to have on create
method which gets called only once first
time the database is created right so
typically on create is gonna run
something like create table blah blah
blah so your typical statement is going
to be a create table sequel statement
right the when the database changes like
if you're not notice that there's a
change in the database from one version
to another in other in other words old
version is different than new version
then this one gets called on upgrade
right so this gets triggered and
typically what you were doing here is
you with you alter table it would say
their table add columns blah blah blah
right you would provide for a migration
from version 12 version 2 from 2 to 3 2
in 3 to 4 and so on together user to the
latest right but in our case since we're
still in the development I just said
drop it drop it should be dropped table
if exists and then the table name in
there just basically raised the table
and then we created which is maybe not
optimal you don't want to do that in
production because you know you're just
basically blowing up your existing data
you may or may not be okay depends on
what kind of data if that's right so
that's that's what we did with with the
status data then we wrote a little
helper method that basically takes the
twitter status right gets writable
database converts the twitter status to
the content values right and content
Vallas is this data structure do
basically maps a java object right on
the right hand side to a table name a
column name sir it's established acts
becomes the column text so just a
mapping its name values a cache table
its name value pairs right and then we
used insert we used instead we don't
conflict because we wanted to ignore the
duplicate IDs and the reason why we
wanted to do that is because we said by
design we want to use Twitter IDs and we
know that we're going to be getting some
duplicates so that's okay all right so
presumably this proven yeah so that's
basically what we're what where we were
at yesterday with that in just make sure
I give you guys three then zip it up
yesterday 3a no I didn't let me just
compress and make tarball number three
that was the d/s today's version
snapshot then it's under shared yeah or
should be in the show
this so so once we get this insert we
then updated our updater service to use
it right with so a simple self get the
application get established data because
we hunk the status data off of the the
application object and we basically said
insert status that's it the line that
used to just print with the log now is
actually inserted into the database and
similarly in the Refresh service what we
did is we said we basically said the
status data insert and we got a static
static here the same thing yeah in
sequel I'd there's no notion of a
connection to a database what do you
mean by that yes you're supposed to
close your connection so we we did get
readable get writable database right so
if you look at if you look at our code
here there is DB dot clothes right so
let me show you try to get this bigger
okay so get ready will database opens
the database okay and it creates it if
it doesn't exist ma creates it if it
doesn't exist okay um one-stop and
successful it is a cash so you can call
this method every time you need to write
to database make sure you call close
when you no longer need the database
right so basically um we just need to at
some point you know call close on this
again but we can call get readable
database as many times as we want and
it's only going to really do something
first time around it's not going to be
opening it opening it opening it so on
right so it's really an terrible so
that's that's basically what what
happens
in this case for for inserting into
nervous so so that the read/write object
is valid until the close is called on it
now there's another one that there's a
get readable database which we'll talk
talk about later on as well so that was
yeah um so what what causes calls to own
upgrades so basically what's going to
what's going to happen is if I change
the ID the database ID so let me
demonstrate that for you see if I change
this number from one to two right so let
me put some log here log da dee da gama
on upgrade from old version
too i can type obviously to new version
okay so i'm just putting some logs so we
can actually see what's going on right
so if i run this
actually I'm going to filter for locket
status data yeah she forgot menu and I
say refresh for example okay so see on
upgrade got triggered it noticed that
hey you know we got version one we're
upgrading to version two right now that
the that goes to version two so so
here's a situation so you may ship you
may have you shipped version one of your
app with the version de updated so there
are two versions right there's a version
of the database in a version of an app
your app may be a first version of App
shipped to database version one schema
version one right now your version to
version 3 of dia schema hasn't changed
all right you've been just adding new
you know fancy look and feel this and
that now you say version 3 of the app or
version file of the app you want to
change your schema to include you need
the support for you know you want to
track the location of the Twitter or
where the tweet came from so that
requires changing the schema right
yes
yeah yeah yeah exactly mm-hmm yep yeah
so so that's basically yeah what the app
is there so that now created a new
database with that version right um even
if i change it let me see if i change it
back to one but you shouldn't do let me
see if that's actually going to trigger
i'm curious that's gonna actually
trigger the arbitrage so the numbers
just need to be different they don't
need to be sequential do they need to go
you know 12 or you know indicative as a
matter of fact databases in the system
if you look at their own code like
contact database is in thousands so like
first 100,000 is like first version of
Android so you know it goes like that
we're like now maybe I 9000 version of
sequel right knee 9001 9002 and so on so
they're just going to jump in chunks so
let me try this again so menu i refresh
died interesting so let's see can't
downgrade database from version code 21
interesting that's pretty sure you can
but ok so i guess the number doesn't
need to go up
so that did not go the upgrade so we're
on the current version cool um so that's
that's that any other questions with
respect to what we did yesterday so now
what we want to do is we want to write a
we want to do the reading from database
so if you look at our design right the
next sort of obvious thing to do maybe
this design would be to basically do
this guy right basically you read the
data from the database my chance so to
do this we're going to need a new
activity yeah we're going to call it
timeline activity right and it's gonna
have the world's simplest to you I right
it's going to have a title and a big
piece of text where we're gonna dump the
data right you guys are gonna do this so
so let me close everything here so a
little bit of a you know warm-up
repetition from before so let me well
let's uh let's do this here's here's the
here's a new job so here's the job for
you so create a timeline activity no
jala and timeline dot XML layout right
and basically you're going to have a
layout it's going to look like this yeah
I'm gonna draw it so this is your
activity right you're going to scare a
piece of text here it says timeline or
something like that and then you're
going to have a piece of text here that
is going to be our output will be one
big piece of text not editable just the
outfit right
that's it that's that's basically your
job for now and then wire it so that
actually there's a button for that so
you can actually show it all right exam
so i'll let you you got to create couple
files and you get to create some stuff
so i'll let you play with it a little
bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
