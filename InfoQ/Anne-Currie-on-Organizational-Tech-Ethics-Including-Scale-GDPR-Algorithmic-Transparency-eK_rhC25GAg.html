data behaviors that have been written
into law by the EU they'll actually come
into effect in March this year and will
apply to all EU citizens and they'll
also apply to British citizens post
EU I think Britain is going to take on
the the GDP our rules theoretically
they're good they're good ideas their
rules about privacy data protection
right to be forgotten and also rules
about making sure that algorithms that
apply to you affair and you have a right
of redress and ability to query why
decisions have been made all of that is
good but it's quite all stick and no
carrot and the stick is very big with
accessibility there was no downside to
people swapping what they were doing
exchanging ideas saying well I'm doing
this and maybe this works maybe this
doesn't work for Google to get involved
and starts say well I think if you do
these kind of things then then that's a
good idea
so we were all quite cooperative I'm
worried that gdpr is too big a stick too
soon in ethics in that I think my fear
it might be discouraging discussion
rather than encouraging discussion
because everybody's too frightened that
they might be infringing when you see
too big a stick with you well the the
fines for infringing GDP are are quite
astronomical there are millions and
millions of pounds and millions millions
of dollars and right now we don't yet
know how aggressive the EU is going to
be in applying those fines so we don't
have a good idea yet which means
everybody's frightened and when you're
frightened you don't share information
and I think at this stage with ethics we
actually need to be sharing information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
