for the mobile team I serve North
America Nielsen's biggest market
research company in the world probably
best known for the TV ratings business
TV ratings business is actually only
about forty percent of our business so
big consumer side as well and what
Michael asked me to focus on is maybe
something a little bit different so I
cover ad networks publishers brands
agencies retail financial services
everything and one of the things we've
looked at a lot lately is as retail and
how does mobile fit into the pathway to
purchase and I think it's important for
for this group because it's a very very
big opportunity so if you think about
retailers in general retailers biggest
capital expenditure is real estate so
the big-box retailers they buy 30 year
leases and have spent a ton of amount of
time and money on research to pick the
store next biggest expenditure is all
the stuff that they need to fill the
store with right the inventory so if you
think about those two giant investments
a little bit more money invested in
mobile to get people that are already
around your store into your store and
either spending money from zero or
increasing basket size once they're in
your store is actually a fairly trivial
expenditure for these guys so I think
it's a very very interesting market for
mobile developers to be in and an
application to right in the middle of it
so I think about 18 slides and 15
minutes so I need to shut up and keep
going so this is your over year growth
by category it's mobile web but it's a
decent proxy for applications to real
estate is sort of an anomaly there it's
sort of an interesting thing in and of
itself but you can see some banking
trading and financial services education
these things are in the top shopping in
auctions is one of the highest growth
categories your every year so this was
August to August from this year another
thing i want to touch on is this is not
a smartphone world or
a tablet world this actually is it so
you heard Chris's keynote this morning
this is an applications world so if you
think about applications in the broadest
sense we need to bring tablets into the
conversation we need to talk about
7-inch tablets and 10-inch tablets
there's various use cases that will
manifest over the next couple of years
so these are some of the differences
between what people are doing on
smartphones what they're doing on
tablets and there's a few key things
here that matter for retailer and are
circled so things like using the camera
so by the way smartphone is in yellow
tablets and green things like using the
camera people are not using cameras on
tablets so this is relevant for retail
because barcode scanners and things like
that product look up excuse the big deal
using a camera location-based service is
actually much much higher on the
smartphone by the way sixty percent of
tablet owners today only access via
Wi-Fi so tablets are not floating around
out in the wild that much right now and
then finally on the far right this is
just mobile shopping and our e-commerce
in general tablets way over indexing I
actually think about tablet there's a
ton of research behind a lot of stuff
but I actually think about tablets as a
platform for shopping when you're not
shopping mobile is actually the platform
to use while you're actually shopping in
the in-store experience to some big
differences there the other thing about
tablets I'll point out this is response
to advertising looking at the ipad and
dark blue and then all connected devices
so we include ipod touch even sony PS PS
and things like that and what people did
after they saw advertising and you can
see these giants use on the ipad so
there's that there is a receptivity to
advertising that's happening on the ipad
right now but i think probably will
apply to tablet the tablet category in
general that it is highly driven towards
people making purchases so you could see
all the skus are people from top to
bottom here it's made of purchase online
made a purchase in a store bought
something of a telephone or actually
made something through the device
m-commerce is quickly turning into sort
of this almost like a red herring for
what's actually happening
with Commerce so you know two or three
years ago even four or five years ago we
just talked about m-commerce is the next
big thing everybody wants to talk about
NFC and point of sale and all this stuff
I don't think that's it I think it's
more about getting people into the store
it doesn't actually matter how they pay
as long as you're enabling them to buy
more stuff when they're in the store so
a little bit about mobile in the
purchase funnel traditional purchase
funnel type stuff right so if you look
at pre-purchase activities top funnel
what happens when you're in the store
what happens at point of sale and then
what happens after the purchase this is
very critical one these are the types of
things that are happening right so
pre-purchase you're looking at store
locating doing a lot of search price
comparison stuff like that looking for
coupons mobile couponing is sort of one
of those things that I think is probably
about to jump by leaps and down
importantly also down on the bottom here
is just a little bit of insight and I'll
just touch on it I think from a from a
mobile web at least what we see in the
data my mobile web perspective is more
about comparison shopping and in upper
funnel type activities mobile apps are
very very transactional people download
apps to do things their utilitarian in
nature right and so when it comes to
actually purchasing Amazon's got this
down really well in their application
it's you know minimizes about minimizing
clicks and getting somebody to a point
where they can actually order something
as fast as possible that seems to be the
app experience versus the web experience
and that applies across tablet and phone
in store it's a lot about price
comparison and looking at product
information there's a social shopping
element to it which I'll touch on the
next slide importantly for in-store
tablets are not in store generally
speaking purchase actual purchase and
despite you know we'll see what happens
with google wallet and all its kind of
stuff it's fairly low incidence purchase
on mobile devices tends to be smaller
smaller basket size and also very very
particular types of items so like
consumed small small ticket consumer
electronics obviously digital content
games and ringtones and that kind of
stuff we'll see what happens with paypal
and Isis
all this stuff over the next couple
years but that is a long term blame you
guys a long term evolution before we do
before we get there from mobile payment
post-purchase I think is sort of the
most glaringly obvious place that's
missing right now retailers have this
opportunity once somebody has
participated in mobile activities with
their brand of actually connecting with
that consumer after the purchase and
they're not doing that today to a large
degree and these are opportunities
around loyalty cards and people people
engaging with activities like tracking
orders social media writing opinions or
reviews about their experience or their
items that they purchase in this kind of
stuff so is a big opportunity there so
I'll just go into each one of those
stages real briefly here so pre-purchase
this is category of mobile search and
it's very interesting that the top ones
that you see are the ones we usually see
right maps and directions weather news
but what's interesting here is that
shopping is is right up towards the top
of the list in terms of what people
actually searching for us if you think
about search on a mobile phone a lot of
times it is around where to buy
something and frequently it's where to
buy something now and this is what I
referred to you about this is a
situational usage of tablets and
e-readers and smartphones we're looking
at Erie ders a little bit separately
right now because different use case
different demographics sixty percent of
view reader owners or women which is
kind of the flip side of the iPad but
this is from I'll touch on a couple
things here from left to right everybody
user device at home right between
smartphones e-readers and tablets but
the key difference is here green is at
work those smartphones are at work
tablets are not at work and then in the
car so traveling in the car is another
one and then the far right at retail
right you can see this fifty nine
percent of smartphone owners using their
phones at retail twenty one percent of
tablet owners using their tablets at
retail the very very different use cases
for these two things and that also goes
back to what Chris was talking about
this morning really developing a
different strategy for these two devices
they are not the same and so this is
something that's kind of interesting
brands I think
there's we were in a study with Yahoo
last year and or early this year and
there's there's all these activities
that people are doing while in a store
right so communicating via text sending
pictures I aming the point is they're
not shopping these are things that are
not related to the in-store experience
and so one of our messages also we
grouped all together we call this social
shopping so about fifty percent of
people are doing these activities while
they're in the store about half the
people these are non exclusive but about
half the people are also doing things
that are about shopping the point is if
you're a brand someone someone's
communicating back and forth with their
social network and this kind of thing
why not try to steal some of that time
right and have them talking about
talking back and forth with you or
engaging with your brand as a retailer
so I think this is it's obviously a big
everyone here's done at right but it's
obviously this big thing what if you
what if you could transfer some of that
some of the social nature person on
their device already into a conversation
with you as a retailer this is another
one of those another one of the slides
about you know the different the big
differences between these two platforms
so this is a frequency it's kind of like
the other chart as far as a situational
use of this is frequency so what this
shows and this in the middle bar here is
that fifty six percent of tablet owners
say they never use their tablet while
shopping or running errands and you can
see a pretty decent distribution across
smartphone right in terms of frequency
you know shopping is one of those things
that people do several times a week
anyway so it's so the frequency of
access to this type of information and
this type of relationship with retailers
around your local area it's just a very
very important metric to keep in mind
ereader is obviously are not going out
the e-reader thing I actually think
might change a little bit you know we'll
see we'll see what happens with them if
we see a similar trajectory with Android
tablets that we saw with Android phones
I think it gets real real interesting
next year in terms of what what
classifies a sort of an e-reader and
what classifies as a tablet coupons are
gaining traction coupons have been one
of those things but fairly slow to
to get adoption but around 70 so about
ten percent of mobile users by the way
this is sort of the overall ten percent
of mobile people participate in some
kind of m-commerce mobile coupons about
seventeen percent in terms of
penetration of that group so not too bad
a couple years ago that wouldn't have
been that big so here's the part about
point-of-sale that's really important is
there is there is great interest in
people using their phone as credit cards
and this is sort of a top to bottom too
however you want to look at the graph
but sort of interest the interest level
on the left and then concerns on the
right people have huge concerns about
privacy so ninety-six percent of people
at least have some concern of a privacy
of personal information credit card
information for using their mobile phone
at retail and then finally on the post
purchase side we really focus a lot on
rewards so one of the things in his
business is sort of funny is you have
always people checking in and and yet
all these retail brands really want to
create this this environment where
people want to talk to torrei and people
want to be in this conversation loop
with target or best buy or whomever but
you need something back right consumers
at some point will get tired of dis
contributing all the time right you
can't give and give and give and not get
something back so this was a question
around what types of branded apps people
like to use and by far right something
with rewards was the most popular and
this goes into the sort of if you look
at coke strategy on my coke rewards in
the SMS program a very very successful
program so lastly I'll just touch on a
few different trends here this is
category of apps use in the past 30 days
you've seen some similar data but this
is the trend I really like about this we
see this massive growth right so this is
just from q3 to q1 so just six months of
growth from seventeen percent of
twenty-six percent in terms of
penetration so this is a category that's
taking off similar to similar to the app
store stuff this is very very critical
to be top of mine so this is from we
have a metered android panel an iPhone
panel but this is I think this is
droid data yeah this is just the Android
data so top 50 Android apps take them
about sixty-five percent of all time
spent and so it's very very critical so
this is on the left is apps and
different types of functions on the
device so you can see things like
messaging about fourteen percent of time
browser behavior on Android only nine
percent of time spent apps is a absent a
general sense of third party apps about
fifty-five percent the time spent in the
top ten you can kind of see the
distribution here in top 20 half of time
spent the top 20 apps and Facebook
obviously is a large part of that and
then lastly a little bit on QR because
all the retailers obsessed with QR bunts
the brands are obsessed with QR very
very bad sort of awareness at the moment
now it's getting better this chart you
know a year ago looked worse but this is
awareness and so the purple bar is not
aware so pretty much any way you slice
it by any demo segment people don't know
what's going on here potato story i was
talking last week and did a guest
lecture at UT and i live in austin and i
was waiting for the bus and lady came up
to do a survey around the new bus signs
there's a whole the whole thing was
about mobile so I'm kind of geeking out
I didn't tell her why I did for living
but she has ten people what do you
notice about this sign and it had you
can call in for the new schedule you can
text in you can enter this web address
that it had a big QR code right at the
bottom and every single one of those
people picked one of the other three
options nobody picked the QR code and
one guy nobody really even knew what it
was one guy said do I have to download
an app for that I don't really get it
and you know so there's a big big
awareness problem with QR codes right
now but I think it'll get better but
that's kind of that's kind of where it
is right now so conclusion SEO for for
early funnel activities very very
critical people are searching for retail
apps and retail information the in-store
from a development point of view the
in-store situation is you want to pitch
retailers on having a conversation about
them that's what they're obsessed with
right now is how do i get a consumer
talking about me and my brand and then
you
app or web is sort of this thing about
you know using location and driving
utility that tends to be the application
sort of sweet spot and then on post
purchase you know they love all this
stuff around loyalty various retailers
are going out big loyalty programs and
stuff like that right now so it's a good
time to have that conversation with them
that's me thank you David</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
