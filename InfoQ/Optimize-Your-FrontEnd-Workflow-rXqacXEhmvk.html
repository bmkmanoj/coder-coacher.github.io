actually said like a give presentation
last year and that was like pretty
successful I guess we had like 10,000
views on YouTube and this was a little
bit about like tools so how to optimize
your workflow and this is the sequel and
that's I guess the cool thing about or
just like technology in general it just
moves so fast and I'm gonna give you a
couple of tips and hints to just make
your own workflow way faster so
basically like if you actually look at
it like any startup or like companies
just in general they they're like pretty
inefficient sometimes like they do a lot
of like copy and pasting themselves and
like they don't really have that like a
lot of like really good tools set up
well there are a lot out there it's
actually the first one I'm gonna be
showing off and this is not really a
tool it's more about like how you can
change your actual workflow so some of
you might already know about this and
I'm gonna be using a simple app here so
this is like coding in a browser and the
app that I'm gonna be using is actually
pulling some pictures those might
actually seem pretty familiar that are
have a hash tag but how Wes goes USA so
one of the things that is actually
missing in here I know like I had some
kind of like unclick handler here but it
doesn't seem to be working so it was
actually supposed to go to Instagram
here so let's actually dive down a
little bit deeper right this is actually
written in angularjs and just a little
bit of like CSS animations here and
there so what we actually see here is
like pointer events knob which is
actually going to make sure that I'm not
able to do any of those things so how
does that actually work right like for
any front-end developer what you usually
do is like okay we try it out oh it
seems to be working but then right like
then what happens is you have to go to
your editor you have to make like all
these different changes then you edit
you have to save it make sure there's no
like conflicts there and then you have
to go back to your browser actually
nowadays there's something built into
Chrome and it's called workspaces and
what you can just do just this is the
settings panels you can just open that
with like just your question mark you go
to workspace and you actually add just a
folder from your local directory just
basically selected you make sure that
chrome actually has access and then this
was a little bit more cumbersome so
that's the reason why I'm actually
showing this you actually have to have
edit and then you can actually add all
these different properties like URL
prefix also your folder path so what
this is gonna actually do is it's gonna
set up a mapping between what you're
seeing here in the browser localhost
8000 workflow slash lo show the ends
your actually local file system so
what's gonna happen if i refresh usually
what you see in the sources panel you're
going to be seeing something like
localhost:8080 c is actually just your
directory right here
and yeah this is a pretty cool key
command as well like just ctrl o to
actually open the file that we want to
modify for me that's main dot CSS and
then what we're gonna do is actually
remove this save it and when you refresh
it it's actually saved on our filesystem
this is huge right it's like just one
step that you have to do every single
time when you're developing in the front
end having said that I don't think we're
completely there yet like the editor
that's built into Chrome it's pretty
good but there's some other things that
I'm gonna be mentioning right now that
are built in quite yet I but I I really
hope this is like the direction we're
heading so next step is gonna be about
linting your code does anybody know what
linting is how many people know what
linting is okay not everybody awesome so
if you don't let your code I would
suggest definitely let your code and
what does that shoe mean it's actually
gonna enable you to spot problems early
on so even in your editor there's a lot
of different tools
be showing some as well so in this
particular case is always the bait of
course like should you use like
semicolons at the end like in JavaScript
or not in some cases this can actually
be an error so what these tools are
going to be doing let me just bring my
editor up here so this is my editor and
you know I just have linting enabled by
default so this is a you know plugins
installed I'm using sublime later right
here
we're just hints and then it's like very
small changes right like if I actually
remove this particular thing I don't
know if it's like super clear on the
screen but you see these like our
notifications warnings one cool thing
that has recently been introduced is
your JavaScript style checker so
especially if you're working on like
open stores and projects with multiple
people involved it's always annoying you
know that one person that always adds
like these extra spaces in your code you
know that guy or girl so and what this
is going to be actually saying even
those particular things are going to
give you errors angularjs just added
this I guess three or four weeks ago to
their own code they're still moving
towards making sure that all of the code
is actually compatible so it just things
like you know extra spaces even like
extra line breaks they're gonna give you
an error notification and when I say
like splitting problems early for
instance in this case like if I remove
this S at the end you know parse picture
well why is this giving me notification
right it's pretty small and screen but
actually it says like parse picture is
undefined but it's never used so here
you can actually see if it's being used
or not this is extremely helpful during
development because otherwise again you
have that one extra cycle where you go
to the browser you check it out and you
see in your console that there's
something wrong here you can just spot
it early on all right so let's make sure
my father's good again so the most
important thing for me what linting is
making sure that's actually life there's
a lot of editors if you use text my age
sublime webstorm even VI like they have
all plugins built them themselves to do
this on the fly so as soon as you're
typing as you saw in my screen it's
actually doing this the other thing is
make sure it actually helps on both as
well
so if other people are checking in your
code make sure you actually make sure
the bailed actually fails if you use
something like Travis CI then is
actually going to give you red warning
before you actually gonna merge the pull
request again a couple of tools for
JavaScript Jesslyn just hint it doesn't
really matter which one you choose just
hint has become more and more popular
jeaious style checker it's pretty recent
we'd love it on our project so far again
I don't have to say to anybody on get
make sure you know there's spaces
aligned they already know before so it's
yeah I don't have to spend it much time
and there's also like tools for CSS and
HTML as well next up is like optimizing
your built so what I mean with that is
there's a couple of tools out there
actually we had a great presentation
early on about like somebody that
actually built their own tool but
there's also a lot of tools out there
that actually already do a lot of these
things for you there's a couple of big
ones so for instance like grunt and gulp
there's also broccoli and you can even
like use make again it's not about like
which tool you use it's more about which
tool actually works for your team they
do things in a slightly different way so
Grint for instance has been along for a
pretty long time and they have a lot a
lot of plugins and a you know it's more
like the fodder like it's pretty mature
and you know it works pretty well
but there's some pros and cons to it for
instance with gulp there's like one
specific item that you do per tasks so
that actually helps you out a lot and
also just the syntax feels very similar
to when you're writing any like nodejs
app so what I mean with dad for instance
right like this is just my grunt file
right here let me just bring up these
two things next to each other so my
grunt file just looks like this and it's
very like configuration heavy it's not
really like it doesn't really feel like
code so what it does when you actually
run your grunt command right now it's
going to do a couple
things right is going to concatenate my
JavaScript it's gonna use uglify in this
particular case you can also use some
closure whatever it doesn't really
matter it's gonna lint my files and last
but not least like this is actually
pretty important as well while you're
building something to have some kind of
watch so what this watch is going to be
doing as soon as you change anything in
your code is automatically going to run
the build on your command line
so yeah let's actually try that out
right so what I'm gonna do here in this
particular case is just grunt watch
right it's just watching so it's
watching for any file changes in my
system and then when I'm changing
something like when I actually break the
code right and I just saved a file
that's the only thing I did and I didn't
like go back to the terminal
it's completely breaking and this is
what I want I want to again like spot
these problems like extremely early on
and again like saving and everything's
fine again so I'm also going to show off
how a gulp is doing this it's a little
bit of different syntax like if you used
to note again like this feels very very
similar one other really big advantages
is that they're using pipes so and
notice a way to actually channel these
files through so you only have to do one
manipulation unlike a specific file and
then you just transfer that to another
without actually having to do any IO
functionality it actually makes your
build way faster and that's what we've
seen with a lot of people that moved
from grunt - gulp again like a little
bit of distance syntax when you run it
this is doing exactly the same thing
just a little bit of different output as
well in the browser I don't know if
people like pink or purple and it's also
doing my watch task actually right here
alright so make sure that whatever built
who you use like these are just two
examples make sure it actually does like
compilation concatenation minifying
hashing so what is hashing actually
going to be doing is making sure that
you don't use like just a regular file
name right like main dot J s if you're
going to be using that on your files
like actually like serving that up
what's gonna be happening is that you
know your cash right you this is gonna
be cash conflicts and you need to expire
your cash with hashing is just gonna
make sure that you use like an md5 hash
and show that file instead so it always
changes when there's any file changes on
your in your file as well again like
watch for changes and lend to your code
last but not least like this is
something it did not really like front
end related but it's a tool that is
really cool if anybody's like using git
or github but I hope almost everybody is
using that it's where all my code lives
as well and the name of this particular
tool is actually called hub
and what hub is gonna be doing it
enables you to do like way less typing
usually what you have to do is you know
you do like get clone and then you're
like oh no now I have to go to like
github and try to copy this URL and then
I have to paste it into my terminal
again it's not something you do every
single day but if you have a lot of
members on your team this helps you out
a lot so instead of just having to write
all this it's very similar to like git
remote you don't even have to put your
repo name in there it actually figures
that out by itself so that's pretty cool
and one thing that I love myself as well
as like making poor requests from the
command line what this is what I we used
to do usually what you do is like you
push something to the server you go to
github you refresh the page a couple of
times to see if you know that one little
bar there right and then you say make
pull requests you check your different
changes where they actually line up and
you hit make a pull request with this
tool what we actually can do is make
your pull request from the command line
which is extremely powerful even
creating repositories is just get create
it's going to use the name of the
current directory and use your own owner
name and this one I like myself as well
like in any git repository like this
whole presentation is actually on git as
well what you can do is just get browse
and then what it's going to be doing is
opening this particular thing in get
all right and then I just want to round
up a little bit it's like make sure to
actually build your own tools and if you
want to make yourself pretty popular but
like some of the other developers on
your team that's a really good thing to
do because you're just spending way less
and less time and actually just doing
this main you know maintenance tasks and
just write your own scripts recently I
wrote something for updating or angular
gem like we have our own language or gem
and just one script and it automatically
does everything for us something else
I've built is just for fun as well it's
a little tool I call JIRA Clippy there's
not that many users but it's very useful
for our team because otherwise we had to
like copy the URL copy the description
copy the title now we're just one single
click on an icon in your browser it's
copied just by default and this is
something the last thing I want to show
you is something we're seeing more and
more like in like different companies
and right now there's not really that
many tools out there that do that for
you especially not if you use like
specific build tools but this is like
what is doing here is like showing the
build information it's showing how long
it's actually taking for us so like warm
up or cache and also or open pull
requests before we had like now 10:00 to
11:00 open pull requests every single
day and I was like come on people like
try to merge these things then what I
did instead is I showed this on the
screen in our office and people are like
we need to do something about it like
the boss coming in like hey you know we
want that feature in like make sure to
actually do that so yeah and if you have
any other questions and like definitely
reach out to me this is my twitter
handle thank you so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
