soldiering on past the snacks and well
into the afternoon I'm going to be
talking a bit about web standards today
what they are how they are made and how
we are moving them forward faster today
than we have in the past so my name is
bear Travis you can find me on github at
ve Travis which is where these slides
will be posted after the talk or on
twitter at bear underscore Travis where
you can pay me with any questions you
might have so a bit about me I work at
the web engine team at Adobe and besides
having a penchant for blue beanies we
occasionally do work on web standards
both creating them in implementing them
in engines like WebKit so I've already
said it a couple times already so you
may be wondering you know what is the
web standard what qualifies and what
doesn't and so I found this definition
that I like um call by Roger Johansson
you said web standards or technologies
established by the w3c and other
standards bodies that are used to create
an interpret web-based content these
technologies are designed to future
putte future-proof documents published
on the web and to make those documents
accessible to as many people and devices
as possible and I like this definition
of web standards because they kind of
describe what web standards aspire to be
like when you have standards you can
create documents that are future proof
they will work today as well as they
will five years from now you're also
making web stick making documents
accessible to as many people on
accessing your content as possible you
know they may come at your content from
a whole bunch of different angles and
standards help ensure that people will
reliably see that content so one of the
things that's unique about the web is
that the web is viewed by a lot of
different people on different devices
from desktop to tablets to mobile using
all sorts of different browsers and
unlike many other development
environments when you're working on the
web you don't necessarily control how
your content is going to be viewed your
users could be using any of these
browsers any of these devices you know
in any area across the globe accessing
your content and expecting it to work
when you're developing for something
like iOS or Android you may have more
reasonable expectations about what
platform on your end user is going to be
using because that's all your contents
going to be accessible but with the web
people can access it pretty much
anywhere so what does that boil down to
from an end users perspective what it
means is that you should be able to
write mark up once and have a reasonable
expectation for what it should display
so like you should only have to describe
this once to a browser and have it
reasonably display the same content all
across browsers and across devices and
so what this comes down to is basically
do browsers reliably implement a feature
can you use one one feature and expect
all of the browsers to reliably show the
same thing and so I figured that it
would be fun to kind of wake people up
in the afternoon and take a poll on so
media queries are one of the the kind of
relatively new features that enable you
to customize the CSS for different
devices and kind of different form
factors that people may be using so how
many of you feel relatively comfortable
using media queries and browsers today
cool I mean it feels like they've been
around for forever right so in terms of
browser support on their supported
pretty much across the board on you just
have to be aware that it they were kind
of implemented in IE 9 plus so be
careful browse was less than that how
about gradients have any of you guys use
gradients and your websites yep I love
them too I kind of abuse them and make
really ugly ones but I'm sure that some
of you have used them quite tastefully
so gradients are relatively new on this
browser supports only relatively fair on
they are implemented in ie10 plus and
they are still prefixed in safari and
chrome and they're not
an opera mobile so border-radius this
one does feel like it's been around for
forever how many of you guys have used
border-radius in your websites yeah so
pretty much everyone I use it a ton too
and it turns out that again this is on
ie9 plus and not yet on Opera Mobile so
you may be asking you know what happens
when you don't have standards things may
be implemented in one browser and you
know we really just want to see if we
can use it you don't have standards you
may wind up having to kind of write
duplicate code to accomplish the same
effect so this is an example of adding
an event listener just for a simple
click event and on the top you kind of
have what eventually became the standard
add event listener and below you have
kind of what was one of the early sin
taxes on Internet explorer and so here
you see that you're doing the same thing
but you're having to write to code paths
for it not fun and you may be asking you
know well all the kind of more modern
browsers are using this but if you look
at kind of conservative estimates it
places IE versions like below 9 still
like nine percent of the people who may
be viewing your content and this is like
on the very very low side of those
estimates so if you really want to
target all of your users you're going to
have to write both of these code paths
okay and then there's also kind of the
case that happens when standards evolve
after some functionality because I
already gotten out in the wild so this
happened with gradients which we talked
a bit about earlier so there was no real
standard for gradients but people
obviously wanted them and so Microsoft
started experimenting with early
syntaxes in internet explorer versions
as low as 6 but as you can tell like
it's not really standardized their kind
of still I da ting let's say it's a
little bit long and a little bit ugly
and it's not even valid CSS so later on
in version 8 they added kind of ms
prefix and they made it kind of a valid
CSS property but no other browsers were
really
menting it yet and then Apple came along
with its own proposal and decided to do
an implementation in WebKit so this made
it into Safari and chrome and they kind
of introduced this WebKit gradient
syntax but this never really made it to
any of the standards bodies either um
and so it wasn't until Mozilla came
around and said you know maybe we should
work towards making a standard that all
of the browsers can implement and they
came up with this syntax and so you know
this syntax is kind of currently
supported by most the major browser
vendors the current ones and it's
getting to become kind of a standard and
something that you can use and reliably
expect but you can see that is really
only the cutting-edge browsers so when
you're talking about Internet Explorer
10 plus you know you're still missing
about seventeen percent of the market
which means that in order to get this to
reliably run you may have to write all
of those other syntaxes in one
definition so you may get like 10 lines
of filter definitions just in order to
get this reliably run on as many
browsers as possible so when standards
take too long to develop you start
getting things like quirks mode
basically when documents in the wild
start relying on non-standard behavior
and you have to kind of keep that around
in browsers and nobody really likes that
you start talking about legacy browsers
basically when you have to start talking
about browsers that have behaviors that
you don't want so in terms of kind of
getting all the players together and
making them kind of conform to standards
standards bodies are really the people
who do that work and one of the major
ones is the w3c which is one of the main
drivers for CSS so the w3c has a more
technical definition of what a standard
is because they want to be able to
define concretely what matches that
definition and what doesn't so they say
the w3c publishes documents to define
web technologies these documents follow
process designed to promote consensus
fairness public accountability and
quality at the end of this process the
w3c publishes recommendations which are
considered web standards so you can see
that from the w3c's perspective it's
more about specifying or writing down
standards and getting the actual
behavior out in the browsers like what
they want to do is they want to go
a formal process writing this document
up coming up with a specification which
goes on to become a recommendation and
that they say is a web standard so the
w3c process is very defined as they
mentioned before on there are three
major stages they have a working draft
stage where specifications are basically
being there basically subject to public
review and they can be kind of seriously
revised during this stage they then go
on to become a submission to become a
candidate recommendation and from there
the specification has to have to working
implementations and a test suite that
says whether or not browsers have
effectively implemented that
specification from there the candidate
recommendation can go on to become a
proposed recommendation and become
accepted by the w3c as a recommendation
what they consider a web standard so who
exactly takes part in the w3c process
one of the nice things about the w3c
process is that a lot of people are
involved so they're obviously the
specification authors the people writing
these specifications they're the
specification implementers the people
who are actually implementing it in the
browsers and there is the community
basically anyone can comment on these
specifications and help move them
forward and so as an example of how that
has worked in the past I want to talk
about CSS grid layout and what CSS grid
layout is at its most fundamental is you
can kind of think of it as as super
tables on their kind of a way of making
tables that flexibly resize to fit their
containers and so what you can do is you
can kind of define flexible rows and
columns and then assign elements onto
those cells but this is largely still
taking elements and assigning them to
cells within your grid and when
front-end developers and web designers
start thinking about grids they actually
think about something more like this so
this is the golden grid system but you
can see similar ones in like bootstrap
reserved Serbs foundation where what you
have is you have kind of a set of
measurements and then you start aligning
incising items to those measurements
what you're more interested in is kind
of aligned to the grid lines rather than
a line to the cells created by those
this helps you kind of create responsive
layouts where elements can resize and
you can dynamically change the grid and
so some people from the community as
they were starting to review this CSS
grid specs said you know hey what you're
writing is great but in order for this
to be really useful for me I need to be
able to align in size items to the grid
lines not just to the grid cells and so
CSS grid layout introduced line based
placement where basically you could
define on the start and end points or
define basically the wits of elements
based on lines in the grid and so in
terms of talking about specifications
from a recommendation point of view we
can kind of revisit those three specs
that those three features that I talked
about earlier and see where they are in
the w3c specification process so media
queries how many of you guys think that
this meets the w3c definition of a web
standard as a w3c recommendation so
we've got one person with their fingers
crossed so this did go on to become a
recommendation on but it was only last
summer on that that became a forum
recommendation even though it feels like
media queries have been around for a
much longer time how about greetings how
many of you guys think that we've
reached the recommendation standpoint
for gradients okay I'm seeing some some
kind of shakes of the head and you would
be right so gradients are part of the
CSS image values and replaced content
specification this is currently in that
candidate recommendation Spade candidate
recommendation stage where basically
they're trying out implementations
they've more or less finalized what they
think should work but they want to make
sure that it can actually be implemented
in browsers so this is a candidate
recommendation it went on to become that
in last spring and finally border-radius
so this has been around for a while lots
of people are using it today how many of
you guys think that this meets the
definition of a w3c recommendation I see
a couple hands on so this is part of a
larger specification called CSS
backgrounds and borders and this is
actually surprisingly still in the
candidate recommendation stage
so this kind of shows how specifications
in kind of the w3c recommendations may
actually lag behind what people are
actually using in browsers today and
what many of us consider to be web
standards so then I guess the question
becomes which definition do we use for
web standards do we use what is
available in the web browsers basically
what we're comfortable using and having
display reliably across whatever browser
or user may be using or is it what kind
of we have defined and have written
specification for that's gone through
this review process and what that kind
of influences is where do we focus if we
want to move web standards forward as
fast as possible do we focus more on the
implementation side or more on kind of
writing and codifying the behavior and
so to give kind of an answer to this
question I'd like to go over a little
bit of history because you know
hindsight is much easier than say future
predictions and talk about the past for
CSS so in 1990 Tim berners-lee develops
the first webpage in web browser I'm in
1994 the w3c is formed helped shape web
standards in 1995 we get the first
public working draft of CSS one this
moves very quickly in in 1996 becomes a
recommendation so you can see that
there's basically a one-year turnaround
from actually writing that to getting it
as the w3c recommendation 1997 we get
the first public draft of CSS to and in
1998 that goes on to become a
recommendation in two thousand the w3c
starts thinking about css3 but then in
2002 they go back and kind of revisit
some of the errata in CSS to start
working on revision one then that takes
ten years to become a recommendation and
so one of the questions may be why does
CSS to revision one take ten years of
work whereas CSS one and CSS to had
really only taken one year
to get a recommendation and the reason
was that CSS to lacked a candidate
recommendations stage before went on to
become a recommendation so if you
remember that Canada recommendation
stage is basically where a specification
is put on hold until it's proven that
two browsers are actually interested and
can implement it so what happened was a
lot of browsers actually diverged from
the recommendation for CSS to the w3c
put out and so some material was just
slightly different and so CSS 2.1 just
was slightly altered in the behavior
from CSS to on some browsers expressed
basically no interest and implementing
parts of CSS 2 and so those sections
were removed in CSS 2.1 and then some
material was added where browsers have
basically gone off and innovated and
created new behaviors and more or less
standardized on them before the WCC had
gone around to writing specifications
for them and so what this kind of shows
is that standards synthesize
implementation and specification it's
not really about one or the other it's
about both on you need to move for both
forward at the same time in order to
effectively create web standards if you
have specifications that outpace
implementation you have things like CSS
2.1 where the final implementations may
significantly diverge from what's
written in the specification if you have
implementation that outpaces
specification you may wind up with
things like filters where basically the
browser's have gone off and done kind of
crazy things on their own in order to
kind of corral them back in you wind up
with all these kind of like legacy
syntaxes that you have to fix up and
support until you can reliably expect
all of your users to be using standards
compliant browsers
and so the w3c is kind of a driving
force behind this it makes for make sure
that specifications move forward and
also the kind of browser vendors are on
board with implementing these standards
and then just the final thing is that
standards are continuously evolving as
you can see from the example of CSS to
it wasn't like the specification was
done and that was a standard really the
browsers had continued to implement new
functionality and what they implemented
and what kind of CSS 2.1 came to agree
on really became standards on the web so
where do these ideas from for web
standards come from obviously there's
there are some standards that basically
just codify existing behaviors in web
browsers but some times the w3c is
thinking more about what is coming down
the line like what is kind of what
people are interested in using in the
future so they kind of have to do some
brainstorming about where the web will
be it several years from now and so an
example of this is just text layout on
the web like there are a lot of
different features on being actively
developed today including some by Adobe
helping people do more complicated
layouts on the web and kind of as a
history of text layout just the simplest
version is you know the scroll it's been
around for a while you lay out text from
left to right from top to bottom and you
need as much space as you have text so
the scroll basically becomes as long as
you need it to fit all of your content
as your layout gets more complex you may
begin kind of playing with that layout
so that you can wrap text through say
multiple columns you can wrap it in non
rectangular areas so in this case we are
avoiding this fish shaped area in the
center and wrapping text around it and
then eventually is as our content gets
really long we may start actually
dividing it into things like pages so
that we don't have to have just one long
scroll of content so we can kind of
divide it into pages and then
ended in something like a book and we
can see that these layouts are still
very much in play today so in something
like a magazine layout you may have kind
of multiple articles running through
custom areas avoiding figures like these
baubles here and then of course this is
all going to be bound into a magazine
which is paginate it and on the web like
layout is started off very simply and is
starting today to kind of explore some
of these more complex layouts so at its
simplest and occasionally its most
elegant you still have the scrolling
area of content you have basically a web
page it lays out text from left to right
from top to bottom the web page is as
long as it needs to be in order to fit
that content and the user will just
scroll down in order to view all of it
but like this site here which is from TV
safety org people are starting to play
with different ways of laying out the
content so here we are laying out text
within these circular bubbles here and
text is kind of wrapping to fit inside
of them and then we've also got these
arrows on the left and right in order to
navigate this and using this we're going
to navigate through multiple pages of
content rather than just scrolling
through them so you can see that they've
kind of divided their experience into
pages
and then there are kind of some online
magazine layouts that are becoming
popular today too this is from the great
discontent and what you can see is
basically they have one stream of
content flowing down the center above
and below this diagram and then what
they've done is they've inserted a
picture and a quote on here into this
stream of content so they basically have
magazine content that is broken up on
being surrounded by figures and quotes
but these more complicate these more
complicated layouts are still a little
bit tricky to accomplish on the web and
one of the largest reasons is because in
order to express something on the web as
I mentioned earlier you have to be able
to describe it in the vocabulary that
browsers will understand you have to
describe it in markup you know HTML CSS
JavaScript and what happens when you
have something like this so you have
content the wraps more tightly around
this capital a here and what happens
when you have something like this also
running through multiple columns where
you don't have an easy translation to
vocabulary that the browser's will
understand an easy translation to markup
so what do you write then and I mean you
can get these effects by writing kind of
complicated things you can start
dividing all of your texts into spans
and do complicated floats but it's hard
it's not straightforward and so regions
and exclusions are two of the standards
that Dobby is currently working on in
order to make these layouts easier in
order to make it easier to basically
customize how content flows through
documents on the web
regions basically customize the
containers that you can float x 3 so
rather than just flowing content through
its current box you can specify areas
and then flow content through them so
here we have a stream of content the
gray content that we're going to flow
through boxes 1 2 3 and 4 and then we
also have this white stream of content
down here that we're going to flow
through boxes a and B and these boxes
that were flowing content through are
called regions and the content that
we're flowing through them is called a
flow and so the mark-up for it looks
like this basically you specify that
your content is going to go into the
flow basically something that regions
can pull from later and then you're
going to mark all of your regions with
this region class and you will pull
content from it using the flow from
property exclusions are basically a
complement to regions and what they
allow you to do is they allow you to
customize on the shapes that content
flows inside and around so here we can
see that content is flowing inside of
this circular shape and also content
outside of it is respecting the same
circular contour and the market for this
is again pretty simple what we have is
we have this circular shape it's
floating on the left so you can see that
this is that circle there and what we do
is we customize the shape outside which
is the shape that content outside of it
is going to respect on the float we
specify that as a circle centered at
fifty percent fifty percent with a
radius of fifty percent and then we
specify that the shape inside is going
to respect the same shape as the shape
outside is also going to be wrapped
inside of that circular shape so I have
two quick demos of this functionality
just you can see it in action
ok I'm not going to try and full screen
it
so this is basically just an example of
flowing content through two columns and
again wrapping it around that drop cap
and we can see that all of these columns
are kind of size to be about the size of
the viewport so people can basically
scroll down the content and see this
multiple column experience and all of
this content is again part of basically
just one div that's marked as content
and then flowed through these multiple
regions and then this is an example of
just customizing the shape inside so we
can do kind of something a little bit
eccentric like flowing text through this
tail shape on the mouse and you can see
that you know if we say zoom in then
it's not something like an image it's
going to actually be the text so it
appears nice and crisp and clean
okay so adobe is trying to kind of move
these and get these into the hands of
web developers as quickly as possible
and how do we accomplish this today so
of course because we're working both in
specifications and implementations it's
important to move both of them faster so
we'll talk about the specification piece
first one of the simplest ways to move
specifications forward faster is by
reducing their complexity so CSS one
just as a measure of complexity start
out with about 25,000 words this is to
had about 92,000 CSS 2.1 had about
140,000 and then CSS 3 which is still
very much in flux so standards are kind
of being added or removed from it this
was account i did back a couple of
months ago currently at about three
hundred and ninety thousand words so you
can see that like it's getting much more
complex and trying to finalize something
all in one go is going to take a lot
longer so what specifications and
standards do these days is they
basically move forward individually
they're broken up into modules and then
each of those modules can move forward
with testing and specification and
implementation all separately so one
specification may actually finalized in
the level three spec and move on to
level four before another speck may
actually finalize its level three and so
as an example of basically how much the
w3c is doing this especially with CSS is
this is the list of current CSS works
the w3c is doing and they're about 50
plus specs that have currently been
broken apart and are currently moving
forward individually there
so regions and exclusions are kind of
examples of this new modular philosophy
they were actually proposed initially as
a single spec and then the w3c you know
kind of said you know there may be
enough here to actually make it too and
so they were broken up into two separate
specifications and kind of ideas that
have come along since have either reused
functionality defined in reaching some
exclusions or kind of been spun off into
new specification so that these two can
remained is focused in lightweight as
possible so for example when you're
using regions basically flowing content
through custom areas it may be nice to
define templates so you basically reuse
that template as many times as you need
in order to place all of your content
into these templates and this was an
idea like hey it's really useful to find
a template with regions so you can
basically flow your content and reuse
the template as many times as you need
in order to kind of make a nice paginate
aveal but rather than include this in
the region spec it was spun off into a
different specification on called the
the page template specification can be
nearly enough that can be moved forward
independently another example of this is
fragmentation the idea that basically
you want to be able to specify breaks
across region in your content and
originally this had been part of the
region specification because well it was
important to be there but it turns out
there several other features that are
currently being worked on that break
content across multiple containers and a
lot of that behavior is being codified
in something called the CSS
fragmentation specification and they
also specify how content breaks across
these multiple fragments and so rather
than kind of having a separate
definition in the reason region
specification on the breaking behavior
was moved over into the CSS
fragmentation spec and then there was
the SS masking which folks have kind of
started to codify how content can be
clipped and masked in CSS and one of the
asks for this feature was being able to
specify shapes that you can
clip content with in CSS so you need to
be able to define shapes to clip content
I'm using CSS Marco and because CSS
exclusions and shapes already has a
syntax for that on the CSS masking spec
just reuses that syntax
but it turns out there was kind of a
limit to how modular or lightweight we
can make any individual module and one
of the reasons for this is that each
module is really part of a larger
toolset in order for these modules to be
successful as features you really need
to be able to use them effectively with
any other feature in the toolset that
you may want to so as an example of this
Jesus CSS regions and exclusions were
proposed as a single specification
because they're supposed to play well
together so you should be able to define
custom regions in your content you
should be able to customize the shapes
of those regions and how content flows
through them I'm so in this example you
can see that you kind of have CSS
regions and exclusions is a one stream
of texts running through two regions
with these triangle shapes applied to
them and so you know in the mark-up this
is pretty simple you have regions they
have a shape inside which customizes the
shape that the content floats inside and
then you have content which is going to
be flowed through them but then the
question comes up well what happens if
both the regions and the content have a
shape inside on them so in this example
what happens if you have these triangle
shapes on the two regions on the left
right and then the content itself that
you're flowing through it has say a
circular shape and so we've decided to
do for right now is basically use the
intersection of those two shapes but
it's kind of an example of how you need
to think about how specifications
interact when you're writing them in
implementing them another example of
this is regions in multi-column so you
can use regions basically to break up
multi-column elements so in here you
could say have multiple pages that use
regions for and inside each of those
pages you have a multi-column layout so
it's something like we saw in the Alice
demo where we want content to flow
through these columns first and then
move on to the next page and flow
through the columns there but if we're
not careful in specifying kind of which
of these containers has priority content
might flow through the columns first and
then be broken up into separate pages
rather than flowing through the region's
first and breaking up into columns and
so you might wind up with basically
these super long columns that are broken
up across pages and this obviously isn't
what you want either so you need to make
sure
that your specifications work well
together so the flip side of writing
faster specifications is getting faster
implementations basically getting this
functionality available to people faster
and one of the things we're seeing today
is that web browsers are releasing just
much faster than they have in the past
so uh all of the major browsers are
releasing test builds before their final
release versions go out so if you're
interested in trying out features I
would encourage you to download and try
out their test builds many browsers are
also releasing something called an
experimental channel something like
chrome canary or Aurora for Firefox
which basically installs alongside your
standard release browser automatically
updates on to the latest build and so
basically you have a browser where you
can test out experimental features
without having to download a new version
all the time and it also kind of doesn't
overwrite your current browser so you
can go back to your regular release
browser when you want your everyday
browsing experience other part of this
is that release builds are also coming
out more frequently than in the past so
your actual like the browser that you
use every day is coming out more
frequently than the past because in the
past we've had release cycles say you
know every year every two years and
obviously the web is moving forward a
bit faster than that so we're seeing
release cycles in a short of six weeks
with some of the major browsers today
so native implementations have a couple
benefits they prove that a feature can
be done they prove that it can be done
in a performant manner and they prove
that it can be done just like any other
web feature after all you know it is a
web feature when it's made it into
browsers on the downsides of native
implementations though are that you're
tied to a specific browser when you
implement it your code isn't going to go
out except for on the release schedule
for that browser and because it's a
shipping product it may have really kind
of high standards for review and
implementation so getting code out in a
browser release can take a bit of time
and it's only going to be in only one
browser so
so what we really want to do is we want
to get functionality in the hands of
people faster because what it boils down
to is letting people play with these
features see if they do what they need
them to and then getting feedback on the
specification so one of the ways we're
doing this today is using polyfills so
many of you guys have used a polyfill in
web development how many of you have you
heard polyfills is a big buzzword okay
so I'll go over them really fast on the
basic idea is that you have something
like a JavaScript library it sits on top
of your HTML and when you have a new
feature that's implemented in some
browsers but not all especially
something like legacy browsers the
polyfill will go through your document
and transform it into something that all
web browsers can understand the idea
being here that you can use newer
features that are supported on some of
the newer browsers then you'll have a
fallback for older browsers what we're
seeing today is that people are starting
to play around with polyfills before
reliable implementations have actually
been released on any browser and so what
you're seeing is the people are starting
to release polyfills so you can play
around with basically the newest
cutting-edge features that are currently
being worked on in the w3c so the
advantages of polyfills of course are
that they work now they can work across
browsers if people take the time to do
that they can be replaced by native
functionality because you know again
this functionality is supposed to be
supported in the future we're only kind
of back filling it with some JavaScript
and some additional markup for now and
they also kind of let you try out new
features
some example of this is the code pen
rodeo and what happened was code pen was
doing a series of basically kind of user
experiments basically it would give a
topic for a week let people try around
try to play around with that challenge
and kind of see what people created and
what they came up with and because adobe
had released a polyfill for regions we
were actually able to do a region's
challenge one week and so the great
thing about having a polyfill was
basically people could use it with their
browser of choice they could go through
and kind of start playing around with it
without kind of downloading a fancy test
browser or anything and they can start
just kind of seeing what they could
build and so it was really great to see
what people have tried to create with
regions and what they were kind of
interested in doing and this is again
when we don't have a reliable
implementation available by default and
in any browser so of course there are a
couple downsides to polyfill they are a
workaround oh they are work round of
course because the feature isn't
implemented yet polyfills start getting
written relatively early in the
specification process a lot of the time
and so you can see the specification
change and sometimes there are
significant changes on in the
specification and that means that all of
the code that you took so long to get
working with the polyfill for the native
implementation to work later may wind up
being out of date and then the other
final reason is or downside of polyfills
is that they can be a bit
non-performance they're doing a lot of
work on the client side sometimes in
order to get markup that simulates this
effect that you're going for on older
browsers and so they can they can be a
bit slow
so if you are interested I have up here
a bunch of kind of polyfills that I
think are really cool you can play
around up on the modernizer site which
I've linked at the bottom there are a
bunch more basically for any
specification that's out there on the
web that you might be interested in
using this is probably a polyfill for it
and so I would encourage you to go and
check them out so the cool thing about
standards today is that they aren't
standing still on the implementation and
specification pieces are moving forward
all the time or getting new polyfills
out there and so kind of what you might
actually be able to use I can change on
a daily basis as people release new
functionality with browsers it's an
older version of the talk um so
standards are basically their tools and
the goal for them is basically for you
to be able to write you want to get
something on the web and you should be
able to describe that in markup and have
it run on any browser that works with
web content so that's really the goal
for standards and so our current
encourage you to help get them where
they need to go on so you can always
grab a test version of your favorite
browser you can test out a new feature
including using polyfills if it's not
currently implemented in that browser
writing up bugs for implementation is a
great way of finding out what people are
interested in working and then you can
always give feedback on specs so all of
the standards bodies on the web are
really open to public review and so if
you see kind of a standard that you're
interested in that kind of maybe isn't
going exactly where you think it should
be going or you would like to see it be
slightly different let let the spec
authors know
so that concludes the talk feel free to
ask me any questions but if you need to
run because it's getting late I won't
have my feelings hurt thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
