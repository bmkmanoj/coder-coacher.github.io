JavaScript and CSS and the windows 8 so
we can actually spend the next 50
minutes talk about some of the
development our best practice tips you
know you need to be aware of if you
interested in develop windows 8
application and then we're actually
going to actually talk about how you can
use html5 css3 javascript oh the skills
that you have mmv okay let me let me
guess my idea how many of you are
JavaScript developer very good html5 CSS
okay wonderful so make my job quite a
lot easier let me introduce myself my
name is Doris Chan I'm technology
Avengers at a Microsoft and then if say
after to talk you have some comments
feedback a question tourists are trained
and a microsoft com that's my email
address and then for people interesting
presentation their most a lot of other
information you want to learn more about
our windows 8 development html5 this is
my blog address so you could have found
a lot of information and you could also
to me doors tgn notice there's the T in
the middle because somebody took doors
chance ever take tours teacher okay so
so let me introduce myself a little bit
in case you didn't know I work for
Microsoft for about two years I'm
focused on the web technology HTML
Javascript and so on so before with
Microsoft I working with java community
for about over 10 years I was a drive
Avengers at a awesome micro system so
web tier is always my focused area so
I'm really happy to talk about how you
could leverage the skill set of like
html5 JavaScript to develop some cool
application and Windows 8
okay so um so we actually have a pretty
busy agenda we have quite a few things
that we try to achieve in this 15
minutes so first obviously a very first
thing is let's give some windows
overview right and then the focus here
in this session is as a developer as a
web developer what happens you will see
which is different from Windows 8 what
are the things you need to watch out and
what are the things you could totally
leverage and make as much as possible in
your development so we're going to first
start with that and then talk about some
of the new features the html5 css3
feature in the IE 10 and which I believe
there's another session which is a
delicate for that later on and then
we're going to talk just briefly about
what is wing jas because the power heard
about that and the development tools you
will be able to leverage and then we're
going to spend quite a bit of time to
talk about you know what is difference
between a web application versus a
Windows a application what are the
things you could totally leverage and
what are the things as a best practice
me to watch out and a few are particular
things like a touch controls at bars
contract those things more integrated
with windows 8 platform and will give
you quite a lot of resources because I
think this is a 15 minutes and I'm gonna
really tell you everything so resources
are really important for you to get
started with windows 8 development so
let's first start with our windows 8 now
you probably have seen this Bible
picture a lot of other prices but really
you know for us as a web developers I
think this is area we're really
interested right so windows 8 also you
could use any other language listed in
this diagram but for us web developers
worry no html5 will read no JavaScript
will know CSS so um there are actually
two ways currently are you would be able
to do a running on Windows 8 now people
kind of confused about these two so let
me spend just a little bit time talk
about that so if you talk about a
desktop application this is almost like
business as usual like what you do with
today's any web app
renewing IE browser right you still use
the HTML Javascript to develop
application that part and changed that's
not uh that's not something like a
really but there will be some new
features but really not something that
fundamentally to learn but the other
part perhaps is more important or more
interesting for us is here which is
leveraging the same skill set HTML CSS
JavaScript and then develop windows 8
application right so this is actually
the part we're going to concentrate on
for today's our talk and then what you
can see is you using the same skill set
same language we don't ask you to learn
another a totally new language it's the
same skills that same language you
already know and then based on that you
will be able to you make your appt talk
to you what we call the windows runtime
API which will have quite a lot of
things which will briefly cover in a
later session for example communication
data the the media graphics and some of
a device like you catch up a camera
ketchup the the video take the picture
video and printing and so on and then
again this windows 8 style application
is a native application whereas the
application developer here this is a web
application right so these are very two
different type of application so so you
probably still look a little pezzo
because this is first question people
have let's say hey I'm already familiar
with all the web application right I
know web application is basically you
know you have multiple pages it deep or
down to a web server right that's your
web app you're running in a browser
right now this is do the same but in
addition to that as a Windows 8 app
these are the things are very different
from the web application although both
of them will be using the same language
skill set to develop app but as a
windows 8 application it's actually
stored locally on the computer just like
any native application right so it's not
a web application anymore it's a native
application and then
it also has access to the underlying
platform like the real-time API and so
on all right and also among the windows
8 application you will be able to
implement the Shuar information
picturing the apps right so these are
something sort of like a different from
the traditional web application so I
want your sort of just digest a little
bit so get us some idea and then we're
going to move onto it right okay so um
the other question is you get some idea
about you know web application windows 8
application perhaps the question your
puppy will ask is why I'm sitting here
listen to you for 50 minutes what's the
motivation for me to develop a windows 8
application right that's a very
legitimate question to ask so I'm not a
marketing person I'm a technical person
but i think this perhaps we'll just give
you some idea right so you see the
number this is from the IDC the data of
march 2012 and then the data shows we
see the number of apps for mac for iOS
and the full enjoy and if you look at a
windows 7 currently there's six hundred
ninety million users using that and then
all those users are going to migrate
into Windows 8 so you think about across
to 700 millings users will need to
actually use Windows 8 application and
then the Windows 8 app store is already
open right so you could actually
checking your app and make some serious
money think about 700 million people is
going to are running on Windows 8 so a
lot of opportunities there and the other
thing is I probably wanna start with a
revenue-sharing in case you actually our
data are right a quite a bit Apple for
other OS so it started with seventy
percent meaning you get a seventy
percent and give thirty percent to to
Microsoft however the revenue model
changes a bit when your app is getting a
little bigger for example what is your
appt reached 25 k which is pretty easy
not not that
25k revenue then your revenue jumps to
eighty percent so you could get eighty
percent instead of seventy percent so if
you look at that potential there's a lot
of quite a big opportunity and quite a
big a quien versus the other OS okay so
hopefully you get some idea about why
you need to divide our windows
application hopefully that motivate you
a little bit more um I'm actually going
to start with a demo so um let's
actually take a look the windows 8 new
startup menu this would be a touch-based
screwing like this it's Windows 8 Start
up alright so you will be able to invoke
a lot of applications like Internet
Explorer everything from the windows 8
you could also if you say I'm a
developer I want to look into some of
the user through to develop the app like
what I'm doing you could go to you what
we call desktop here and then our Namir
tree
okay so this is a desktop let me just
get off the slide show mode and then
what you will see here is this is
probably a very similar like in your
windows desktop you're familiar with
right so it's basically it's kind of
like a tuning one and this is actually a
prototype from builder last year it's
using Simpson slate it's so you could
see you could have a tablet to kind of
based and also regular kind of desktops
or between one and then the difference
here is with windows 8 you don't really
have the start of a menu like what we
have before so instead you actually have
a starter like this so you could go
there which is go to the front page this
will be your Start menu so um we go back
so what you can see is a the App Store
is already open which is you could
artists if internet works fine I cannot
connect to the internet for some reason
so you could go to the store and take a
look there's a lot of implication
already there and also you could see if
you're screwing around you could see a
lot of desktop a regular application
like office suite or some other
development tools you may be interested
and it's all there you could invoke them
okay so let me actually go back to the
demo I try to show you this is um it's a
color rope and i hope the internet is
working
so it says limited so no question so
okay let me um internet is always a
challenge isn't it okay so let me see if
I could connect to the did you guys get
a better luck with HTML dev conference
it's not working okay okay so I'm in
that case then it might be a internet
issue so it's just not working so what
I'm trying to show you here is you
probably try to some OS right with kind
of rope is a pretty famous one
especially for the kids to pray and then
this cut the rope if you look at the URL
www cut the rope ie that's at your URL
it's a web application and we completely
rewritten everything with javascript
HTML 5 and you could try this URL in any
browser doesn't have to be IE and what
you will see is a version of career rope
and the based on that activated the
internet is not working but what we did
is we transform using all the JavaScript
game engineering physics engine and all
the HTML we transform into a Windows 8
app which is i uploaded here so this is
cut the rope right on windows 8 behind
that it's HTML CSS JavaScript so if we
pray with that you will see everything
is app centric every single pixel is
occupy the central space there isn't
it's not a web right you don't see any
of the web URL all those things so you
can see we could add a trip pay the game
right I don't have to hear the music I
could hear some music and then it's
touching a boat you could occur a rope
ah so not bad Oh 3000 Oh 5000 pretty
good move so I reached the very first
one and this is really cut a rope it's a
native application windows 8 but
the code is HTML Javascript and CSS
alright so
so hopefully you will get us some idea
let's go back to the desktop and
continue with our content so what does I
show you here is I just showed you a app
which is completely developed with with
HTML Javascript you could run in any
browser right and then you transform
that into Windows 8 so um the next I
want to spend just a little time talk
about you know what other features for
ie10 because I eat n will be the browser
running on Windows 8 right so you're
probably wondering up you know what kind
of new HTML CSS feature will be able to
use in ie10 so there's a lot of new
features supported ie10 so everything
when you see in peru label these are the
new features in ie10 and then old
everything else is already a variable in
ie9 so if you use 7 I&amp;amp;I that's that's
actually other all the other like
features already available so let me
just sort of like a point out a few new
features supporting AETN for example we
did a lot of work with the css3 support
so we have CSS 3 3d transform support
animation support for Xbox great support
which will actually show you more demo
if the internet is going back we
actually have a quite a better like a
cool like a demos things like CSS
position the frauds which is called the
css3 exclusions a really nice feature
you will see that multi-column is
another one you could actually just pray
with the css3 feature some of the
attributes to make a column have
multiple columns instead of just one
column and I think about a normal day
when you do that you have to use the
JavaScript to do that you have to do
Colorado layout right now with the css3
you just pray with some of the attribute
just say column count equals two instead
of one then boom become multiple column
so it's really a great support in css3
and again all the HTML CSS feature I'm
talking about here from w3c a totally
stander come from with deborah street
east and it's not
the IE or any Microsoft specific feature
right so you should be able to see all
the new feature from Deborah's receipt
so I'm also and there's a lot of file
reader HTML other later kind of like a
dragon drop form validation related
features supporter also if you look
interested in the local storage index DB
and app cache and all those are local
storage technique as the porter there
also is supported a pointers with all
different kind of input in which we'll
talk a little more later on SVG future
is also supported in IE TN as well as I
think a lot of people love WebSockets
yes WebSockets will be supported ie10 as
well as web workers which is basically
providing a sort of try to resolve
single threaded mode in the JavaScript
programming try to make her more
concurrent so you could actually invoke
multiple web worker service to sort of
resolve the concurrence in current issue
so a lot of new features are supported
in IE 10 oh one more thing I want to go
back is up all the features all the new
feature here would be supported by I
Eaton's hardware acceleration because if
you think about a look at a modern
browser you look at the competition or
whatever the performance difference you
will see it's how well you know each
browser Chris support higher activation
for different feature that's I to make
big difference and again the older
whatever web application running the
javascript is the same as you running in
Windows 8 which is check for JavaScript
engine so if you have an app running on
IE 10 and it's running fine you should
be shouldn't worry about you could just
transform these and then I'll put it on
into Windows 8 that should be working
because it's the same JavaScript engine
running underneath them okay so um what
are the new features for CSS we actually
supported in especially in Windows 8 we
used quite a lot for the 3d and 3d CSS
transform as well as we use a lot of
animations and
the transition features in the css3
layout just something we spend some time
so we talk about what we're going to use
a great layout and the frack space
layout and there's a lot of other things
people already use like a gradient text
shadow you know and then if you want to
make your content really throwing like
more fruit through interprets what we
say we could actually are using a
multi-column had nations and the
position of row so first thing I one
actually talked a little bit about is
CSS medium quarries so how many of you
actually familiar CSS media inquiries
okay quite overview so median curries is
really I think one of the coolest
feature in css3 and then it's actually I
really you know make everything is so
easy to maintainable and group into the
particular way so windows 8 actually
have four different views States and
they leverage at the median correct
concept to implement your application
because for any tablet you know that
there is a full view right and you could
actually change your orientation there's
a portrait view right as well as in
Windows 8 we will actually have another
one called snap in a few of you what
does that mean that means in Windows 8
you will be able to run in to
application at the same time right you
make one is smaller the other is a
little larger so one of them is your
main one for example I could actually
leave this snap you say this part I
could use as my to my development but
then I could use my snap you to take a
look at the weather or take a look at
the stock situation right so I Chris
when I do develop a nice dude critic a
low key if I have some stocks i need to
i do something about that so two apps
running same time and windows 8 and then
because of that so we actually defined
the smaller versions costs net view and
then the little larger version is called
few of you right so afterward you found
all of the views states then we actually
just use medium curry this is standard
css3 feature right so we use medium
curry and the way we do it is we still
called at a medium screen this is a
pretty typical in any of the css3 right
and then we are two defining different
views because it's a little easier just
to define different views so we could
have some default CSS support implement
there as well as obviously you could we
couldn't do fine tuning adjust you look
in the field for that particular view so
we actually have different views day for
full screen device poor tree snapped in
a few right so I'm you Christy the
diagram this is a waterway sort of
represents different view okay so um
you're probably wondering you say um
could I actually just take a look at
what it will look like so what i'm doing
here is i'm going to open this is called
a brand and it's a free tool it's
altering to for you to develop HTML CSS
kind of application and then what I'm
having here is I actually have it's an
app called a memory game and if every
time we could have pray with that it's
basically try to find a two-match images
but in this case what I want to show you
is this is what it look like in the
regular like a will call full view right
and then if I want to change the
orientation right I change the device to
like this let me dude so you will see
the orientation change to the vertical
view and you do see the content changes
a little bit in terms of where to put a
button the choice button and all the
layout for the images it doesn't look
different right and as well as if you
want to say I want to make a few of you
right what it will look like so all
those views it depends on what you want
to do right what will make the best
sense for different size of that so you
could you would be able to use a
different just you know solo regular you
know what we usually to do to program
different views and a different kind of
view state right so um you could use
tools to do that and also um you know
the idea here is um you may want
admitted something right sometimes you
may want to change your resolution of
your picture for example for your image
sometimes you may want to use a border
at all sometimes you want totally care
of the captions for example and then the
medial crura basically the idea here is
give you a
way to systematically implementing the
look and feel depends on the device size
device resolution for example in this
case I'm talking about our tablet you
could have right on maybe mobile device
right you could have run it on a game
console or you could run in a big-screen
TV so all those things we require to you
some nice way to are putting all the
code together depends on what you want
right pretty straightforward okay um so
next let's actually spend a little time
talk about our flex box and the grid now
for Xbox how many of you heard about a
fresh box okay quite a brick so for Xbox
for me is a very useful feature too
especially doing your layout because it
gives you very easy way to actually
align your vertical components or
horizontal components really easily okay
so we usually do is align the horizontal
components no big deal right we could
align the buttons really nicely but how
well you could add you al and vertical
components in your app totally doable
right I agree you could invite a lot of
JavaScript or whatever work on your
layout to make a really nice but then
how easy it is probably not that easy
but with fracks box are you will be very
easily to just change some of the
parameter to make it work okay so um
grid is another one so great what we
have here is it great to just like a
table right we're familiar with table
right so every single page could be
ready if you want to really do it you
could always sort of like compose as a
grid right and then you could actually
change the matrix size you could have
changed the sale size right but I deal
here is a grid it's based on grid so
layout it could always use a grid to do
so with the css3 you have a quite a few
like a nice attribute you could pray
with the SS grid for example or you
could call the spray the grid right you
could are defining the grid columns how
many columns you want how many grid ro
rose you want and you could also
defining the size for each of the
columns as well as each of the rows
right using fixed pixel size as well as
fractional right Fred
like a relative whatever space left I
want I want to take that bit and then
you could also defining if I have like a
two by two matrix like and what I have
here I could also put the content each
it to each individual cell right I could
use it's like a matrix but instead of
stuff with 00 it's always from 11 to 1
12 and 22 right so for each of them you
could say for this greater column 2 and
the rope 2 which is here this is what I
want to have right so we could have
video content into it right okay so it's
at your very straight forward to really
use a grid and then so now that crucial
thing is if the internet is back so um
again this is probably something I did
it a win the internets to hear this is
what we call a test drive so if you want
to take a look at the new of html5
features or just ESS feature it's called
IE test drop just just I just use that
keyword are you test drive you go there
you will see a list of what we call demo
a specific features specific kind of
demo so each of those demo will actually
show you how to implement a particular
feature in the html5 and css3 so for
example if I'm interested this is you
can see a lot of like html5 related demo
as well as a graphical use Kimber's SVG
you know all those things video
manipulation and so on and then you
could also see some browser specific
okay so um one of the demo I want to
show you is I want your own it I want to
show you how we could actually play with
some of the css3 feature so let's add
you take a look the fraks box layout so
um what you can see is it's basically
it's a little like a toolkit right so
you would be able to pray with this
little sliding things to choose
different parameter for your css3 and
all your code will be generated here and
all the look and feel will be on the
other side so you could use that to take
a look for example I have one two three
this is the Flex box so I'm doing a
vertical kind alignment but
could also change the fraks a line kind
of perimeter to put liking and different
parameters center and then stretch USC
actually are your components will be
actually aligned with different things
right that's Wednesday the other thing
is you could actually pray with the
direction so vertically I have one two
three how about I want to change the
order of these three components I could
have the fraks direction as ro reverse
this is reversible right so you actually
have a reverse three two one and you
could also actually do it in your
vertical which is just as simple that
put a things called a column into this
practice direction and your components
would become vertical and then you could
also change the order to like a column
reverse to have different order so isn't
that cool yeah pretty cool to change the
CSS and then we could also have some of
the simple kind of frags box layout so
you could actually like this layout you
could leverage then I go here to see
whatever the setting yes and then again
you could actually change from the
smaller setting as well as into a larger
setting right all those things will
change the size accordingly so if we
change it to a smaller setting such a
tutor little manual like this and then
if I go to a item and you will see like
for example if I mentioned in box 3 I
could actually change it to something
like instead of 0 I'm gonna change it to
one so box 3 is going to have a
different fraction umber color one and
then the USC this particular component
is automatically take whatever the space
left without you to calculating you know
how much I have to sort expand just by
changing some of the parameter
everything will lay out really nicely
all right so this is the fraks box and
then again you know feel free to play
with that it's online and you could
actually change all the parameters here
and to get a best to kind of layout you
want and what I do is I usually are
using a slide bar to getting the
components and just simply copy and
paste the code here into my css3 isn't
that easy
okay so next I want to try is I want to
show you something on the grid okay
let's try it again with a grid alright
cool Verizon's walking alright so very
good so I'm so great it's the same story
right so we actually have great column
for different column different rows
which you could actually play with them
right to so when you pray with that you
could address the different fixer size
as well as a relative size to do that
and you could pray with the particular
grid height and width you could play
with individual laker you could add a
particular upgrade item oh you could
actually go with number nine three
columns this is a little nice kind of a
different layout for the grid as well as
some more interesting greater to to pray
with that and you could have pray with
very complex grid and go back to the
beginning and you will see older what is
the parameter to create a such a grid
and then you could feel in content a
really nice thing as well as adjusting
any of the size here to make it more
interesting or more appropriate for you
for your particular application right so
again go to I test drive to take a look
now the other nice feature I want to see
this let's see if it's the hook kick
it's called a protein throats this is
actually using css3 exclusions or the
position of row and then looks like it's
a graduate sort of what I slightly
getting there it's just wait okay cool
so this is actually a project I did
probably a few years ago and that kind
of fair the project so the idea here is
they wanted me to develop a kind of like
a company logo in the middle and then
embedded in the text and then do
something like this isn't that cool and
then still get a real-time performance
so it is working few years ago my
projects working but the performance is
not that great so at that time I use I
don't know HTML CSS right so that time I
just use a javascript so it's not really
that great
then oops interesting let me actually
just uh internet is back that's why can
a rope is the life now so so I'm
actually you could actually play with a
simple layout like this multiple layout
which you have a multiple layout great
layout and it doesn't matter what can
lay out you have added background as a
text this is called position of road
kind of feature you could pray where the
CSS feature it's called css3 exclusions
and then you could do something really
cool as cool as this so I this is
something if you want to do some
animation if you have to have some nice
to logo or some simple image you want to
be and it's touch-based or I could do
all those things you could use position
fro to do that so the take here is you
know I'm just thinking I overlook the
css3 maybe a year two years ago because
i'm thinking i'm i'm a developer right
I'm thinking I'm more like sort of
interested in to the JavaScript but I
trade css3 has big big progress a lot of
things css3 feature is implemented by
very professional high performance team
right so why not just Larry the result
they already have they already
implemented nice this feature feature
when I just use them instead of
implementing your own right all those
all those things I show here definitely
could use any other way to do that but
why not just use the easy way right so
that's sort of like a the takeaway I
want you to so keep in mind okay so um
let's not you go back um and talk just a
little more about winch is so windows
Jas is basically try to help you to have
a better integration with windows 8 and
also it will provide you some of the
easy API for you to access for example
we talked about how to do the namespace
write JavaScript think about namespace
today how do we resolve the namespace
issue in JavaScript right there's a lot
of things like a synchronized way to do
things called promise pattern app model
navigation data binding little control
utility and so on all those things is
implemented in Wayne Jas so in addition
to old nice HTML CSS you're using today
it's totally fine but if you want to
take some advantage
make your life little easier to
integrate with windows 8 perhaps you do
wonder look into which is just a little
bit okay so i'm i'm actually going to
sort of change it a little bit because
i'm not going to focus on how to show
you all the wind jsapi that's another
main focus but whatever show you is
first of all you know the development to
for windows 8 is free right so if you go
to this Billy windows 8 download you
should be able to get a windows 8 4 and
then you should get a extra called
express version so for windows 8
development express version is a free
version so visual studio 2012 this is a
version to develop windows 8 application
and then if you're interested in
authoring to write so just like what I
show you in the different layout try doc
portray don't then you could use brand
brand is embedded in the visual studio
so you can open a project in the visual
studio and then break it could have just
open the HTML in brand brand is HTML CSS
3 all serving to so you could use that
to to do a lot of things and what's so
cool about brand is you may be
interesting is it could also generate a
dynamic content from JavaScript and it
could also play with the JavaScript
testing so you could actually go into
what we call the interactive mode so
it's not just the regular static
authoring to you could see how things
change with the JavaScript you could see
a lot of dynamic content as well so if
you get a chance feel free to take a
look again this is a download link pay
attention is case sensitive Billy link
is kids tends to do all right so um and
then it's yours to keep it's all free
okay so um now I want to actually change
the gear a little bit I want to actually
i'll show you a html5 app let me
actually first to clean up the app a
little bit i mean this is a brand so i'm
gonna I don't need it for this demo I'm
going to clean up so what I'm having
here is I actually have an appt positive
ever developing HTML and CSS and this is
something i did of like a year ago when
i first started with HTML kind of video
tag I just thought it's kind of fun to
do that so here's what i do i will
briefly go over that
I have a video html5 video in order to
make it across different browsers so I
keep the video in to format when it's
mp4 where is web am so that you will be
able to running all major browsers right
so and i'm using just the video tag
html5 video tag and make an auto play
and then in this case i'm at you pray
with the mouse out to mouse over so when
the mouse at over the video are sorry
mouse over the video this video will
keep on playing when the mouse will be
leaving the video area then this video
was stopped praying this is sort of like
my control right and then on top of that
i would just say why not just using some
campers so I'd create a canvas what I
want to do is I want to actually adding
some refraction into this video so what
I do is I go to here and then just pray
with grab of the video tag getting the
cameras contact and then I'll creative
refraction so here with this I use a
scale 1 2-1 to flip the video to create
a kind of like a refraction effect and
then I pray with a gradient so you could
use CSS so you could use JavaScript to
make the gradient work and adding
different color from different color
sort of like a range and also i
implement some event which is little
like animation to sort of like a setup
the draw the video interval in this case
is i'm going to just use a drawer image
even though it's called your image it's
the same thing for image as well as for
video so you could put your video put
your particular how big your video is
going to be and then you could actually
are also doing something called a few
rectangle to create a sum over called
fading kind of effect into it right so
and then this is 60 milliseconds that's
the interval is set up so this is
basically the implementation for me to
create a refraction and then last not
least is you know i haven't tried any
CSS yet right so for demonstration
purpose i keep everything CSS javascript
HTML into the single file so what I do
is I actually use a fun face I want to
use some non-traditional kind of what we
call the good dog
found was found right you probably hear
about a wolf phone rings the accessory
right it's a very rich set of phones
it's not just a sort of traditional what
you see it you could use all kind of
really interesting phones you could get
over the web to make your application
more more useful and in the past those
war phones usually people have to
generate admit you to do that but now
you don't have to do that those are true
phones that you couldn't lavage them and
then in this one I set up a background
with some kind of color right which is
due to hear and I set up some title with
that and here is something I want your
pay attention is I actually pray with
the hover kind of effect so I have a
video I have a hover effect I pray with
a box shadow to create some shadow as
well as I also play with something we
will call the border radius and the
transition so with the hover I have the
shadow I have the border radius prying
to that as well as a transition into it
so um and then you could actually see
what it look like alright so this is a
basically around 100 you know less than
hundred lines of code everything is here
so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
write it in a browser so notice that
this is a browser application so what
you see here is it's a video playing
with it's a refraction and then when I
actually come over to have it over where
we see some box-shadow kind of effect
right and show some transition and so on
and I'm gonna get out like I said it was
stopped right right get it on we're
praying there right in the same thing
since I treat somebody noticed i
actually have a canvas hover kind of
effect also in my CSS so if i hovered
over two cameras so the cameras area
which is the reflection area we also
apply in the CSS if fat down to it right
even though all those data is a
reflection so could anybody tell me why
the video is not playing anymore exactly
because i'm outside the region right
this is the woman videos praying this is
outside of video so it's not pray right
pretty cool right
alright so very simple no this is a web
application this html5 web application
right it's a URL here so what do you if
I do something um do something not very
nice but let's try it I saw some
experiment so i say i'm going to
actually develop a project and then this
time is going to be I have a different
temperate it's a brand application for
windows 8 and you christy windows 8 you
could use JavaScript you could use em oh
you could use some other different sort
of like a language to do that so in this
case I'm your stay with JavaScript so
you can have a different layout of Star
Wars like a grid layout split layout fix
the layout as well as a navigational
kind of layout but in this case I'm
going to keep things very simple just
have a brand layout so with a brand
basically means nothing's there except
they don't you know just a brand kind of
like a background so now what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna actually go to the
project which I have that a video
make it a little bigger or smaller
first let me a tree figure out where is
the particular um ok know where it is ok
let me actually go to that a web project
I create it um and then go to my here so
these are all the video resource the
project I just show you the default like
a default file everything right so I'm
gonna be really brave here I'm gonna
actually grab the hosting and then copy
it over there right and then it says all
maybe some default thing you want to
replace yes one replace it ok now I just
drag it all the web content I did right
brain over to a Windows 8 MPD project
right let's see if it's gonna work so I
Creek a 5 function key which is when the
project wow it looks like it's working
even the touch is working right oh the
shadow all the transition and then when
i leave it out stop praying and then all
the refraction is also working pretty
cool right I didn't really change
anything it's the same web code i used i
showed you before right and now I
couldn't do something like this but is
it a good windows 8 application yet so
anybody say yes no it is a windows 8
application right very good ok so
obviously you know this is a what we
call single page application which is a
single kind of web page this is probably
a will be the most straightforward way
to transform into the windows 8
application right so it's there it's
running but it may not be that great yet
right so next I want to actually spend a
little bit of time to let me I just stop
debugging and go back to the slide and
we will add your continued from there so
very good very good point to sort of our
continued with the web and Windows 8 so
we just show you something really easy
use it's a web application and then just
sort of drag it and needing to MPD
Windows 8 app you couldn't make her work
right what I want to share with you is
all the web skill set is using you could
also use a web search space web services
you're running like what you're doing
the past and you can also use trickery
yes jQuery is supported you could use
that the things may not be really you
know looking out data well is is the
local context versus the web context so
what we do here is we're also doing
everything in a web context which is
totally fine you could use iframe
everything to do that but because of
that if you want to access the wing jas
we'll talk about those nice feature
before then you wouldn't be able to do
that so there's a lot of like the wind
us all those things you wouldn't be able
to access that so in a way when you do
your web application you need to watch
out if it's absolutely for you to use I
frame that's one thing second thing is
you want to make sure once you is I
frame then you cannot access some of the
green dress library okay so um I think I
need to wrap up but i will share the
slide with you later on in my blog and
this is the just one page to show you
how you could actually are getting all
the difference between the web
application and windows 8 and if you
have my size you have all the link and
then what I want to actually I'm sure
your next is I'm going to actually do a
fast forward so that you will actually
see what are the things you need to do
so afterwards because I don't really
have time sinica I'm running out of time
so
yes afterwards we need to add is you
need to add things like a best practice
for example use the name space so that
your javascript master function could be
used anywhere because in javascript is
always global right so you could use
namespace to defy or unique way and
getting the scope of JavaScript correct
and then adding the the sort of like a
touch a lot of times if you using a nice
JavaScript whatever with web application
touch is there but then with a nice
windows 8 and I could point the touch
which actually I will introduce my
colleague at jeff has a session and
touch how to implement that and then you
probably want to implement something
called a bar and then for example if we
go to this is ie version right and then
you could add your tickle these are your
eyeball right this is the word our bar
you could do and then these are what we
call the trombone so you could do I want
to share this application with a male 2
with some people to or some other simple
to right and then you could also use the
search button right to search where is
this IE right so all those things you
probably need to add into battle
particular video refraction and then
that will make it a good Windows 8 app
ok so I'm I won't just cut it short to
the resource page so again use the link
give it to you so you could be able to
download windows 8 and under tools and
you could also look at some of the
things like the app generation to get a
30 days of free consultation and thank
you very much
