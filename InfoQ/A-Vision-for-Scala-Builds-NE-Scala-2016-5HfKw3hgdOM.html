talk about a build tool and I sorry
originally I thought I'd just have a
vision of what I think how things should
go but turns out I was kind of made
faster progress and I then I thought so
I actually have a better to show and to
like yeah demo how I think would be nice
to do builds and when I am young Chris
invoked i work at x today I we magically
schedule meetings with artificial
intelligence and given know me from my
work on slick and my years in Martin's
lab and the compostable record stuff I
did and my involved in the forklift and
maven search maybe and so what's the
goal here with the build tool I develop
open source libraries I'm working on
different projects at work and well
builds are important for me and it's
kind of it feels like hassle often to
just write those bills so I want
something nice to replace this
especially now a textured AI where we
have 25 engineers a lot of data
scientists they they just experiment a
lot they read a lot of a small project
that we want to break up our built into
smaller things to make it more
maintainable and even though this is
like a side project in my free time
eventually would be nice to use it there
as well and it's I'm not like and first
of all I would like to target open
source and smaller projects and then see
how where things go with this and right
so here's what I think is a cbt is which
is it's made out of few and simple
building blocks it's easy to use it's
fast it's a dramatic Scala because you
write your goals in Scala it's flexible
so it's simple but at the same time not
restrictive it's still flexible and a
very important feature of it is that
builds are compositional and I'll get
into that again and also which was also
very important to me the code is
actually easy and everybody who has very
basic Scala understanding this room will
be able to understand the complete code
base and will not take a long time for
this actually so it should be easy to
contribute their other reasons for this
so what are the building looks the most
important one is that you can compose
bills you can write a small
build have another bill depend on this
and this is a very fundamental concept
which we built it derive a lot of
functionality from then there is a
scholar like a library written in Scala
that has all the basic features that you
would need like for putting stuff in a
jar file and publishing it to maven at
all that that's just a library and build
scripts to build scripts however are
written for several they're written in
Scala Scala code and the default way how
CVT does it is their classes so what
what usually will call tasks and builds
are the members of this class the
methods you can call them and that's how
you run tests and they can depend on
each other that's it and configuration
happens through inheritance so you can
inherit the class inherit from the class
and then override certain things to kind
of hook in however this is a very
shallow layer on top of this library so
you can use all the functionality
without this class stuff if you want to
it's just a one way to configure your
built or the kind of suggested way also
I i made sure at least as far as i got
to it that this that the interface of
cbt actually works well without the
command line tool so for example compile
would return the path to the class files
or class path will return the extra
class path which you can pass on to java
version like that whoever has been
around the SBT 0 at seven era may
recognize the way to configure builds
using classes so this stuff is actually
similar I didn't realize that until a
week ago when I kind of talked to martin
he was like hey look at that as old
stuff went and turned out they made a
lot of similar design decisions with
this configuration stuff and different
ones in other areas so how how do I get
it fast so I'll talk a little bit
fearing first minute let's show the tool
it runs it keeps the JVM running by a
nail gun it caches dependencies first of
all from downloading them it comes with
its own resolver for maven catch them a
disk and doesn't resolve them again when
it has them already and it does catch
the class loaders for those things in
memory so whenever when you keep running
it again the
even the class the the jars for your own
project will be resident memory that
makes a lot of difference in terms of
runtime there's ink then commit a
compiler which also has a has an
overhead so it kind of guards against
running it too often it does support
concurrency for for speeding up things
in parallel and I used a different
library for triggering automatic
rebuilds like when you loop that's
pretty fast and OS x and y is it easy to
understand first of all because it's
very focused it like I really want to
keep it down to the small parts that
really make up a build tool and not kind
of diverged from this path that could be
done separately in its libraries you can
plug them together it's just Scala code
right it's tiny it is less than a
thousand five hundred lines of code with
all the functionality it has it's easy
code that beginners can understand and
actually and that's it was this was more
like the next point was more like a
guilty pleasure first but it turned out
to be really useful it actually starts
from source so you download you clone
the github repository and then you run a
bash script which the first download
scholar jars uses those to compile the
first part of CBT which includes the
maven resolver and all that use then
runs this to download additional
dependencies then use that which
includes think to compile the rest and
then it's basically ready to go and it
also detects changes in its own source
when you use it so you can just keep
changing it and it will automatically
recompile itself before we come out your
project and these are the feature
support right now compiling running
having tests generating scala pecking
pecking jars uploading them to sonatype
downloading jars from maven repeating
compiling on file changes and composing
builds and missing that the handful of
superficial things missing like
perfectly different resolvers and cross
scala versions and scott JS support and
kind of jumped into the rep well even
that's not actually true there's a way
to do that and so they would probably be
a couple of refinement needed even until
a larger audience even can use it for
like them simple bowls if they want
these features but it should be simple
to get in and there are some rough edges
because I'm the only user right now so
things and yeah
it's only been tested in OS X by me like
I know two guys tried it on Windows and
Linux and it did work apparently but I
don't know and and the output the
logging and stuff needs to be improved
to kind of be nice or visible and
usability but it's it's okay and alright
let's get to it so we are in a directory
with nothing in there but I have a file
prepared here so the very the most
simple cbt built you can have is you
don't write any build files you just
dump a scholar file so we save the
skeleton out which appears here and what
we can do now is just cbt compile and
now yeah parently i changed cbt since
last time could we compiled itself it
kind of starts on sale restores nail gun
then to compile this will turn the
classpath actually this and yeah if you
run it again will be very quick that's
like so it's really it's like about half
a second and that's straight from the
from your own shell it doesn't need its
own shell or something for that which
which makes it nicely interoperable and
of start time and all that okay and
right so right oh there's a little bit
of convention in the tool not a lot
because I think if there's a lot of
convention if to learn a lot of things
in the can seem very magical in the
beginning but little bit of convention
can help to make things easier and one
of the conventions was source files on
the main directory and under / source in
any kind of sub folder there another
convention is if there is a class called
main this will be the main class if you
do CVT run it will run this glass and
okay yet another convention is if
there's a folder test and in this folder
test let's cut this out and create a new
main file here there is a object main in
the tests if you run tests in your main
project it will basically treat the test
folder as a build loaded and run the run
method in there which makes a very
quickly
that a framework adjust speed ups and
testing a main method and obviously this
needs to include the main sources right
and so you can do something like right
so this is the main surface in the main
build this is the test build so it that
that's how that works and right so okay
this is like the default bills that are
very interesting that's added extra bill
to our project and one more convention
there if there's a folder build in which
you put any kind of scholar files I used
to call them build that scholar but and
this will be treated as the scholar
files for your build and in general it's
already composition in the sense that
the test folder the main folder in the
build folder they are all free built
with exactly the same rules in each
three of them the same rules yeah hold
which means you could actually write
tests for your build script in your
build folder or you could have a built
for your test file or you can ever built
for a build file just because of this
composition and it's easy to do so okay
so now let's look at how an actual cbt
build script looks like when you run
cbts compile and CVT will check if
there's a built folder and then in there
run a default build but because it's
going into the build folder it doesn't
run the standard default build it runs a
slight variant of it which is one scroll
to build build which well builds your
build script basically so and one of the
things that it does it gives it the
dependency on cbt so you can access cbt
internals within your build script yes
so I can do stuff like import cbt right
underscore and then which is what I
would normally do and then class build
that's another convention so if there is
a folder built in their class files in
there it will
check for a class called build and
that's your script that that's the one
it will run and it expects a particular
format which is it takes a value of type
context and pass it on to whatever build
you extend from in this case I'll extend
from the basic build there are a handful
of different variants of these bills you
can extend there is the basic build that
is which doesn't allow you to package
your publish stuff there's a package
build which requires to give more
information like the artifact name and
version in that and once it has that it
allows you to package stuff into a jar
then there's another one which is the
published build which requires even more
information for the pom file and all
that and this basically allows you to
publish stuff too so no time but right
now we don't need that so we just let's
say we just want some dependencies right
dependencies equals super dot
dependencies and right let's what do we
do oh right to this let's do this yep
and so I I just adopted the same syntax
here s SBT because a lot of people
publish their dependency descriptions
this format in this format so you can
have the same dsl here so now I'm
depending on the library and in my mind
code I can now go ahead let's make a
main thing again and I'll main code I
can go ahead again and actually rich in
the main that's the main app I can now
import
something from this library in this case
I will import this method which allows
us to and show basically what scholar
things an expression is after type
checking it and right over I
dependencies all right right right so
that's the output that shows okay here
is that there's this famous kingdom from
it all that stuff but basically we just
added dependency to our build and
because this folder build which is a
very small but you can see here is a
built itself you can do the same thing
it's light and he has a similar feature
right we can add a build file for a
built and then you can have dependency
which you pull into your build but it's
just standard scholar code so usually if
you would create like something like
plugins there will be there will be
traits which your mix into this build
which you pull in as a just normal
dependency and you just mix it in and in
fact it comes with some trades already
there's like 14 scholar test where you
just mix it in and then you're built
becomes a scholar test build that is
pre-configured to run scholar test and
right so what else would I want to show
right and you've seen how oh okay let's
let's actually give the test a build
file as well so now in the test folder
we create a build folder and in the
build folder we create a build Scala and
I'll just copy this over and by default
it would look like this with test that's
basically the default that CBT uses in
itself but let's not do that lets me
write this by hand just to see how how
this would look like because the way I
mean the test project it's a known
project but it depends on the other one
right needs to compile the
first and use the class pass off the
outer one in order to run the test
against it but you can just do this by
hand and that's exactly what this test
trade does so you can have a so-called
build dependency and see where you say
well so project directory is a member of
this basic build which just gives you
the directory this build is responsible
for so in this case it would be the
directory test and from there we want to
go one directory up which is the main
stuff and so now we depend on the main
stuff and in fact you can even do this
where where you get actually I think
it's be build this would give you an
extra handle to the build object so you
can interface you can interoperate with
it call methods on it if you want to do
that but in this case we just depend on
it which means if compiled first and
thick we inherit the classpath and right
so and this is a way how you can
basically assemble projects together
right you can you have a handle to a
different build and you can kind of
create structures how you want you can
do multi projects built with it you can
have D structure stuff into different
projects and have one that's contained
and then the other one depend on it
right did we do wait to try that we
didn't did we so in that we need to run
tests so that it changes into the test
folder and does run there then which oh
we didn't configure it that to do
anything so it shouldn't do anything I
think right so in we 12 what do you want
to do yeah I change should do something
right that's just here
yes it does um right okay and few other
things there's cbt admin which among
other things has this so admin is like
it doesn't call you build it just does
it's a conditional functionality one of
the things is resolved you can get just
give it a dependency and it will resolve
it and return the classpath which
basically allows you to quickly Scarl
our dash CP and using fish shell so I
have these round parentheses to kind of
execute this command now I can import
you know I don't have this year so the
account have access to the resolver to
just resolve stuff and give you the cast
path and oh one thing I also didn't show
them custom custom tasks or I mean their
methods right and basically what you
would see BTW allows you is to call to
call methods on your build object from
the from the command line and it can
also list them so the the default if you
just type cbt you can just get a help
thing this is the method through which I
just added to the build and these are
just all the ones that are kind of
provided for example the provided ones
are scholar version and I try to use
similar terminology to sbtb just because
to keep it familiar where where it made
sense but I can also just call fool and
then it returns this so that's that
right yeah and I can do stuff like cbt
class path where I do java dash cpe in a
knee
yeah sorry now it's official if not bash
did I remove this stuff oh yeah this
yeah so you kind of interrupted it with
a command-line interface which is kind
of nice and I guess that's what I wanted
to show let's get back to some slides so
to get started there's a readme file I
mean it's it's it's a quick intro I rode
like a quick getting started it might
even be outdated by now after the
changes in the last days but kind of
should get you started and basically one
fundamental philosophy which drove a CVT
is builds aren't special they are just
code they're just another software
problem you want to solve so just write
software and do it the same way like you
always do it and I mean if you need
particularly heavy configuration then
inheritance is a way is one thing that
allows you to do that so let's in this
case use inheritance and the
dependencies of cbt itself is zinc
obviously Scala barbary watch service
which is the thing that allows oh I
didn't show you that I do that now out
inch there are two things I didn't show
you so cbt first of all loop compile and
out H this dash D log allows you to give
some outputs on logging so these are the
so I'm Luke compiling now it's like the
tilde thing in SBT and and these are the
paths that symmetry watches as you can
see well it's the demo it's actually the
build scripts of the demo so if you make
changes near build scripts it will also
loop it's the sources of your project
it's these three things which is cbt
itself so you can change the build tool
itself and it keeps looping over it and
improving so you can kind of keep ya so
let's just change something that's
change I don't know let's change this to
what did we loop let's loop run to
selection actually work and let's see so
let's change this to
some random stuff and let's see what
happens where did it print it sorry
right but didn't I change it to it
changed oh I did a run test oh I have to
write oh yeah fo guys I have to do phool
right and let's do it something with s
and the start there we go she runs it
twice that's right I guess that's a bug
right Oh another thing just for fun and
so let's go to actually into cbt itself
and now i'm going to kill the Maven cash
so now if i do anything like cbt run it
will need to redownload all the
dependencies and let's log the resolver
so we can see how it just downloads all
the stuff we'll get back to this in a
second and write it currently it
currently depends on on eminent offices
well even though it's very very little
time thinking about just getting a
reference dependency and in lining this
or like doing something similar so I
wrote a custom maven resolver so just
because it turned out easier than I
thought it was like 30 lines or
something for something that doesn't
cover the complete maven spec but I yet
have to see it to fail I'm sure there
are things out there where it will fail
I heard from Alexander who develops
course here that even currently which
does a lot more still fails and I think
some paduk dependencies or something but
I I do it's not implemented right now
but I do support I had it implemented
but I kind of fell out to kind of
support to swap in course here which
basically would mean you use the simple
dependency manager to download course a
which works i tried that and then you
can use course here to resolve whatever
else you need which didn't work with the
simple one and
right oh by the way file watching so
Java has its own what sure to watch
files however on OS X for some reason
they didn't implement native support for
the hooks in the operating system
instead they pull every like I think
four seconds which is kind of a bit slow
so there's this other project barbary
watch service which basically just
implemented that for OS X and I guess
use the native Java thing on the other
systems right you can parallely execute
tasks it's like opt-in there's a method
which just you can give it the task and
you can run in parallel and of course
that requires hear from you because you
do like file system like I all or
something if you like right in the same
stuff then it will screw stuff up there
is however a feature built in a tiny
caching thing which allows you to wrap a
task into a caching like basically a
caching wrapper which is thread-safe and
allow its kind of if multiple all to
task at once which both depend the same
task you can kind of guard them from
from kind of screwing that up if you
know that it's will be a problem is what
we catch there below libro and once also
you can use it for expensive stuff built
compositions are really this is like
something like this is what builds look
like right you have all these kind of
little projects which you can Tony does
each other and it's not uncommon that
people write large build files for the
whole thing and then at some point is
kind of get some unhandy and then then
you kind of break it up but then how
people work is that they publish
snapshots to like a local artifactory
and then defined of cumbersome so I
really want something where you can
break it up and can't publish everything
independently if you want to but usually
the way you work and develop is that you
have everything kind of together and
build dependencies on each other and
then actually have an or four
dependencies where you can say either
use the file system if it's there or
else use a maven dependency like a
Combinator on on bills right now and
this whole dependency stuff like build
composition as you love dependent build
multi-project bills having tests as
nothing special just the dependent
projects having builds up builds and
wherever you need like a B 4 B and
actually it's even unified with
dependencies so most of the code between
that most of the code of a maven
dependency
a built as actually shared between the
two and because it's contended the same
thing right provide something before you
can do something this is like the kind
of concept that underlies all this stuff
current limitations and concurrent
builds so basically what I do support
scorecard tasks within one build of the
kind of lots of bills what I don't
support right now is and running several
bills concurrently i do do parallel
downloads I don't do parallel builds
because with a parallel builds you would
kind of need to make sure that you can
have compile them in the right order
which I just didn't implement yet which
you should be able to implement but you
have to be more careful that you
actually cash correctly so every kind of
build exists only once and you but so
but it shouldn't shouldn't be conceptual
problem with my model and write another
problem with the model is and there's I
think we need some solution for that so
are you cbt use inheritance right
inheritance a static so you wire it all
together and then it is wired and let's
say yeah so how would you do it if you
want to provide the scholar version from
the command line if it's wired in this
object like the build once it's running
it's like instantiated how can it swap
out its own version number and the other
thing is something like let's say you
have one task publish and one task
publish signed or 11 task published nap
short and when you have a point to
publish a snapshot you want to swap out
the lower appendages up to the version
number but it's kind of already wired
right so the multiple ways one is we
could just make the glasses mutable
which like the members which is probably
not a nice thing if I'm not mistaken it
is up roughly how cbt does it right it
isn't it sort of mutable like I mean
it's a staid Monette but its its it has
effects on the rest or maybe I'm just
mistaken and the other thing is you
could hard code the use cases that are
at hand differently for example take the
version number as an argument to the
class or put it in the context rather
than make it a member depends on how far
we get with this and
sure another thing is use code
generation in some way to basically
generate subclasses for the property
that you give by the command line cbt
could do that it could generate a
subclass of this build thing which
overrides I mean it's a build tool after
all it can it has access to a compiler
it can generate code and compile it at
build time right and another way would
be what I would imagine would will be
acting nice kind of Jim create a
something that's independent that's kind
of reusable independent of the bill tool
which is which would basically allow you
at run time to mix in stuff so let's
imagine this where in the basic build
which is the base class and then we have
published snapshot which needs a
reconfigured build where the version
number is replaced and then I could say
this mix in and then give it something
of the same type that I want to mix in
and it will generate the code for that
so well that's that soon it's it becomes
it becomes interesting with stuff like a
pending snapshot automatically or or
managing version numbers so something
we're still let's room for for figuring
stuff out and oh and this even though it
would require like code generation and
reflection and all that it's all that
build time right so if something breaks
it breaks it built I'm not it right how
to contribute so it's distributed a
source right when you use it you have
the source right there when you change
it even applies immediately so it's very
easy to end of change stuff there's a
very quick developer guide which gives
an overview over their folders which I
can actually do here as an unconference
session or maybe even right after in the
break or something and the club if the
code is clean and easy then there's some
little superficial craft which is
accumulated in the last two days while I
was like fixing staying things but it's
it doesn't like the I'm actually very
happy with the overall structure and
architecture and all that and write it
rebuilds itself and extensions are just
try to put them in libraries on my even
or something or put them in builds you
depend on which your builds can depend
on right to build talk to them self and
source code later and it would be nice
to right now all bills need the same
need to use the same cbt version you
could imagine that if you want to drop
in Scala test or something as a
dependency and scour test would build
with CBT probably it doesn't use exactly
the same cbt version like you do so you
would need to kind of bridge
that shouldn't be too hard actually
won't need to define an interface which
really means like I compile yourself
before me that is actually that works
across CVT versions they can talk to
each other yeah concurrent bills cross
the integration actually caching the
dependency class loaders a duel now and
which gives a lot of speed up which
actually if I wouldn't catch the
dependencies the class loaders for the
dependencies of your own project I add
minimum a second to the response time in
a second versus half a second is a big
difference unlike interactive news right
I have some of the somewhat of a
surprise feature for scalloway 16 2016
which I have sort of implemented but not
integrated which is and get up dependses
would be nice SPT interop would be nice
so you could use a SBT build sa built
dependency in your main thing which
would really if we have that then it
really enables this to kind of
interoperate in the sky lake ecosystem
right in with the existing stuff so this
here's a question that everybody asks
what does it actually mean something up
for me the sea comes from compositional
but there are some of the some of these
things that people suggest it because
usually people were like what does it
mean is it X and well that's complex
build tool there's cool built tool
there's cbt build tool because it's
recursive this compulsive Oh build tool
which is kind of funny because it's
impossible was like my little plan last
year at scala days for composition
possible when it preempted the records
what I actually got the most was Chris
build tool which so I think I'll
actually go with that for now however
here's here's an idea I had so if we
manage that if this gets traction and we
managed to kind of make it a community
thing let's in one year at any scholar
rename it to community build tool with
that and our special offer any scholar
I'll make your cbt builds work if
and what's next well this is beta let's
go back hunting please report lots of
issues and submit PRS and let's get this
stuff Sala dental scala days and what
also is missing is this so now it's on
github and that's it miles yes
sounds sounds great I'd love that yep I
mean it should be like each of the
projects created a CVT build and we have
some kind of master project which just
depends on them right and that's it yeah
that's it well no sorry one so the
question miles asked us for the camera
type level is kind of looking for some
bill tool that kind of compels all of
their projects together and what idea
what to kind of potentially build it on
this video and cbt sorry wrong yes
right so that nothing so so the question
was because of the limitation with
inheritance could you just basically use
the state monett instead and use that to
compose the different steps and call out
to the library right I mean you totally
should be able to do that it's just a
library right it's and you just need to
build a new layer on top of this library
and I mean if you if we go to the source
code of no wait cbt itself and we look
into the distance call default build
still should we call basic build this is
really how it looks like right you have
tests which called out to lip test you
have run which called out to run if main
founded you have compile which called
out the lib compiled and just takes all
the stuff that has been assembled in
this class and that's some heck I just
did right this is probably something
that I should put in the library as well
yeah right more questions yes all we
need to be done one more okay
so I I don't know the exact details of
that design decisions I suppose that one
of the reasons was this thing that
inheritance is fixed and it's harder to
reconfigure at runtime even though I
think it's still fine if you provide a
basic building block that's just used by
the user we're not where the user can't
do anything wrong to basically extend at
runtime at build time brand time right
and I suppose that's it but also I think
SPT even zero at seven had a handful of
concepts which are all subsumed by the
whole built dependency concept or
two-hole do this before this concept so
maybe there was some complication down
this road which actually doesn't exist
in see I'm not sure yeah whew nail gun
so nail gun is a library that just keeps
the JVM running and you can connect to
it over over a service and then start
stuff in this ok I think we're we're
through i'm happy to give a break now or
if people want to see the XO code of the
tool in the break or something i'm happy
to show that it's not going to take long
actually ok thank you everyone
