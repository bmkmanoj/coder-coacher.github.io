starbucks know me Hamilton apparently
this delicious Frappuccino you can
follow me at H Kalin a desperate for
attention so please follow me you guys
probably best know me for SAS the CSS
language I'm the original creator of it
but most of the work is due to these
guys so I just always like to come
credit cuz these guys Rock Nathan who's
worked on the core library forever and a
half and Chris who's actually speaking
at five-thirty the inventor of compass
and a big contributor awesome guys who
made sass amazing but I'm not here to
talk about SAS today I'm gonna actually
tell you about the six rules of mobile
design yeah it's what I've actually been
doing for the last two years is all been
kind of mobile stuff I've been writing
as much CSS as I could be and I've been
working at a company called move web
we're launching soon so you've probably
never heard of us but hopefully you will
soon basically what we do is we take
this and make it into this and we do
this for an awful lot of very very large
companies typically the ones with the
hardest things to like the hardest sites
to build and we kind of have like where
technology company we make it easy to
mobilize sites so how did I get into
that apparently two slides of that I
actually got started doing mobile at the
wikimedia foundation uh yes back there I
think so um Ivan actually worked there
in a couple years uh but basically a
friend of mine came to me i was living
in Toronto at the time and I didn't even
own an iPhone and she she was just
complaining we're having
minus I mean she's like ah I hate
Wikipedia my phone this sucks and I was
like but I could fix that um so I
downloaded the sdk without a phone and I
built the first version of a thing
called I wig which was basically what
kapiti or your iPhone was the title of
it and then I got contacted by the
lovely legal department I Wikimedia
saying hey look you can't call it
wikipedia you can't have that in your
title we have a trademark and I was like
well why don't we just work together on
this and so we did so what I did for
about I think it was actually three
years was run the thing you have all
right we took Wikipedia make it into a
mobile website and yeah so through that
I'm gonna kind of be using this is the
main example I can get us hear me in the
back am I my good time okay all right
good um I'm gonna kind of use this as
the example because this is like you
know early days this is not the current
design think the designer the new much
better looking design which I'll show
you later is here but this is the old
one that I did and we kind of use my
rules and step through how the design
process was and you know basically now
they come down now we do this for big
companies over and over and over again
so the layout of the talk is I'm gonna
kind of talk about the challenge of
mobile I'm mostly talking about web
though a lot of this applies to a patoot
I'm even gonna talk about one of the
apps i've done and but yeah we're going
to talk about the challenge we're going
to talk about you have to understand
mobile right to understand what we're
actually doing i'm going to go through
the rules that i have they're the
perfect rules by the way exactly correct
their laws really i think i should
rename them and then yeah i'm going to
show you a more detail the design
process that I went through with
Wikipedia mobile um first a little note
I fancy myself a kind of product
designer and so you know what does that
mean wow that's not clear those are two
circles
yeah the jokes totally not going to work
now so there's graphic designers that
look like hipster barista there's
software designers that's that's a
childhood photo of me and then there's
kind of you I people but really you I
people it just shrank by the way it got
really tiny just imagine it it's
beautiful um because you eyes not as
much of it right it's like some places
hit job sometimes it's everyone's
responsibility right there's a whole
thing there I mean I kind of fit in
that's in the area between you I and
software which is just kind of a
horrible place to be and what that
really means is that my is ugly but
usable and scalable so yeah you I
software people and that explains why
Wikipedia was so ugly for so long um so
let's talk a little bit more about the
challenge and why this is a challenge
and why it's important or as I like to
call this segment it's kind of the dumb
part like it doesn't take much to
convince people that Mobile is important
right like I mean come on like my
grandmother's like Oh mobile you're in
Bobo that's awesome that's important she
doesn't know how to use a phone but
mobile usage is increasing very very
quickly the hard part is we're used to
social on the web we're used to
developing it was a microphone on now oh
I've been just showing the side of it
the recordings gonna be all silent I
think up till that point so we have this
beautiful display that you're designing
for right this is you know we've worked
years on this you know most of my career
is how do we lay this out and then you
know this comes along this tiny little
screen and somehow all the beauty and
all the experience we have here we've
got to jam down on this little screen um
so I call that a challenge and then we
need to understand i meant to make a
little side note on the small screen
thing my mom years ago was interviewed
in the New York Times about she's an
interior designer and so they're asking
like what's the home of the future gonna
be like and she's like oh audio people
are gonna talk
to their homes and I was like in high
school the time he was like 99 or
something like that and I was like mom
you are so wrong you're so wrong nobody
ever wants to talk to anything it
doesn't work it's slow you must
understand each other people just want a
nice little screen and so I feel like
when I'm approaching this challenge and
by working this field I'm just proving
my mom wrong over and over again cuz ya
who owned here only uses Siri when
you're drunk with your friends and make
it say stupid me I'm like Siri
where's the palace hotel I do not
understand all right you hold on um all
right let's get back to it um so now we
did to understand mobile right what what
is it to be mobile it was really easy
before you people were sitting probably
a work or at home in a chair with a
monitor and they were committed to what
they were doing that does not really
apply anymore people are distracted on
mobile devices you probably have three
to five minutes at max to make something
happen we worked a lot of e-commerce
customers so for them the something
happen is you bought something amazon
one-click was a lot more valuable to
them than I think they ever thought is
done but you have about 35 minutes
sometimes it's at home there's a lot of
mobile usage at home a lot of its while
on the go and just the situation
somebody could find themselves in while
trying to do this is very very different
it depends on the application a lot so
this is my completely kind of off the
cuff completely and complete that
possible I think it is so basically like
e-commerce the goal you want to buy
something maybe check the price of
course if you're actually the e-commerce
person you don't want them to check the
price you want them to buy something
it's like on demand and then you know
usually you're sitting at home sometimes
I'll do it after a bottle of wine I'll
be like oh I need to buy fan click click
click one click done there's a theme
through all this by the way uh-huh I
yeah when you're when you're looking at
prices that's gonna be in store their
social when you're messaging a friend a
lot of times you're walking you're like
oh what's their phone number I need
to message them right
we've all done that and then there's
like then you're kind of there's this
the be where you're just browsing what
are my friends doing I'm kind of bored
I'm I'm waiting somewhere as we see over
there so just working this kind of stuff
out seeing what your application really
thinking about what people are doing
what are their goals right the the
challenge is people aren't just they
used to have a lot more patients on the
desktop like I'll click through now
there's a flash video terms of service
so there's a pop-up don't I do a survey
on the mobile device you're out right I
mean I'm sure we've all done this like
what note close it so I'm gonna kind of
go through the rules start the first one
on mobile simplicity is a requirement
it's not like I remember was it Nielsen
he's just always like oh you know make
your experience simple make it simple it
doesn't really matter whatever just
throw the on the screen the you
know the guy in marketing wants a button
to do this sure whatever doesn't matter
nobody going to click it it's a
requirement on mobile you cannot like
every button that's there every feature
that it implements is important and
needs to be there our starting needs to
be really thought through so I have to
use dieter Rams because whatever it's
it's like requisite in my mind good
design is as little design as possible I
love that if you don't know what you
have dieter Rams read all of his rules
they're much better than mine but it's
as little design as possible right you
want to get things to get out of the way
you want to use stuff and not have to
think about it right he was a famous
designer of all these awesome consumer
goods and really change the way the
consumer goods were made and you really
have to it's utilitarian right what
you're doing I mean what he did was art
but it was utilitarian all right and
that's very very important your thing
has a task it doesn't matter how good
your test cases are in the back end or
your databases double optimized you your
users don't give a they want
something simple and they want something
powerful and let's look at some simple
design that we've been doing on the
desktop it doesn't really work very well
on mobile a couple these companies here
will not do mobile sites for some reason
but yeah this is not okay no double
click to zoom or whatever they used to
that would that doesn't
solve it right it's horrible this is
information overload it ruins your
experience simplicity is required here
the next rule some to explain simplicity
what i mean by that right because i
could mean a lot of different things
it's a it's between comprehension and
brevity probably being kind of
minimalism or just you know what's the
smallest thing i could make but then you
also have to make it understandable
cleave your sights one big button and it
doesn't any text on it that is the most
minimal design you could have but it's
not a very good design because it
doesn't explain anything to the user so
here's some examples and i'm using
wikipedia in this one this is
comprehension this is the this used to
be crazier show you guys remember it
this is after the redesign so it's
simplified but you know we have all
these different options I can do
advanced the page just keeps going on
after this there's lots of things your
makes lots of sense you know exactly
what's going on you can find what you
need right and then this is kind of
brevity so just put that at the top of
the page right but it doesn't I don't
know what that is what am i doing with
it what am I supposed to do there's no
hints here and so then simplicity it's
like okay we have a little bit of
branding and we know there's a search
bar because i'm told it's a search bar
so that is simplicities amounts between
that comprehension brevity and they
should always be in a tug of war and
like i said on the desktop used to not
matter that much right Oh would I write
a couple buttons cuz somebody asks for
it like that really matters on mobile so
let's the thing that you're really doing
well well that process is occurring is
you have to figure out what your core
value proposition is I'm always always
on about that with everything I'm
involved in like what is that thing
doing you really and you know oftentimes
the person who's closest to the product
wants it to be everything you know like
what is your product oh it's an
experience towards enlightenment of
mankind communication network oh so you
send a tweet like all right I get it um
but you know you have to to realize you
really and I think to make a great
design you have to know like when you're
designing a product I'm designing a hair
dryer I just need it to be a hair dryer
err i mean i want to make the experience
great i think we'll take that as red
right we don't want to be bad but it's a
hair dryer it needs how well it dries
hair is a definition of its quality so
let's see how we figure out I'm going to
do the core value proposition stuff on
Wikipedia what do people do on Wikipedia
well on the go they read they read a sum
one caveat and edit I know that the the
guys are working on editing now finally
because I was just like yeah let's just
focus on the reading or especially early
on right like tennille editing's really
hard like we have to mail reading for
you to editing so you know for me the
design process was read read read read
this is about getting some information
as quickly as possible like hey I can't
remember who invented the television
right so this is the process that people
go through open the browser Google the
word television and then click on the
Wikipedia link and then read that's the
process we want that is exact and then
we don't care if they close it I don't
care sure whatever maybe donate if you
want there's a text message thing but
read read that's you want to find out
this information and that is our goal so
you really need to understand that core
value proposition and even when you know
at the foundation it's like obviously we
believe in collaborative editing and we
believe in a community and all those
things and those are totally completely
important but ninety-eight percent of
the people on the site read then you
want to maximize editing to tangri stuff
but it's like you can't ignore that
right the new or the next one is sorry
where is more important than who so
where do you think people use mobile
apps I'm going to talk then this is very
specifically well there's there's four
places that use it home transit bars in
the toilet where people use Wikipedia
mobile is they don't really do it on
transit I mean somewhat right but you
look moving
home somewhat but like whatever people
do use it on the toilet definitely
that's totally there but the number one
thing is bars far and away far and away
is my bag this is a I read this chart
only a couple months ago and how it used
to be much more pronounced now mobile
usage is spread much more evenly around
the world where cultural differences and
stuff like that but you can still see it
and it's on the left there I believe
this was taken over a three-day weekend
you can see those spikes in the middle
of the daily spikes there so that is bar
hours Friday Saturday night people are
using wiki mobile over and over again
because it's like hey no I'll tell you
who starred in that film you're like wha
I win I spent two years my life on that
the three whatever yeah so where is
really important right because that
teaches us a lot about that's why I read
right there not it's less I'm gonna have
a moment and commune with the wonderful
it can be a community I'm I want to read
something now i'm not paying attention
very much like oh 3 g's not good you're
off which brings me to the next one
assume terrible dexterity i love this
picture for some reason it's gross but
it's like thumb hand from assume that
they're not very good at touching the
screen little ninja swipes and
cleverness need not apply it's not going
to work you're just gonna have angry
angry users and then back to my previous
point your users are probably drunk so
what I recommend and I'm not joking
about this is when we finished a mobile
design hand it to a child a drunk person
and an old person if if two of them can
figure it out you have got a fantastic
design it will work perfectly and people
will love it if they can't figure it out
then your users aren't
because even though they are better with
the device they're distracted as we said
they don't have much time and their
patients is very very low so assume
terrible dexterity the final rule is the
footer is a dead zone so typically stuff
like legal notices sometimes search will
be at the bottom actually I'm going to
we've actually been experiments putting
search at the bottom of pages because if
you've gotten down to the bottom you
didn't find the thing you wanted so i
guess i am going against my own role too
good place to start no basically the
footer though on mobile on a desktop
it's often visible people will get down
there pretty quickly as long as it's not
a super long page but on mobile it's a
graveyard you have to put stuff in the
header like that's that's where you're
all your interaction needs to happen
like it's not gonna happen anywhere else
in the page once you've gone to the
content you can pretty much only fit you
know one thing at a time wyd so you're
not going to just keep scrolling people
be either lost interest by a point or
move on so it needs to be up at the top
um so let's go through my design process
shall we so this is Wikipedia and I'm
going to kind of walk through what I
mentally did to come up with the
original Wikipedia design or at least
what should be there so first of all
that giant logo is lovely but not needed
I don't need to see that whole corner
also there's all these links on the left
on the desktop you just ignore them
instantaneously but that we can't fit
that needs to go there's article and
talk there's a nice little tabbing
system that helps you understand that
you know you can tab between the two
pages but that doesn't make any sense
when we're just reading all those can go
how about that we don't we can't login
get rid of that it says it says it's
from Wikipedia right below it like
there's a giant logo next to that I
noticed okay I got rid of that
people give me weren't happy about that
I think it appears now but I was like
those little notices I'm like yeah let's
get rid of that this is kind of a
problem area obviously is taking up a
whole lot of screen real estate so we
need to come with a way to deal with
that and then obviously it's not using
the space very well there's just kind of
black hole of trapped white space there
just glaring in the middle of the sushi
article sorry I'm I don't like trap
white space alright so let's get rid of
those marks and let's let's go from the
opposite now we're removing but what
we're keeping it basically turns out to
be that I was like okay I need to fit
all this on a page that i can use on a
mobile device but one of the problems so
this actually been fixed now on
Wikipedia but at the time it was a big
problem and especially it pronounced on
mobile which is the search bar it used
to be the search bar you would enter a
term and then you had two buttons to
click when with search and one was go so
basically if you search you always got a
list if the article existed it didn't
matter if you typed in sushi you get if
you had searched you get every article
with the word sushi in it if you had go
you rolled the dice whether or not there
was an article if there wasn't an
article it would ask you if you want to
make a new article and not give you
suggestions so I was like we need to fix
this so basically what I did in the
background was issued two simultaneous
requests about search and do a look up
at the same time for every single person
who ever see a video mobile for many
years and then made a decision about
whether or not that page existed because
I was like yes I can see the use case
that okay I'm really am looking for a
word to exist you know I'm not looking
for the article sushi I'm looking for
what articles talk about sushi and I
think on the desktop that's totally a
valid use case but I'm like nobody's
doing that on mobile oh I'm typing in
sushi search I'm just interested in
finding out about sushi cross Wikipedia
so simplified this thing up to the point
of it was kind of not very performant
for the actual site
so we have this one of the things I did
for a while was actually oh sorry
actually got rid of the title because
you can see the word sushis up in the
search bar I wouldn't say this was a
whole success people got a little
confused but basically if you clicked on
the article I was like wait you know you
search for it it says sushi and then i
would say sushi below it I'm like wait
just use a search bar as the title place
too so that was it for a while and it
kind of looked like this so if i go to
the user experience article would say
user experience up in the box and then
i'm supposed to have a little clearer
thing but i never worked right yeah so
that's this is the design super
minimalist you already saw the search
part I'm sure you guys have seen this
before but so this is like quick little
walkthrough you know we did the homepage
it was kind of hacked together how did
you one for each language because
they're kind of freeform so I had to
write like a little wrapper for each one
of them the search is there you can
search if you search for something wrong
it just issued to background requests it
found a list of there's only one that's
great Oh with two ice right uh so you
can change it you actually get the
proper article there then we had to if
you go down now we use this whole
folding system this is a believe it's
it's still like this right I use it yeah
okay yeah I purposely those see that
lying beneath their I knew that was ugly
I did it because I thought that it would
prompt somebody who's really good at CSS
or a proper graphic designer to come in
and fix it and they never did so that
everyday people saw that it mostly got
yeah that's ugly it was a prank like
wasn't a probably I thought that would
be like oh I can fix that let me do a
little patch and move it no open source
and creative people not necessarily
overlapping is what I discovered there
yeah so when here's the redesign that
that I think they launched about a year
ago much cleaner at the top all the
Genki weirdness with the stuff is gone
much cleaner I'm so glad so he took over
when you touch it I think the beta
version is like a cool thing that swipes
in then my little pop in and out button
thing anyhow so it's getting getting
much better so we go over one other
application that I did for this is a
native application I don't talk about
this one too much but I definitely think
it's the probably the nicest thing I
think I've ever made dictionary does
anybody here use dictionary okay there's
some all right yeah so I made that are
you put the two each other um I keep
really greedy people and I'll see on
their phone they're like oh you did that
I was like yeah I did um yeah so
dictionary is a dictionary for your
iphone also for webos and i'm about to
release the android version because it's
been like in development forever and a
half um so basically what happened was I
was like sitting in bed this is before i
had a kindle and i was reading and you
know i came upon a word i didn't know i
just got my iphone with the money I got
Billy leukopenia or the I wit thing it's
true and then you know I went to look up
a word Google was okay the definitions
weren't great took too long you need an
internet connection and it was kind of
lagging in the bedroom and I was like
yeah I'm gonna make a thing to make this
experience I'm having right now there
must be other people with their phone
going I just want to look up this word
really quick please help me so it's a
native application English language
dictionary uh it was number one in the
app store forever i think number 24
dictionaries sorry what it was like for
a week solid number one which is pretty
cool but uh laughs for dictionaries
number one like eight point six million
users which is crazy and then like about
5,000 actually today was a couple days
ago but whatever but yeah five thousand
users a day and I even like touches
singing forever it will occasionally
crash in iOS 6 oh I'll work on it no in
by the ways a little story about this
cuz I'll get to the design though so
dictionary com is owned by
iac/interactivecorp they don't like ask
calm and like a million other web
properties and you know this big
powerful mega conglomerate company and I
think I really annoyed them because they
were number two forever and they kept
like redoing the app like completely
from scratch like every every two months
there was like a new version for like a
year and you know i think i spent like
three or four weeks on the initial
version dictionary
I and I don't know I just love that I
like the headquarters like somebody was
like nearly getting fired every week to
like oh I can't you beat him like and it
was just like you me and my underwear at
home like hanging out like I don't know
um but and this is actually it was it's
I mean you'll see it's based on
simplicity like I think that's what most
of Europe driven crazy the dictionary is
not very good to be honest it's word
word word net which is like supposed to
be for grammar geeks to figure out stuff
with I stripped all that out the
definitions aren't fantastic there are a
lot of words not in there they had like
merriam-webster's like dads and swipes
and coolness and I don't know still beat
them it was fun but here you hear some
of the design goals right that made it
happen first of all you want to look up
a word and then leave I'm not trying to
make them have an experience I don't
want them to sit around in my app I mean
if you want to click on add please click
the odd but I don't want you don't need
you to sit around right other ones would
have things like where did the days the
first thing you got or like want to play
a puzzler and I'm like no I just I'm
looking up a word get out of my way I'm
busy so here are some of the
requirements i wanted i wanted the data
on the device I didn't want you have to
use to have like this were the ipod
touch was I mean still really popular
yes but I didn't want people to have to
have an internet connection also built
into this one is I want them to be able
to download the application over the air
which at the time i think was 20
megabytes is now higher so i had to make
sure that my final application with the
dictionary it fit underneath 20
megabytes which this is why i took three
weeks like the user interface wasn't
hard it's one of those rare instances
and in my career as a developer where no
actually diving super deep in the code
was the right answer to the problem to
get that done and i did so that's good
search as you type okay would have been
easy just to put the dictionary in there
but i wanted it to be as you type the
word list is updating instantaneously
without any delay and without the things
sticking all so fuzzy search I want you
to be able to misspell the word do naive
with a why on the end or something like
that right um and also as I said it need
to be super quick
so that that was the design requirement
so had to be super small I couldn't put
a big index I kept having things where
the index was giant and then you know I
was like freaking like a hundred
megabytes I can't do that so yeah I took
a lot of finagling here to get that done
but I caught it so is what it looked
like on the left I can't really see the
gray background so that's the iphone
version or when you first start the
keyboard just comes up that like I there
is not a version of this where the
keyboard isn't the first thing that
shows up because I'm not I don't want to
go click happy to wait for deload and
then click is terrible so as it's
loading you see the hell like a
foreigner screen and then your keyboard
just pops up and you're ready to go and
you start typing and then you're you're
often you're looking for your word here
on the left but yeah this is sorry on
the right is the ipad version just put
the word list on the Left definitions we
decide to include them kind of in the
right on the same page on the other one
if you click you have to go in one level
you can look it up one you look up
synonyms even like a pronunciation you
can do all these things and it's just
super super super simple feel free to
download either one of these they're
both free so yeah I was just it's just
single purpose right single-minded it
does one thing I want a word I want a
definition get it done and get it out
there you know in 8.6 million users I
poured dictionary com people adding
features and doing all sorts of stuff I
mean I barely changes since it first
came out just updates to like make it
not crash in various versions be I'm
super proud of it please play with it
it's really cool so let's just go over
the rules one more time on mobile
simplicity is a requirement it is not
optional you cannot mess with this stuff
it's a balance between simplicity is the
balance fitting comprehension and
brevity right that's we have those two
forces need to be fighting if they're
not fighting in your head then you're
not designing number three understand
and optimize your core value proposition
make sure that thing happens make sure
when they look forward they can find and
make sure if they're reading the drain
they want to send a text message make
sure that happens right that's like the
number one thing by the way I message
design sorry if they not totally failed
at that on the desktop anybody use that
holy crud I'm like I want to send a
message to a person you
type in their name oh no I have to go
click to a menu to add a new
conversation and then go to a different
thing to type like seriously it's chad
we after we solve this people um so I
just I'm not Randy at all where is more
important than who so really think about
what your users are doing right and that
definitely relates to your core value
proposition what's that thing you're
really delivering and wire that why are
they on a mobile device looking for this
and if you can understand that you're in
a really good spot assume they have
really bad dexterity drunk people old
people children the Holy Trinity the
footer is a dead zone usually you need
to either move stuff out of it don't put
a little log in down there they probably
won't see it that call so I'm done with
a mobile design part but I'm gonna tack
on a surprise announcement it says it
right there um so I don't you guys know
about this but uh I think I have the
animation yeah lib SAS has been in
development for the last six months who
here uses SAS all right okay so for
those who you don't know what it is it's
a CSS super language really weird you're
like its extends CSS adds a whole bunch
of cool stuff to it and it's been around
now for four or five years something
like that and basically it's asses
written in Ruby so it move web our
toolkit is a compiled framework in SDK
that you can install beta mu web com and
so we didn't want to include ruby in the
whole stack right to make sure you have
to install this like hundred megabytes
of ruby just to get the SAS compiler
because we want to have sass in our
framework so why not just write it and c
or c++ and that's what aaron has been
doing it moved web with me he's been
spending the last six months it's really
it's even darker than the normal picture
looks kind of creepy totally not creepy
no so he's like super smart compiler guy
like brilliant and
I can't believe we're so lucky to have
him he's been working nonstop on this
and basically the design it's a see
interface with C++ internals because we
didn't want it to do some stuff but you
can anything that is a see interface you
can wrap it put in your favorite
language statically linkable just drop
in its couple files it's not a big deal
you don't have to worry about libs and
whatever and what's installed and that
you just drop in and compile your
application it's smallish you know
actually I know that number of lines but
we wanted to try to keep it as compact
as possible so that you can just drop it
in and it's not like some crazy giant
thing super simple interface and we
wanted to be fast and supports us 3.1
style features or some 3.2 stuff that's
coming out or just out and we're not
covering all those yet basically move
web sponsored it when you're six months
in we've been using in production for
about four months we need more adapters
these are the benchmarks it's about a
hundred times faster I don't know people
with Giants ass projects our compile
time I'll tell you move web can
sometimes take 30 seconds for something
there's encashed so deployments total
pain in the ass oh yeah you can't even
see the little line sorry just there's
like a little green thing but it's like
nothing it's super dick asleep fast and
so what I'm announcing is one point oh
we just tagged it today we're finally
ready to say it's good to go it supports
bourbon it's chris here sorry cuz
bourbon doesn't have any native features
so it's a that's a library of sass
functions supports at fully we've been
using in production for four months live
up on lots of major company websites
we've been compiling it in a bunch of
advanced users using it there's a link
to it if you haven't gone there there's
also owned it to pimp node sass so
there's an oj s binding for lips ass so
somebody was tweeting about it asking
about it so if you use node you can use
sass now and compass support is coming
in 1.1 when we get those
interface is working so go forth and
adapt our eyes it's one point oh it's
ready go mess where they go try to break
it if anything's broken it's definitely
a huge bug but we're pretty confident
that it's very solid at this point
alright so I just want to say Michael
help me with all these slides my husband
and he's not here and I was like to give
him some credit because I didn't do all
the pretty things myself follow me at H
Callen like I said I like attention wow
you're welcome everyone uh are you well
I think we have oh we're done now we're
done is 20 isn't it alright well thank
