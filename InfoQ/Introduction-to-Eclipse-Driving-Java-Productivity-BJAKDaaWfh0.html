Marikana and I'll be talking to you
today a bit about the Eclipse integrated
development environment eclipse is the
IDE that we that we like to use for a
lot of our training classes here it's a
it's an open source product you can get
it for free and it turns out to be
pretty customizable so it ends up being
very applicable for lots of the
different training courses that we do
here ok so first things first I want to
point out that you do need to get a copy
of the Java Runtime installed on your
system beforehand if you don't have it
already you're going to need at least
Java 5 Java 7 is out but we actually
prefer a Java 6 just because it's got
you know essentially all of its
compatibility issues that have already
been ironed out over the last few years
so again you know please go ahead and
download either the JRE or JDK version 6
before you before you follow along here
ok so the first thing that that we're
going to look at is basically this this
list of Eclipse downloads and instead of
having just one you know download
Eclipse there's actually lots of
different choices on the menu so just
wanted to go over a few of these that
there's there's lots of different
options here so it clips for Java
developers that's 127 Meg download clips
for Java EE developers seems like it
comes with some more stuff it's 210
Meg's there's eclipse classic Eclipse
for C++ developers and so on and what
this really is is all of these come with
sort of the the core eclipse
functionality and then it bundles some
additional features so for example the
Eclipse IDE for Java developers is going
to have the JDT the Java development
tools pre-installed in this bundle so
we're going to go ahead and download the
Eclipse IDE for Java developers I'm not
a Mac so I'd want the the cocoa 64-bit
version and actually I'm not going to
download this
now I've already got it here to save
some time so to install it all that you
need to do and really nice thing about
eclipse here is the installation process
is the same across all different
platforms whether you're on Mac or
Windows or Linux all you need to do is
basically unzip the tarball that you
don't that you download so let's go
ahead and tar XZ the F I've got it in my
downloads directory it clips Java
alright so we are extracting eclipse
into the Eclipse directory and now all
that I really need to do is CD Eclipse
and run eclipse alright so you can see
we're burning Eclipse indigo this is
this is version version I basically the
the previous was Helio sand and so on
I think Ganymede so these are these are
all alphabetically-ordered and the first
thing we see here is is that the the
workspace launcher wants us to select a
workspace so let's take a take a closer
look here Eclipse stores your projects
so you can have potentially multiple
projects at the same time and a folder
called a workspace so let's uh let's
let's choose something for this let's
say R Arcana demo workspace and if you
wanted to you could you could just click
the little checkbox you saw there to use
that as a default and great we've got
we've got Eclipse running so let's
maximize this close the splash screen
and before I get into any of the stuff
that you're seeing here just yet I
wanted to point out like like I talked
about before with the diff for the
different oops the different packages
that you can download you can also do
this from within eclipse in sort of an
ala carte fashion the way you do that is
maybe somewhat unintuitive Lee through
the help menu under help you look for
install new software click that
it's going to ask you to work with a
particular update site so Eclipse has
this notion of update sites which is
basically its own sort of package
management system that's a you know
based on based on these remote basically
these remote repositories where our
eclipse packages are hosted and let's
see in the Eclipse for Java package I've
got three pre-installed or predefined
update sites and the one that I care
about right now is not updates not not
myelin but but rather indigo because
that's the the release that we're
working with right now so first time you
go and do this it's going to take take a
minute to to update the to update the
list of packages here because it's
fairly fairly hefty set so we give that
a minute and there we go so there's a
whole list of things to choose from here
the the one that I wanted to point out
was you know for example if you're going
to be doing some zoom C or C++
development you would choose the C++
development tools and that's basically
the same thing that that you would have
gotten here the Eclipse ID for C++
developers I'm so that would be useful
for example if you were if you were
writing some native some native code
that you were going to call from the
Java that's one example another thing I
wanted to quickly point out is that
you're not limited to work with just the
the software installation sites that are
that are predefined here you can
actually add a new one so the example
that that comes up pretty frequently for
us is the Android development tools so
let's go back to our browser here and D
on Android comm is where we're going to
download this thing from it's under the
SDK and uh-huh the ADT plugin for
eclipse so let's let's take a peek at
this we're going to read the installing
the ADT plug-in instructions and here we
go downloading the ADT plug-in it gives
us the URL for a download site so it's
going to give us full instructions here
but I'll just go ahead and do it quickly
we're
add a new download site call it ADT
plugin copy/paste that that URL in hit
okay and in just a second we're going to
look at the at the components that this
that this software site provides so
again we get a sort of similar list in
order to bit quicker this time and we
would choose the Android developer tools
one last thing I want to point out about
this some of these plugins such as the
developer tools here these these Android
development developer tools are actually
not self-contained the Android developer
tools plug-in won't actually do anything
without a copy of the Android SDK
installed so just something just
something to be aware of as you're going
through plug-in installation you may
have to do some additional configuration
after the plug-in is installed okay some
just cancel out of this we don't need
any any additional functionality for for
what we're going to do right now okay so
quick overview of just just what you're
seeing here on the in the default
default workspace the default screen
this is the Java perspective a
perspective is basically a a layout of
views so these individual panels and n
tabs are each called views and a
perspective is just sort of a predefined
collection of those you can choose a
number of additional perspectives such
as the debug perspective or what else we
got here the XML perspective CVS repo
Explorer and git repo exploring and so
on and these these just make your
workflow a little bit easier because
they bring the views that you're going
to be most likely working with to sort
of the forefront so we'll see an example
of the debug perspective in just a bit
but for now we're going to stick with
the Java perspective I'm actually gonna
go ahead and close the tasks list
because I don't care about that and I'll
close the outline as well and here's
sort of the place we want to start is
the is the package Explorer and the
first thing that we want to do when
we're going to create a new a new
project from scratch
is new Java project so this is one of
potentially many projects that you're
going to have in your workspace I'm
going to call this echo we're going to
be doing a sort of like a hello world
just for just for demo sake this is
going to be something that echoes
arguments from the command line we'll
use the default location we'll use the
Java six JRE
and let's go just go ahead and click
finish all right so we've got now a Java
project called echo we can expand that
and we see that we've got an empty
source directory and we're also
referencing all of the jars that are
that are part of the JRE the the Java SE
six JRE so you don't need to worry too
much about those but just in case you
ever ever needed to figure out which
version of the Java libraries or which
version of you know some some
third-party libraries you're using they
would they would also show up in your in
your project here under the package
Explorer alright so let's go ahead and
create a new package in our project
we'll say calm Maracana dot echo
and within that package we'll create a
new class again call it echo and this is
something that that turns out to be
pretty handy
it sort of takes care of a fair amount
of the boilerplate for you says yep
we're putting it under under the source
folder in the echo package we're calling
it echo it's going to be a public class
just inheriting from java.lang object so
nothing special and I'd also like to
have a stub of a main a main method
filled out here just to save myself some
typing all right so what do we get well
we get basically a runnable and runnable
stub here if I wanted to go ahead and
run this just like this I can click on
the Run button
and sure enough nothing happens why is
that well it's because this isn't really
doing anything one thing that we can do
to sort of just confirm this behavior is
we can actually go under window and add
a view to our default Java perspective
we can look at the console view and we
can see in fact that nothing was really
written to the console our main isn't
doing anything so just as a just as a
start we can fill out you know system
dot out dot print line hello world all
right save that run it and there we go
we can we can see that how the world is
output it to the console okay great but
what we really want to do for our echo
application is we want to echo
whatever's coming out of the first thing
in our arguments list so so let's have a
look here let's say args of 0 we'll save
this and we'll run it and oh my god we
got an exception so what's this all
about well says the exception is in in
the main thread we're getting an array
index out of bounds exception at echo
dot Java line 9 well it's fairly clear
what's going on here but just just to
show you the the debug perspective let's
go ahead and debug this to see what's
going on
right next to the Run button there's
also a debug button go ahead and click
on that and immediately it says oh well
we'd like to switch you to the debug
perspective because we think that's
going to be essentially more more
helpful for you more productive so yep
let's say we always want to be to be
able to do that and here we go we have
actually stopped with the the execution
of this is suspended on the exception
that we had hit says on on line 9 and we
can see in the debugger here that args
is is empty it's it's showing us the
value here this is this is an empty
array and why is that well you know of
course we haven't actually passed any
arguments in when we ran the thing okay
great so let's stop running this we'll
just clear this out and slide this over
just a little bit more I'm going to go
back to my Java perspective so we want
to be able to fix this and there's two
ways to fix it obviously we could pass
an argument in which is what we'll
eventually want to do but just to show
you a little trick here I would like to
surround this line of code in a
try-catch block this is a nice quick way
to do that we're going to go to source
we're going to go surround with
try-catch block and you notice there's a
there's a good shortcut key here command
option Z and you can just go try-catch
block so it's surrounded our statement a
try-catch block and it's automatically
sort of highlighted the type of
exception that we might want to fill in
so we know that this is going to be an
array index out of bounds exception and
what I just did there is sort of a
shortcut for myself to avoid all that
typing once I hit control space so you
know I type date this is basically an
auto completion I basically typed the
first few characters of array index out
of bounds exception and it filled the
rest in for me hit enter and there we go
so this is our auto-generated little
stub of a catch block and I actually
don't want to print the stack trace I'd
like to print something else so system
dot out dot print line
oh no and we'll see how this goes hit
save again command S and run and oh no
so we got the exception but now we've
caught it and we didn't have to worry
about sort of code formatting or you
know manually typing out all the
try-catch stuff this was something that
was was just added for us so of course
we want to verify in at the end of the
day that our echo application works so
instead of just running it by clicking
the the Run button we're going to go to
run configurations and we're going to
specify some program arguments so let's
say oh ho ho it's coming up on Christmas
it seems appropriate
and now we'll hit run and there we go
oh ho comes into play we can also verify
that this is sort of coming in the way
that we expected to by setting a
breakpoint and doing a debug and let's
have a look at args now yep it's being
passed in as argument 0 ho ho ho great
let's go back stop execution here go
back to the Java perspective
and now I want to do something different
we've seen we've seen some basic
examples of how you can do Auto
completion with control space and we've
seen an example of how eclipses can fill
in some of the blanks for you with
surround with try-catch and so on now
I'd like to get a little bit fancier I
want to take a whole list of arguments
and I want to echo them back out but I
want to echo them out in order of their
their string lengths so I'm going to put
in a whole bunch of words as arguments
and I want to get them sorted by length
and then I guess also lexicographically
so let's go ahead and blow this away
what I would like to do first of all is
rename our application we won't even
this is no longer echo we're going to
call this echo sorted so how am I going
to do that well let's again do a
refactor now Eclipse since it has
basically its own internal copy of a
Java compiler which is specialized for
for the fact that it's an ID so it's a
dynamic compiler assistant called ecj
it's able to do quite a bit of work for
us whereas if you're using just a plain
text editor you would have to do a lot
of this stuff by hand so I'm going to do
refactor rename and again I could just
do command option R as a shortcut and
I'm going to say a public class echo
sword it alright
rename type this contains a main method
just wants us to be sure that we don't
have have any scripts that are going to
be relying on this after we do the
refactor say ok ok confirmed and not
only did we did we get this renamed
Eclipse was also smart enough to follow
the Java rules and say that our Java
file name is now echo sorted Java so
very cool now in order to help us with
with this application I'm going to pull
in a third-party library as something
some folks may be familiar with
something called guava and guava is just
going to help us write some of the write
some of the boilerplate code here so how
do I want to do this well I've got
a copy of put this in the background
I've got a copy of guava installed or
downloaded rather and I want to put it
into my workspace so let's go to
documents and myrick on a demo workspace
and we can see we've got our echo
project now one thing I could actually
do is rename the project as well let's
do a refactor rename echo sorted uh-huh
echo sorted great so we've got a bin and
a source and I'm going to also add a Lib
and I'm doing this from the command line
right now for a reason this is something
that you can actually do within Eclipse
but I wanted to show you something
that's that's fairly important from the
environment perspective if I do this
outside of Eclipse I make make the the
Lib directory CD in here and copy
downloads guava into Lib now it's in
there the jar is in there but if you
look at my echo sorted project Lib
doesn't show up so this is what I wanted
to show you the thing that you need to
do before before any external changes
that you've made will actually show up
in here is you need to do a refresh and
that's important in a number of
different situations if you're doing any
sort of file file operations file system
operations like renaming is a big
example or if you have some of some
compilation steps for example I think
the the Android developer tools will
will auto-generate some sources for you
and sometimes you need to do a refresh
to pick those up so let's go ahead and
do that and there we go
Lib shows up and our jars there but
again we need to do one more step in
order to actually use the things that
are in this jar we need to tell Eclipse
that this jar is actually part of our
build path
there we go so now in addition I can
just close this in addition to having
the JRE system libraries is part of our
reference library set we've also got
guava in there now so now we should be
okay so what did we say we wanted to do
we wanted to we wanted to sort all of
the arguments by their length now of
course I chose koala for a reason what
what I wanted to do is is build a custom
comparator for Strings so let's do that
we're going to make a private static
class called a string length comparator
okay and you can see that that Eclipse
is giving us little a little squigglies
along the way saying oh well we need to
actually insert a class body here so
let's go ahead and do that first thing I
want to say is that this implements
comparator and again I'm going to type
just the few the few first letters of
comparator hit control space and oh
we've got a couple choices comparable or
a comparator which one do we want
let's choose comparator and it's asking
us to fill in well what type of thing a
trie comparing is compared or on type
string
great you also notice that eclipse was
smart enough to pulling this import
statement okay so it's still giving us
the same error about how we need a class
body so that's great
save this for now but it's still giving
us an error and the error is that well
we must implement this inherited
abstract method comparator compare so
instead of typing all that out one thing
I can do here is just say add
unimplemented methods or if you didn't
have this little sort of mini mini
pop-up dialog open you could just do
command one if you're on a Mac or I
think it's going to be option one or
maybe Windows one if you're on a on a PC
and say add
implemented methods and just like we had
we had the try-catch block before sort
of out automatically inserted for us
what this is going to do for us is give
us a stub of the compare method and
again it's smart enough since we said
this is a comparator of strings it's
smart enough to say oh well we're
comparing two strings so that's great
we're comparing two strings I always
like and this is just sort of personal
preference I always like to call these
the left hand side string and then the
right hand side string but that's just
maybe and geeky so now we actually want
to fill this in and the way that I'm
going to do this the reason why I pulled
a guava in is so that I can use it as a
helper in this compare function and
we're going to use something from the
guava library called
comparison change let's say comparison
chain again we we just pulled this
indirectly by by doing our autocomplete
and the way that this works is we set
comparison chains start you don't really
need to know anything about this this is
just for for the sake of our example
here comparison chains start and what
we're comparing is string lengths so
compare LHS lengths
alright chest
length
and we want to actually keep going with
this chain so we're going to say that
compare since you know if if these two
lengths are actually equal we still want
to be able to differentiate between
different strings so let's also say just
LHS and RHS dot let's see where are we
dot result and we want to return this
great but this is a little bit unwieldy
right now we've got it we've got this
big big one-line statement so let's set
let's try something here let's try and
go and format it so I did command shift
F and that did a format for us and what
I can even do just for fun I can even
just do a little bit of this myself hit
return here now we've got a gutter our
dot compares on one line each and result
there we go so this is our this is our
custom comparator so that's great but we
can still see we've got a yellow
squiggly here that's representing
warning and what it's telling us is that
oh it's it's never used locally all
right so let's go and use it somewhere
what we want is let's see we want to we
want to take the arguments and sort them
right so the few ways of doing it I want
to use arrays dot sort so we're going to
be sorting an array of stuff an array of
strings and we want to pass that custom
comparator to it so we're going to use
this method we're going to be sorting
args and we're going to be using a new
string length comparator
great so that sorts our arguments and
now we want to do system dot out dot
print line of args okay so let's see if
this works and then we're going to do
one last refactoring one thing to what
to just notice this little gray warning
here saying the string length comparator
class is never used locally it's gray
because the warning has gone away if we
do a save that gray warning will go away
so is okay that's that's definitely
taken care of now and let's run a
program and we'll run it instead of just
with with ho-ho-ho like we had let's set
let's give it a different set of
arguments so let's say the quick brown
fox jumps over the lazy dog
alright so let's give this a shot see if
it works and we want arrays as list of
args let's see how that goes for us
aha so there we go we've got sorted by
lengths so we've got all the
three-letter words
dog Fox two copies of the lazy over
those are our four-letter words and
we've got some five-letter words brown
jumps and quick all sorted both by
lengths and alphabetically
so now let's say we don't we don't want
to use this arrays dot sort and we want
to don't want to use this arrays dot as
lists we want it we just want to do
static imports so let's say sort and as
list so let's go ahead and copy this I'm
going to say import static
java.util.arrays dot star now I want to
show you this first of all because I
think it's a good practice to to keep
these as short as possible assuming that
they're unambiguous so I like these
static imports and if you don't like
importing star you can import sort and
import as lists on a separate line but
this is just a good shorthand here and
the thing that I wanted to show you is
that this this import is now unused
because the only things that we were
using from arrays are imported
statically so the easy fix of course
would I could be I could just delete the
line but I wanted to show you one last
thing and that is if we do a command
shift o for organized imports then that
actually gives us everything that we
need I can do I can do that in source as
well if you if you can't remember the
the mnemonic for this you can do command
shift o here for organized imports so
that keeps things nice and clean these
are all these are all alphabetized and
so on and they're grouped by static
imports by by what package they come
from and so forth and then you know your
Java dot util stuff is going to be
obviously placed before your comm dot
whatever stuff so that's a nice thing to
just keep in mind for for when you're
doing your your real world development
in Eclipse is that you can always use
organized imports to to keep things nice
and clean hopefully that gives you guys
a pretty good perspective on what sort
of things you can do with eclipse
what eclipse provides you in terms of
automatic refactorings and clean ups how
a package management works and of course
you know just starting from basics how
to choose and uninstall an eclipse
recipient distribution
so thanks for watching and hope you
enjoy your courses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
