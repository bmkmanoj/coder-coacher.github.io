lead engineer of the learning experience
team here at Coursera so today we're
going to talk about what
internationalization is and how to do it
on the front end so I attend out on the
front end is about taking a static
string in your UI and translating with a
function at Coursera we typically name
that function underscore T so I'll refer
to that throughout the presentation and
it wraps up all the i18n magic that you
would want to do and returns a
translated string back like say in
Spanish so throughout this talk I'd like
to convince all of you who think that
18m might be a little bit difficult that
it's actually easier than you think and
for those that actually think it's quite
simple I like to convince you that it's
actually a little harder than you think
but that might be a bit confusing so
what do I do when I am confused is that
I think of two things lunch and an
analogy that may or may not decrease my
confusion so let's start out this way
think of IGN as like a great-tasting
peanut butter jelly sandwich it only
takes a few ingredients in a quick
lesson on how to put it all together
things can get super sticky and messy at
times but in the end it delivers immense
value for its size so whether you're
working on a small open-source project
or a large application with lots of
users ie tenon offers great potential to
increase the community that you engage
with and new users that you may not have
considered originally so consider this
Coursera is an online educational
platform that offers courses from the
top universities around the world and
many of our courses half-hour learners
are international and a growing number
of university partners are actually
teaching their courses in Chinese
Spanish Hebrew and many other languages
so by necessity bringing idatn to our
front end is essential to our success
and maybe to many other projects as well
so the best thing about i18n is our and
our efforts at Coursera is our
translation community these are not just
users but volunteers who contribute back
their time and efforts and make our
platform better for other users consider
them as a multiplier effect for the
success of our project and your project
as well another value I can just be
shown by looking at the engagement
patterns in particular of course there
before and after we added translations
to our courses during a release of a set
of courses that we translated both the
content so the video content and the UI
we saw 130 percent increase in user
engagement so hopefully you're convinced
and hungry so let's talk about how we do
this first you're gonna need the bread
this is what holds everything together
and that means you're gonna need to know
what language the user wants to read
luckily the browser actually tells you
this language and a set of preferences
that the user has the accept language
request header that comes in on every
request to your server contains a
comma-separated list of language codes
and the preference for the quality that
that user would prefer you can see this
header highlighted in red above lastly
if you have logged in users you actually
want to take this preference and store
it on your server this way you can give
access to the preference of what
language they're reading your
application in on like their accounts
page so that way they could change the
language and make it separate from what
their browsers are we actually have lots
of users who want to take courses in
Chinese but they're actually browsing in
English for whatever reason so let's
have some glue to your sandwich once we
know what language you speak we actually
need to wire up the strings so you know
what to read that means we need to
figure out how to store all these
translations now your I 18 Len library
of choice is likely gonna make these
decisions for you but let's walk through
how to think about this anyways they're
all basically used some parsable format
like XML or JSON and they map a language
to a string ID and then they map those
to the actual strings that you're gonna
use in your interface however this is
gonna get messy really fast if you plan
on adding more languages and there are a
lot of languages out there you're gonna
end up with one giant file it's gonna be
crazy to have a lot of translators
committing all at once so you're going
to want to break these translations to
separate files
so your first step you think let's break
one file for every language as you can
see in this directory listing of mine
but if you got a large UI like Coursera
I recommend instead taking a step of
abstraction even further and having
language instead of having language
files have language folders and each of
those folders contains
a file to a part of your UI so imagine
files like homepage JSON or accounts
JSON about page JSON and so on
in fact our Coursera these translations
are large enough that we have multiple
ie teen and folders throughout our
project that way we can keep these
translations close to the views
themselves in our own app structure
great so now let's add some sweet stuff
so now that you got the translations and
you know what are the strings that the
users wants you're going to need a
function to bring these two pieces of
information together so it's time to
pick an AI 18n library for your
front-end there are many of them out
there
Wikipedia air B&amp;amp;B many other open-source
developers have some pretty trustworthy
libraries that you can choose you should
definitely try out one of these above
these are pretty mature polyglot is the
air and B&amp;amp;B one at Coursera however we
went decided to go with the required
json plugin we've used many require
plugins in the past and it worked really
well with our architecture just a brief
on breafor on requirejs
it's a popular library for allowing you
to work with javascript in a modular way
there are two standards that you'll see
on the front end there's a common jazz
standard which is kind of what youth the
pattern you see in nodejs and browserify
and there's also AMD asynchronous
modular dependency this is what
requirejs implements and this is what we
use so you can see from above requires
pretty straightforward
it allows you to avoid having your
entire environment hanging off the
global window object and here we're just
importing different libraries and then
you're able to use those within your app
so as mentioned earlier the first step
that you're going to take with your ITN
library is to configure the language for
your user you're likely going to parse
the the header out or from the user
model on the server side and then
actually put that string in your to your
configuration if you don't the require
just plug-in actually does it for you
but again you want your users to kind of
have that control so here in this
configuration
we're configuring the plug-in and all of
require from now on to pick the Spanish
translations so require actually has a
very strong a parasite 18 and plug-in
has a strong opinion on the layout of
your files it is similar to what I
talked about earlier except instead of
your i18n folder
Jeff folders called NLS and there's also
an additional JSON file which lists all
the languages that you're currently
support so it knows which ones you're
not supporting right now so here in this
program underscore T is simply a
function that map's keys through the
translated values so it's like an object
but it's a function for your reference
so now the variable question will
contain the Spanish translation for the
key PB type there are some complexities
to think about however and depending on
your app you may want to consider other
libraries are rolling your own polyglot
is a good one that takes a step further
so for example you might have a lot of
sentences like these in your strings
where part of the sentence is a variable
and that variable might also affect your
plurality so here the variables are one
three hundred eighty nine and there's a
question of whether layer should be
plural or not so one way in which we've
seen other libraries make this work is
to have a custom function that takes in
your strings and gives it interpolation
and pluralization powers so for this
example you can see that we pass in num
layers and a call to a plural function
under underscore t which is now actually
a returned object of course Sarah we
don't actually do this but we have a
customized require ie TN J's plug-in
that has underscore t allowed to do
interpolation but we don't do
pluralization so congrats we're now done
done making lunch but are we ready to
eat it yet almost so now you got to do
localization or otherwise known as l10n
you've got a localizer content which
means to actually get the strings in
your UI translated so you can first
start out with Google Translate it's
much better than was a few years ago but
it still has a minute much more to go
and I would not recommend using it for
production but it's great to get some
sample strings in your application so
you can start testing and seeing other
languages appear in your application so
it's a great and cheap way to move
forward very quickly however look to
your own teammates for help you may
actually have some bilingual speakers
these are all the bilingual speakers on
my team I was quite surprising and they
were very helpful to get off of the
ground and running but don't be afraid
to see if you have a community of users
that will actually want to help you
hosting a community is a non-trivial
effort even for a Coursera so we use
transifex to help
let's do that they host translations and
they provide a UI for your community to
engage with each other and to add and
edit your own translations at Coursera
we actually go further and use transifex
api's to upload and pull down these
translations with each of our commits or
at some time frequency on some server so
if you're hosting an open source product
transifex is actually free so you really
have no excuse to see if you've got a
community out there own cloud is a great
project that I use and they use
transifex for in this way so let's talk
about what Coursera learned when it
tried to take this information and pull
it all together so first we did what all
great companies do when you need to
tackle something new we found an intern
so we crowned Victoria queen of IT nen
and had her translate one of one page
our homepage into Chinese she worked
really hard
she double-checked her translations she
dotted her eyes and underscored all her
T's and she got a page that looks like
this great but as time went on and very
quickly this page turned into this as
you can see almost all the strings had
been reverted back because the i18n
injections that she did hadn't been
maintained by other developers as they
iterated on the UI we thought about
training all our developers on all the
lessons that she's learned and to you
know provide a set of best practices and
for them to underscore T all the strings
in their UI's however we decided against
that it's not that we didn't think that
our team could do it or that we couldn't
teach him but instead we took a bat took
a step back to think about how much time
there is in the world to do all the
things that great developers do so first
they need to remember to submit their
code for reviews they need to remember
to review someone else's code and go
through that iteration cycle and they
especially need to remember not to
forget to eat lunch and don't forget
they also have to know how to test all
their code and all their browsers
including every single ie and lastly
they got to stop refreshing hacker knew
so much and now in today's world they
have to check their code on multiple
devices so with all that do we actually
want our developers checking all the
pages in all the different languages
ones that they don't even understand
clearly the answer is no so first we
decided to put all that responsibility
and one man's hand
this is young so we just said well we
don't want to all the developers do it
so why don't you
do it for us so we told him he was our
i18n guy and we wished him good luck so
Jung is very good at coding but he
wasn't too happy with his task so he
just he decided to do what all good
engineers do when they get a task and
they're not in love with it they
automate it Automation is not an easy
decision and one should consider it
carefully and be wary of this xkcd graph
on what can happen when you venture off
into the automation worlds so Jung
started doing out everything manually
for our entire project just to get a
sense of what it takes and then he ran
his timing results through XK CDs
automation table to ensure that he was
making a good decision so young made
many decisions along the way for our
team so for example he decided to move
all the strings into our HTML and out of
our Jas logic so no strings in J set J s
at all or any of our views at Coursera
you can see that we actually use J
templates to write our HTML so we don't
write HTML directly but we compile it
before we send out to the client moving
strings in this way just into your
templates is a great idea overall
whether or not you use I tune in string
shifts are a better fit in the UI itself
and don't belong in the logic next Jung
wrapped all the strings and our Jade
files with the underscore T function and
then interpolated in Jade you'll notice
he also made a decision to avoid using
string IDs he's actually just passing in
the strings themselves he didn't want to
come up with a key for every string in
your UI variable naming is very hard and
then doing that throughout the entire
application is no fun so instead the
string itself is just the string ID this
does have a lot of complications because
you've got spaces and dots and lots of
other weird punctuation in your JSON but
it also has some advantages for example
if we don't have the string translated
yet underscore T is just going to return
the string itself and so you can
actually makes a bunch of languages and
then upgrade over time as the
translations come in next Jung had to
create all our analyst folders himself
manually and also all our translation
files and then modify our Jade
precompilation tool in order to inject
underscore T as an argument so here this
is a if you look so the Jade file acts
be near the bottom and it is these
precompiled files that we actually ship
to the clients we actually don't ship
Jade we pre compile it and then ship out
of function but inside he managed to
pull in the actual translations and then
pass in lower down it got cut off he's
passing an underscore T so all of Jade
will actually have access to underscore
t just for that particular view so that
was a lot of file creation on his part
so after he did all this he saw that no
other developer including himself would
ever have to do the same again and he
created an open source UT on github you
need the name of a famous jade emperor
of ancient China and it certainly rules
all of our Jade files so what you d does
is very specific to Jade but I imagine
that the same approach can be taken for
HTML mustache JSX or any other way that
you are templating your HTML so let's
walk through what it does so all we do
it Coursera now is just what we did
before we write HTML and Jade just like
always
there's no behavior change necessary in
any part our strings are just as is it
takes it and then the steps that I
walked you through before about what
Yong did manually it now does
automatically so all these strings will
automatically be surrounded by the
underscore T interpolation and the pre
compilation phase through another
automation tool that he wrote is
actually inserting those translations
directly in so no developer does
anything and we get take advantage of
all the translations the biggest
component that's not in UD is the
creating a translation file and nls
folder for every view so if this folder
was called jobs dot Jade it would create
an NLS file in there and create a jobs
JSON for this translations and so that's
how Coursera built its lunch and ate it
too but we've got a lot more to do there
are left to write languages and
right-to-left languages and they throw a
big wrench in things if you only build
one and not the other German words are
also very long and they caused as much
havoc as the change in direction of the
languages there's also a lot of
performance improvements that we can
that are needed for our non-english
translations we bundle up all our
English and make those really quick but
for international users they require we
actually ship in the amount one at
and so there's some huge performance
tweaks that we need to do on our part so
we'll be happily sharing all these
updates as we improve our own i18n
infrastructure and as we learn more on
our blog at Tech coursera.org so please
follow us that's all I have for now is a
quick talk I hope you had some fun and
learned a bit along the way and thank
you for all your time
