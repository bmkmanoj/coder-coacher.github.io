yes today I'm going to be talking to you
about meta classes so first of all why
metaclasses why would you care about
meta classes well the short version is
that there's things you can't do with
classes and metaclasses lets you do
these things and so I'll spend the rest
of the talk trying to explain what those
things are and how exactly you would do
them so the reason why I started playing
around with meta classes was I was
trying to use knows to run some test
Suites and I ran into this problem where
nose will print out the docstring of
your methods as it's running them and
these work strings aren't necessarily
particularly informative so if you have
some you know class a and it has a
function called my phone it has some you
know doc string for the function and
then another class that inherits from a
and then you look at the doc string for
both of those functions the same doc
string so you don't actually know if
you're getting that function through
class a or through pass P and so this is
normally not a problem but in these like
specific cases like when you're trying
to use nose for this it makes it very
hard to debug and see like which of your
test test cases are actually passing and
which are failing so I set out to try to
find a solution to this so the simple
solution which you might think of is
just to you know include the information
manually in the doc strings that's
probably the best solution for simple
cases you just change you know a and B
there you go you're done but if you have
lots of methods or lots of subclasses
the kit this can get pretty arduous and
so there should be a better way to do
this a little bit more programmatically
so here's it maybe
a better solution to try to fix this so
what you could do is say I'll just edit
the doc string in the init of the parent
class and then that'll fix everything so
you go and you know for each of your
functions in this case it's just my funk
but if you had more you could do more
you know look up the class name and edit
the doc string so that it's prefixed
with class name colon doc string
unfortunately this doesn't actually work
because the doc strings for class
methods are not writable you can't
change them after the class has been
created so it doesn't work to just edit
them in a net you need to do something a
little bit more fancy I'll note that in
general doc strings are writable for
functions if you just have any you know
random function that is fine but it's in
particular methods the docs drinks
aren't readable so this is like specific
problem to classes in particular so is
there a way that we can perhaps maybe
change the doc string before the
function becomes a method and the answer
is yes so but to take a step back for a
moment and just sort of give a brief
refresher on the basics of classes so
what's a class a class is just a special
type of object that creates other
objects and those other objects are
called instances remember that
everything a Python is an object if you
haven't heard that before now you have
everything in Python as an object that's
the most important thing to remember
from this talk is everything a Python is
an object so you all objects to act
basically the same and so to get sort of
a real world example that I like to use
is that a class is sort of like a
particular you know government form a
tax form like the you know 1040 and then
an instance would be your particular
version of that tax form with all of
your information written out on it and
so we can ask Python what what flavor of
object a particular instance is what
type what class it is we use that using
this
type function and so here it'll tell us
that a inst is of type A which is what
we would expect because we created it
from a but again everything in Python is
an object
so therefore classes should have types
two and in fact if we look at what the
class or the type of a is we see that it
is of type type this is kind of
confusing because a lot of people use
the term type in sort of a general sense
but in Python there's also the specific
term of type and to make it even more
confusing they're sort of like three
different ways that type can be used so
first of all type will just denote like
the flavor of object that it is that is
to say like the type of what a class is
you can also use type as a function to
tell you what type of particular
instances that you have which is
probably how you've seen it used before
and finally you can use type to create
new classes and that's the interesting
part that I'm going to be getting more
into now so so how do you create a class
on the fly you use type this is how
you've probably seen classes
instantiated before probably you haven't
seen them instantiated in a different
way but you can using type it takes
three parameters the first one is just
the name of the class the second is a
list of base classes or parent classes
so that's equivalent to what you would
put here up in the parenthesis and the
final one is a dictionary of the
attributes that the class will take and
so in this particular case I just have
the attribute for my funk but if you
wanted to have other variables or
methods etc you put them in that
dictionary so you just pass those three
arguments and voila you have a class you
don't need to use the special like class
syntax to do it okay so now that we know
how to create a class on the fly maybe
we can try this again see if we can get
our doc strings rewritten so I created a
function here called make class which
has the same signature as the type
function but before it actually calls
type it goes through each of the methods
that are passed in and rewrites them to
again be prefixed with the class name
so we can call this make Class A and
they Class B but unfortunately this
isn't exactly what we wanted what we see
is that when we print the duck string of
my funk for a it is in fact prefixed
with the a colon which is what we wanted
but then B is B colon a colon so how did
that happen the answer is that both of
those classes a and B we're using the
same function in memory so when you
first rewrote the one for a it prefixed
it with a colon and then you rewrote the
same Docs during a second time and got B
colon a colon and so if you actually use
is which does equality in memory it'll
show you that those two functions are
exactly the same so can we get around
this by perhaps making them not be the
same function so again everything in
Python is an object so we can also
create functions on the fly functions
also have a type which is the function
type so here's a function that takes a
function as an argument and then copies
the function and returns the copy of the
function you don't need to worry about
too much about the details of how this
works this is really getting into like
the internals of Python actually the
first argument that it takes is like the
compile bytecode for the function so
yeah don't worry too much about like the
specifics there just know that you can
actually duplicate functions so we have
this alright so we'll take my funk and
we'll copy it to create my new funk and
then change the dog string for my new
funk and we print out the dog strings
and it is in fact modified second one is
the first one isn't so this seems to be
the behavior that we want so take three
now we'll try it again we're going to
modify our make class function two
before modifying the dog string also
copy the function that it's been given
and then create the class using these
new copied functions and hopefully this
should work and in fact it does so here
we have we're making Class A
Class B they both take my funk which are
the same object but because this make
class function now copies the functions
we get different docstrings for the two
different methods so all right so you
might be wondering why I haven't
mentioned metaclasses in a while given
that this is a talk on better classes
but actually the whole time I've been
talking about meta classes so Amedda
class is just any callable which means a
function or a class that has a call
method
well technically metaclass uses new but
anyways it's any callable that takes the
parameters for the class's name the cost
of spaces and the classes attributes and
so type that we were using to create
classes before is just basically the
default metaclass it just that's what
happens when to the scenes you never see
it so you never have to worry about it
and the function that we've been
developing this make cost function is
technically a meta class - I know it's
confusing because that's a function not
a not not a class but uh and so what
makes this a metaclass again it takes
these three arguments for the name basis
and attributes it that modifies those
attributes and specifically in this
particular instance by creating copies
of the functions and then modifying
their docstrings and then creates a new
class using these modified attributes
and returns the new class that's all
about a class does is it you know
intervenes on class creation time make
some adjustments and then so the class
that's returned is slightly different
than it otherwise would be so so now
python has some special syntax that we
can use so we don't actually have to so
if I go back to so we don't have to
necessarily make classes like this we
can still use our nice like class class
name parenthesis colon syntax that we're
used to we don't have to do it like that
that's a special syntax to do that oops
but Python creates classes a slightly
more complex way than the way that we've
been doing it in addition to the myfunc
or whatever attributes you define it'll
pass in special ones like
underscore underscore init underscore
underscore and various variables too so
we just I'm just adding to the for loop
here to skip special methods and non
functions so we're not going to touch
those and then here's the syntactic
sugar which is just you add this
attribute called underscore underscore
metaclass underscore underscore you set
it to whatever your metaclasses that you
want it to be so this case our make
class function and it just that's when
the class is created that's basically
like when you you know import the module
or you run that python file the class is
created and the metaclass goes through
modifies the class and so when you
actually create an instance of the class
and check the function you see that the
doc strings modified note that this is
slightly different in Python 3 the
syntax is a little bit different this is
for Python 2 7 but I'll be posting these
slides online and you can look up what
the syntax is for Python 3 ok so just to
take a step back what exactly was it
that we did I getting meta about meta
classes so again meta casas intervene on
the class creation again that's class
not instance so it's the thing that
creates instances we're changing that
thing and because we're able to
intervene on class creation we can make
some changes and in this particular case
we copied the functions change their doc
strings and then we finally created the
class using those modifications a quick
side note if you're around the code that
actually gave you and try to do the sub
classing thing it doesn't actually still
quite work but the reason is kind of a
stupid reason that I don't didn't want
to get into the details for basically
you need to the myfunc is not an
attribute that you would pass into be
because it's already an attribute of a
which is the super class so in order to
make this work you'd have to go through
manually all of the attributes of all of
the parent classes I have all of the
code on the blog post that inspired this
talk and so you can go look at it if you
really want to but I think the cool part
at all was that your
to rewrite the dark strings for the
methods that are part of their cross
originally so that's a fairly simple
example of what you might use embedded
class 4 you'll find other instances of
people using meta classes one really
commonly cited example is that django
uses metaclasses to sort of simplify the
interface so if you create a up for
example a person class which is so
forgive me if I get this wrong I have a
use Django in a long time but if you
create a person which is supposed to be
a model for like an interface to your
database or to represent you know
various like a character field enters
your field on your website if you create
that class then you actually create an
instance of the class you'll find that
the attributes aren't these like fancy
character field or integer field types
they'll just be like integers or strings
so it makes it a little bit easier to
work with these classes as a user and
all of the fancy stuff underneath is
handled by this meta class rewriting
these attributes and the source from
this is this really great Stack Overflow
answer which I highly encourage you to
go look if you you know want to find out
more about this so a word of caution
which is that meta classes can be really
hard they can make your code really hard
to understand like I get confused going
back and looking at my code that uses
meta classes and I wrote the code so if
someone else is going to go read your
code like really there you know there
are there are instances when meta
classes are very useful but you really
should only use meta classes if you
absolutely really really need to use
them and there's this great great quote
that's attributed to Tim Peters who's a
he wrote like design of Python meta
classes are deeper magic than 99% of
users should ever worry about if you
wonder whether you need them you don't
the people who actually need them know
with certainty that they need them and
they don't need an explanation about why
I think that this is true though unless
you're like me and you just like kind of
play
with the you know obscure parts of
Python and coming up with a reason to
try to play around with this so I think
like the the takeaway from this is I
totally encourage people to play around
with their own code find out about cool
things like this but if you're actually
working on you know code that's going to
be used by people and read by people
don't use metaclasses unless you are
certain that's the thing you need to be
using so that's it like I said I'm going
to be posting these slides so if you
want to go back and look at the examples
and stuff that I gave you can just go to
my website which is Jess hammer comm and
also this presentation was created with
ipython notebook which is awesome and
just automatically renders all of the
Python code etc it's great for slides
and everything else but
okay that's a lot to think about what
questions do we have for Jess just out
of curiosity have you looked at class
decorators yes
so I metaclasses like my eyes cross
class decorators like seemed pretty
obvious but it seems like there's some
some limitations are the things you can
do with medical asses you can't do with
class decorators yes so in this
particular case you could use class
decorators to to do the docstring
rewriting but then you need to use a
decorator for every single method that
you have which is kind of annoying so
yeah this is a case in which if you
don't actually want to do it for every
single method then you need to use
something like a meta class but in a lot
of cases absolutely decorators can do a
lot of stuff that you know like if you
think you need a mat a class you might
be able to do it with something like
decorators so if you have a class named
C and a method called F and you want to
rename I mean change the doc string for
it you could say CF da I am funkdoc
equals the new value and so that way you
could change the doc string in place
yeah I am funk yeah the I am funk
interesting all right did another thanks
I have one right over here
so would you consider Django's usage of
meta classes to be valid or a good use
case or just one that's confusing um I
think in this particular case it is
probably a good use of meta classes
because the way that you like create
Jango classes is a at least from my
experiences Jango it's a little bit like
use it not quite like you use Python
normally anyways and so it I think it's
probably fine but I also like don't have
enough experience with Jango to like I
give a confident answer to your question
but I think it's probably good Adam
I actually have response to that
question I think that Django does a good
job with metaclasses and it's because if
you're just using the Django API
normally you don't know it uses
metaclasses I so the the advice that you
put up there is totally valid earlier
meta meta classes are great for doing
complicated things inside of frameworks
and inside of the framework as soon as
it crosses that that end user API you're
probably doing it wrong so you don't
know they happen in Django unless you
really go into jingo internals so
awesome use great API okay thank you so
much for that great talk Jess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
