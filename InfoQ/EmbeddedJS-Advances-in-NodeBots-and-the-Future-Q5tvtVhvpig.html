keynote speaker everybody give it up for
Cassandra perch morning perfect awesome
great okay Wow a lot of you uh so I'm
sander like he said I'm going to be
talking a little bit today about
advances in node BOTS and the future of
nodebots so imagine most about what I
who I am ready I am also a developer
evangelist at authz row I like to talk
about user management and identity
management I'm a node BOTS author at a
book come out in December called
learning JavaScript robotics and this
parts a little more easy to see but I'm
a wearables enthusiast I like to build
light up clothing that connects to the
Internet so what are node BOTS the the
definition has gotten broader and
broader over the years but I think the
definition we've settled on is any
hardware to this control to via firmware
or server by javascript and/or node J s
so there's a little bit of history and
by a little bit of history i mean this
movement has really only been in place
for a little over two years now in in
force it actually started about five
years ago in 2011 a library called node
serial port was published by chris
williams the man who ran j/s comp and it
was a little hard to use if you'd never
used a serial connection before and it
was still a little cryptic so it didn't
really spur the explosion of the node
BOTS community as much as in 2013 when
Johnny fives became a thing a movement a
library this was started by Rick Waldron
but now has over a hundred regular
contributors its eponymous with node
BOTS as a community when people say node
BOTS most people think of Johnny Five
and while it is a large part of the
movement in a very important integral
even part of the movement it is still
the part it did start with just arduino
boards however the rest of history for
node BOTS is very very fast once Johnny
Five became prevalent the node BOTS
community exploded I
like to liken it to the Cambrian
explosion if you ever studied
prehistoric history the Cambrian
explosion is a timer on planet Earth the
number of species grew exponentially and
this is true of node BOTS between 2014
and now there's been a ridiculous amount
of growth from many different angles
there are now over 35 platforms
supported by Johnny Five alone arduino
particle photons tehsil our rule tehsil
to lots of different boards just
supported by Johnny Five alone and we've
gone from controlling arduino unos to
the 35 platforms on Johnny Five to
platforms being developed specifically
for JavaScript IES Perino and the tussle
in tussle too we can now control
quadcopters and other Bluetooth devices
with JavaScript and the barriers to
entry from costs to difficulty
perspectives are all dropping we've gone
from needing to purchase a forty dollars
we know uno two twenty-dollar sane smart
clones we've gone from dreaming of Wi-Fi
connectivity to a twenty-dollar particle
photon that does connect to the internet
out of the box espera no pico is twenty
dollars to run a native JavaScript
microcontroller so and from a difficulty
perspective Johnny fives documentation
has been nothing if not ironclad if you
need to learn about something a
component perhaps Johnny fives
documentation will ninety-five percent
of the time have what you need and have
documentation not just from a written
perspective but images things of how to
wire it up and the community be is super
supportive even if the documentation
does not have what you need we are
moving towards production node BOTS
slowly quickly slowly depends on your
your viewpoint I view it as quickly but
we're talking years not months these
boards are getting smaller and smaller
the spe no pico is about three quarters
of an inch square if you cut off the USB
connector samsung's our tech platform is
12 millimeter square and contains
bluetooth le and Wi-Fi connectivity
and can be controlled with node we're
getting closer to production level node
BOTS another explosion of the node BOTS
community has been software we're
starting to write some amazing software
and not just from the perspective of
controlling node BOTS johnny-five while
it has exceeded many people's
expectations for controlling different
platforms and devices is not the only
not the only part of this show we have
while Johnny Five is using varying
methods to connect the board you can use
bluetooth serial connections now with
johnny five instead of just using a USB
port it is a very good starting point
for beginners again with the
documentation in the community around it
the documentation is robust as ever and
the community is extraordinarily active
I have never seen a day go by where the
Gator channel didn't inform me that some
conversation was going on that had to do
with the library we also have an amazing
effort to kind of subvert the existing
tool chains so for those familiar with
arduino development there's a library
called AVR dude and it's written in C
it's 20 years old and it's used to flash
Arduino compiled Arduino code onto an
Arduino board Suze Hinton who is amazing
nooope cat on twitter check out her
profile she's subverting the AVR tool
chain in JavaScript she's written a VR
girls wash Arduino which can flash i
believe about 10 different arduino
boards with precompiled arduino code all
in nodejs and fermata party is one of my
favorites because now in the in the
first few days first few years even of
Johnny Five when you wanted to get
started you had to download the Arduino
IDE this is over a hundred megabytes and
on conference Wi-Fi when you're running
a workshop of 50 people trying to get
them all the download a over 100
megabyte file can be volatile at best
and for model party is just a couple of
Meg's and can do the same thing we no
longer need to download the Arduino IDE
just to get started with Johnny Five
Johnny 5 chrome is something I'm super
excited about created by luis montes
this allows us to run Johnny Five bots
in the browser we do not need a node
server to run Johnny 5 BOTS the
implications on the education front
alone for this initiative are staggering
instead of having to worry about setting
up servers and teaching kids how to
program node we give them a Chromebook
and a cheap microcontroller which
reduces the cost from an education
standpoint to a very small fraction of
what it was before babble BOTS I've been
playing with this library what it does
is you give it a JSON description of
your build and it spits out what I call
a thin client a thin client is a layer
of see that communicates with a node
server in order to create a complete
robot both of my wearables are running
babble BOTS programs and works on some
components with the particle photon I've
mostly focused on neopixels and RGB
color sensors and a couple of types of
LED though I do have the firmware now or
you can set any pin to any value over a
node server with babble BOTS and it
doesn't just stop at microcontrollers we
have libraries for drones and quad
copters bluetooth leap motion
controllers video game controllers if
you can plug it into a USB port there's
a pretty decent chance you can use that
device with JavaScript but what makes
all of this work what caused this
Cambrian explosion what causes all the
software to keep popping up what causes
us to be such a great environment for
beginners people that's really what it
all boils down to software is so much
more than code software is us we are so
we are without us there is no software
without people we cannot create new
things um we have codes of conduct on
everything in node BOTS the contributor
Covenant was just applied to Johnny 5
the robots working group for node has a
code of conduct and our get er channels
also have
codes of conduct and we all take
responsibility for enforcement we are
all there to make sure that we have a
good environment for our contributors
for our learners for everyone we are
open and supportive we encourage every
inventor it doesn't matter if their
project seems I don't know useless to
you it doesn't matter if it seems like
something you wouldn't do you encourage
every inventor we try not to say it's so
simple or just do this or don't do it
that way when someone approaches is with
a problem it's hard yes but empathy is
hard being a good human being is hard
and we try every time to do that we
there's no such thing as noobs only
those willing to learn considering
linode BOTS movement only started in
2013 none of us have more than three
years experience with node BOTS except
maybe Rick so who are we to judge we
have supportive an active diversity we
reach out to your communities in order
to bring them into the environment we
create a safe space to learn and we
constantly recognize that as a community
we can always do better we can always
watch out we can always watch ourselves
a little better we can always be better
I hear a lot of people tell me oh well I
just take the people who push the best
code no you don't have to choose between
people and code if you encourage and
support good people good code will
follow there is nothing on this earth I
detest more than hearing oh well they
push good code even though there are a
terrible person we don't need them we
can we can get along without them so
that's something I really want to
emphasize is that we do not need to
choose between good code and good people
if we encourage if we create a good
space for good people good code will
follow we have a strong emphasis on
education in the node BOTS community our
documentation is required in johnny-five
when you can when you put in a new
component it is
a I believe it's still unwritten but
your pull request you will be asked you
put documentation for whatever new
component whatever new platform you put
in because we need that documentation
nodebots days are not so much geared as
come show off the cool thing that you've
made but more come learn about node BOTS
you you haven't you know how tried it
out come try it out with a group of us
will teach you well I'll learn together
education is at the core of everything
we do there are about those misspelled
workshops meet uh there are three
workshops I believe this week for node
BOTS we do is geared towards education
and yes all of this is hard watching
what you say is hard being inclusive is
hard reaching out to new communities is
hard but we must as a group put in the
effort and it is worth every second of
effort that we expend because we are
doing nothing but making our communities
better by performing this outreach by
working hard by making ourselves better
so I have a couple demos obviously so
what about here is my jacket and my belt
if you go to that URL you can change the
colors on the devices right sleeve
decided to throw a temper tantrum and is
offline but left sleeve hood and
controller are all online and the belt
is online you can also go on Twitter and
tweet at the hashtag notice sash with a
CSS parsable color of any kind and it
will also add the color to the belt q so
I'm sure my colors are changing as I
speak so another thing the jacket can do
is I have this little controller and the
reason i brought my comfort sitting up
here is i have attached an RGB sensor to
the jacket and so if i go up close to my
conference hoodie i can change all the
light colors on my jacket to that color
i can also this is an accelerometer
built into the shield and the pitch and
roll of the accelerometer change the
color of the sleeve and
hood respectively and then i have what i
call a rainbow fun time because it's
just rainbows because we always need
more rainbows let me show you a little
bit of the code this is my this is the
particle ide for a reference and i'm
gonna this is the code for the jacket
this is the C code I did make a couple
tweaks to it but um ninety-five percent
of this byline was created by JavaScript
by a JavaScript library called babble
bots which trans
see to get this exactly the way I wanted
it and it is quite a bit of firmware in
the jacket I also have the code for the
belt on here way too many pieces of code
in here and then close that and this is
the code for the belt this is a hundred
percent babble BOTS so this was I have
not touched this code this was entirely
generated by JavaScript and so that's
the site hmm neat so uses web sockets so
as you could see up there it said hey
something's wrong with the socket it'll
tell you if one of the devices is
offline and not allow you to select it
anymore yeah you can do any CSS possible
color in this field see if I can still
type I can and now I've added Becca
purple to the belt and you can see it
it's a basically each ring represents a
color of the queue the first one to show
up is the next color to get out of the
queue first-in first-out sort of style
so and then my my node code what you
what you probably came here to see this
is my server um essentially i'm setting
up a twitter client that's to control
the belt I'm then telling particle to
log in and list my devices and telling
it that the belt is the device with
named belt and I'm setting up some
events when the belt is refreshed what
that means is when the belt has all of
its colors and it sent them back to the
server tell the browser to refresh the
color list offline and online to detect
when a device is offline same with
jacket and then I've got update colors
which calls add color which so photons
are interesting devices you can write
functions in C and then give them a rest
like interface you can tell particle I
want this function to be callable from
the internet I want to be able to pass
it a parameter and then I want it to run
this chunk of C code so what I did with
babble BOTS is is it ok I've got
neopixels I want one of my custom
functions to be I want to
ass and index and colors and change the
colors of every neopixel after that
index to whatever color is being sent in
the strength so these are calling those
functions and the way it keeps track of
the colors on the server is it uses
particle variables which are like
particle functions except I'm saying
publish this variable to the particle
cloud so I can go get it so I can go
take this variable and keep track of it
for instance if you were making a
weather station you might make your what
the readings from your temperature
sensor into a particle variable so you
could access it from your node server
okay and then at the bottom here i have
my twitter situation so again i'm
searching for the node sash hashtag and
then basically fun regular expressions
to detect many of the different types of
CSS parsable colors I then have a second
catch for CSS color words such as Becca
purple lemon chiffon lighter blue and
that's my server just a little under two
hundred lines of code to get all of this
working and yeah that's what I've got
from a code perspective so now I'm gonna
go back to my slides if I can find there
we go the question I regularly get about
my node BOTS projects or any new
advanced projects oh that's cool but
what are they worth are you ever gonna
start a business with these or are you
ever gonna sell them more yeah the thing
about that is monetarily who gives a
hoot what these are worth I the monetary
value from the side projects from the
node box community it could be nil and
I'd be okay with that because I don't
focus on that and aside about side
projects is related to this and that um
i asked the node box community what do
you love about node BOTS what makes you
excited to continue participating in
this community and far and away the most
exciting responses I got the new most
numerous response I got was that it
revitalize the lost interest in both
participating in an open source
community and coding in general quite a
few of us in the node BOTS community
have experienced burnout I myself was
about to quit tech when I found node
BOTS and I am on 110 percent convinced
that node BOTS and the community therein
is the only reason I'm standing on this
stage is the only reason I'm still in
tech and I think there's quite a few of
us in the community that feel that way
we've formed new friendships and again
because we push each other to be better
push each other to be good as a
community and push each other to work
hard we flex that empathy muscle empathy
is hard because empathy is a muscle you
must work it you must continue to try
and push yourself harder to be
more empathetic to other people because
yes it is hard but it is worth it the
word I get from my toy side projects is
every day I wake up knowing i have
friends fun things to build and the help
i need to keep doing better the tech
community can be toxic and can wear you
down and it had worn me down having a
community in which i feel state safe as
a contributor as a member has
revitalized my passion just for software
development and for being me so the
presence is pretty great I mean I can
stand up here with these garments that
are lit up and connected to the internet
we can build amazing things right now
with JavaScript but where are we going
the future can be just as exciting as
the present because of our emphasis on
inclusion in education nodebots to see
nothing but growth and i sincerely
believe we will continue to grow as a
community whether we will always be node
BOTS is questionable but whether we will
always be a community I do not question
I see us sticking together the future of
node is very closely tied with the
future of node bus as you all know we
went through a huge rift when we
winnowed became a fort window joined a
foundation when no join the Linux
Foundation and had its own board I
remember hearing this and thinking well
this could go one of two ways node could
get forked eight times and we'll just
kind of fizzle out into non-existence or
we can come out of this stronger luckily
we've come out of this much stronger
node now has LT esas no now has support
periods you can walk up to your boss's
boss's boss and say yes we do have a
support window we do have everything
that makes us enterprise-ready you know
with definitions of that varying between
companies with the inclusion working
group inclusivity working group I
believe we've made a good step in
towards making towards making node a
better place node BOTS is getting there
and now note is starting to get there
and I have to say Ashley Williams making
the
bored as a community member fantastic
she will do wonderful things for node
and wonderful things for the community
and she definitely inspired a lot of
hope from me and hopefully for many of
you about the future of node in general
so the number one question I always get
when talking about the future is what we
have production node BOTS soon and my
bet is yes like I said the Arctic is one
pose 12 millimeter square contains
bluetooth le and Wi-Fi connectivity and
can be controlled by node they are
currently in their Developer Preview
stage I'm trying to get my hands on a
board the tassel to is started shipping
its pre-orders it is a $35 node native
controller so you can code for in node
with no translation layer it also has a
Johnny Five wrapper and the photon is
designed to create your own products and
reincorporate they're open source design
into your product and while it does
still run on a sea firmware you can
create a thin client that runs off a
node server and get to about eighty-five
percent JavaScript so we're getting
there and we're getting there quickly
but if there's one thing you take away
from this talk it's not how cold
neopixels are and it's not how cool
robots are it's this the present is
great and the future is even brighter
but we must keep working hard to make
things better we must keep making things
better thank you for listening I'm
Cassandra arch both of those emails work
and no I'm no botanist on twitter if you
have any questions I will be
participating in the robotics panel
later this afternoon and once again
thank you for listening
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
