thank you Paul I want you to thank all
the organizers for you know putting this
up and then you sucker for seen the
event in a very cool place I think and
tonight I will talk about our robot now
that you may have heard about like on
videos and things like that is getting
pretty famous so let's start first
everything started in the city of Paris
in around 2005 so in case you haven't
guessed yet we are French if you cannot
tell from my accent so we came all the
way from Paris to San Francisco for this
event and a few other ones and so it
started like almost all stories with an
idea so the guy you see on the screens
is our CEO movie nominee and he had this
crazy idea to build robots but not
robots like you know with wheels or
robots or factories or whatever he
wanted to make humanoid robots and at
that time it was a very cool idea and
very new because if you think about it
like 2005 it was around the first
iPhones for instance so when everybody
was focusing on smartphones this guy
wanted to make robots and again we
didn't choose like the easy way to make
a robot with will know that we wanted to
make like a a real robot that can walk
which is actually very difficult and
with arms and anyway humanoid robot so
we had a few iteration started with the
early prototypes that you might see al 0
0 1 as but again from the beginning you
can see that this first prototype has
legs so it was planned from the very
beginning and we went through several
iterations until we get a design that
hasn't changed much since al 5 so it's
it's been so seven six
it's been seven years almost eight and
the robot hasn't changed much actually
so this is a really cool design and in
was chosen in such a way that the robot
actually looks kinda cute nice and it's
kind of universal
like if you show this robot in any
country in the world what would be like
aww it's so cute especially girls and
the cheetah
children like it oh come on it's true
right we have pictures to prove that and
we came up with like almost the final
design in 2008 so I told you we're
French so one of the first use case we
had was to make him play soccer so
actually it's a kind of worldwide
project called the robot cap and the
goal is to make robots playing guests
against humans around the year 2050 so
we want robots to playing as humans and
actually win the game so we're a little
far from that now but we that kind of
crazy goal the organizers wanted to
achieve and you have many people all
around the world buying our robots and
playing again against each other every
year in different countries like read
the World Cup so there are other leagues
but we have the robot for the standard
league and a little interesting story I
will talk about this later but we have
two cameras one here and one in the
mouth and the one the math was added you
know so that the robot can actually see
the ground while looking around because
the first game were like the robot you
know was looking around him and you know
moving and then looking like this and
and I was kind of boring so that's a fun
fact and as time went by we had a few
other cases that we didn't react so what
you see is a picture with autistic
children like it was very random but we
realized that children especially
autistic children had a very good
connection with robots because you know
that the main issue is to interact with
humans but actually pretty easy for them
to to work with robots and
no because first this is not a human so
they understand that this is something
different but also we can make the robot
like repeat the same thing like a
hundred times and not getting bored and
things like that which is very difficult
for humans sometimes I'm sure like you
have a called a cat or a dog
you know how it's like so this is one of
our use cases right now
and apart from now because it's his name
I haven't said it we also have a
European project or homeo and the goal
is to have a robot which is high like
this and like much more powerful like
with kind of big muscles to carry on
heavy tasks and very like taller which
is actually also a problem for us
because you know when you design that
kind of thing it's it cannot be very
dangerous but when you start building
robots that are very are bigger and more
powerful we don't want them like to hurt
you and there will be catastrophic for
us and that's something we are working
on is very very new for us and we this
project is actually very nice because
it's a European project with lots of
European companies laboratories and all
that the goal is to get something like
this so it's our dream is to have robots
in your house helping you doing stuff
you don't want to do like washing dishes
I'm sure nobody ever relaxed washing
dishes I mean I don't but that's our
goal and we were getting you know each
day a little closer so if we look at
this so in my company one two three
satisfied because it's sealed you know
small and we have lots of room and all
that but when we look backwards like
when we were five years ago it's very
impressing because so many things have
changed and we also get a clearer idea
of where we are going and we have new
questions and now we don't care so much
while we still do but we don't care so
much about hardware and software but we
also have some marketing philosophical
and all kinds of questions that were not
like
our main concern like five years ago so
it's kinda cool now even people who want
to take this robot to Mars so that was
kind of unexpected and they're going to
do it or not but I can understand
because I wouldn't go to go I wouldn't
go to Mass with a Roomba for instance we
get pretty boring although there is a
rough dust but that's cool Yahoo and
this is us today so we start in Paris
when I joined the company we were like
30 people now we're more like 350
employees worldwide so we have offices
in Boston I know we have nothing in
California it's a shame but we're
working on it
and we also have offices in Shanghai and
Tokyo which is not really surprising I
think so I told you we had many projects
and we we mainly sell robots to geeks
well we have what is called the
Developer Program we also sell robust to
universities you know they really work
with a robot like to have some kind of
workshops with students and all that we
have researchers who are doing all kinds
of stuff with the robot so this kind of
robot because again is human so they
were working on interaction emotions and
so dynamics things like that
so this is our main business right now
so we have more than 6,000 users
worldwide I think we have sold like
5,000 robots in the beginning something
like this of course some of them are
broken right now but still oh yeah and
that's the actually the last figures
more than 4,000 and I will talk to you
about Matt this guy so this picture was
taken in the South Pole because a
researcher was going for a very long
mission like I think was a year so he
took his robot with him and he actually
went to take a picture with the Penguins
so that was kind of fun
yeah
so instead of music and even that's good
like a pro thousand brothers and sisters
amuse all around the world in
universities and research laboratory do
you want more technical details yes
counting every articulation in my body
and I need to detect obstacles but I
might encounter my two cameras give me
an opening sucker around my head allow
me to detect the origin of sounds nearby
well I think about it there are four
forest sensitive resistors
under each of my feet survive with my
inertial sensor they keep my balance I
can use some legs by the way you can
take be Charles for the moment thank you
for listening to me thank you
do you want something yeah so in the in
you know when you have robots playing
football like I'm in soccer
sorry I'm European you really want them
you know to be able to get up on the
fall because they often fall during the
games and that's an important use case
so I said we work in on human with
robots
so that's important that we don't want
to make humans this is not our goal we
want to make robots there are kind of
human like humans but there are real
robots and that's important because they
are able to do all kinds of stuff we we
cannot so like you're not really
equipped with ultrasounds for instance
and you have that memory that CPU like
that powerful and thing like that so we
are more you know like thinking about it
as a new space see for instance that you
know trying to make the same things as
humans like in a very global way so we
are we how would I put it we want to
make robots we don't want to make humans
so anyway this is basically what he said
what I'm going to review all this with
three more comments so we have twenty
five degrees of freedom so we
models in the neck shoulders elbow wrist
hips knees ankles we have yes so you can
control the motors complex movement
again it's capable of playing soccer and
you know to keep his balance
and doing things like this interaction
because that's a very important thing
for us we want the robot to be able to
interact with humans so we have two
loudspeakers and I know it's not very
logical but they are in the ears that's
the problem actually and we have
microphones that are here here and on
the side so you know when people want to
talk to the robot the ways talk to the
ears which is actually not always a good
idea because when there is some sound
coming out when the robot is not
understanding anything
so it's let's say a design issue and
that's one of the thing we didn't we
think about at first so we have LEDs
pretty much everywhere so on the scale
cap in the ears the eyes it's off so
we're still have some LEDs here on the
feet you cannot see them but it's mainly
to to know the temperature of the motors
and things like that to get some
feedback took tyre sensor on the head so
it's a capacitive sensor that can be
used to interact with the robot but this
is like more work around because I
really would like to interact with the
robot the way I interact with you like I
talk and I'm not touching your head when
I want you to do something not sure that
would work so same with the buttons and
all that so we have hands like very
basic hands that are just able to do
like to grab grasp something we were
thinking about getting hands with more
fingers but there was like the first try
and it's kind of successful infrared
sensors so you can actually use a remote
with the robot but again is some kind of
technology from the past so we are
thinking about removing them
so they're here by the way in the ice we
have Wi-Fi connection of course and
Ethernet - so it's located I'm going to
put this down on the back of the head
it's hidden so we have a USB port and
you can plug in Ethernet cable stop
moving
sorry yes
stop moving
yes he's reacting to sound right now
because as he said he has four
microphones so he's trying to look
whether the sound comes from so when I
talk and I'm trying to do something with
his head it's kind of painful since yeah
as I said - HD cameras for microphones
so the FS sauce for those who don't know
our sensors under the feet so that robot
knows when you know he's standing when
his feet are not touching the ground we
have an inertial sensor which is really
cool I will try to make it work or later
because I want to screw everything up
right now we have bumpers here so it was
many designs that robot when the robot
eats the war for instance he knows about
it
and so when he plays soccer and he is
shooting in the ball it also knows about
it get some feedback and so now's our
here ultrasound so you can detect
obstacles like if the robot is going
close to wall it knows about it the way
like bats do and think between quotes we
have an atom CPU which is getting kinda
old so we're working on a new version we
have one gig of ram which is also
getting crowded a little and we have
flash memory and while the software suit
is what you used to program this robot
because as the robot said itself it's
fully programmable so you can basically
use all the sensors I talked about you
can control the motors you can do pretty
much everything you want that's
physically possible
yeah so I want to try something and it's
a fail okay so in this mode you didn't
detect the fault but you should have
stopped it surprising no no it doesn't
uh it does so I detected the fall and
he's going to get up go on this table
I'm not so sure yeah
now he wants to sit no he wants to get
up yeah so I was very fun so when you
are doing a presentation if the robot
Falls it's not really a problem because
then the robot tries to get up and
actually it's better thing for the
audience because like oh I can get up
and everything so you can never screw up
presentation with this guy which is
relaxing no so actually be before you
arrived maybe some people were here the
robot fell from the table that's one
being careful and it still arrived right
it's not broken but like five years ago
when the robot would fall you would get
all pcs everywhere and like that one of
my first day at LD bhai I made a road
fault and there was there were pcs all
over the place and I was so worried like
yeah yeah it's normal
that's fun okay I guess that's pretty
much it for so as I say we have a bigger
version called homeo which is a meteor
and 58 centimeters high I don't know
anything about your units so I will let
you convert it in inches yards or
whatever
although yard is kind of big and yeah so
our goal now is to get something bigger
than can do more interesting things
because it's very small it doesn't have
like a lot of power to
carry things and all that so we take it
as a prototype a cute prototype working
prototype but this is not enough and
it's not where we want to go okay only
by the way the batteries behind so we
have between 45 minutes and then I want
to half of autonomy because we didn't
rework on that that's also something we
want to improve all right so let's move
next so for the rest of presentation I
will use this one which is not in a life
mode so you see won't take pictures are
you done I will do that later in life
yeah it's life now we'll use this one
which is completely number so the other
from the same generation exactly the
same you can tell the generation from
the karach like we started with blue red
green orange now it's blue no all right
it's not life so let's get more
technical it was like a basic overview
to make you listen lots of things but
most of you are developers I guess and
you are interested in how things work so
we have software running in the head we
have two CPUs we have a ARM processor in
the chest which is mainly used as like
how do you call that in English the
novel no you know what you just another
like nervous system novel system in our
system okay so it's it's basically
detecting like as I said inertial data
and making all the models move and all
that and we have the head
and they had used mostly for processing
data from the sensors like oh I'm
falling and okay I see a human and all
that and the atom processor is in the
head and this is where we run our
software so you cannot access the chest
and our software is like a framework
which is called now key so maybe some of
you have studied or know Japanese and
Chinese so I think it Chinese it's Chi
it's like the soul something like this
so this is basically the sort of now and
our software is organizing modules so we
have many modules so I have a list here
al memory which is like a global memory
of the robot short-term memory we have
motion which is like the module used to
to deal with dynamics make the robot
move we have text to speech so you just
feed him some text and make him speak
speech recognition so you can talk to
robot in the robot we understand and
know the way you use Siri for instance
video device you know Julia with cameras
battery face detection because you know
through the cameras you can recognize
you well at least you can train him to
recognize you all the sauce localization
is what you saw moments ago with the
other robot you know he was looking in
direction of the noise since I'm the
only one noisy here was only looking at
me navigation so we're working on making
this robot like walk in your apartment
and remember where is that the kitchen
bathroom and all that and avoid
obstacles so audio player to play sound
and lots of other features I just listed
the main ones and what is cool that you
can write and add your own if you are
motivated well and if you want to I mean
you don't need to be motivated but and
so each module is like a running object
and this object has an API so for
instance the memory module has some
methods to insert data in memory get
data to raise events you know
so we have like a globalised even system
on to which you can subscribe so to take
the martian module but i send you and
dynamic of the robot you have the walk
to api so if you you can walk to with
the parameters you know the angle and
distance and all that the robot we go to
where you said the leads if you want to
control the intensity of the leds make
them fade and all that and so for each
module i said we have an api that is
available documentation and take this
software again as a framework upon which
you can build applications so this
software is not doing anything is just
available and what you've seen the life
of the robot it's just an application
built on top of our framework on now key
so we this is this is a little technical
but just to let you know how it works we
implement modules as dynamic libraries
our main modules are written in c++
because we need something like first we
want that to to be very fast efficient
and this is our main language at a Libba
home but the nice thing is you can write
modules in any language almost any
language you want so we have been
supported by them from the very
beginning and we even went through the
Ruby Python wall and Python one like
everywhere else but you can also I will
show you Java I also have some
JavaScript bindings and our framework
was designed in you know in such a way
that we would like to open source it so
it's not that clean right now so I can
ashame but we're gonna do it soon and
you know people can write their own
bindings for instance like you're doing
a c-sharp you won't write your bindings
and make them available for like your
community
but first we have this idea that some
talented people might have very good
ideas for robots it might not be
developers so we almost from the
beginning we worked we started working
on a GUI called choreograph that can be
used to make the robot do things but
very easily so as you can see on the
screen we have like three kind of paints
although you can have a lot more see is
a virtual view of your robot so if you
have no robot then you see just like a
kind of simulator and if you have the
robot the the 3d view here we just be in
the position euro but physically is
physically physically is B is like your
work space in which we put the boxes
that are in the a pain so we have stand
up boxes that are designed and doing
like atomic actions like talk get up I
want to catch this sensor for instance
and this GUI were again was designed to
to make to let 200 people wanna three
developers one of geeks to you to play
with the robot so this morning we were
with Stefan chin that you probably know
and we went to a school and we were with
children and those children after maybe
I don't know 10 15 minutes washed able
to design behaviors and play them on the
robot and make him do things there were
three awesome it's very powerful and how
it works is it's like basically a flow
diagram one box when one box is over it
has some outputs and it regards the neck
box so I'm gonna show you a little how
it works so this is the view of my robot
so as I said the 3d view is in the
position of the robot and you can see
that the camera that is actually looking
at you right now you can smile
and we're going to play a little with
the boxes on the left so we want to say
something so we just drop the say box
and this is the beginning of the
behavior and this is the end that's very
nice
like it took me three seconds to build
something that actually make the robot
talk yeah this is the kind of hello
world so it's very nice because for
people we don't know anything about
computer sciences they can actually play
with the robot and design things so we
find it pretty cool and it's usually
very rewarding because we see that the
users quickly understand how it works
and be nice stuff like we were in Poland
three three weeks ago right one months
ago and we had people are you know
working on the soap opera with two
robots like we were married and arguing
and all that and so they had never
played with the robot before but they
were like you to create something like a
small movie and played in front of
everybody that was kind of fun so how it
works so you can see the wires and it's
it's it's a sequence so so what could I
use LEDs maybe I don't know let's say
blink so
and tell from the way this thing look
that after saying something the LEDs
will blink hopefully listen so it's very
sequential but you can do like more
powerful stuff like react on events so
if I used sensing boxes like tactile
head so you can see that you have
several output boxes so the first one is
when the box is over but we don't care
in that case the first interesting one
is the front touched so you cannot
really see it but we have actually three
different areas for touching so we have
front middle and back so I can design a
small application that will be triggered
when we hit the front tactile sensor so
this is what I'm doing put everything
all together
hello so in three boxes I have something
that reacted to each there are events
where else can I show you I'll be very
cool
so we can also make him speak his name
for instance so I'm going to use the
output of one box and fit it to another
one so we don't need that anymore
so let's still keep that
you know so his name is now because you
can also give him like a bad name which
is different from the factory name you
know to recognize him on a network when
you have several robots and on that and
in that case so it's a type output so
you can see that the type of the output
is trained and luckily the sate Xbox
also takes a string and we have we are
handled many types of data like in
strings like bear events like no value
and all that and we heard so so sometime
you want to to patch a box or to create
your own boxes and this interface
actually completely supports Python so
you can write your own boxes in Python
right now we are only supporting Python
but we would like in the near future to
have other languages available so I
would say Java of course but we want it
to be more generic that what it
currently is but we never had a need for
that because you know we felt like
Python was enough at that time many way
you can write your own boxes yeah
everything yeah so the Python code
descends to the robot and the robot has
the Python interpreter in that case if
we run it
how could you process he proposed
process or that kind of thing but it's
not executed on my machine it's on the
robot side and you can yeah we can do
more interesting stuff like speech
recognition for instance speech Rico so
I think yes Oh
let's try this so I'm gonna make him
listen to me and repeat what I say
Robert didn't understand try in Robert
so it understood something
and so I know there is a way then to get
your youngest to text
you know so it understood yes actually
instead of robots which is writing human
that's very successful but anyway we
have specific conditions working you
know when I was trying to launch the
presentation and things like that but of
course it's it's a demo it's not going
to work right you don't know that I
actually know but ya know it's very fun
to see people in Paris working on the
English side and you know speak English
with a French accent and try to get
noticed by the robot it's actually
something very fun and now they have
this kind of you know robotic English
accent because they know how to get on
this by the robot speaking of which we
are we handle like 15 languages 19
English France Spanish Japanese Chinese
polish lots of different languages and
we have started working it with new ones
I'm showing the new ones from working
for the iPhone and I'd like that number
one in the world and we are going to to
have a new voice specially crafted for
us and for the robot so it should be
coming very soon that it's very nice
because the English voice right now is
not that good I'm sure you you've
noticed
so anyway this choreograph and it can be
used not only like to play with the
robot but you can design like real big
applications so I know that for me at
least made me Fourier so it's kind of
weird because you know we like dumping
codes and running nice programs nice
files using some weird editor but it's
actually very nice to build a program
with this software because you focus on
the essential I can haven't shown this
but you can make groups of boxes and you
just design the input the output and you
have like a high-level overview about
what the robot is going to do and that's
actually surprising because I never
realized who is but it made me
understand that sometimes you just want
to focus on the architecture and for
that this tool is very nice it can also
be used to when you're done so of course
we send
applications of robot and play it but we
can also build a package and that
package is like how would I say the
exported format for the application so
you can share it with friends you can
put it on our store I would talk a
little more about this later so anyway
this was choreographed and we have many
boxes like stop behavior it's like
starting an application you can use
infrared motion what else so the posters
are you can make him sit you can they
stand up and like go to predefined
postures system memory trackers oh we
are we also have trackers so the robot
can recognize things so like by default
ball or face but we you can also train
him to recognize forms like what we had
in Poland was a guy he he would make the
robot recognize his shoes with a Nike
logo and hitch time he would show that
the robot is shoe the robots would say
how you have nice shoes said that was
very fun and very easy to do yeah thing
is pretty much it or you can also use
like if you can't think differently you
can you still have like control
structures like if you if all the loops
and all that anyway all the features of
the robots are available as boxes in
this software oh yeah I forgot to say
something like you can put things in
parallel like mmm maybe not this one but
okay I'm going to try to make him stand
up you just probably by the idea of them
so what your thing is going to do okay
so he's going to stand up and talk at
the same time see probably stop because
the application stopped because it's
rich and so now it's stuck in a funny
way I'm going to and stiffen it anyway
you can have a lot of some fun with this
robot
okay that's it going back to my slides
so our framework now key is built upon a
new library that we have entirely
written from scratch which is called key
messaging and it's designed as I said to
be like complete across language you can
write your own bindings on top of this
and make any language talk to the robot
but it wasn't designed to be a robot
framework what we do is you have you can
create services on the network and
register them to a service directory and
they can then be used by anybody in any
language because I said this cross
language and it's a way to expose to
bind objects on the network and objects
with an API and all that it's actually
pretty cool and that's the thing we want
to open-source so how does it work so
you would see like snippets of code but
an application is just something we need
to create you know to start of the event
loops and all that it's not very
interesting and a session is a
connection to a robot or to a key
messaging network so you first connect
to the service directory and you say
okay I want the text-to-speech module
and the service directory will tell you
okay this is the address and then you
can connect to that module and access
all the api's it's fully introspect able
and again cross-platform because it has
to work
like it can work on Mac index windows
and that also the product are used by
the choreograph software to talk to the
robot it's the protocol used internally
in the head of the robot between all the
modules and all that and again that's
something we rewrote ourselves think
about it as a way to advertise a service
some yes none right so we share like
some common ideas like you need services
on the network and you need to access
them but apart from that we show nothing
yeah but we are not so interested in
Ross right now we like we have no point
in working with that it's a good
question like it could be a rustic
equivalent but with different
philosophies and so the way you will
work with the robot is you will get so
if you are developing on a very low
level layer you will get proxies to
those modules so for those we don't know
a proxy is like an object that we act as
a mirror of something else and you talk
to that object locally and we do all the
networking to talk to the real module
and next has a real API so you never
know if a module is in the same process
as you or if it's remote if it's in the
robot if it's outside if it's in the web
you never know so I'm going to talk a
little bit about Java because this is
what we were here for it's never really
been a priority for us because so I
think Java from beginning didn't rip
initiate from a strong support in our
company and he had like a very bad
reputation for how many software
I mean I can I know some people are
wouldn't agree with ultra Java cows and
all that but you know when we were
thinking about Java we're like okay it's
very heavy and we have at that time we
had a very bad process but very bad CPU
and all that so we it wasn't our first
choice why we moved to Python but now we
are starting to consider right this
because so first there are very big
communities are one
the world yeah like a strongman power it
was the most successful languages and of
course Android changes are things so the
typical would case should be to use the
key messaging framework on the phone to
talk to robot and develop an application
that would be like you know a remote for
instance you won't tell robot ok get up
sit down bring me some beer something
like this and this is why we need some
people are interested but you would
typically write this in Java and this is
why we need Java bindings so we started
working on it like maybe six months ago
so it's Nasri mature and we it's
actually not easy to find like the
perfect developer felt that can afford
because our framework is very low level
and we have a hard time finding somebody
would be like at the same time a sip
espresso expert and a Java expert so
with these things in our way although
we're not really like Java experts you
you you will see well anyway I will talk
about this little later but if you are
very good in Java and C++ we're hiring
but yeah but not exactly the same way
but we talk about this later on and it's
like yeah
so as I said we are ranked but we are in
Paris so but Paris is Paris and San
Francisco so shouldn't be an issue
so this is a very short example of hello
world so as I said you need to create an
application but we don't care about this
and you create the session so as I said
the session is the connection to the
network and you would connect to the
service directory to see where all the
the first request will go like okay I
want this service so so we first connect
and then we have so everything is
asynchronous in our framework so you
have we have like a kind of future
mechanism I'm sure you know about this
so future aka promises AKG found objects
and kind of thing
so basically make the call and returns
right away
then you need to wait or you can have
the callback to get the result later and
this is so this is one of our very bad
ideas which was to name a proxy object
and from time to time it gives us some
very headache
I apologize publicly for my company so
we create a text to speak object and we
will call the session that service
method to get the proxy to text speech
and then we can call the same method
with the right parameters so I'm not
lying okay
yep I'm not spoiling everything so this
is the code I just showed you with
earlier improvement at the last line
this is Java code and we provide the
Java framework with a version for the
the CPU of the robot which is just Intel
Atom processor but also for your own a
machine like you can run the Java on
your computer for instance because I
said you know you can connect the robot
without your inside or outside never
makes a real difference and so we
provide a jar for key messaging which
contains like the application object
session future everything I told you
about and once you have your editor
setup and all that you can just hit play
and this is working right now though we
don't ship with a runtime environment
for Java in the robot although we're
going to fix it soon but we are
struggling with other problems as I said
the CPU is getting very old and we are
trying to do too many things when we
have a robot working in the life mode
you know recognizing faces processing
processing sound and all that so we are
waiting for a new version of CPU to
a low running Java and other stuff but
you can still do it like you just ssh to
the robot and you start the JVM yourself
and all that and I works the problem so
it's not really complicated in if you
want to build an application you will
get other proxies you need on all the
services like again motion to make him
move the legs to make him do crazy
things with his eyes and ears and all
that and then you would use those
proxies with all the methods are listed
in our documentation and you can build
very nice applications like we have
people telling stories with that for
instance like the we have the 3
Musketeers we have Star Wars and we
always show them some people are doing
very interesting stuff so I'm going to
show you another example take picture so
how does it work
so if you look at the main method so we
first get an application I said
so the util dot get session is just some
boilerplate boilerplate code sorry to
get the session connected to the robot
and on that then we call we create to
take a picture object and we call the
run method so as I said you know you
just get the the proxies to all the
modules you need then you call wake up
wake up is to make the robot so right
now is his ID or is not doing anything
with wakeup will stiffen all the joints
and all that rest is a so first wake up
say smile so if you look at the safe
smart code you just called the same
method and it's yes to make him say
something oops
and then will make him take a picture so
if you just write a little of the code
I'm sure you understand why right does
and that's why I'm going to run right
now
yes so some people made experiment of
plugging a pico projector in the head on
USB that's pretty cool but it's it's not
very efficient because you know when
you're outside for instance where do you
project you
so we're also interested in have you
heard about Leia no it's it's a device
you know they just sprinkle some steam
and the eyeball to send lights right and
you have like a real screen yeah not for
your organ because only 2d but you have
a screen that's pretty cool anyway so if
he doesn't love the internet connection
I probably have received something I
will soon because we have a 3G router so
I'll let you know if it comes anyway you
can see the picture and was like a very
short code using a few things like
stiffening your necks that robot looks
right in front of him and talking a
little bit it's like so I don't know the
number of lines but maybe like 150 lines
it's very very simple and you know that
that's it I don't have any cool Java
stuff to show you because we have
something very generic like you get
proxies you call methods right now what
we need is like a real Java layer to
make things done in a more Java way and
I forgot this slide anyway yeah so this
is the current status as I said the Java
philosophy are our bindings can be
improved and that's a euphemism because
you brought some bunch of geeks in Java
is cool so let's try to do something but
I've never really been a Java expert of
I've done more like C++ I was a counter
programmer for VMware so let's say that
Java is not like my men domain of
expertise
or so we don't have a very good
integration with ideas we need to to set
up a lot of things and I protect clips
and you know as I said our application
layer doesn't support Java
you cannot write applications in Java
right now and launch them right away you
need to hack a little bit in the system
South gvm and all that
copy the the files on your robot and
stop them so we have no runtime on the
robot and also do we have any you is
anybody in this room does anybody in
this room have a robot now robot no so
just to tell you that our latest public
release was 114 and Java is available
starting from 122 which should hopefully
become public soon we are working on the
latest last bug fixes so anyway it's not
yet available publicly so to be
continued we this is the first step and
we're working on making like it's more
Java friendly for for you guys because
again if you if I gave you like a robot
right now with SDK you would be probably
crazy because it's not so clean so if
you're interested in you know this robot
and working with it and all that we have
a community that's building up with a
forum and people are helping each other
and we have a store like the Apple Store
Android store we can you write your own
applications publish them and sell them
and all that so no they get
automatically downloaded by the robot
and then you can ask the robot so the
way I launched the presentation you can
ask a robot to launch any other
application so you can join the
community even even if you don't have a
robot in that case you would get the
choreograph GUI with a simulator and you
can start doing stuff with it it's kind
of nice you want to try do it a try
I'll show it to your children you
usually like that stuff and for more
information you can just visit our
website and and see where we are
so thank you very much and this is from
our apartment next to the Oakland Bay
Bridge
