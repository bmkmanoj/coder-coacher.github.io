I'm just gonna be honest I think
building front-end JavaScript
applications can be pretty bloody hard
and there are a bunch of factors that
contribute to this and part of it is
that they're just these giant balls of
state and events right so I thought it
would be really interesting to take a
bit of a step back and I guess play the
devil's advocate and take a critical
look at some of the patterns that we're
using and thick client JavaScript
applications and see if they giving us
ways of managing state and events in a
scalable and maintainable fashion and
then we can take a look at some of the
tactics that we can use to help us
better embrace state and events without
sacrificing clarity in our architecture
but first I'll just introduce myself
this is a llama it's not me I am Amy
I've come over from New Zealand and I
live in a town called Wellington so if
you ever arrived in New Zealand and you
want to hang out you can give me a shout
on the Twitter I'm a meet on Twitter and
pretty much everywhere else on the
internet and I work at github so I've
got two confessions to make before I get
started the first is that last week I
spent the week hanging out with all that
github is from around the world at our
company meeting and so subsequently I
have the summit plague which is why my
voice sounds like this so please bear
with me I might need to drink a lot of
water and the second confession is that
my job at github has nothing to do with
writing JavaScript please don't leave
please don't leave hear me out I spend
my day hacking on native applications so
I work on the team that builds github
for Mac and github for Windows and I'm a
Windows developer so please again state
being with me be with me it's fine I
write I write lots of c-sharp in my day
job but before I was at before the
c-sharp is actually a really great
language before I was before I was at
github I was writing lots of JavaScript
I was building set client JavaScript
applications and the thing that's really
interesting about a desktop application
architecture and client-side JavaScript
application architecture is they have
quite a lot in common right and the
thing that ties them together is the
amount of state that we concerned with
so JavaScript applications
contain heaps of different kinds of
state we've got the state about court
entities like the models and that often
needs to be kept in sync with the state
that's on the server we've got the state
of the address bar we've got the state
of all of the different views that are
being presented at any given point in
time and then we've got to manage the
overall state of the application so
there's a lot of state to think about so
state on its own isn't really that
interesting
what makes an application interesting is
if we're able to interact with that
state right and for some new states on
the application and we do this via
events we force state transitions via
events so what I mean by state
transition is think of a form right and
we've got some data being and put into
the form and we click a Save button and
our model transitions into a new state
perhaps an invalid state and there's so
many different ways that we can make
interesting things happen in our
application or transition state we've
got Dom events things like click drag
key up we've got model events so in
frameworks like backbone we have an on
change function and we register
callbacks to that so we get notified
about interesting things that happen on
the model and we've got routing events
and those are normally fired when the
address bar is gonna change so and
that's normally going to kick off a
series of transitions right the models
are going to change the views on the
screen are going to change there's a
whole bunch of state that's going to
transition at that point so we've got
lots of state and we've got lots of
events and they all need to be managed
and as complexity grows like our code
base gets bigger we get more developers
on the team new features are being added
if we're not careful we can end up in
the corner crying alone feeling really
sorry for ourselves and questioning our
life decisions right and we don't want
that that sucks
so we've got to have a plan so I thought
we'd just take a look at it this is a
somewhat contrived example but you can
imagine this kind of architecture being
extrapolated out to a really large code
base and hopefully you'll be able to see
the reasons why this isn't so great so
here we've got a view which contains
some information about a party so we've
got some party animals party dog this is
getting
and we also have an invitation list and
when the button is going to be clicked
something interesting is going to happen
we're going to invite something to a new
animal to the party and boom we clicked
and we're gonna do a bunch of semi
terrible things here we're going to
reach into the dom using jQuery to query
the current state of the party which is
being stored in the Dom which is kind of
weird we're going to query that current
state and we're going to sorry that
invitation list we're going to pull that
out we're going to append that animal to
the party and we're going to build up a
new view and then write that back to the
Dom so we've conflated a whole bunch of
ideas here we've conflated models with
views we've conflated views with state
and the view is in charge of
transitioning the state into new states
via events right so this feels wrong for
a whole lot of reasons and it's easy to
see that when state and state transition
gets intertwined like this at scale
we're going to end up with an
unmaintainable codebase a brittle
codebase and a hard to test code base so
the management of State in its
transition got out of control
so basically the more of it you have the
harder it all becomes to manage you've
really got to have a plan hooray this is
where design patterns come in right they
come in to save our sanity to prevent us
from being that developer in the corner
feeling bad about our life decisions and
the thing that I really love about
software is that were able to take
solutions from wildly different contexts
and apply them in a new environment to
help us solve new problems right so for
example the problem of separating for
you and data and events and because we
can take ideas and inspiration from
other places design patterns tend to
evolve in a really organic fashion the
spread of design patterns is really
similar to the spread of memes on the
engineered actually the word meme it
means anything that spread they were
inherited and a non genetic fashion
right so meme just means idea any idea
that spread from one place to the next
and it sticks because it's funny or it
became or contains the solution for a
really tricky problem and if you take
the MV star family of
so like MVC which is a common one that
we see those presentation patterns they
actually originated out of applications
built for the desktop right I'm talking
about the small talk days and over time
people saw the value of those patterns
and web and web server programming
became really really popular and we
started to apply those patterns there
and now we're back to applying those
patterns on the browser in the client
with JavaScript and I'm deliberately
using the phrase Envy star here rather
than MVC specifically because there are
a whole lot of flavors this
model-view-presenter model view
viewmodel
and they're all at heart they're all
trying to achieve exactly the same thing
they're all trying to separate our
concerns our data from our views our
state from our transition and it's this
very fact alone that's going to help us
bring structure to our code so let's
take us take a stock of the current
state of play in the client versus
server world so we've got web server
frameworks like rails right that are
written in the MVC style and we've got
these kick-ass JavaScript applications
which are written in frameworks that
also claim to be implementing MVC what
gives well I really I'm not interested
in turning this into a conversation of
like who's doing MVC by the book right
that's not very interesting but I think
what is interesting is to figure out
what flavors of MVC and and how they
affect how we manage state and
transition and each cases so which ideas
can stick and which ones are causing us
too much pain and friction and a really
event vented in stateful world like we
see on the client so let's take a step
back and take a look at what's going on
in the server hopefully this is going to
be a bit of a reminder so I'll I'll just
quickly go through it so we've got our
models there the guts of your
application right this is where all your
domain logic is going to occur and then
we have the presentation of those models
and that's typically in the form of a
JSON document or an HTML document that
we're returning and there are really
representations of current state right
you can think of them like a snapshot of
a model's current state
and then we have our controllers and
that responsible for sending commands
down to the model maybe to query its
current state or to update its current
state and then it's going to return a
snapshot of that model's current state a
JSON document or an HTML document and
the thing that ties them all together
are our routers so they're responsible
for incoming matching an incoming web
request and then routing that off to a
designated controller in action and they
normally do that by matching the pattern
of the URL and combination with the HTTP
verb that's being used so how does this
all relate to our state is managed on
the web server well that's just it
hopefully you don't have state on your
web server right we have applications
that we're building typically a
stateless in nature and we do that for a
whole bunch of reasons which mostly
relate to scalability right we want to
be able to deploy our out across
multiple front end servers and have them
communicate with a back-end server we
want to be able to scale right so we
achieved the statelessness by persisting
to a data store of some kind and so in
this environment we were persisting
state to a data store we're able to
address that state via HTTP so like
we're able to say something like HTTP
get me all of the animals that are
currently at the party and what if we
want to move into a new state what if we
want to execute an event perhaps one of
our animals is behaving misbehaving we
want to kick them out of the party well
we can simulate a state transition
across the boundary by saying HTTP
delete and the controller is going to
execute that function and return a new
snapshot of the current state of the
party so what we've done here is we've
simulated a state transition across the
HTTP boundary so you might have
something like this on this table we've
got routes we're defining a route for
get post and delete on weck party with a
optional parameter animal and when that
is invoked we're going to invoke a
controller so here is the get case we're
going to take the incoming parameter
we're going to execute a search and
we're going to return a snapshot of the
current view with posts we're going to
do something very similar except this
time we're going to change the state of
the model
and return a new snapshot same goes for
delete so we've got a router that
matches a pattern a controller with an
action and vote a model that may or may
not be have its state transition and a
snapshot of that model state returned so
because of the client-server boundary
all of our states and all of our state
transitions are necessarily addressable
via HTTP right like we wouldn't be able
to change the state of the model without
being able to address it and so the way
that we use routers and the way that MVC
is designed on the server is that our
architecture is very linear right the
request comes in we do something to it
something may or may not happen in us
and a snapshot is returned we go down
the stack and up the stack so the
difference between how MVC is
implemented on the server and what we
see on the client our stateful client is
that on the server we're trying super
hard to be stateless and on the client
we have all of us in memory ready to go
so we keep a bunch of things in memory
on the client to help us form a really
cohesive application we've got things
like our models and that's usually
coupled with that snapshot that comes
back from the server but then we add an
extra layer of stuff on top of that
validation security update functions the
number of possible states that our
models can have on the server is larger
than that then we can have on this sorry
the number of states that we can have on
the client is larger than that we can
have on the server we have our view
state so we might be presenting lots of
different views at any given point in
time and together all of those different
views define an overall view state can
we see items in the menu bar are we able
to eat it a view what's displayed in the
main content region all of this is
adding complexity to the state space
that we're managing and then we have
things like the overall application
state like which modules and controllers
are currently active which ones are not
being used and we need to dispose of
free up memory to make sure we're
writing up
application all of this different kinds
of state means that what we're doing is
traversing around a very non linear
state-space right it's not that up the
stack down the stack as we saw on this
on the server so the other thing that's
interesting about managing state on the
client is that suddenly we're not having
to emulate state transitions across the
boundary we can execute an event call a
method a function whatever it's called
and your language of choice you can
execute that within the same execution
context right which is way more powerful
than having to make a network call so
we've got a much richer set of concepts
that we can architect your application
around and that's great because in this
really large state space moving around
in a nonlinear fashion gets complicated
and the dimensionality that we have
makes it difficult to manage so we
really need a have a plan here a
long-term plan to help us not become
that sad developer in the corner feeling
bad about our life choices
so originally we bought over to the
client some presentation patterns to
help us deal with the complexity right
we've got our models our views and
controller all the things that we saw on
the server whatever the controller
portion is is lots of different names
for what you want to call that as I
mentioned earlier and then we add the
routing portion and the first as far as
States concerned this feels a little
weird to me right when I look at this
list the thing that pops out is being
weird as routers that there's a need for
routes on the client the server was 100%
stateless so I can totally see that they
would be need there but I mean do we
need them on the client and it all feels
a little weird until I'm like of course
we totally need them we have an address
bar and I totally need to be able to
copy the URL of my web application and
give that to my friend and have them see
exactly what I see right address ability
on the client is still a key concern so
let's take a typical look at how that
architecture might scale might pan out
when you're implementing MVC on the
client and address addressing the need
of
being able to address all spots parts of
the state space via the router so I'm
going to give this example in backbone
so some of the object names might be
different to what you're used to or you
may not even see some of these steps
because the frameworks that you're using
or hiding this all away from you but the
series of events is pretty much going to
be the same so here we have an animal
model and we have a collection of party
animals which is really just a list of
animals and we have an animal animal
view which defines a template and a
render function and the render function
is just going to take that template it's
going to take the collection of animals
it's going to mesh them together and put
something out onto the Dom and then we
have our router and we're defining a
couple of routes here party and uninvite
and when each of those are invoked when
it detects a change in the address bar
we're going to call the function either
start the party or revoke party rights
and revoke party rights is going to do a
lookup it's going to transition the
state of the model and then it's going
to update the view it's going to update
the snapshot of the current state and
start the party is going to do something
very similar the only difference is it's
not actually executing a state
transition so we're breaking
encapsulation here in order to push
everything up to the routing portion of
our code so we've got a view that's
responsible for doing some initial
rendering but it also has a reference to
our model and then the route kicks off
and the first thing we do is look up
that model when we already had a
reference to it in our view I'm feeling
a bit weird about this this isn't yeah
this is feeling weird and then finally
we're going to need to update that view
we're going to reuse jQuery to update
the current state so again we're
breaking encapsulation the view already
has a reference to those Dom elements
we're creating spaghetti rate code which
is going to become really difficult to
maintain over time the more of this that
you add the harder this is going to be
able you're not going to be able to
follow this nonlinear state space very
easily
is anyone able to grab me another glass
of water that would be amazing thank you
so on the client were often working with
really stateful frameworks and all of
the objects that we need in order to
perform a state transition are already
instantiated so there's no need for us
to look them up again and that very
linear fashion that we saw on the server
so we don't need to be structuring their
application in the same way because we
can embrace state we don't need to be
manipulating our models like the rows in
a database and models can become real
rich interactive responsive objects so
we really want to be embracing state
here and we really want to be embracing
events because what we've done is we've
taken those memes those ideas from the
server and we've tried to apply that
linear approach to a nonlinear state
space and we've had to break
encapsulation in order to do that we
started treating state and events like
second-class citizens and the code that
we ended up with was a tangled web so I
feel like history is repeating itself
right if you remember that example that
I gave at the beginning of the talk of
the jQuery that was kind of managing the
state in the view and it was all kind of
happening in this weird soupy kind of
thing I feel like we're back to this
again we've just pushed it all up into
the routing portion of our code because
we're trying to emulate what the server
architectures look like and this kind of
code doesn't scale well beyond the
simple use case because it breaks
encapsulation because we can't test it
because we can't pull it apart so I feel
like we're back to square one again
we're sacrificing clarity in our
architecture so to build rich single
page JavaScript applications we still
need to use rounds it's critical that we
can address the state space but in my
mind routes are a feature they are not
an architectural driver they're not the
cornerstone of our architecture we
really should be being concerned with
events and state and architecting around
those concepts so abouts the problem
here if they're totally not the problem
the thing that's causing us pain with
managing state and events
is only using routes to drive our
architecture so we've discovered that
separating concerns is really a really
important and that's why we implemented
the MVC design pattern in the first
place to get rid of all that shitty
jQuery so but somewhere in the course of
that we too closely emulated what we saw
on the server and the cracks and that
started to show so thankfully I think we
can find a happy medium where we can
embrace the need for address ability on
the client the need for routes without
relying on them to drive state changes
within the application so we're going to
use events to help drive our
architecture and we're going to build a
composable architecture to help us
better separate our concerns so the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to refactor some of that bloated
router code that I showed you and so
hopefully it's starting to become
apparent that addressing a state
transition like a delete is not the best
thing to do so we still have our models
like we did before and in backbone we
now have an event hash well that's not
now I mean I've just added it just now
that's been around in backbone for a
long time and the idea here is is that
we can current we can correlate events
that are occurring on the Dom to a
function to call on our view and in this
case we've got a delete function and a
delete function is going to use the
model that it has a reference to and
it's going to destroy it and then it's
going to figure out that there's no need
for this view to be around anymore and
it's going to destroy itself it's going
to remove itself from the view so we did
the router go there was no need for it
here right the view could take care of
itself we don't need to do any
unnecessary lookups to find what model
to the lead and we're taking advantage
of that state that was available to us
by using declarative events and we can
buy into that delete function and the
views in charge right which is what we
want we don't want the router to be in
charge so this is fine this is step one
but as I said earlier that routing is
still a key part of our overall design
so how do we support the need for
address ability
of our state's well I think we can
embrace the need for an event rich Envy
whatever pattern and the need for routes
with a clear architecture so I'm going
to show you a couple of ideas or memes
or what-have-you that you can choose to
apply as you see fit
and they might help you so we're gonna
take our models I'm gonna take those
rich interactive objects that keep track
of their own State and handle validation
and rays events when they change state
we're going to take our views which are
responsible for rendering templates and
mediating any interaction between the
DOM and the view and vice versa so we're
going to take all of that and we're
going to give that to a controller an
actual controller object and a control
object might be responsible for managing
a couple of different models and a
couple of different views at any point
in time we're gonna take all of that and
we're gonna slide it into a logical
component called a module I want to do
this for a bunch of reasons for
testability for composability and like
it's just sensible right so this guy
Justin Meyer who wrote this framework
called JavaScript MVC which claims to be
like a really true reference
implementation of what MVC was supposed
to be and JavaScript he said like we
want to be building large-scale huge
JavaScript applications we should just
we should just not do that let's just
stop and not build big applications
let's build a whole lot of smaller
applications test those individually and
then bring them together compose them at
the end to form a larger application and
I really really like this idea and this
is where the idea of modularity comes in
so a modules responsible for
coordinating state and events of the
views and models it contains right and
it's at a really micro level so I think
modules are a really integral part of
building any robust application
architecture and they usually define
like a discrete area or a functionality
so that's functionality that logically
belongs together right and so within it
can raise events keep track of which
views need to be presented and manage
it's on an internal stage so in
JavaScript we've got a couple of ways of
implementing the module pattern you
could roll your own
mother module patterns a clearly defined
pattern you could do that using object
literal notation if you want you could
use AMD modules there's lots of
different versions of that out there
common jeaious modules lots of
frameworks have their own definition of
what a module needs to look like there's
there's tons of different ways that you
can do this and there's lots and lots of
information out on there and I'm happy
to give links to this afterwards if you
would like them so to note one thing
about modules that I've discovered is
that they shouldn't be free to present
they should be free to present their own
views right but they shouldn't be free
to choose where on the application shell
they present those views so the
application some other object needs to
take care of deciding where that module
is allowed to place its views and I
think the other object is something
responsible for layout composition so
for composing all the different views on
the screen now I'm gonna give the sky
the name of layout manager because
naming is hard and management kind of
sucks I don't know like if you've got
any better ideas of what to call this
the idea is that it's an object
responsible for composing lots of
different views and deciding where they
fit on the screen at any given point in
time so it's going to define a shell
write an application shell with areas
that modules can render their content
into so like a sidebar the main content
view any widget areas that you have an
importantly winner module a new module
is activated the layout manager is
responsible for deciding where that
module should render its content so each
each module is going to have the views
that it wants to present and the layout
manager is going to figure out where
they need to go so this is an example of
a layout manager and has anyone heard of
a framework called marionette jeaious
yeah so I'm a big big there's a lot of
great ideas about composable composite
architectures and that in that library
it was really just a library that sits
on top of backbone that you can pick in
the bits that you find interesting as
you figure out whether they will work
for you so in marrying it what you do is
you define an overall application object
in my mind I would rather see this be
like layout manager or layout composer
or something
like that and then you define a series
of regions so you're gonna say main
content side by footer all of those
kinds of things and then that gives you
the hooks to do things like when the
application starts for example here
we're saying the module foo which we see
he defined just below I'd like you to
call the display function on that and
I'm gonna pass you a region and then
that module is able to say I'll call
thanks for the region I've got a whole
lot of views that I need to present and
I'm going to present those in the region
that you've just given me so that's Matt
that's implemented a marionette but
that's a concept that you can very
easily roll into your own applications
so it's going to look a little bit like
this I've got a bunch of modules
presenting views at a micro level and
we've got a layout composer that's
responsible for composing all of those
modules views at a more macro level so
this placement occurs when like when
does the layout composer know to start
placing objects when a new module is
activated how does this work so the
thing that needs to be responsible in my
opinion the thing that needs to be
responsible for determining whether it's
time to invoke a new module as a
dispatcher so this is going to be an
object that listens for events on some
pub publish and subscribe subscription
and it's gonna listen for events that
indicate that it's time for a new module
to be loaded a new module to be invoked
and on such events it's going to load
that module up it's going to create an
instance and it's going to hand it off
to the layout manager who will then
figure out where to place it on the
screen so that one of the interesting
events that might mean that it's time to
invoke a new set of modules routes write
a routing event might occur so the
router is going to facilitate just
purely an incoming URL mapping that to a
set of modules that need to be invoked
and then it's going to raise an event
that the dispatcher is in listening to
so it's responsible for observing those
changes and reacting to them it's not
responsible for doing any lookups it's
not responsible for executing any state
transitions all that is is delegating
off to another object
so it's delegating to the dispatcher so
here's an example of what a dispatcher
might look like this is all just stubbed
code so we might want to keep track of
say the previous route for reasons of
moving backwards and forwards we're
going to need to keep track of the
current modules that we have loaded it
in any given point in time and the
current route that we're on when we set
up we're going to subscribe to that
publish and subscribe channel that I
mentioned so that when the router raises
its event to say that something
interesting has happened it can take in
the parameters of which modules to load
and it can hear that event and we're
going to load those modules right so
this is gonna this is the point we're
going to load them into memory and then
hand them off to the layout manager to
do something interesting worth and this
is cool because the dispatcher can also
do things like oh I noticed that we've
got all of these modules that we're not
using anymore I can clean those up clear
the memory keep your application stable
and performant so we're going to take on
the dispatcher which is responsible for
creating those modules and managing the
lifetime of our modules as well and then
passing them on to our layout manager
who's going to place them in the overall
application shell and one way that the
dispatcher can know that it's time for
us to load another module is a routing
event and what I really like about this
is it means that the router is a feature
of the application it's not an
architectural driver it's something that
sits on the side and raised of raises
events it's the interaction of the other
objects that gives us our rich nonlinear
architecture and then the last thing
that we're going to need to add is
similar to what we had in the marionette
example and application objects that's
responsible for kind of managing these
higher-level
objects and making sure that they are
communicating correctly it's going to
provide us a way for us an eatery point
for start stop logging cross-cutting
concerns all of those kinds of things
would perhaps belong and this
overarching object
so we've split up some of our concerns
that we had around state and events and
all of the many views that were being
displayed and the state of the address
bar and we have a much more composable
design we were able to use events to
transition into new states in a very
nonlinear fashion so if that was all too
long and you didn't read it because
reasons or some of the management of our
states basically it's really really hard
especially if you don't separate out our
concerns so on the client we shouldn't
be using routes to address all aspects
of the state space and definitely never
transitions taking ideas from one
context and applying them and the new
context is really great that's what
building software is all about but it's
not a rulebook right we need to learn to
be flexible and figure out when these
patterns are actually hurting us more
than they're helping us and we need to
mold them to support your requirements
so like the need to be stateful like the
need to embrace events within the same
execution context and I guess if I have
one thing to say it said please don't
build servers on the client because the
client is a really rich awesome place to
put like write code and events are
awesome so embrace them
