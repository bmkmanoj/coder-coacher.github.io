types we've covered so far today we have
our basic immutable types talk about
numbers instant floats bullion's true
and false strings which are immutable
lists which are mutable and all the
various operations we can perform on
lists there's a related there's actually
two related types to lists that are
really close similar syntax and some
dramatically different functionality one
of them is tuples and that's kind of the
next section that's 5.4 in that PDF
section 5.4 and a tuple is basically
just an immutable list so list you can
change items in a list tuples you can't
change items in a tuple to create a
tuple that's it you've got one and the
syntax for it is a comma separated list
and you'll notice when I type in a comma
separated list and hit enter it prints
it out with parentheses the parentheses
are optional for declaring tuples but
you can think about the parentheses as
replacing brackets and Python uses all
parentheses for lots of things so the
context determines their their meaning
and parentheses are potentially
confusing the only time parentheses are
required is if you want to make a even
then I'm not regarded Omega one tuple a
trailing comma is required because
there's no there's no sense what just
three would mean besides the value of
three and three inside parentheses
doesn't get you a tuple either gotta
have a trailing comma aside from that
your parentheses are optional your
values can be whatever and it supports
similar operations as lists
but it's immutable so why do we want
immutable lists why aren't we happy with
just lists any thoughts yeah so there's
a little bit of a sense of constants
here and the next data type that we
talked about dicks needs to use
immutable values only as its keys and
when we have lists and we want to use
lists as keys we need to convert them to
tuples tuples are returned lots of
places instead of lists because they're
slightly more lightweight we talked at
the very beginning about ID and looking
at the memory usage of variables and
lists every list is unique because it's
mutable since tuples are immutable you
can create a very large number of
similar tuples and not use it very much
memory because each identical tuple is
actually going to end up in turn to the
same memory location so there's some
performance advantages occasionally and
lots of the standard built-in functions
return tuples so let's look at a few of
those like lists you can create two
poles with parentheses I wonder now you
can create an empty tuple don't know why
you do that just like empty brackets you
can also use the built-in function tuple
and you can pass the built-in function a
value to be converted to a tuple in this
case a list and it'll return you a tuple
and you can use tuples to do things like
variable reassignment anybody ever done
an interview question we have to swap
the contents of variables like a really
basic programming kind of thing I found
lets you say just that and the sin tax
implications of this swap are that on
the left-hand side we implicit we have
parenthesis and this is a tuple and on
the right-hand side we implicitly have
parenthesis and this is a tuple and
Python will do
poople unpacking there's no list
unpacking there is tuple unpacking so
tuple unpacking
if you know how many items you have in a
tuple and it's immutable see not the way
about having changed you can go ahead
and expand those into the implicit tuple
on the left-hand side of the equation
and my first second third variables got
filled with the first second and third
values in the tuple and from pythons
perspective it's just creating a new
tuple on the left-hand side is an
implicit tuple there it is but it's
immutable and useless memory and Python
does a few special things with it and
we've already seen one tuple anybody
remember
when we wanted to loop through an array
and we want to both the index and the
value of what function do we use it was
built in somebody said enumerate and if
you schools and if you look at this
expression implicitly there is a tuple
there and I could in fact put
parentheses around it because the
enumerate function is returning a single
value each time you have to return a
single value on a four for loop but that
single value is a tuple and we can
automatically unpack it we could also do
this to prove it I'm catching a single
value and printing that single value and
a single value is a tuple with the index
in the value of the current position in
the list so tuple unpacking is just
shorthand expanding that tuple into two
variables and it's convenient it's
mostly using loops but you will
occasionally use it for like variable
reassignment make sense of people can
you keep yes you can keep tuples and
lists it does not so the tuple is
immutable in the sense that it is a list
of variables and it will not change
which variables each position is bound
to but if one of the variables in it
itself is mutable you can still access
and change that variable you won't be
able to do it directly actually you
could do it directly
parenthesis vs brackets so square
parentheses is always a list and
parentheses which are optional are a
tuple square brackets are lists I
converted a list to a tuple with a tuple
function and it accepts an iterable and
makes it creates a tuple out of it but
that's just an input function just like
i did this list and gave it a string
that's an iterable and it creates a list
out of the individual characters of the
string and if it as long as it knows how
to iterate over the object it can create
a list or tuple from it and I just use
the built-in type function which returns
you the type of the variable you pass it
and when we get to OOP we'll talk a
little bit more about why you generally
don't need to do that sort of thing in
Python nondestructive so pop and into a
pop and insert don't work on a tuple
because you can't take something out of
a two bullets immutable so the and
remove insert I think that's everything
there's a pen depend won't work count
would work extend does not work int
index would work insert doesn't that
work pop does not work remove does not
work and no reverse on sort the well the
next data type is dictionaries lists and
tuples are both kind of used for the
same thing there's an implicit order and
it's positionally indexed what you care
about is what position things are at or
maybe you just care about their order if
you want something to be sorted you
might put it in the list to sort it the
next type we also dereference but it's a
key value store python calls them dicks
the ICT which is short for dictionary
a the languages might call it like a
hash or hash map and the distinction
syntactically here is that we're going
to use curly braces so square brackets
are lists parentheses or tuples curly
braces are dicks and dicks can be
created in a couple different ways one
way is the syntax we've been using which
is key value pairs just like we created
lists with just their appropriate braces
and tuples with just their appropriate
braces we can create dictionaries with
just our appropriate braces some other
languages the keys don't have to be
quoted in Python both the key and value
has to be quoted if there are literals
if they're string literals and what can
we do with dicks dicks don't support the
concept of positional indexing so I get
a kir when I say X 0 because there is no
key 0 I could make a key 0 but it's not
a position it's just a key you index
them just like you do list with square
brackets not with curly braces and you
specify the key it returns the value
there's obviously no slicing notation
there's no sense of order there is no
sort or reverse for dictionaries it's
just a key value store it's a table
lookup it's a hashmap look up yeah the
underlying the underlying implementation
is a hashmap we talked about in for
lists determine the presence of
something rather than using index you
could just say if one in
and the same thing is true for dicks in
except that it's checking by default
keys not values
so it printed true the first time it's
looking at the the keys not at the
values when you say in and there isn't
very many convenient idioms for
searching through the values of a
dictionary dictionaries are for storing
keys and you're interested in the values
of the values associated with a
particular key and we can also create
dicks with the built-in dicked function
and this is just like we did with the
list in this case it's a comma separated
list of parameters and I don't need to
put quotes around my keys
so you can use the dicta function
function instead and while I like square
braces from my lists sometimes dick is
less typing than curly braces for
initializing dictionaries you can
despite the fact that there's no order
you can loop over dictionaries you might
want to do something on every member of
a dictionary so it still makes sense to
loop over a dictionary yes there's no no
convenient built-in idiom to look for a
value well here's the thing so let's
look at the built-in methods of the dick
type the first function of great
interest is items and items is returning
me tuples of the key and the value keys
will return me just a list of the keys
if you really want to look and see if a
value is in you can look at values and
it gives you just a list of the values
so if you really wanted to search
through the values of the dictionary you
could search through its values list
that tells you that it's there it
doesn't tell you that it has a
particular key there's no way to go from
X values back to figure out which key
corresponds but again in general you're
not so much interested in what are my
values i might dicked but what are my
keys if you're really interested in a
list of values and searching through
them you're probably gonna use a list
instead
oh yeah so let's let's talk about that
that's a good question um statements are
single line statements by default right
if I say x is equal to and then I hit
enter I can't put five on the next line
it's a syntax error there are some
exceptions one of the exceptions is
pretty much anytime there is a starting
brace curly bracket parentheses square
brace so i can say x is equal to and
that's valid notice that's on two lines
this is valid it's in a function call
net surrounded by parentheses so Python
knows that I'm not done specifying that
function call
and you can format as you like so as
long as you're inside of some containing
parentheses curly brackets square
brackets you can use multi line and I
said earlier that if statements don't
require parentheses for the condition
one of the common uses you'll see with
actual parentheses is because you've got
several conditions and you need to break
it up on the multiple lines but you
can't do without adding the parentheses
so if x and y and z and you could assume
that those were all really long
conditionals that's a legal statement
and the parentheses only syntactical
implication there is basically to
convert that whole thing into a single
line statement even though it spans
multiple lines
so iterating over dictionaries still
have a dictionary I still do when we
iterated over lists we got the value I
just did a simple iteration using for
value in list what am I going to get it
here
I get the keys dictionaries were
interested primarily in keys if I wanted
to iterate over a dictionary and print
the actual values I'd have to
dereference my dictionary inside my loop
with the key that I've got and as we've
noticed I could always do
items which returns two tuples or lists
explicitly over values or keys to get
just the values are just the keys but
the default is the iterate over keys so
let's do a couple things in terms of
labs and you can get these two new data
types go back to your classmates file
and go ahead and copy it to classmates
one save it as a new file so we can go
back in time we have a bunch of
iterations of the classmates file it'll
get more impressive gradually if you're
already fluent in some sort of source
control you can go ahead and ease get or
bzr or whatever to revision it but
otherwise just copy it to a new name and
right now you have a classmate's file
that has a list of all the first names
of all the students and prints them out
in your new classmates file go ahead and
delete the list slicing samples and
let's store first last name and roll of
each person in class so you're going to
have a list of three tuples first name
last name and roll and let's go ahead
and loop through our list of tuples and
print out hello first name last name is
a roll and by roland just thinking like
teacher and students
you
I should probably make you do a little
research to get acquainted but
and why don't I give you one more
specification which is let's use a
string formatting to print out our
information
and it's worth noting my editor helps me
by automatically indenting things right
but there's no syntactic requirement to
have that list of tuples on multiple
lines there's no syntactic requirement
to have the space at the beginning right
there but I just have it lined up so
that the structure of the data structure
is pretty apparent this is a list of
rows and each line is a row and would be
it's a little bit confusing to say okay
when do I have open parentheses close
parentheses comma outside the
parentheses all that if I Jam them all
together the much more confusing the way
it is it's pretty obvious if I leave off
an opening or closing parenthesis or
leave off a trailing comma it's pretty
easy to scan a Python also allows you to
leave trailing commas in lists and
tuples and a lot of people like to end
their list with a trailing comma since
it just means if you ever go to add an
additional line do your data structure
come back to edit it you start on the
next line and you've already got the
comma there if you start on the next
line half the time you forget the comma
if there wasn't one in the first time
through complains so everybody has that
that far of the classmates file working
look like store a list of tuples you're
printing out the rolls okay so let's
start making our program slightly
interactive and let's change our data
types once again so let's use dicks so
right now you're storing a list of
tuples let's store a dict for your
classmates and let's key it by the
classmates first name so the value of
the dictionary can continue to be a 32
pool if you like but the key is going to
be the first name and go ahead and get
it to print out all the names again so
you can have a loop over a dictionary
and retrieve the values from the
dictionary and then the next step is
we're going to
put ourselves in an infinite loop and
get some input from the user and that
input is going to be a first name and if
the first name exists we're going to
print it out so a couple of new concepts
to dig into
meet the built-in function raw input so
you won't use this a ton but something
for quick and dirty scripts it's useful
raw input takes a string it prints the
string out to standard out reads from
standard in until the user hits the
enter key and returns you whatever the
user typed so I say answer equals raw
input and I noted you typically leave us
space if you don't leave that space your
cursor is blinking right up against the
end of your screen and I'll type
something hit enter and answer is the
variable that I was storing the return
value from raw but an answer has what it
is that I typed and the other thing will
introduce here is the idea of an
infinite loop so lots of GUI programming
and a lot of program that uses
interactivity will frequently have a
main event loop and if you use a GUI
tool kit of some kind it'll usually
provide the event loop for you and
you're basically doing event based
programming in that case you just
respond to certain conditions I can be
quite that sophisticated here but we are
going to do an infinite loop or almost
infinite loop we'll start out with an
infinite loop
and I have an error on line 7 i'm
missing comma and that's not related to
the present returns is just a formatting
issue so if i don't put that space i
take a space out it still works exactly
the same but my crews are kind of right
up against and like let's say you ended
with a question mark that looks kind of
weird when i answer so all i was noting
is it's a typical formatting thing and
leave a space at the end or several
spaces at the end yep so if you notice i
have a never terminating program now
it's while true and true never changes
it's prompting for input and whatever I
type it echoes back to me
slightly interactive a raw input and
your never-ending program i'm using
control-c to break and control see your
control d will break for you depending
on your OS as well once you have a
never-ending loop we'll talk about how
to make a slightly nicer exit loop
so this is good everybody's trying to
define some dictionaries and bumping
into several edge cases so your keys
have to be quoted and this is slightly
confusing some of the languages know
that your keys are going to be strings
and so they don't force you to put
quotes around them Python will actually
let you use a variety of dictionary
types for keys so you do have to specify
quotes if you want your keys to be
strings and also as we've discussed
there's two ways to initialize
dictionaries and it's actually more than
two ways the way we're doing it was with
braces and then it's a key a colon and a
value of some kind which in our case is
a tuple right that's one way to get a
dict another way is with the built-in
data function dict creates elements of
type dicked in this case you use key it
doesn't have to be quoted because it's
actually a parameter to a function they
exist
which will get you the same thing the
dict function will also take confusingly
lists of 22 polls
and it will use the first sorry
item in each tuple as the key and the
second as the value you can initialize a
dictionary if you have a list of two
tuples and it is actually semi common
for converting back and forth between
data types but for the moment stick with
curly braces quoted keys colon and our
value
doesn't matter you're specifying a
string so you can use single quote
double quote triple quote doesn't matter
we're specifying string keys if you
leave the quotes off it needs to be a
valid variable or it needs to be another
basic type so people should be maybe on
a step two most people have got a
dictionary stored they can loop over it
and print it so step two is get input
from the user and print out the student
record if it exists and let's do a
couple things about getting values from
dictionaries how do i test and see if a
first name is a key in my dictionary
okay so I have an answer that semi and I
have a dictionary that's badly filled
out and doesn't have Simeon in it how do
i tell if that answer is in my
dictionary and therefore there's
something for me to retrieve sweet so
yeah the in operator works great and
it's false there's a couple of other
methods if I just directly dereference
the dictionary it'll raise an exception
if the key doesn't exist it's a key
error exception and we don't know yet
how to handle exceptions other will get
there dictionaries provide a convenience
method called get and get functions just
like dereferencing does with a couple of
exceptions one is no exception thrown
and the other is you can provide a
default value to be returned instead of
none which is what's returned by default
if it doesn't find the key so you could
say if dick get answer and that's the
same thing as saying none as the default
but if for some reason you were
interested in some default for instance
if you wanted to quit whenever the key
wasn't found
in this case might if is successful
because it gets back a default value
quit even though the key wasn't found
operators and probably people are
guessing and finding out that their
guesses work out pretty well but we
talked about the Equality operator
before so if the variable on the left
hand side is the same as the variable on
the right hand side in some sense then
it returns true we didn't talk about the
not equals operator which in Python is
the exclamation the bang equals it's
false in this case because a really is
equal to be the value of a really is
equal to B and I saw a few people trying
which doesn't actually work since not is
basically just a boolean inverter
not requires a single value not a dual
operator so this statement on line 8
order of execution is a equal equal B
gets evaluated to a single boolean which
is true not true is evaluated and not
true just flips it to false and it's
cast a boolean which it didn't need to
be so not equals is the logical not
equals operator and earlier we were
doing less than and greater than
operators for numbers and is also less
than or equal greater than or equal just
kind of like you'd expect so debugging
tools while you're writing your code
there's a module called pretty print P
print and it has a function pretty print
that will nicely format whatever data
structure it gets in some probably
program or logical format
in this case it isn't splitting it up by
lines
it's the identical output let's try with
some longer
okay so until i get to 80 characters why
it is not going to split that up into
multiple streams but preprint can accept
arguments to say how the formatting
should happen
if I really needed less than 80
characters what you sort of do you have
a narrow console
yes with a colon at the end printer for
print value sorry yeah right value and
notice that that's printing the keys so
if you want to print the actual value
that stored you need to print X brackets
value I could have done the same tour on
strings that we did on lists which is
look at all the built-in methods on a
string type and there's a bunch of nice
formatting methods that will get you you
know half the way to having to break out
reg ex is so for instance just checking
to see if its digits or if it's
alphanumeric there's some things built
in like that or has spaces there's lower
and upper what to do what you think they
would X is a lowercase string right now
there's even
as it just title this title title case
which will capitalize the first letter
of any word which kind of peaceful and
you Lee right now is checking for a
particular character and she doesn't
want to check and see if it's uppercase
or lowercase so she can just say if
answer got lower that gets you a
lowercase string bracket 0 that gives
you the first character in that string
as long as it is a string that'll work
out and let's
and it is kind of nice most of the
there's a lot of chaining possibilities
I thought lets me go ahead and just
append the indexing operator right on
the end of that function call yes there
so there is no char type and Python
there's only string a single length
string is still string so yeah so lists
if we wanted to add something to list we
could use like a pen you can append or
insert or whatever for dicks
update takes another dicked and copies
all those values which is sometimes
useful but you just want to add one
entry it's by bracket assignment so just
like a dereference to get the value out
i can dereference to set the value and
if the key is there it's updated yep one
more data type that's kind of list like
is the set data type set does not have
its own kind of braces just because we
ran out of them we've got the
parentheses for tuples got square
brackets for lists and we've got the
curly braces for dicks we have no more
bracket kind of things on our keyboard
although you know now that I say that
angle brackets are severely
underutilized but then we'd be pearl um
so we can only make sets with a set dict
and the set dicked accepts a list
what differentiates sets from what is
the name set do for you anybody know
anything about sets doesn't make you
think of like you know sixth grade math
problems with Venn diagrams and mutually
exclusive sets and things like that so
sets lists you can store anything you
want in a list it can be heterogeneous
objects you can have a list that's 50 s
asset is a unique list there's no
implied ordering to a set there's no
sense of sorting a set but you can then
use set type operations on a set so the
first time this looked like we got
exactly what we expected the second time
you'll notice I have a set that accepts
a list with a repeating element and my
resulting set only has that element one
time so it's throwing out duplicates in
my list when it's constructed and you
cannot index into sets because there's
no sense of order in sets and that's
actually kind of inherent two sets as a
mathematical property it's an unordered
collection but you can do with sets our
compare sets to do things like the
intersection of two sets or what is
exclusively in the left or right set so
let's construct ourselves some sets
I have two sets we can use the built-in
set functions and I'm going to do a and
dot to see the list of functions I've
got here in ipython and some of these
are kind of obvious like ad and clear
and copy difference accepts another set
and a difference be gives me everything
that exists in a that does not exist in
B and I can also shortcut that by using
the minus operator to run the difference
function on two sets and notice that
difference with sets is not commutative
B minus a gives me everything that's in
B is not an a the answers are not the
same there's also intersection which
gives me the list of things that's in
both sets
and I don't remember if there's a
shortcut for intersection and it doesn't
look like it and there's also actually
there is that's right
ampersand which ampersand by itself in
some languages is used for logical ends
but more frequently for boolean and in
Python it is only a boolean and which is
a bit flipping operation that you
probably won't have to use very often
it's overridden in some end-user classes
to give you a logical and sense so it's
intersection there's also a symmetric
difference and if I don't talk about
symmetric difference did for me
right so everything that's not in the
intersection of the sets the stuff
that's only in the left one or only in
the right one but nothing that's in both
and that has another bit shifting
operation that shifting operator
overloaded in real usage I rarely use
things like symmetric difference I do
some ties use intersection what I mostly
use sets for is the common problem of I
have a list find me the unique elements
in the list you might have rid read in a
whole bunch of numbers and you just want
to know how many unique items were there
for unique items I convert my list to a
set which throws out all the duplicates
and then I can still take the length of
a set and that's how many unique items I
have the most common use along with sets
there's a couple of new built-ins we
could talk about one is one that will
give you fits from time to time I think
it's the built-in called zip and zip has
nothing to do with compression zip is
for transitioning tuples and what you
usually see zip demo dad's like if you
to two examples of zip what you usually
hear zip explained as is taking two
lists and returning a 2-tuple with the I
a--the pair from each list I think
that's the explanation that's on python
org so let's look at that one
okay so this is what a lot of people
will use zip for I have two lists a and
B and zip accepts the two lists and for
each position it returns me the value at
that position as a tuple so I have the
first value in my resulting list is a
2-tuple that has 0 and 60 being the
first position in the first list and six
being the first position in the second
list and so forth and you will actually
use zip like that occasionally I think a
more intuitive explanation of zip is zip
accepts lists that represent rows of
data and it returns a list where each
entry represents columns of data and I
actually use it for that quite often so
let's also define see
and if I wanted the first if I wanted
the second column out of my data I have
a bunch of input rose and I want the
second column because I zip a B and C
and grab the first position in the
resulting row and that's this column
seems somehow more intuitive to me so it
throws away the extra elements the
resulting list of columns only has as
many columns as the shortest and the
iterators package has a couple of
additional zip extensions that let you
do things like filling a default value
go to the longest one so let's go ahead
and use zip right away and sets by
saving your classmates file as a new
file classmates three would be
appropriate and go ahead and print out
all the unique roles in your database as
your first order of operation so you've
got a list of people in the room they
all have a role assigned with them print
out a list of unique roles no repetition
in the roles you do not have to change
your data format at all for this which
just means no duplication in your list
of roles so not roles that only have one
corresponding but don't print out a list
that says student student student
student instructor fern alyssa says
student and instructor which is a hint
that i want you to get a list of all the
roles and convert it to a set which will
throw away any duplicates and print out
the set so do people have a clear idea
of how it is that they would solve this
last little Nutcracker okay so that's
good i'm trying to make you do something
so that when we introduce an additional
piece of syntax tomorrow it'll seem like
the solution to a problem
and it really does turn out to be the
solution to a problem but let's solve
this ourselves together first in the
slightly awkward way that we have to do
it right now and then we're gonna take a
break since it's three and I've been
forgetting and then when we come back
we're going to talk about functions for
a little bit so data I have a data
structure like everybody else has pretty
much right now names it has it's a
dictionary it's indexed by first name
and has a 3-2 pole with the first last
name and roll of each student I want to
get a list of the unique roles so I want
to use set at some point and since what
I want is kind of a column in my data
I'm tempted to use zip to retrieve that
column if I want to use a zip that means
i need to retrieve the rose first and I
could do this name's Danny that's a row
that's two rows
explicitly get the rose I can just do
names values and that gives the three
rows for me so names is a dict dicks
have a variety of ways to retrieve their
contents there's keys which we return a
list of keys values with return a list
of values which in this case happen to
be tuples items which returns tuples of
key value pairs let's use values and
with values I have the rose that I want
I need to pass them to zip and the only
way I know how to do that right now is
let's go ahead and say Rose equals names
values so there's my rose
is explicitly specify each list that I'm
passing the zip and zip returns columns
right so it returns a column with his
first names a calm its last name on a
column I want which is students so let's
get that column now I've got a tuple of
just of just the roles and I could
convert that one to a set and back to a
list get a list of unique instructors
that's a lot of functionality packed
into one line with wakeham any
parentheses and there's a really ugly
Kluge in there which is how can I do
this if I have more rows like I have to
pass each row 2 zip explicitly what if
my list of names had five and since I'm
going to add a name I don't know how
many it has each time how can I handle
that case we're going to answer that
tomorrow today we're going to take a
break first and then we're going to talk
about functions and functions and
function and handling pythons very
sophisticated function and argument
handling is the answer to the question
and let's go out and take a break grab
yourself some coffee or snacks in case I
nobody else gave you the welcoming
speech have that out there there's a
fridge with juice and you know sodas and
water and whatnot feel free there's some
snacks out there there's still some
pastries left in this morning there's
some snacks and bags Gorp whatever so
feel free
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
