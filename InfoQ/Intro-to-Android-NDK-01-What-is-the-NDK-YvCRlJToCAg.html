garganta I work for Marikana an IT
training company focused on open source
software and as a instructor for
Marikana I've done a lot of training on
Android all the way from the internals
to the SDK and app development and in
the course of my trainings of often come
oftentimes encountered and the KD
Android native development kit which
enables Android developers you guys to
take advantage of code written in C or
C++ and incorporate that code in your
applications through the use of J and I
the Java native interface I've actually
always tried to stay as far away as
possible from J and I simply because I
feel that it tends to introduce a lot of
security / stability problems in the
name of performance in my applications
but interesting enough it turns out that
25% of the Android applications on
market are written with some form of and
decay or written using in decay with
some form of j'ni so it is something
that every Android developer should lead
at least know about so while this
screencast is focused on Android
developers wanting to learn more about
NDK it's also well suited for those that
are simply care to examine what's
possible in android
maybe they're building the actual
underlying infrastructure of Android
through building custom roms but they
and they just simply want to understand
how the different layers fit together
and they want to understand how J&amp;amp;I
works I hope you enjoy the screencast so
what exactly is the end eqing I'm
actually going to navigate to the NDK
page on Google Android comm as I'm
answering this question so NDK as I
mentioned before enables us to
essentially take advantage of j'ni which
in turn enables us to write code in C
C++ and then access it from our java
code base now we know that generally on
dendro applications are written in the
Java language and they run on top of the
dalvik virtual machine so we'll get this
in a moment but we generally use NDK in
the name of code reuse or increase
performance
now NDK provides a set of tools ie a
tool chain that enable us to compile our
code written in C++ into the different
targeting
Emmons so a B is the application binary
interface is like the arm V 5 V 7 or x86
which are the targets that our code base
is eventually going to run on it also
provides a mechanism of embedding the
native libraries these are going to be
the deliverables of the NDK this is
essentially what the compiled code is
going to look like okay it's going to
ship as far as in form of native
libraries and NDK enables is to package
these native libraries into our apk
files which is essentially what will
finally deliver to our target audience
to install on their devices NDK also
includes a number of system headers to
essentially shared libraries that we can
take advantage of and know that these
Cather's are going to be in these
libraries are going to be supported in
the future
and finally NDK provides documentation
samples and tutorials some of which
we'll take a look at as we go through
this screencast</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
