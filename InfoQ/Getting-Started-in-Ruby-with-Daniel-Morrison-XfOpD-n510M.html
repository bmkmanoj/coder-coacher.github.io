when i'm not talking about Ruby I'm
leading a running a small Ruby
consultancy out of Michigan we've been
doing Ruby since about two thousand five
and mostly rails web apps a little bit
of mobile a few other things here and
there but lots and lots of Ruby and then
I also do a lot of Ruby and rails
instruction for Marikana and have been
doing that for quite a while as well so
I claim I think I know my Ruby but
you're welcome to challenge me and tell
me that I don't I'm going to talk a
little bit about the language overview
what's different from maybe Java or PHP
or whatever you might have used before
but Ruby itself is a very nice dynamic
language that was invented in 1993 by a
guy named yahara Matsumoto in Japan he
looked at pearl small talk lisp and he
decided he liked bits of all these
languages he liked the object
orientation of small talk he liked how
quick Pearl was to get started and write
a script he liked some of the more
functional programming pieces from Lisp
and scheme and so he made this Ruby
language for mainly for programmer
happiness and programmer productivity he
wanted something that he would enjoy
coding in was easy to read and made him
happy to use Ruby didn't have much of a
following outside of Japan though until
two thousand four when a guy named David
Hina minor hey David Hina Maya Hansen
who now works and lives here in Chicago
built the rails framework rails is the
framework for building database backed
web apps that caught on like wildfire
and really propelled Ruby into the
mainstream not only did it did rails
become very popular it also
led to a lot of other frameworks that
followed the rails conventions and we'll
talk a little bit about those but it
also just got more people excited about
doing Ruby for other things for mobile
apps for just plain old scripting and
for everything else the reason you're
probably here is for the row mobile
track because it relies heavily on Ruby
and can use Ruby in a lot of really cool
ways I'm not an expert in real mobile
roads though so you're going to have to
talk to the other guys about that but
what I like about it is it gives you the
flexibility with Ruby it takes some cues
from the rails structure and lets you do
some really cool things with it a little
bit about core rupee I'm assuming all of
you are coming from Java C sharp PHP
something like that show hands like Java
C sharp some seek out of something other
scripting languages perl PHP something
cool cool well Ruby is similar to all of
those it's a you know a see style
language a Java style language where you
have objects and classes one thing
really interesting in Ruby is that
everything under the Sun is an object so
our integers the number 5 I can ask what
its classes and it's a it's an object of
fixed num we don't have any native types
we have objects and it knows enough to
make a really big number a big num so
you don't have to you know instantiate
numbers but you can see that there might
be some power there because numbers are
our objects and everything in Ruby is an
object you know with numbers we have all
the standard arithmetic the one weird
one in Ruby is the exponent operator
which is star star so two star star 10
is to the 10th rather than the carrot I
don't know why I'm probably in pearl or
something for that
strings in Ruby also very simple you
just have a string a string hello world
double quotes that's a string it's an
object as well we'll be able to call
methods on this and do all kinds of cool
objective things and we can do use
single quotes double quotes we also have
some weird sin taxes with like % q and
other strange ways but really we have
single quoted in double quoted strings
as you might expect and we also have
string interpolation using okay I'll be
honest the syntax is a little ugly it's
pound curly braces but using that we can
insert something into a string whether
it's the result of an math operation a
variable an entire Ruby expression
whatever needs to be the only thing
about strings is that sink you can only
do string interpolation with double
quoted strings in Ruby so I tend to just
use double quotes a lot they're cool but
you'll probably get bit by that once
with single quotes we have simple
methods in Ruby you know you might be
used to functions in any other language
but if you think of object-oriented call
methods this is a very simple Ruby
method can one see that ok it's kind of
small up here one thing you'll probably
notice right away is that there's very
little punctuation in Ruby methods and
in Ruby in general we define a method
with deaf and end so def my addition and
then we take two arguments value one
value to and we add them together we
don't have curly braces to denote the
method we just use end to say that we're
done I also don't have any return value
which is really cool in Ruby we have
what we call the implicit return
whatever the last thing is
a method that gets evaluated will be the
return value so if I do 10 different
things whatever that last line is gets
returned as though I said return value 1
plus value too we do have a return
keyword you only need to use it in a
situation where you want a short circuit
what you're doing inside sure yep you so
if I was doing some it'll always be the
last line you return or you could have
an if statement you know if some
conditions met return an explicit value
so in Ruby will will usually you know do
whatever we do and then just if we set a
variable maybe just have that return
below or as last thing if you don't need
a return value you can you know it'll
return something but it doesn't matter
you could also explicitly return nil
just say mill on the last line as well
to call a method looks pretty familiar
right you just call the method and say
here are my arguments and in this
particular one would give us back the
number 15 yeah interesting there's no
idea of type safety here right we'll
come back to that in a minute because I
want talk about variables first when we
define a variable we also don't use a
type we just say something like a AE
quills hello world really simple we
don't we don't need to specify what type
it is and we can also redefine that
variable to be something different at a
later time so I can redefine a to be 15
and both variables and methods we can
define them with any lower case letters
and we
before we use underscores between words
to separate them so I had my underscore
addition or I might have first
underscore name we typically use
lowercase letters rather than Java style
camelcase yes everything is case
sensitive so to your question about type
safety ruby has what we call strong
dynamic typing its strong because every
variable this variable a always knows
what it's holding at one point it's
holding a string and it knows it's
holding a string later it's holding and
integer we know that it's holding an
integer so the unlike like see where you
have to you know you're talking about
just bytes of memory Ruby always knows
exactly what type of object it's holding
so that's what we mean by strong typing
dynamic typing means we can change it so
a can be a string in one minute number
the next some crazy object two minutes
later doesn't matter
yep the there is so if you try to do
something that you can't do so going
back to my my addition method if I
called that with two strings well the
plus sign is used as a concatenation
operator in Ruby so if i say my addition
i spelled it wrong but whatever and call
it with hello and world it will
concatenate those together this is what
we call duck typing if it looks like a
duck that sounds like a duck if these
two values can be added together I don't
care what they are so this is where we
see that yeah if you try to add a string
and a person class or something that's
when you get a runtime error of you know
can't can't coerce Ruby's pretty good at
trying to figure out I'm not trying to
figure out it will do some basic
conversions for you if you try to add
one and one point zero it knows to
return a float for you if you try to you
know add a string and a number it just
will say I can't do that yep we have we
have methods we can convert between them
I don't have them in here but you can
convert at any time there's a two I to
underscore I method you can call on a
string to convert it to an integer or to
f4 float and to convert to a string you
can say to underscore s so 200 score I f
s to convert between integer string and
floats
those are the basics no they aren't but
it's enough to keep moving forward
because I want to talk about our
collection types because this is what
you're going to see no matter what kind
of Ruby you're doing whether it's simple
scripting simple scripting rails
applications roads apps it's all going
to use our different collection types a
lot simplest one is an array an array in
Ruby is just very simple here we have an
array literal I have to work two ways we
can define a new array i can say array
dot knew that might make you feel better
but i don't need to the first line is
exactly the same just square brackets
some values i don't have to say how long
the array is going to be i don't have to
define what kind of types go in to
access an array this should look
familiar to all of you you just use the
index index in tax so you know a of two
gives me back the 01 to the third value
of 45 and if I chain I can change a
value with that same syntax I can say a
square bracket zero is now 1000 and now
my array starts with the value 1000 very
simple to grab and set values in an
array arrays can also be polyglot arrays
they can hold different values we don't
have to have a raise of just a single
type this might be scary but it also is
I mean you're not typically doing this
it just you can if you need to it goes
back to our not needing to define what
the array can hold we can if we really
want to put a string a float an integer
and another string in there we can and
we can mix and match values change the
browned it will I can change banana to
be
the number seven it's just a it's just a
place in the array we can also have we
can also dynamically resize our arrays
without having to do any thinking if I
have an array of two fruits and I set
the second so 0 1 2 which doesn't exist
yet to be orange now my array has three
objects we have lots of really cool ways
of adding additional adding to the array
we're moving from the array from both
sides and checking for how big an array
is yes
it will fill them with nil so yeah it'll
it'll fill all those back it it yeah
lets you do that pretty easily and if
you try to access an array object that
doesn't exist it will return back nil so
fruits of 12 will give you an ill it
just it doesn't it doesn't care how far
you go in there correct yep so I can
call fruits length this is a method call
on my fruits array gives me back three
objects or three the number three right
now we have three items in that array
after inserting orange into there i also
have handy ways of saying fruits dot
first to give me the zeroth the first
item in there or fruits that last to
give me the last one i also can do-
indexing which is really cool i can say
fruits negative one and it will give me
orange or negative 2 will give me banana
so just accessing from the other end
nope no truncating is there probably is
something easy for that but i don't know
what it is off hand bleep pop push you
can you can also like slice an array or
just trim it down yeah lots of fun stuff
you can do the raise the next and
probably most important collection type
in Ruby is the hash also known as hash
tables dictionaries associative arrays
and other languages the hash is probably
the most used and abused and loved data
type in Ruby it's really just a key
value pair where the key is unique
we create them similar to arrays we have
an array literal syntax of curly braces
and then ki equal greater than and value
so here i have a hash of two objects of
a key of name value of daniel language
is another key and a value of ruby the
little equal greater than sign is a
little weird we we finally call it the
hash rocket because it's used in hashes
to separate the key and value but you
know there with that we have a simple
hash literal we access them very similar
similarly to an array so we can say H
and use the key name to get out Daniel
the value for name like an array if I
try to grab something that isn't in
there so here age it just says nope nil
I don't know about that key the key can
be anything yeah this is actually really
interesting in Ruby that your keys and
values can be any object so your key
could be a string a number a another
object if you're making your key and
object your might be doing it wrong but
there are probably some situations where
that's valid here I set a non-existing
key to 10 or I could overwrite a key if
i set the name key it would override my
my name and change it to something else
so now I have a new hash with well I've
modified the hash with the age key and
added that in there
I want to mention briefly symbols
because they're the weird they're this
weird strange thing in Ruby but you see
them a lot in hashes a symbol in ruby
begins with a colon and nine times out
of ten they're being used as just a key
in a hash so I build a new hash with
colon name and colon age as my keys and
I access them using the colon age so
this symbol colon age is not the same as
a string you could kind of think it
think of it as a a finalized string or
more of an identifier I really don't
know of a exact equivalent in any other
language so if you want to just think
them as think of them as oh that thing
we use for hash keys you can because you
probably will see them in the in the
wild and wonder what they are it's not a
variable it doesn't have a value it's
just an identifier we use most often in
hashes and if that meant nothing just
ignore it yes hmm the hashes the hashes
yeah you could think of these as just
your your attributes but the the colon
name itself doesn't it in this hash it
points to alice but colon name outside
of the hash has no meaning both hashes
and arrays can you know obviously
continue our hash values can be anything
and hash keys ken too it's a little
weirder but of course we could insert an
array into a hash and we could also have
an array of hashes this that will be
very common so here I have an apple and
banana hash treating them like objects
with properties and then I can build an
array of the two of those and I can even
grab out the last one in there
multi-dimensional arrays are really just
a raise of arrays
so my matrix is an array of three sub
arrays of three values so that could be
a 3 by 3 array simple enough the last
type I want to talk about is the range
type I think this is the coolest thing
in Ruby because it just is a really easy
way to represent some range of values so
here my range is the numbers between 10
and 100 and you define a range with dot
dot so 10 dot dot 100 is all the values
between 10 and 100 it doesn't build that
out into an array you can say to
underscore a and and get that array but
it's really just a way of identifying
the each each end very quickly and you
can ask if it includes a number if it
overlaps another range it's nothing you
couldn't do in a handful lines of code
but it's a very fun datatype what I
really like is using it with things like
x so if I had a date for January one a
date for December 31 I can then see if
you know today is inside that range or
you know some value from the user so
here I build it a range of those two
dates I ask does it have today of course
the answer is true if I ask does it
include you know 365 days from now the
answer is false so really fun really fun
type makes it easy to check against sets
of conditions ruby has regular
expressions as well you would create
them either with regex new or just the
literal syntax with forward slashes so
here I've built a simple regular
expression with four digits dash two
digits dash two digits kind of a date
format
and I can use that to match against
strings so if i have a string called
info the conference runs from this date
to that date i can use equal till day to
as a simple match so info my variable
info equal till day that regular
expression what it actually returns
there is the first index that it matches
at so in this particular when it matches
at character 21 any non nil value means
it found a match in there so if it found
it at the beginning it would be 0 but
and if it didn't find it it would be nil
i can use dot match on that string
instead so info dot match to get a value
back and or to get a match data object
back that then I can call other methods
on and get the data out and there's a
lot of other ways we can you know do
match groups and pull data out using
regular expressions simple substitutions
we have the sub and G sub methods as you
probably expect sub substitutes the
first one so if i replace in today it
replaces the first date with the word
today and if I G sub i can replace both
dates with the word today or do
something more complex and tweak it in
there I do want to mention this tool
called Ruby leur Ruby leur com it is a
regular expression testing tool and it
is fantastic because it's it's built
with the Ruby engine so you can put in a
regular expression test it out and it
gives you all the different modifiers
below so if you're doing anything with
regular expressions Ruby law com is
fantastic and I recently saw something
similar for JavaScript regular
expressions called script dealer or
something like that
I want to talk briefly about
conditionals in Ruby we have the simple
if statement the first thing you'll
notice about this if statement is
probably that it has very little
punctuation sorry if that's a little
small in the back has if input equal
equal quit so if my input is equal to
quit I exit so if and end or what denote
my if statement block weather however
many lines are in there I don't need
parentheses around the condition you can
put them there if it makes you feel
better but you don't need to Ruby really
lets you leave off as much punctuation
as you want it it doesn't like it it yes
with it with a new line the statement
ends with a new line so you can as long
as it's a complete statement it will
treat that as a complete line you if you
want to do multiple statements on the
same line you can use a semicolon but
it's usually don't need to
yep you could use them here too it's
just not necessary if you you can use
the backslash up at use a backslash at
the end of a line or it you can do a
kind of an unbalanced statement so if I
said 1 plus new line Ruby knows that
that's not a complete statement so it'll
wait for the next line to complete that
statement so I could do 1 plus and then
two on the next line and it will realize
it's waiting for a balanced statement
and find that one cool thing on if
statements is you can do a single line
if i can rewrite the above as exit if
input equal equal quit that's great if
you just do have a single line if
statement otherwise it can you know you
might as well do the big form but the
trailing if is kind of cool works the
same way no you would have to it this
doesn't work with code blocks away at
that same way we also have the inverted
if for the unless statement unless is
really just a anything you would say not
in front of so you know if not input
equal equal quit if you want to you can
use unless it's just the opposite so
unless equal unless input equals quit we
do some work and again we have the
single line form of that too I like
unless for really simple statements if I
if anything gets more complex i usually
go back to if
there is else we to do multiple
conditions we have if else if and else
so here if the input is quit we exit if
the input else if the input is pause we
sleep for 20 seconds and else we do some
work pretty simple the only thing that
you will get burned by is that you
definitely know note the spelling of
else if it is not else space if it is
els i F you can definitely blame pearl
for that one that will that will burn
you once and then you will curse the
Pearl guys forever and the Ruby guys for
copying them yeah for this particular
one how about this it's not really so
like well what yeah that's longer that's
more conditions you do have that we do
of the ternary ternary form and it's the
statement ? positive case colon negative
case that works the same as anything
else I do want to point out the case
statement in Ruby though it's nothing
you can't do with an if but it's a
little bit it can be more powerful and
interesting in cool ways you give it
some starting values so case input here
just some variable then you'd have a
series of when so when quit you exit
when its paws you sleep I can test
against particular objects so I can say
when it's a string and then do something
cool or I can test against a range when
it is between five and ten do something
or test against a regular expression
unlike some languages it will only match
one of these one blocks it doesn't fall
through to others so it's just going to
pick the first one that matches
it won't it won't do it will never do
multiple know yep you can you use a
double bar syntax for or and and an for
and you can also use the words and an or
in Ruby same meaning just less less used
to do a loop we have a simple while here
we have count equals 0 while count is
less than 10 I'm outputting it and then
doing count plus equals 1 the plus equal
here is a is a really cool thing in Ruby
but it also shows us that we don't have
a plus plus I don't have to count plus
plus or minus minus but we have the plus
equal operator it's the same as saying
count equals count plus 1 what's cool
about is you can use it with any other
arithmetic operation you can do count
plus equals 10 or count- equal 5 they
they all work we also have the in line
while where you just use it at the end
of a line like an if useful for single
lines and you can rewrite this version
as a single line I output the count plus
equal one wild count is less than 10
that'll actually go from one to nine
order to change my count to be exactly
equal because I'm outputting it before
but
and then we also have unless which is
the inverse form of while so it just it
works until the condition is true or
true wow this is I totally did wrong
there this is all until not unless until
until count equals 10 or until count is
greater than or equal to 10 I will
change my slides we do have a for loop
in Ruby for fruit and fruits or four
person in people we don't use it we do
not have the syntax of for I equals zero
semicolon I plus plus yeah you know it
is and this one that we have we don't
use we're going to do it eration the
Ruby way which is this syntax fruits dot
each fruits that each do vertical pipes
whatever my variable is inside my
iteration in this case fruit so if I
have a list of fruits this will iterate
over each one assign the variable fruit
and output I love apple I love banana I
love orange this syntax will look weird
to you and that's okay but it is the
Ruby way of iterating and you'll see it
all over even weirder we can replace the
do and end with curly braces so this is
the same as above just with curly braces
in place of the do and end so we use
this for multi line or single line
statements and we usually use the each
or the do end version for multi-line
statements they're interchangeable
the reason that this syntax is really
cool is that we have a whole bunch of
other methods that we can call on an
array a hash arrange things like map
each with index to pass in an index
counter as well or each key to go
through each key in a hash and we also
have a lot of other syntax and Ruby that
uses the same style we actually use the
do n sintex for opening files and it's
really cool so actually what I what I
usually tell when I'm teaching a class
is like just get to know the syntax you
don't have to understand it right now
but get to recognize it because you will
start to see it everywhere objects in
Ruby we have very simple class person
gives us a person class and we also have
inheritance using the less than operator
so here programmer inherits from a
person everything inherits from object
implicitly by default so I didn't have
to say person inherits from object but
it it does by default and then something
simple like a constructor the
constructor is the only strange method
in Ruby classes because you use the
initialize name to define a constructor
so now i would say person dot new and
pass in a name and it would use my
constructor on my class any other
methods you decide to define in your
class become instance methods and you
can also define class methods and scoped
methods and everything else you need
no no will you do you can you can go
extremely deep we do only have single
inheritance though so we don't can't
inherit from different sources but you
can you know you can have a minion that
inherits from programmer and an intern
that inherits from minion and that will
get all the data and attributes that
your methods that you would have on your
person class all the ultimate all the
methods and all the the yeah you don't
get data on a particular instance so you
just get like a person might inherit
from animal and so you have you know
what what am I trying to say you don't
know the name of the person or the
animal but you have all the same
attributes you might have a name and a
number of legs or something like that
don't know that really might confuse me
more correct correct yep
but there is no wait
we do we have we have public methods
private methods protected methods one
interesting thing in Ruby is that there
are ways of getting around private
methods which can be really useful if
you're you know stuck using some library
and you can't like in Java if
something's private its private for good
in Ruby you can actually dig in and get
around that if you have to so we have a
keyword that we say private and then any
methods defined below that in the class
private but we can still if we really
need to we can get access to those and
it gives us the flexibility I wanted to
do yeah sure I wanted to do a quick talk
on rails because I wanted to show you
really quick demo of what we can do with
rails something like creating a new demo
app I've done this before if I say like
rails new demo and create a new rails
app and then it's taking forever
I can make a person class with a name
string and an age of integer LCD demo
it's okay that I'm just that you're not
you might not be following along because
there's a lot of great info and rails
what I just wanted to show quickly
though is how we can you might want to
use rails and dig into a little bit
later because it gives us a really easy
way to create simple crud apps so i just
created this app / people if i cant
spell people right that gives me a whole
like crud interface for creating for
creating people wow great person okay
new person
and the really cool thing about the
simple rails app is we have json
representations of all our data so all
my people that i just created this
little Crudup for I have a JSON
representation of all that all that data
there's Daniel with an age of five and
Alice with the age of 45 if I had more
time I would show you how all that works
but i'll save that for another day what
i do want to talk about though is using
json in ruby in rails we have this
json.parse object method call we can
pass in some raw JSON in roads its row
colon colon json.parse they work the
same way they have the exact same method
calls and interface what's really cool
about JSON and Ruby is this lets us take
some some JSON with keys and values so
here is you know some JSON named Bob age
20 friends of an array of strings it'll
turn that into a hash that we can use in
our in our Ruby process or in our roads
app or whatever so a lot of what we do
with JSON and Ruby is converting JSON
into hashes and you can see they even
look similar you know they're not
exactly a slight syntactic difference
but if you're dealing with JSON and it's
really easy to see how that'll turn into
a hash of of data in Ruby so if i gave
json.parse this first chunk of code it
would return back this as a hash if
you're using XML it's just as easy it
just assumes that you have a sane XML
file in both plain old Ruby and inroads
you can call re XML document new and
give it an XML file and will work the
same way
the last thing I want a demo is a little
tool that I want to want you to try
sometime later called IRB IRB is what we
call interactive Ruby and once you once
you've had that installed you can do
simple Ruby expressions like five plus
three or h equal or let's see fruits
equals banana apple and banana you know
play with arrays so you can start
testing like can I call if I safe routes
that length what was the question and I
set it to be equal to 10 nope I can't I
get a no method error undefined method
length equals so I cannot set the length
using that syntax IRB is really cool
because it lets you play around with
Ruby right you know right in front of
you and you don't have to you can play
around with method see what you can do
with it it's an array
like in two actually yeah you can say
fruits methods it'll give you a whole
it'll give you an array of all the
methods you can call because it's an
array you can say fruits that methods
dot sort and it will give you them
sorted alphabetically you can even say
okay well that has a bunch of methods ok
this is get in advance but whatever
let's take that list of methods and sort
them but then subtract off anything
that's on object new dot methods ok
really this will give me only the
methods that are unique to the array
class exactly so you can do all kinds of
really cool things about or with your
classes and objects in in Ruby there are
four Ruby Ruby dot org is the official
documentation and it's pretty good look
it's it's their interface is not the
best but it works it's the it's it's
great there are a handful of sites that
integrate both Ruby and other projects
whether it's rails or roads or something
else they try to integrate all the
documentation in one place for that
actually I like things built into
editors whether it's one of the Ruby
editors like ruby mine or something more
generic a lot of them have built-in
documentation in it it is ok it really
depends on the type of project your
building and what you're working on with
IRB I did want to mention rails console
it is just like IRB but for rails it's
for inspecting your objects inside the
rails environment it can be it's the
same thing but with rails also we have a
couple ways we can look at data we have
the puts method
puts hi and we also have the y method so
if i have a hash or something
the Y method
okay maybe they've removed that in my
particular version yeah that's more than
the rails console it's why as a way of
dumping out your data as well forget I
pulled that up we do have debugging and
Ruby we have two gems to libraries that
we can use for debugging both works
similar to gdb or the Java debuggers if
you're using an IDE there will be
something built into that as well and it
will probably use one of these under the
hood but I do want to show you how you
can read these errors Ruby gives you
decent stack trace errors that you can
even without a debugger you can get a
lot of data like for instance this error
undefined local variable or method my
method for some class isn't all that
helpful but if you wrote my method then
hopefully you know where to look for
that and if not you can start to look
down here and see okay well this is from
a you know some kind of framework
framework framework but down in here
there is one line of code that I wrote
because I see that it's in my you know
my projects directory wherever I store
code and it's looking at sine dot RB
colon 16 so that's actually telling me
what file and what line and in what
method in the import method that there's
some method I'm calling that doesn't
exist other weird errors you can get
this one's really common it's my
favorite you try to call some method and
you get a undefined method for nil this
is my favorite method because you're
tempted to think oh the first name is
nil you know the like first name on this
user is nil I don't know why what's
really telling is that no the user is
nil and nil does not have a method
called first name so when you're reading
these errors actually take the time to
read what they're saying not what you
think they're saying and hopefully that
will help you out I have a couple links
to more info because we're kind of at a
time
the the official documentation Ruby org
is your best bet for finding more about
Ruby also go to the additional sessions
on the real mobile track I do want to
show you a site called tri Ruby it's the
most cool thing in the world you can
actually try Ruby in your browser and it
gives you a little tutorial about lots
of the different language features so go
to try Ruby org and give it a shot it's
a lot of fun even if you'll never use it
again so what's that oh yeah great
drawing so i'll be around the rest of
the day i'll be in the expert session
later thanks for coming this
presentation is also online if you want
to copy down the URL and thanks for
coming sorry that was little whirlwind
