conference ever I know I know I know
what you guys are thinking who is this
awesome guy sitting in the front of the
room where did he get those rad shades
well I'm actually sorry to disappoint
you guys but I'm actually not that cool
but I just want to kind of illustrate a
point here so this does have a context
of Scour but but but I'm going to get
there slowly but my point is basically
that deducing certain truths about the
beauty and that you see in the things
that you make only based on a narrow
vantage point can some sometimes lead to
mistakes or misjudgments in my case if
you take me and throw me in a party
function your program is likely if there
were a runtime error but that said ah ok
so looking at like the the same kind of
perspective of view of a certain design
from a different perspective say for
another person who may be sitting on a
different side of the bus that view may
be kind of skewed by certain differences
let's say there's fog on the on the
window that they kind of have to push
aside or there is a set of confusing an
up you skated bytecode that they kind of
have to rearrange and try to understand
in order to see your vision but i
thought this idea was kind of
interesting and i thought i would kind
of explore it in terms of basically a
java programmer looking back at what a
scholar programmers code generates for
them ok so where does my story start my
story starts with my mom as most stories
do and what I really love about moms is
the kind of lessons that they teach you
as a child kind of come back later on in
life and they apply in lots of different
contexts for me my mom taught me a lot
students and those kind of lessons kind
of reapply to me in a day-to-day basis
actually in the and what I do for
programming so let's say for instance
always finish what's on your plate this
one I don't adhere to as much as I
probably should but this basically means
that we all have lots of ideas we all
get really excited about things but
what's important is not so much starting
those things but finishing those things
clean behind your ears keep it clean
otherwise you'll end up with a ball of
mud that was mentioned earlier but one
of the more important points so if
you're taking notes and this will be on
the quiz later is to always be mindful
of your neighbors and why I think this
one's most important is because when
applied to basically any problem domain
that creates a better world for
everyone's future particular ours so how
does this apply to why does this apply
to Skala so though there many are not
many there's a handful of different
implementations of the Scylla
programming language there's a pretty
good chance that the one that you use
runs on the JVM why is this a good
choice the je viens essentially
considered mostly reliable runtime so
and for that same reason other languages
have adopted it is their kind of target
runtime platform and so it's probably a
good idea whenever designing your code
that you want to kind of play nice with
the other kids frolicking up right again
and so you can kind of think of this
also is basically a courtesy to others
sometimes I see skyla programmers who
look down on Java programmers it's not
so much that the Java programmers are
any more primitive and they may just
have a different perspective on things
that said when you're playing in the
same playground or your codes running in
the same the same basically run time or
whatever you kind of want to do it would
you would do yourself a benefit by
showing the courtesy to them in the
interfaces that you expose some extra
thought with them in mind and so when it
comes to scala and other languages view
escada when it comes to Skylar
hopping on the JV n there's kind of two
things that they kind of round upon and
basically giving the JVMs young
generation gray hair early and we
generate a lot of garbage just scale
that makes it really easy to do that and
also these kind of awkward interfaces
which if we tried a little bit harder we
can kind of resolve our differences with
some extra thought so therefore I talk
about those differences I guess it's
worth mentioning what's universally
translatable between anyone got that
joke okay oh my god it's tricky so so in
Scala we have lots of different types to
work with and to mold with and do what
we want with but so what does translate
well to Java is behavior behavior lyst
rates those are traits without any
behavior and basically all three flavors
of classes with other classes abstract
classes in case classes case classes
actually generate an object but I'll
talk about that later so what doesn't
translate well basically everything else
that we like about the language that's
why we use it but again I think we can
do a little bit better job of thinking
about the interfaces that we exposed and
then this is kind of like a small talk
about some things to consider when ever
you think about this so can anyone in
the room attach a name to this face Mark
Twain yeah good bonus points on the quiz
so yeah he was kind of known for many
things but one of the things he was
known for was dabbling in a pastime
called back translations back
translations are kind of an interesting
subject matter basically it's so say you
have a source document someone
translates that to another document in a
different language and then the back
translator takes the translation in
attempts to translate it back to the
original source without the actual
source on hand so and then it's kind of
funny whenever you compare the original
source with the back translator source
you can kind of see like where the
differences lie between the two
in terms of transition and so among many
tools that the Java Runtime provide is
this little one cog java p java p will
let you kind of inspect class files in
the bike code and then most basically
split out spit out what it thinks what
the actual java source interfaces would
look like interestingly enough since the
sky the c compiler generates class files
and byte code that the JVM can
understand you can actually point java p
as scala translated a classify oh and
see what a java what what it expects the
java source file to look like to some
degree so i'm going to go through a
couple different features that i like
about Scylla and things that don't tend
to translate well when you translate
them back to Java from by code so if
there was one feature that I had to have
in Scala and that I could not give up it
would be default arguments so I'm sure
you're all familiar with this type of
programming pre skyla 28 you do this a
lot in Java too particularly where you
don't want to break interfaces you want
to add new behavior but maintain older
interfaces and basically we do as you
override and so let's say you have a
method apply that takes an int and then
you build some client code against that
and you introduce some new feature you
don't want to change the usage of the
existing interface so basically you add
a new add a new argument to the method
and then you can kind of keep changing
this as you add new features so that you
don't break old features know what it
ends up being is a lot of boilerplate
and it makes you an angry developer this
is an angry developer at a younger stage
so basically if the formatter that this
talk is kind of like what you see and
what you make it and so in a when taken
over board you can kind of take this
this feature set which is basically
allows users of your code to actually
not have to pass in any arguments just
give a default to everything
and what that actually generates for
your Java users something that's really
ugly it looks something like this so how
many of you are kind of already familiar
this might give me a sense of the
basically that what Java could what
calling okay how many of you have kind
of had experienced calling into scholar
from Java code okay more than I thought
so that hopefully someone appreciates
this so basically whenever you get on
and Scala you can have basically the
same name type under a given package you
can do this with traits with classes
with objects but actually this is kind
of an illegal thing that you can't do in
the Java world this would you would run
into name collisions and the way the
people typically typically work around
this is to namespace namespace things
differently so you kind of get away get
away from the problem with qualification
but what this is doing here is in Scala
you can't actually define constants or
static static methods or whatever for
that you have a companion object where
do you store that for basically the
arguments of a constructor there's no
state so Scala generated basically a
companion object for me and it's
basically storing those arguments that I
said in the the constructor as a default
as these kind of long mangled names so
basically if a driver user wanted to use
your code in Java they don't have the
language feature of default arguments
available to them so basically they
would be forced to reference these long
identifiers if if they wanted to use
your interface so that said it's worth
thinking about not going overboard and
basically providing default arguments
for everything you probably actually
really want to capture the common cases
of the the types of behavior that
or your interfaces would provide and for
the exceptional cases the cases that the
would be like the that times the method
wouldn't be called as often and applied
defog Youmans to those and because and
that would kind of hide it a little bit
more from the java developers and make
them happy and look less like this so
companion objects I kind of already
alluded to this in the last slide
companion objects again they work around
this problem where and in Scala you can
actually have a static method or a
constant basically in Scala you encode
that in a companion object and so let's
say you have a class bippy and you have
an object would be if you wanted to
store a constant for the type it be you
would most definitely want to put it in
the the year companion object that kind
of reduces like the overhead of object
allocation so you wouldn't need to for
each instance of class pippi to
instantiate new value for each one of
these constants so what does that look
in like Java again this is the same kind
of thing scholar generate some kind of
mangled names you would reference the
singleton object through this hippie
type this kind of has a suffix of a
dollar sign and then reference it
through this a constant member module
dollar sign and basically down here is
your vanilla class poppy and basically
this guy over here and then you can
instantiate that if as if you would any
other class in Java the sucky thing is
that the Java developers would kind of
have to indirectly reference to these
contents through this really a ugly name
which kind of sucks but there's some
kind of interesting properties about the
way that Scylla treats these two these
two things that I'm going to try to show
you a quick demo of something that's a
little bit neat so companions so
basically this is like the kind of what
you saw on this slide earlier and so
let's say we
added some behavior or a method to bit
b/c OOP yeah sorry not think about that
this viewable ok so bit B says Boop and
it be returns get class get mean so I go
back to hear this should automatically
give me a boot ok so now the Fremen
drivers from a Java developers
perspective and you kind of have this
boot member which basically delegates
into your companion objects Boop I'm
going to fast forward ahead and because
I'm running out of time but another
interesting property is what happens
whenever would be defined Boop that was
really short on time and basically the
java class deals that boot method and
makes it an instance method ok i'm going
to try this really quick little check
you can do singleton is to provide an
interface familiar to java developers
so live coding those takes more time
oops
yes
I think this will do it yep and so
basically if you wanted to reference a
the loop on the bippy basically you can
call bigoted were to give you a
reference to the singleton object which
is a lot nicer than called calling bippy
dollar sign module and then calling the
poop on that this kind of gives you an
indirect and nicer path to do that in
Java so I did have a couple other
examples but I ran out of time but yeah
until then yeah just come talk to me
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
