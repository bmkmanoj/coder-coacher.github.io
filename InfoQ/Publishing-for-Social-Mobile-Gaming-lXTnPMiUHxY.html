publishing organization at six days law
laps where publisher on both social and
mobile a little bit about six waves
again we publish on social mobile and
what is a publisher do in these two
places there's a couple key services
that we provide distribution marketing
localization hosting and game advisory
and so on the distribution and marketing
side we have a network of around 25
million monthly active users across both
platforms any game that joins our
network we automatically start cross
loading those users in in addition to
that for the games that do perform we
spend hundreds of thousands if not
millions of dollars pushing those games
there's also localisation so we
localized in 24 25 up to nine or ten
different languages hosting and then
game advisory so because we do see such
a wide array of games our product team
has a good idea of what are the best
practices across the various platforms
and so the developers that work with us
we share some of those best practices a
couple of top games that we've published
mostly on facebook there's probably 15
to 17 games that we pushed over 1
million monthly active users there's a
handful 456 that we've done to the 4 5 6
million monthly active user range and
then there's a raven sky city and
Ravenwood fair which we've pushed to
over 10 11 12 million monthly active
users now to keep it somewhat
interesting and just not a pure pitch I
just want to share a little bit about
what publishing looks like in the social
and mobile space relative to the console
space so I myself spent a couple of
years over at xbox on the first party
publishing team working on both halo and
age of empires I've been in the social
and mobile space for a year and a half
two years now and a lot of people ask
why is publishing necessary in social
mobile definitely while you can build a
great game you still do need someone to
go push traffic to your game spend
marketing doing user acquisition helping
to localize these games and for a lot of
developers who are focused on making
that great fun game experience this
isn't stuff that they want to worry
about and so they partner with us and we
take care of all that stuff now a couple
of things that are different between
let's say console publishing traditional
PC game publishing and social mobile
publishing
right here so definitely there's
increased data visibility leading to
more transparent communications between
the publisher and developer so I'm
saying with this is on facebook on
mobile you can see exactly how your
users are performing after you locked a
game you're constantly looking at the
stats and so both the publisher and the
developer are very aligned with how the
game is doing the game's not doing well
everyone knows whereas on the console or
PC side the developer makes the game
they basically pitch it over to the
publisher and then they don't really see
how the game does until you know let's
say the weekly reports of the monthly
reports come out another one is the deep
connectivity between the game design and
the distribution in the marketing side
really allows publishing to bring to the
table best practices so because we do
see so many games we see on facebook
what are the viral features that are
going to spread to users what are the
retention metrics that are going to get
people coming back to your game on
mobile it might be what are the specific
UI changes that we've seen some of our
developers do that make for a better
gameplay experience these are things
that as a publisher we can bring to the
partners whereas you know on console
generally is the developers know exactly
what kind of game they want to make
their only relying on I'm the publisher
for the distribution in the marketing
another one game development cycles are
fast enough that when you work with a
publisher like us on social our mobile
you're not signing away two to three
years of work it's four months six
months see how it does and if the
publisher does a good job then yet you
continue working with them but if not
you know you go out and work with
someone else fortunately for us we've
signed with multiple partners where
we've worked on a couple of games
they've valued will be been able to
bring the table and so there's you know
five or six where we've launched two
three four five games and then finally
players at this point on multiple social
networks on multiple mobile networks
really in order to hit as many of these
people as possible with as many touch
points you want to be working with
someone who does have polishing across
all of those platforms and fortunately
we do and that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
