talk because I wanted to give people
kind of an intuition more of an it this
is not gonna be a super technical talk
but I wanted to give an intuition for
how do you write functional programs
that do sort of seemingly imperative
things so you know things like reading
from a database writing to a database
you know reading from files drawing to
screen you know all these things that
people think of as not necessarily being
the best fit for functional programming
so this is not going to be super
technical I'm not gonna you really talk
directly about monads or either a tease
or anything I want to just more show how
you could actually kind of discover some
of these concepts for yourselves if you
just sort of start with the sort of
premise of functional programming and
kind of work from there
so I'd like to make a bold claim here
which is that functional programming
actually provides I think the most
powerful tools for imperative
programming out of any paradigm and I'm
gonna explain what I mean by that but
but sort of the general idea is that
when you're when you're programming
functionally you're forced to move from
directly performing the side effects
ourselves to constructing composable
descriptions that of programs that when
you glue them together will result in
some imperative program that does
whatever it is you want it to do and
it's just moving from you know doing the
actions yourselves to describing you
know basically a little language a
little imperative language and
assembling this little language that
ends up being a very powerful approach
and so I'm going to kind of kind of
demonstrate this with you know starting
with a very simple example and trying to
build up a little bit so this is a this
is a very simple example it's a toy
example I'm just trying to give an
intuition
this examples actually it was taken from
the first chapter of functional
programming in Scala which we just
released the meet today and you know
this is so let me just say a few things
about this code so we have a play a
player case class and we have this
function declare winner which takes the
player and and you know has the side
effect of printing to console and then
we have this winner function here which
is you know figuring out who the winner
is and displaying it okay so pretty
simple block of code here nothing too
exciting
but so one of the things I want to point
out is that whenever you have sort of
imperative code like this where you're
there's some side effect occurring in
this case you're printing to the console
a lot of times there's a pure core sort
of hidden inside okay and in this case
if you look at this function winner it's
actually doing two different things
the first thing it's doing is there's
logic for actually computing who the
winner is
and then the second thing it's doing is
it's having the side effect of okay now
that it has the winner I'm actually
going to display it and so we can factor
this code a little bit differently to
sort of reflect that intent so here I've
just broken out the logic of computing
the winner into a separate function and
this is now a pure function it's just
it's still taking two players but rather
than having the side-effect of printing
to console it's just returning the the
player that's the winner and then you
know we can call that pure function you
know and then still then pass it to the
function that has the side effect so
this is kind of a very general thing
that you can do which is that really any
time you have an impure function you can
generally factor it into into sort of a
pure core that's just a regular pure
function and and a sort of side effect
that consumes the output and maybe
does something with it that you know
some action and you can do this sort of
iteratively as well so you don't have to
just do this once you can just kind of
keep doing it so like let's look at this
function declare winner you know this is
a function that has a side-effect it's
printing to the console but again this
is also doing two things because it's
both computing a message and then
displaying that that message and we can
go ahead and factor that out as well oh
so this is a sort you can formalize this
idea a little bit of just I have a pure
function from or an impure function from
A to B and I can sort of just factor
that into a function from a to some
description D and then a function or an
interpreter of that description that
takes the D to some type B and then in
our case here we I mean you can see how
that applies in this case and and the
point is yeah you can you can keep doing
this so there's no there's no sort of
point at which you say oh well I have an
impure function so I can't sort of keep
factoring it to sort of split apart its
side-effects you can pretty much always
do this so here
yeah I'm showing how you can separate
the computing of the message that you
want to render you can separate that
from actually displaying that message
and if you I mean I think of this is a
very natural thing you're it's they're
really two separate concerns I mean a
lot of times we sort of intertwine these
things in our code without really
thinking about it but if you're sort of
looking for it you can see oh I can sort
of sort of split apart those two
concerns and and have a nice composable
sort of core and then kind of on the
outer edges of your program that's where
you have sort of your side effects where
you actually are interacting with the
real world okay so
if you sort of keep doing this you you
eventually do get to sort of the outer
edges of your program so you've sort of
factored all your your side-effects and
you keep sort of pushing them to the
outer layers and eventually you get to a
point where okay you actually do need to
do something you do need to have some
effect on the world you need to print a
console you need to read from a file
whatever it is and so what do you do
there
well you just sort of give up and say
well screw this functional programming
I'm just gonna go back to imperative
programming well no okay you don't so
you can actually you can actually
continue this this process but it maybe
changes a little bit so here what I've
done is this function declare winner
which you know we were thinking of it
before something that necessarily
requires some side effects because it
actually needs to print the message but
what we can do is instead I introduce
this this type I call that action it has
this completely opaque method run which
is really just interpret the action and
this function print line now instead of
actually per its capital print line here
so instead of actually doing the side
effect
it's just returning an action that when
interpreted will produce the side effect
okay so now you might be asking
yourselves well has this really bought
us anything okay and and that's actually
a really good question so the thing the
thing I want to convey here is that when
you when you sort of go with this
paradigm of your computing with these
descriptions and you're composing these
descriptions of things so action is a
description of what needs to happen
there's sort of these there's all these
design choices of what what makes a good
a good description so action you know
it's completely opaque right we can't
sort of look at an action and
and really reason about what it's going
to do it's just really the only thing
that it lets us do is delay when the
when we sort of have to pay for the side
effect and so just like with any other
data types that you're working with we
want to be with with these descriptions
of sort of imperative programs we want
to be dealing with descriptions that are
composable that we can sort of combine
in ways that are well defined and be
able to reason about what they're going
to do when we actually interpret them so
we want to be able to sort of assemble
these descriptions in well-defined ways
just just like any other sort of library
we might write and that you know
different design choices have different
trade-offs and the way to sort of
approach these things is you look at
your problem domain and you think of
well what would be a good description
for what I'm trying to do and what what
makes the things and programs I'm trying
to express more natural so action as I
was saying very opaque really the only
thing I can do with an action it's only
sort of API is that I can combine two
actions into one so you know I
introduced this function plus plus which
is just going to run the first action
when it's interpreted it's going to run
the first action and run the second
action so but I don't know this isn't
very interesting to me because I feel
like I wouldn't really if I just have a
list of these actions I mean there's
really nothing I can say about I'm not
going to no run the third action and
then the first action or I mean it's
it's just a opaque description I can't
really combine it in any interesting way
so another sort of restriction with
action is that we can't handle what I
call input side effects so here's sort
of a example program I'd like to write I
like to be able to prompt the user to
enter a temperature in Fahrenheit and
then I want to convert it to Celsius and
then print out the result okay just a
very simple program now you know I can I
have this this function in print line
which is returning an
right but there's no way to sort of
encode an action that is a side effect
that's going to return a result so I
don't really have any way that I can
kind of chain an input side effect
something that returns you know a value
chain that to some further you know
imperative program that I'm assembling
and so here I'm just forced to actually
call read line and actually do the side
effect and you know now this is no
longer a pure function it's you know
this is just sort of regular you know
imperative function here so when you
encounter situations like this so as you
sort of start to develop like a little
API for assembling these these little
imperative programs when you encounter a
situation like this you don't just throw
up your hands and say well screw this
functional programming stuff I'm just
gonna do all this with unrestricted
side-effects well no you think about
what I'm to be able to ask my
descriptions to express something
additional something that they can't
currently do and I'm going to sort of go
back to my data type that I'm using for
my descriptions and see what I could add
to it to be able to support the use case
that I'm trying to express so here's
sort of version two of action so so now
actions instead of just returning unit
every time actions when they're
interpreted they're gonna possibly
perform some side effect but they're
also going to return a result of type a
and now that they actually return a
result now I can start to combine
actions in more interesting ways
so I defined or you know I sort of wrote
out the signatures you could define the
the methods map and flatmap on action
and now that we have that we can use
action in for comprehensions and we can
write our example here of prompting user
for input so we call print line then we
call read line and notice read line it's
an action string so it's an it's an
imperative program that when run will
produce a string
so this is really just sort of gluing
together the sort of bits of the
imperative program so that I'm calling
redline I'm calling map I'm converting
the output of that sort of imperative
program and converting that to a double
and then just sort of chaining that you
know feeding that to two to the print
line converting to Celsius etc so and if
you look at this code it's actually it
looks very much like the sort of
original imperative program that we
wrote
I mean it's which is not not really
coincidence here but this is not
actually doing anything this is not
actually performing any side-effects
this is just returning a pure
description of what needs to happen and
it's only one I actually invoke run to
interpret this this description of this
little language that I actually pay for
those side effects so I I think of this
as a very natural thing like I just sort
of set out to solve a problem
I noticed that oh I couldn't really do
it with my sort of existing
representation for actions I thought
about what did I needed to add and then
I made that change and and now I'm still
really functional and we can keep going
so I mean one of the things you can do
is you could just add more primitive
actions here so here I added read lines
and write lines and you can kind of
imagine how these would work I haven't
shown them here but you know read lines
it takes a filename it's returning an
action which when interpreted gives you
the list of lines in the file write
lines kind of works the same way but
it's dumping this list of strings to the
file you give it and then here's a you
know a program that reads a bunch of you
know values from Fahrenheit txt into you
know a list so it's interpreting that
program so it's actually going to do
that i/o and then we're going to map
over that convert all those temperatures
to Celsius and then right
to the output file okay very simple here
and this is really not an amine this is
kind of the same principles as the the
previous slide here now so one of the
problems with this representation of
action is that and by the way the this
the what we have so far for action it's
this is sometimes called the IO monad
it's a very simple version of the immi
not it and kind of one of the problems
with it is that we can't really we can't
really do things incrementally which is
which is sort of what we would like to
be able to do I mean what this is going
to do read lines is it's going to take
the entire contents of that file and
read them into a list now I mean what if
that file has you know a gajillion a
gazillion elements in it and now we've
all read all that into memory when
really this if you just sort of think of
what this process is doing it shouldn't
need to you know keep everything in
memory it should be able to be streaming
streaming in the temperatures from the
input file transforming them and then
dumping them to the output file all in
roughly constant memory so again do we
just throw up our hands and say well
screw this functional programming you
know let's let's go back to imperative
programming and open up some some input
streams and output streams and just do
all this i/o manually well no we do we
do the same thing so what are we really
asking are our descriptions to be able
to do is we want to be able to kind of
represent in a more abstract form a
stream of values and we there are
certain operations namely map mapping
over that stream that we want to be able
to express so let me kind of go over
this so and this is more just meant to
be illustrative I think if you actually
sit down and try to think about how this
stuff would work you'll maybe come
with different ideas but so here I have
this this datatype source and it has a
function it's a source of a which can
separately think of it as like a stream
of A's okay but it's not nailing down a
particular representation of that stream
so the stream could be coming from a
file say and I've said that there's this
function map on a source which lets me
transform that stream and you can notice
the implementation is actually just
again it's not doing anything it's just
purely returning a description that this
mapping needs to occur so we have a case
class map source it takes the source
takes the function and it's not doing
anything with them it's just saying okay
this is here this needs to happen when
you interpret this program you're going
to need to do this mapping and then we
have a few other things so file lines
you give it a file name and it extends
source string and you can imagine the
interpreter for this program well here
I'll talk about that in a minute but so
we have different different sources I
can construct a source from just if I
happen to have a list of elements in
memory I can sort of promote that to a
source and then we have you know a
similar API as before except let's look
at read lines so instead of read lines
returning an action that returns a list
of strings the strict list action is now
just going to return it's it's going to
return just a source of strings which is
just again a description of a stream
basically of of strings and nothing's
really going to happen with that
description you know when you call read
lines and so here again I mean and then
we sort of glued together the logic in
the same way so this code actually looks
pretty much identical to what we had
before
I mean I actually think it it is
identical
so the for comprehension is identical
we're still reading the lines except
lines now it's not a strict list it's
actually just a description of a stream
of a stream that's coming from a file
really and then we map over that and
then we can write that too you know to
the output file now the interpreter for
this little language you know it starts
to get a little bit more complicated
because the interpreter shirted needs to
kind of keep track of these things but I
mean the interpreter can can say oh
you're you're you're reading from a file
you're mapping over it and you're
dumping it to another file well okay I
can just I'm you're just going to
interpret that as you know a very
imperative loop of read you know some
elements from the input transform them
dumped and dump them to the output in
just a streaming fashion so as you sort
of build up your descriptions to be what
you want your interpreter you have to
sort of add more smarts to your
interpreter maybe but you know the
advantages that you get to work with
this really nice this nice abstraction
and so I would just encourage you to
actually try doing this for some
imperative programs that you have and in
fact so I'm not going to sort of give
the answer but so something to think
about is so we want to do this streaming
but what if we wanted to you know read
so read in these degrees Fahrenheit and
then compute like a five element moving
average say and then stream that to the
output so think about how you would do
that you know would we need to change
our description at all to be able to
handle that thing because right now we
can do sort of map over a single value
of a source but to do this sort of
moving average we need to somehow have
access to the history or allow the
transformation of a source to retain
some some state or history as it's doing
the transformation so
yeah that's just something to think
about and those are the sorts of issues
you'll encounter as you sort of build up
these AP eise's you'll just start to
notice more and more you know little
requirements like that and you know it's
like you don't have to be discouraged by
them it's just oh this is kind of new
requirement and let me think about how I
could maybe add that to my description
and be able to you know still craft a
nice efficient interpreter for it so let
me just give some examples of kind of
this general paradigm this is like stuff
that we've used at work so we have like
a library for serializing serializing
you know large structured Java objects
or Scala objects to you know nicely
normalized database schemas and you know
rather than having that library actually
do the side effect of writing to the
database it instead just returns a
description of what needs to happen
which takes the form of essentially a
stream of tuples sent to different
tables a little bit more complicated
than that but that's the basic idea and
then so the library just produces sort
of that stream of tuples and then we can
compose the you know that those programs
in different ways and then there's a
completely separate thing which
interprets that description and actually
writes all the stuff out to the database
another example is like you know we have
sort of this custom way that you know
users can lay out a bunch of data into
into a report and you know rather than
having the layout actually do the side
effect of rendering the GUI we separated
sort of the description of the of the
layout of what they're trying to render
we separate that from actually rendering
the layout to to an actual GUI and
there's there's if you sister look at
things with this lens there's just tons
of examples of it of like decouple the
description or the little of the
language from the interpreter and
oftentimes the the language ends up
being something that's very nicely
composable and
easy to work with so yeah that's kind of
the take away is start if you have
imperative programs start by sort of
factoring out the effects kind of move
them to the outer layers of your of your
program and then once you get to that
point try to come up with nice
composable descriptions that you can
assemble to create interesting programs
that do what you want them to do so I'm
hoping this kind of gave people sort of
an intuition for it so I'm working on
this book functional programming in
Scala with rune RB Arneson and tony
morris it's coming out hopefully later
this year and it's it's gonna be talking
a lot about these I mean we just
released the the Manny early access
program there's a few chapters up there
and yeah the book has talks about these
issues in a lot more detail and there's
a lot I mean this is sort of a oh you
could have discovered these things
yourself but you know if you sort of
work through the book we sort of go into
oh what are the idioms that people have
discovered what are the nice
abstractions that people have have found
for assembling these these descriptions
and and writing useful imperative
programs functionally so yeah that's
that's all I got so anyone have any
questions
yes go ahead
so if you factor your side-effects out
to the outer layer everything else
disappear what's so bad about having
your var just right yeah nothing yeah
it's I mean and in fact it's at some
level there there needs to be something
that's actually having the side effect
kind of sometimes we say it's at the end
of the universe so it's not really a
side effect if if no one's around to
observe it what makes it a side effect
is that it breaks referential
transparency but if if there's no
serving closing program to see that the
side effect has occurred then it doesn't
actually break referential transparency
and as far as your program is concerned
you might as well have not have executed
that side effect and it was just the
program that called your your program
that actually performed that side effect
so yeah I mean you all tomorrow CH is
basically you're returning an imperative
program that is then executed and yeah
that is what you're doing the power of
the approach is that you're not limited
to sort of the imperative language that
you're given you know like it doesn't
have to be like C I mean you can sort of
design whatever sort of nice composable
little language you want for for doing
this sort of thing and then approach
sort of program to that as your API and
not that's kind of what makes it so
powerful as opposed to just doing the
imperative programming directly where
you're sort of forced to do things the
way the Machine wants you to do them yes
okay the question is how many times have
I forgotten to call unsafe perform IO at
the end of the universe
yeah I guess that never I don't know
it's not really a problem in Pratt I
mean in practice like we have we have a
ton of code and we're not we're not
completely pure all in all of our codes
so I mean you can think of this as a
just an approach for really controlling
where your effects occur so we'll we'll
sort of you know have a pure core and
then we'll call unsafe perform IO
you know it's not necessarily at the
outermost layer of our program but
that's okay I mean we've we can't sort
of rewrite our entire architecture to be
pure I mean maybe if we were starting
from scratch we would but you know it's
okay to just sort of push things out as
far as you want and then call and say
perform IO there and that can be sort of
the end of your universe and you still
have all that composability within that
little universe you've carved out for
yourself thank you everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
