presentation pretty quickly here to
leave some time for questions I'd really
like to do that I'm not going to dive
too deep into the products we've got a
ton of sessions following this as well
as I had to completely redo my
presentation after su oz talked this
morning because well he asked me to send
me send him my slides about a week or so
ago and now I know why so I ended up
having to redo all my slide so I didn't
really want to bore you guys with a
bunch of my slides being presented by
sue hostas though his look better he
must have had some hired help that
actually made his look better than mine
but i'm really excited here to talk to
you guys about rhomobile suites brand
new product that we fundamentally
launched last week it's really a
culmination of a lot of hard work by the
organization and a series of combined
teams but we'll talk about that a bit
later but really kind of one of the
things was wanted to talk to you about
OS trends and I don't kind of beat this
topic up a lot but it's really quite
fascinating when you actually think
about what's going on out there in the
industry today a lot of people go which
OS should I choose what do I standardize
on how do I build my applications if
you're a partner in is V what platform
do you target your applications for and
it's really not an easy answer first off
when we start looking at mobility in the
world today and we look at it from a
world's population perspective and I
know Tom likes to talk about this as
well a lot when you think about it
there's approximately six billion mobile
subscribers worldwide today that's
astounding that's astounding and I hope
a lot of them have jobs and I hope with
a lot of them work in the enterprise in
some fashion or another and they need
work applications right it's not just
about Twitter and you know angry birds
and you know draw something or words
with friends or something like that
what's amazing is that first off that's
only about eighty six percent of the
world's population I'd say that's pretty
decent market saturation from a from a
deployment perspective in
terms of driving into that market and
saying how many other users can I grow
into what's even more astounding is
there are more people in the world today
that have access to cellular coverage in
other words they have cellular coverage
and they can use a mobile phone then
people that have access to television
electricity or even safe drinking water
that's amazing that means they can use
their cell phone because they have
cellular coverage but they don't
actually have access to electricity to
charge their phone I think that's kind
of funny so we've got to work on the
battery situation but nonetheless what's
amazing is people think that the race
for mobile smart phones this is over
already six billion people have access
to mobile mobility six billion people
using mobile but only 830 plus million
are actually using smartphones everyone
else is using what we call dumb phones
or feature phones or whatever the name
you want to look at 5.6 billion people
in the world today still using dumb
phones so what exactly does that mean
well when I look at where we're at from
a smartphone sales perspective and where
feature phones are this is where we're
at here today and as you can imagine
there's still enormous growth
opportunity for smartphones as well as
actually even for feature phones as that
trend starts to shift and when we look
at the market today inside the United
States still right we talk about a two
horse race for most part between Android
and Apple but even in the u.s. today in
terms of overall mobility Mobile
smartphones or mobile OSS or whatever
the phone you use today it is is it
really a two-horse race we go back and
we look at how much room there is for
growth still from an OS perspective
right globally where that trend is
projected to go over the next four years
alone right how much room there is still
for that growth inside North America
only and really you start to ask
yourself well which OS do I pick
alright we sit here and we seem to think
well iOS and Android I'll build for that
and I'll be safe it's kind of funny when
you think about it right but there's
still a ton of growth right the race is
not over 8 point 8 830 million users 5.6
million billion left to go there is no
way shape or form is a race over the
race is just started and I think that's
a really important message here not to
mention that these are kind of the os's
that we think about or talk about today
some obviously more prominent than
others but what about all the new
announcements that have come out right
soo ah scanned of led on to a couple
earlier today already tizon which is a
joint effort between Samsung and Intel
they're going to be making a big hood
push and if anyone doesn't believe that
Samsung from a smartphone cellphone
perspective isn't going to make a big
push on their own OS you'd be surprised
Mozilla has now come out and announced
the fact that they're going to be going
to market with a mobile OS as well even
the new a newer one Ubuntu right as well
as announced the fact that they're
looking at creating a smartphone mobile
OS and then of course rumor has it
forever and ever and ever that Facebook
is going to do it and I think that may
be the case you know I know my wife
keeps sitting there saying when's that
Facebook phone going to come out when's
that Facebook phone going to come out
and I keep wondering to myself don't you
already spend enough time on that
website today so so when you think about
it and you think about what platform do
I really develop my applications for
moving forward it's not an easy decision
right and we start to take a look at it
and we think about where the mobile
enterprise trends have really gone well
first off we know the introduction of
apple and consumer grade operating
systems is really driven a BYOD
phenomenon in the enterprise day right
and how that's really affected buying
trends for enterprises there is a need
for enterprise class devices that are
very purpose built rugged in nature that
are used by specific workers in an
organization task workers line workers
that are repeating the same job over and
over again they do it hundreds of times
a day thousands of times today they need
the the durability and the life size
cool and the device built purposely for
that right but if you're an iPhone user
or an Android user those devices from a
consumer perspective are generalist
devices they're built to not be great at
necessarily any one thing but devices
that can do a lot of things so those
might be devices that executives are
walking around with or floor managers or
something like that because they're tied
to corporate email but they still need
to be able to run the same application
that that line worker or that task
worker is running on a rugged enterprise
device today so when we think about it
we think about kind of we're trending is
going right an influx or desire from a
BYOD perspective is affecting the
enterprise the enterprise is evaluating
and trying to understand I don't know
Renee's in here Renee is probably in
here somewhere trying to understand the
direction at Microsoft's going in right
windows mobile now called windows
actually that's wrong Windows Embedded
handheld I apologize and then moving on
towards what's coming next is a windows
phone 7 Windows Phone 8 what's the plan
around that Windows 8 we know that
Microsoft has a lot of focus around
windows 8 but the direction that they're
headed in right create some some concern
and uncertainty for sure right we see
that Android has grown fifty-nine
percent enormous it's kind of funny
actually because blackberry is down to
two six point four percent four years
ago did anyone ever think that
blackberry I guess maybe more than four
years ago five six years ago right
blackberry was the enterprise device
right for email and everything did
anyone ever think that blackberry would
be at six point four percent market
share today no when iOS made the huge
leap and everyone said wow this is it
this is it iOS is the way to go two
years later Android so in a matter of
six years we've had three kings of the
hill that doesn't even take into
consideration what's going on with Nokia
and their complete drop out on the
market space so maybe in six years you
call it for kings of the hill coming on
absolutely come and gone from an OS
perspective so what does that leave we
think about the fact that the race is
nowhere near over 830 million people
use smartphones today 5.6 billion still
left to make a decision and a lot of big
companies coming into play about making
smart phone os's so what does that
really leave us to that really leaves us
to thinking about how we build solutions
and applications in an OS independent
way and that really drives us towards
our whole html5 strategy what's Motorola
strategy around this well today
obviously you know we're huge supporters
of Microsoft and the initiatives around
that leveraging Windows Embedded
products right windows embedded compact
windows embedded handheld we're looking
at in planning what's next what's coming
down it's not necessarily Windows Phone
I'm not trying to say anything here
other than just trying to get some logos
up here but really saying what's v-necks
coming from Microsoft in terms of an
enterprise smartphone operating system
that we can leverage in the enterprise
space right where you drive and need
those requirements that we talked about
on a day-in day-out basis right the
ability to do things like a kiosk mode
or security you'll be able to integrate
directly with LDAP or Active Directory
or have multi login ensure the fact that
i can Rutt wipe the data on the device
remotely if the device is lost or stolen
all right all the sorts of things that
we've been doing for years and years and
years right those still need to exist
and that's really what v dot next is
whatever that may be whatever they have
to call it I'm not proposing what they
call it up here i'm just saying v-necks
motorola is planning for that today and
continually looking at and working with
microsoft on a regular and even weekly
basis but what we have done is we've
added to the confusion in the market
space today what OS should i target i'm
used to building enterprise apps i'm
used to building them for window see in
Windows Mobile I usenet use Visual
Studio greatest development tool in the
world in my opinion may not be
everyone's in the room and that's fine
but we're adding to the confusion by
coming out with our et-1 Android tablet
right we've added kind of this motorola
extension capability to android to
harden it to make it secure enable you
to do things like have multi user login
instead of just a four digit pin how
secure is that everyone in the store
knows the four digit pin you're at
nordstrom some guy you know gets fired
and
disgruntled guess what is access to all
your devices he can get on to all your
devices and start processing
transactions who knows where's the
security that mobile payment why all of
a sudden is that less important from a
security perspective than it was a few
months ago in terms of when you start
thinking about enterprise needs and
requirements so while we've added the
confusion at the same time we've really
had to think about what direction we're
headed in and that's really what that
brings us to in terms of the role mobile
sweet we talked about we just kind of
talked about some of the key challenges
associated to that right when we look at
it we used to think oh it's just the
guys that get the rugged devices the
line work or the task worker they're the
ones that need the mobile app but when
we now start to think about and we think
about the pervasiveness of mobility in
general in a consumer-oriented market
how that's affected the thinking of
executives and other decision-makers
inside a business we now need to start
thinking about complete end and mobile
solutions it's not just about the line
work or the task worker anymore walking
around with a motorola device and this
is why it's important why does Motorola
care about this so much why would we
ever want to do something that enables
competitive devices because one device
doesn't fit all right even a generalist
device right why does not everyone use
iPhones I don't know a lot of people
don't like soft input panels for taiking
they want more of a blackberry look they
want hard keys right they want a
vertical slide out or horizontal slide
out or they want a blackberry look with
a screen and into Android gives you that
that's why Android has made a huge leap
over iOS one device doesn't fit all more
specifically that's why our portfolio so
broad because depending on the task work
or the type of solution you're employing
in the specific industry or vertical you
need a different device for that we've
seen as well obviously the buying trends
are shifting from an IT to an employee
base that's obviously driving the BYOD
phenomenon right clearly as a result of
that in the need to be able to enable my
managers and executives with the same
applications that I enable the line
workers with a need to be able to
support multiple os's right because a
corporation or enterprise is not buying
blackberrys anymore and handing it out
to all their employees
that model and that trend is changing
I've got a brother-in-law it works for
dr horton he's the president for one of
their divisions they have been
standardized on palm OS for um for about
six years now that's a corporate policy
and standard because the security
reasons and needs right instead of doing
blackberry they pick palm for whatever
reason not to get into that but all of a
sudden now the CEO and CTO are walking
around life owns why because it's cool
and they like it right now what happens
all of a sudden now what's been a
corporate standard is now completely
changed and shifted right so there is
definitely a need to support and it's
creating a challenge for them because
they have all their applications running
on Paul what do they do growing demands
obviously if user interface and
experience controlling the cost of
development I know everyone in this room
wants to do that and leveraging both
enterprise and consumer devices in my in
your overall solution so when we started
down this path a couple years ago around
looking at and in this is something
motor always has to do we always have to
have an eye on where we're going from an
operating system perspective as you see
the industry turns on a dime we evaluate
it we review it we analyze it every week
where's the operating system market
going what are we putting on our next
device what are we doing what are the
key regards those are things you have to
start planning two to three years out
when it comes to producing some of the
hardware that we do so when we think
about it and we realize that hey Android
was where we were going we literally sat
down two years ago and said we have to
create a strategy around this we have to
figure out how to enable our customers
and our partners to be able to build
solutions moving forward because we're
adding to the confusion so we decided at
that time we're going to create the best
possible platform for enterprise apps
and this is important focus on
enterprise apps for development and
managing those solutions out there in
the market today we committed to this
strategy roughly two years ago actually
a little over two years ago with a focus
on delivering and enabling those on
really from a cross-platform line of
business perspective in july of last
year we acquired a small start-up called
rhomobile really excited about that
obviously and then october of last year
we launched our first edition of the
effort that we started about two years
ago
called row elements now row elements at
the time actually had nothing to do with
rhomobile from a product set perspective
row elements was the initiative that we
started two years ago around bringing
html5 and WebKit capabilities to windows
mobile and windows CD platforms well
what I'm really excited to talk about
here is that actually last week of june
31st we launched the row mobile sweet
now which is an integrated solution
between what rhomobile came from a man
from an acquisition perspective and what
we did around the products from row
elements oh my goodness I'm so sorry
thank you may thirty first thanks Jim
all right good all right I saw our
vision your application ran on all your
devices soooo it's kind of joked about
it today and have we founded companies
and started companies in the past where
we used to talk write once run anywhere
and that was never really the truth it
is now though oops and it can deliver
that compelling consumer smartphone
experience right really drive that brand
and this is kind of important when you
talk about a compelling user experience
right there's like well sencha and then
there's jqtouch or jQuery Mobile and
then there's I you I and there's all
these UI frameworks right one thing to
keep in mind is we don't mandate or tell
you what it should look like right in
the past you've been beholden to what
the operating system says your
application experience should look like
a button should look like this right
even iphone drives that standard it's
kind of interesting because most of the
UI frameworks are really actually built
around iphone look and feel and standard
so if you actually use one of those UI
frameworks which i think is a great
thing and by the way all of them work
seamlessly and no problem at all with
roll mobile you know i was at a customer
site last week no no no no no you know
we want to use sencha and it's a great
do you want to run on Windows Phone and
like yeah that's like what do you want
to look like oh it has to have that
Metro UI look and feel okay well so one
of the things to think about is HTML the
power of it a blank slate being able to
make it look like what you want yes use
those frameworks to get yourself
kick-started or drive that experience
but realize that you're not beholden to
that and I think that's a key thing and
really leverage native device
capabilities like
scanning and GPS and signature capture
and the list goes on and on that was
really our vision when we determined our
strategy said hey we need to be
cross-platform we need to BOS agnostic
what were the three things that we cared
about at that time it was truly that
write once run anywhere right it was
being able to deliver that compelling
user experience but still deliver the
value propositions and things you need
to do from an enterprise application
perspective so what does that mean well
the rhomobile sweet fundamentally today
looks like this it's three key products
in it one is raw elements we talked
about that right it's a client framework
for using html5 to build what we call
hybrid and natively deployed
applications right and there's a beauty
in that in the sense that when we talk
about the transition of going from whoa
what did I do I went back sorry um we
talked about application architectures
and I won't dry it dive too deep into
this because you guys this will get
covered in a later session but really
when we think about it as well is is
that how you develop and design a
solution how you architect it is
different depending on your use cases in
your needs am i inside the four walls
and my outside the four walls do I only
operate when I'm connected what do i do
when i'm disconnected do i need data
locally if i do have to have data
locally how do i secure it these are all
questions that you need to think about
when it comes to how you architect your
application but rest assured row
elements addresses all those problems
and challenges and allows you to
architect the solution the way you need
it to for your use cases not the way
that traditional consumer apps say you
should and I think that's important
because in the enterprise world there's
always edge cases in those edge cases
are just as important as the core use
cases okay row connect it was formerly
known row sink in the row mobile days
row connect to something we're
relaunching we've done a lot around it
beefing it up from a feature set
perspective worked bid on performance
added some some great new capabilities
to it but the focus for row connect is
predominantly
a back-end server that allows me to
integrate to enterprise systems right
and synchronize and use native push
capabilities to get that data down to
the device if I need to or want to
Andros to do it's an eclipse-based
plugin for application development it's
a great developer tool I'll have a
deeper side on that but you can download
that today and start using it for free
no cost at all row hub is something that
will be kind of formally if you will in
the motorola sense launching it soon as
well as row gallery which are additional
products that kind of exists in the
overall rhomobile sweet product set so
we talked about row elements in essence
what we're shipping here is Roy elements
version 2 what is it well here are some
of the key things that we've really done
in this release when when integrating
that with the overall row mobile product
set it's been a it's been an absolutely
astounding effort by the engineering
team since acquisition the guys have
been working night and day and just
really excited about it it's truly a
high-quality product the types of things
you can do with it are just absolutely
amazing Motorola WebKit we've got a new
version of our Motorola WebKit embedded
in it our html5 score as of today I
guess or whenever was the latest
releases a 314 I guess we get two bonus
points I don't know maybe it's because
it's WebKit no but check it out you'd be
surprised from a feature set function
perspective right um you know not all
web kits are equal but what's great
about row elements is that you're
driving that consistency you're not
necessarily relying on knowing what
version of the browser is going to be on
that device right you can use Motorola
WebKit and you'll feel confident that
you're driving that consistency full
cross-platform support unlike row
elements version one that only supported
msi devices we now support msi as well
as non msi devices including competitive
and consumer smartphones iOS blackberry
windows phone 7 and Android right we
talked about being able to deploy hybrid
or native application solutions but this
well some of the great features that
come over from the world mobile product
set a full MVC and an ORM model that
allows me to develop my application and
abstract it out and architect it
correctly making it easier to manage my
data that's local right the valley
of MVC and ORM for developing
applications just can't go on set it is
absolutely enormous infant and fantastic
some of the key things that I'll mention
it I'll jump down here right is what's
great about it is leveraging the ORM or
the the MVC pattern right you're able to
take your application one of the big
things that a lot of people have really
been worried about says if I go html5
and I do everything in JavaScript you
know am I going to get the performance
that I need right because it's
JavaScript and it's interpreted right or
how do I secure my application
obfuscation only goes so far right the
value out of the platform here with row
elements is your code actually gets
compiled down to bytecode so the
execution and performance is astounding
I think we had some test results from
one of our partners they were they able
to insert 120,000 records into the
database in under a hundred and ten
seconds 120 can anyone do that with
sequels to eat just out of curiosity
120,000 records into the asserted into
the database how about the ability to
then execute 800 plus queries on that
data in under three seconds it's pretty
astounding stuff consumer style look and
feel obviously but then finally the last
thing compile your application code down
to bytecode and secure it right so that
your IP can't be stolen I think that's a
big thing obviously with automatic data
encryption pki capabilities from a
security perspective without a doubt
truly best in class when you look at it
kind of what the mobile architecture
looks like from a real mobile
perspective how do the three products
work together right you use rose studio
to write your application right we
provide the framework for your
application to run on the devices real
elements and if you want to optionally
and you need synchronization or
integration capability depending on
whether or not you have your own are
ready or not you can use row connect to
integrate and connect to your back-end
system so when you think about it from
the overall products that feature set
that's what it looks like row elements
specifically is a culmination of
bringing the row mobile roads framework
together as well as raw elements and
and the motorola WebKit as well as
capabilities right so with row elements
you get the automatic data encryption
you get NFC and RFID support
capabilities barcode scanning real time
barcode scanning signature capture all
those things but this is how we look at
it from a subset perspective right row
elements is fundamentally a superset of
what existed previously from Rome mobile
am i doing on time ok so ro studio is
well obviously a new product really
excited about this one like I said you
guys can go up and download it now
actually speaking of which so did anyone
hear soo ha sir earlier today when he
talked about a number of downloads how
many 3,000 yeah that was outdated data
um since launch on Thursday we have over
5,000 downloads so believe me there's a
massive community and initiative and
effort around that's an exciting thing
at so that's impressive right five days
including weekends a thousand downloads
a day I think that outpaces phonegap now
that i think about it doesn't it yeah
that's kind of a exciting thing so um
row studio what's great about it is
we're putting a lot of effort and
initiative behind this this is kiwi
realizes people are transitioning from a
tool like visual studio they're used to
having capabilities and feature sets
like the ability to do simulators and
that sort of stuff and debug in real
time and people wonder how do i do
debugging how do I simulate with a real
device using HTML and JavaScript how do
you do that well your answer is rose
studio user 0 studio build your
application use a simular you can
develop your entire application but I
happen to have SDKs on the device like
how awesome is that not only that but
then with the capabilities associated to
building and compiling for all your
platforms and ensuring the fact that you
can get to market faster you can build
iOS apps on macs are sorry you can of
course you can write you can build
windows mobile and windows ce e apps on
max or vice versa right you don't have
to have a mac in order to build an iOS
app that's a great thing and the beauty
of that
as well comes in and i'll talk about it
in a minute is our integration
capabilities that we're going to be
looking at adding into rho studio with
our row hub service that will talk about
a bit but really truly a massive
developer community and ecosystem we
start talking about html5 right again
all those UI frameworks that exist out
there today I'm sure there's going to be
some coming out shortly very along the
lines of jQuery Mobile that'll do things
for windows phone and and and let's not
underestimate what Microsoft's efforts
are around windows phone I think that
that's still an operating system be
reckoned with even looking at industry
pundits and trends the Nokia Lumia right
which was that new device that was built
specifically for the windows phone
operating system most people actually
vote that to be the actual best
smartphone on the market today was the
Nokia Lumia just kind of interesting if
you haven't used a windows phone 7 I
highly recommend you do I'm not trying
to give a plug for Microsoft here but it
is actually really a compelling
operating system I'm an iphone user have
been for years and years and years I'm
just now realizing that when I'm like on
a phone call and I'm doing something and
I want to take my phone off mute and I
maybe in another app or something like
that like it can take me sometimes eight
clicks to unmute myself it maybe was
really inefficient and impressive
operating system when it first came out
but honestly I just not convinced that
it necessarily is anymore Rowe connect
again a service that we provide a
solution as part of the overall
rhomobile suite allows you to integrate
and connect to back-end systems I highly
recommend that you attend two key
sessions going to plug a couple sessions
here I'll plug them all later but Adam
Blum former CEO of Rome mobile is here
today and he's going to do an awesome
session on rope connect later on today I
think Adam at what time is it three is
it in here at three honestly I think you
guys are all locked in here for the rest
of the day but that's okay and then I
think that we also have large is going
to do a session as well on rope connect
on actually how to do like specific
integration to back-end systems and do
plugins and that sort of stuff but we
have two big sessions coming up on row
connect you don't have to listen to the
marketing guy anymore the rest of this
sessions are all developer sessions
they're going to be doing some coding
giving you some real
examples and that sort of stuff so
that's good it's a dev conference right
that's what it's supposed to be after
all so Rho connect allow me to easily
integrate to back in-system cville SI p
Oracle you know let's hope there's no
pic universe database users out there
anymore but web services databases you
name it highly scalable and performing I
think this is great and unique about the
solution the architecture is it's really
an industry first you start looking at
existing synchronization engines out
there today they're all based on sequel
server oracle or there we say sybase
unwired platform and their whole I
anywhere framework right but really this
concept of no sequel is amazing in terms
of being able to manage and and
associate and determine date date of
differences to be able to send down to
the device and and the performance
capabilities you're driving as a result
of that are without doubt astounding an
industry-first native push capabilities
we talked about that as well as some key
features in there around our metadata
framework to allow you to easily manage
ever change I mean anyone in here think
that my Siebel instance isn't going to
ever change over the next two years of
my essay p instance isn't going to
change and holy cow what does that do
when they add a new field to that api
and my mobile app stops working enough
so there are ways to fix that the
metadata frameworks an amazing thing the
backend can change all you want your
mobile app will still work ro hub is a
service that's up there today we haven't
formally launched it yet but i can't
help but talk about it right and some of
the things that we're going to be doing
about it we're going to be formally
launching it hopefully later on sometime
this year no promises yet on that um but
use it it's up there use it as you wish
it's available the value out of RO hub
as we talked about earlier is your
ability to do builds and compilations of
iOS you need to build an iOS app and
don't have a map that's okay use row hub
it's a free service today we don't
really have any plans are changing that
but please sign up anyone in here a row
hub user already today just by quick
show of hands okay all right that's not
enough come on guys all right get up
there use roja roja calm not a problem
sign up start using it start building
your apps managing it it's also a great
way to allow you to collaborate and work
with
others right because it has tie-ins with
source control github capability so you
can actually share projects make changes
and there's also a great tool
application they're called row gallery
allow you to manage application
provisioning so it's very cool so we're
going to be working on moving here
forward Rose studio being tied directly
into Rho hub so if you have Rose studio
on your device and you want to do
cloud-based builds just hit a button and
it'll happen so look for that and new
versions of Rose studio coming up in the
next few months really exciting stuff so
some of the key takeaways here and then
we'll get some time for questions is
really all of this is driven around our
desire and I need to have true device
flexibility and portability right really
truly writing it once and running it
anywhere being able to support the
operating systems that we really truly
do care about today enterprise and
consumer grade right leverage your web
skills easy backend integration for
offline use and anyone that doesn't that
tells me no none of my enterprise apps
need to work offline boy then I'd really
question whether or not that's a
mission-critical app right if it doesn't
need to be able to operate offline is it
truly a mission-critical app exploiting
those enterprise device capabilities
that list is amazing check it out
enterprise security compliant we talked
about that right the ability to secure
your application your IP your code your
data the ability to do things like
remote wipe of the data and that sort of
stuff so um wanted to introduce you real
quick this is not the whole team there's
about 50 to 60 core people associated
this product if you don't think that
this is a massive investment for
Motorola you know I don't know what
shows that is but 50 to 60 people as
part of the core product team that
doesn't even include those outside of it
from a sales perspective globally and so
on and so forth this is a handful of the
guys from the product team that are here
today and tomorrow I'm going to leave
this up here for a second so you can
kind of you know get their faces in your
mind find them talk to them ask some
questions most of these guys are
presenting in the breakout sessions the
rest of the day today and tomorrow
please talk to them more than happy to
they're here for your purposes and
reasons to be able to answer any
questions that you have don't ask me any
just ask them no just kidding I'm just
ask them the questions I really don't
know the answers to anything these are
all the smart guys here so um sessions
please check these out if you haven't
already I assume you've already looked
at the agenda but some big ones the
first one coming up right after this I
think is is Jeff is that right is that
next on the schedule Rob Oh Rob zup next
okay Rob is going to be talking about
using row studio okay deploying your web
apps natively what if you already have a
web app what if you have a web app today
and you want to enable it to be deployed
natively how do you do that how do you
leverage your existing work that you've
been doing how do you leverage that in
the robe old platform that's a cool
thing check it out Rob's going to work
with you on how to get going on Rose
studio and use it by the way you don't
have to use row studi if you don't want
the web apps html5 app leveraging device
capabilities and the framework that runs
on the device you don't have to use your
favorite tools if you want adding device
capabilities in html5 features to your
app Darren's going to talk about that as
i mentioned row connect and server
plugins by Adam and Lars we also have
two partners here this week working with
us one Marikana is going to talk about
how to get started with Ruby an amazing
language some of you may know it some of
you don't actually show of hands how
many people have already done
development with Ruby before okay all
right that's actually a pretty decent
show for an enterprise environment it's
one of the fastest growing programming
languages in the world today and when
you think about it and you think about
building an enterprise app and you think
about the things that you need to do
having an effective programming language
that gives you true object or any
capabilities and meta languages and so
on and so forth you know ruby is really
the way to go you'd be surprised
developing payment applications with
rhomobile Prashant's here to talk about
that that's an exciting thing how do I
build applications using payment
building consumer like end user
experience again with a partner Bahn
who's going to be talking about that so
that's exciting and then I think James
capping it off with a neat little fun
how do I build the fun i think his
example is a well i guess i won't spoil
it but talking about html5 and SVG right
don't give SVG enough love in terms of
how do I build things when you're
dealing with you I and you want high
performance and leveraging the values of
scalar vector graphics developer
community check it out Launchpad if it
hasn't been plugged enough it probably
is because it hasn't been plugged enough
it's a full new site relaunched it
updated it access to downloads
documentation discussion boards blogs
it's an exciting thing learn more about
row elements to do and ro connect pretty
cool Rob just out of curiosity how many
people do we have registered on launch
pad now yeah I check last week me about
2,300 okay 2,300 users registered me
over 2,000 okay everyone anyone in here
show of hands everyone that's registered
launch pad today already Wow okay that's
awesome those of you that are not you
should really be wondering why you're
not because i should say first off
actually let me back up launch pad is
not just about rome mobile launch pad is
Motorola's new developer community you
want to get up there and you want to do
android development only for the 81
there's a community inside launch pad
for that right any any of our products
we're lighting up new developer
communities around them so it's not just
about rhomobile look hey you want to
build a native app on android for the
et-1 we're there to support you will do
that that's fine you want to build
native android apps that's fine as well
i mean if the first few slides didn't
really give you an indication of the
challenge of the risk associated to that
i don't know what does but still
nonetheless you can resources go and
download the product like i said 5,000 i
guess another show of hands how many
people have actually downloaded the
product okay that's pretty good all
right all right some of you still
haven't so let's try and get that number
up to 6,000 and the next day because
there's not that many people in here so
just download it a lot okay
I've got a bot going that just keeps
downloading it so that when i talk to
gartner and i say we had no the
community again check out launchpad docs
