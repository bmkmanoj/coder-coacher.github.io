really passionate about culture was
about ten years ago
and I just left a cushy enterprise gig
to go join a startup down in LA founded
by a bunch of the original myspace team
a really smart group of folks and really
connected with their idea and their
passion and I remember being there the
first few months and I noticed that you
know half the team was going off for a
few hours and playing xbox every day and
this continued for a number of weeks and
so I remember having lunch with the CTO
one day and I had asked him you know
don't you care that we have so much work
to do and you know half the team is off
playing xbox we're so busy so he looks
over and he says I really don't care
what the team does while they're at the
office I know they'll stay up till 2:00
a.m. the work weekends on their schedule
they'll do whatever it takes to ship on
time so no I'm not worried about it and
I remember going back home and you know
reflecting on that and thinking about my
past experiences
I wasn't new to startups I had worked at
a couple of startups and big Enterprise
shops but they all shared a similar
trait which was productivity equals time
at desk and it was about top-down and
management focused right not a lot of
autonomy so here it was in this new
environment where impact and results
mattered more than just looking busy it
was about autonomy and freedom was about
openness and collaboration and I saw my
own skills grow exponentially while I
was there in terms of abilities and
confidence I was tackling projects that
just a year before that I didn't think
I'd be able to handle because it was
okay to fail it was okay to try again
and I share that story because while
that company never grew as expected
expected to me that was a culture of
innovation that was a culture of freedom
and now that I'm at a new company a
fast-growing startup the challenge
becomes how do you take that same
feeling of innovation autonomy and and
low processed low overhead
and high coherence and translate that
into you know a company that's growing
and adding people rapidly so in this
talk I hope to walk you through some of
the things that that we've done to help
facilitate that culture and to try and
keep that that feeling of of innovation
alive so with that my name is Jim plush
senior director of engineering at
CrowdStrike
I was employee number 30 of over 500 now
so I've seen you know the rapid growth
phase and I've seen some of the a lot of
the changes that were made I'm also a
member the culture team so I deal with a
lot of these issues day-to-day with with
a team of individuals that I'll discuss
in a few slides if you want to talk
about any of this offline over beer
later I can hit me up on Twitter I'm
pretty active there and I'll be free the
rest of the day let me give you a little
background about crowd strikes they kind
of get a sense of how everything works
so we're at endpoint security company
picking up where a lot of the big AV
players have sort of left customers in
the dust they're still experiencing
breaches and you know we see that
happening in the news all the time we
were the first cloud-based real-time
endpoint protection company so what that
means in practice is we have a kernel
level sensor that sits on desktops
laptops servers and we're constantly
sending telemetry back and forth to our
cloud systems to identify potential
breaches and and threats we also do a
lot of the data analysis on the endpoint
against machine learning models and
indicators of attack kind of looking at
the full kill chain of of how hackers
actually compromised systems and give
them that were cloud-based we're also
pretty high scale you may have seen us
recently at the regards to the DNC
breach attribution where we came out and
identified Russia as someone that was
trying to tamper with with our election
process and so we were the first ones
called in to do a lot of that
investigation and a lot of our cloud
systems were used for that attribution I
mentioned we're high scale so we see
about a million events
down per second that has to be processed
in near-real-time and we've got many
many petabytes of data under management
and we do all that using fun open-source
tech like go elasticsearch Cassandra
Kafka sort of technology so let's level
set on culture because everyone kind of
thinks about culture differently and and
has the different ideas of what that
means to them sometimes when I talk to
folks at conferences or out and about a
lot of people say well our company
doesn't have culture we normally talk
about that it's not something we're
active but the reality is every company
has a culture right culture is how
business gets done it's how teams
interact it's how you ship code it's how
executives treat employees management
treats each other your development
environment is your culture our people
fixing broken builds are they looking at
broken tests going the extra-mile right
all these factor into what kind of
culture you have and how product gets
shipped it's also about what happens
when no one's looking right what happens
when management's not staring at you all
the time and asking for status are
people doing the right thing so all
those are cultural issues right it's not
ping pong and those same folks I talk to
you tend to think well that's not my job
you know that's management that's HR
they're the people to think about
culture I was hired to write code that's
what I'm gonna do
but I know the demographics of this
audience and it's a lot of principles
architects senior engineers technical
leaders and the reality is you all are
the culture influencers people come in
and they're looking at you to see how
business is getting done right how
should I care about builds how should I
care about automation how should I treat
my peers what do we value and so I say
that by you know sort of challenging you
to as we go through these slides to
realize that you know you're not a
passenger in this culture experiment
right you need to be part of that that
solution that you want to see so think
about those things as we go through and
how you could potentially apply these to
your company a lot of the stuff we'll go
through start it as just a small team of
five showed promise and and something we
valued and we wanted to you know keep
reinforcing and got adopted
organizationally I'm gonna take it back
to the early years and how things got
started and we said next-gen startup
cultures right what does that mean
next-gen and I kind of think of
companies that starts a day have main
foundations that make them next-gen one
distributed from the start it's very
difficult to compete these days for
geographic talent locally so you got to
be willing to open up your your talent
pool as you start and figure out how to
make it work as a distributed company I
mean the reality is once you've passed
one floor of a building you're you're
now distributed company right start
thinking in that aspect and culture from
the start so if you can't compete with
these packages from the big companies
you have to give people a great work
experience you have to you know give
them autonomy
let them fail and learn and let them
grow give them leadership opportunities
because I know the startups I've been
the most learning I've accomplishes is
while I was at startups I remember
certain new a interview a crowd strike
and I'd work with the CEO in the past I
knew some of the founding team I knew
was gonna be really successful but I
wasn't really sure about another
security company right security
companies tend to be closed source and
secret and private that wasn't really
the culture that that I wanted to get
into again but while I was interviewing
became clear that that's not the kind of
companies that they wanted to create
either they wanted to give back
information in the community and be open
and share and release tools use open
source contribute to open source and
that aligned a lot more with you know
what I was looking for so I joined on
and you know honestly the first year so
we didn't really talk a lot about
culture other than you know things we
value we're just busy trying to get a
product ready iterating with customers
getting feedback and then things started
taking off I started getting more sales
need to hire I started getting feedback
bug reports new feature requests and
things started coming in from customers
like hey we need sam'l integration
okay well no one joins a startup to work
on sam'l integration right so now we had
to start balancing who gets to work on
that project and who gets to work on the
new innovative code and you start
realizing these are cultural issues
right and and need to balance that so
really all we put together this concept
of a culture team and the culture team
is a representative from all the
departments HR engineering finance cloud
team sensor team kind of a wide breadth
of representation for the employee base
and one of the things that that we
needed to do was phrase our mission and
define our values so phrase our mission
is why did we come to this company in
the first place let's get that into a
soundbite that we can kind of rally
around and use that as as a motivator
and then secondly define the values what
is it in the engineering organization we
valued right and we wanted to see from
an employee standpoint a leadership
standpoint management standpoint and
then more importantly how are we going
to incentivize behaviors to you know
reinforce those values because if you
just write it on you know a piece of
paper on the wall somewhere right people
are gonna ignore it it's it's the
decisions you make that reinforce those
values right that's that's how culture
is built and I'll give you example of
something that the culture team would
kind of work on that's a cultural issue
early on we had this concept of team
bonuses and the idea was each team at
the beginning of the quarter would
define some of the big things they
wanted to accomplish and if you hit
those targets at the end of the quarter
you know you got some some cash now very
well-intentioned meant to drive
productivity but what we started
noticing that was incentivizing
behaviors that we didn't actually want
to see as we scaled an example was you
know let's say the cloud team is busy
working at the end of the quarter on
some projects they have to get done any
of the censer team cranking away on
their projects and you know they need
some help from someone in the cloud to
help finish one of their projects now
the cloud team is incentivized to you
know finish their projects first so you
know they get a bonus everyone
get some shoes for the kids that quarter
but now you're you're valuing the team
over the company's success and if you
watched talk from Matt Raney from uber
he's got a great formula there which is
company greater than team greater than
self and anytime you violate that
formula you have a problem and so we had
a problem right we were choosing the
teams over the company goal because if
they had shipped that feature we might
have been able to get additional sales
so those are kind of cultural issues we
look to find out how are we
incentivizing behaviors and how can we
turn those things around and get it
right company culture is the byproduct
of consistent behavior what you do
always wins against what you intend to
do I think a lot of people missed this
point but this sums up culture very well
you know it's it's not just about
passing around someone's culture deck
and saying all we should do that we're
writing a bunch of values on the wall
and passing that around every decision
you make reinforces those cultural norms
of how business gets done and if people
see you sending out surveys for example
and they never see the results they
don't see any change from those they're
not disgust people are gonna stop taking
your surveys and you're not gonna get
feedback that you need so you have to be
very conscious that when you define
those kind of values you have to think
how you're actually going to change your
decision-making in a way that reinforces
those right because every decision
incentivizes some behavior so as a
culture team we try to look at you know
what can we learn from past companies
who work that what are some of the anti
patterns that we saw that we didn't want
to repeat from other companies that
scaled up or you know places that we
worked at that we didn't like the the
culture there and then let's structure
the environment and structure our
management style in a way that hopefully
we can naturally avoid some of those so
what are some of the contributors to
poor culture poor management practices
managers putting their favorite people
on the good projects wrong people
getting promoted fired hired people
being limited for opportunities in the
company and upward mobility managers
painting themselves in a better light
because there's a single pane of glass
to upper management like all those plans
to people not feel like their voice is
heard and that issues are being raised
lack of autonomy you hire smart folks
and then you micromanage them you take
their decision-making ability away and
then you expect to have happy folks
that's if you're gonna hire smart people
you have to be willing to let them fail
let them learn and grow and in a
leadership role and that sometimes tough
because you you may know what the
solution is but you have to let them
fail learn because we learn a lot
through those too much process too many
meetings as people think as you scale up
a company you know you need to bring in
the adults you need to add a bunch of
process and meetings now all it takes
ten people to figure out if you can put
a button on the UI like that creates a
definitely not a culture of innovation
right then you start to become the
behemoth you're trying to replace so I'm
going to walk through two ways we
accomplished that one is what are the
structural things we put in place and
then what are some of the more people
oriented things to give folks a good
working environment let's start off with
structure so people don't leave
companies they leave managers this is uh
not always true but right we've all
probably had our share of this or we we
felt that you know we weren't given
opportunities or we weren't growing or
learning so one of the things we put in
place early on is called skip level
one-on-ones and if you're not familiar
with that if you know the concept of
one-on-ones
you know VP will have managers report to
them managers will have engineers and
the managers will have one-on-ones with
the engineers and the VP will have
one-on-ones with directors so in that
model you're allowing managers to paint
a single pane of glass right up the
chain you're not allowing for team
issues to come to light and surface now
the manager gets to control the message
in a way that maybe makes them look
better maybe or doesn't raise issues
they don't see is important
so skip level one-on-ones will have the
VP have one-on-ones maybe less
frequently with the engineering team
so it just sort of levels the playing
field and allows that that visibility to
rise and executives and and other
leaders to hear what the actual problems
of the team are and so I think it's not
groundbreaking but but it's one of the
more important things we put in place
that just sort of levels the playing
field which i think is nice
multiple sign-off some promotions this
gets into you know managers in the past
having tendency to promote the wrong
people for various reasons personal or
pressure especially when you get in a
senior and principle type positions
you're expected to be impactful across
the organization it's not just one team
that you're impactful for so if you
can't justify you know promoting someone
as a senior or principal engineer to
your peers then that person probably you
know may need to work on additional
skills or work on some outreach across
teams and you also have the challenges
other and why people aren't getting
promoted right why people are getting
left behind and and look at other
training or opportunities that they can
take to maybe grow their career so there
are both ways there and in our model
managers don't control tasks managers
are more facilitators and working on
career development and you know some
tactical issues day to day and I'll get
into RS they'll see in a little bit but
taking managers out of the tasking
remove some of those negative incentives
to you know feel pressure and put people
on special projects or you know
executive special projects so again
structural things that that lead to not
incentivizing that behavior in the first
place because you can't if you want to
increase innovation you have to lower
the cost of failure I think a big
misconception people have is invention
equals innovation so when I talk to
people out there talk about innovation
it becomes well you know my company is
not very innovative my team's not very
innovative I don't think of new ideas
all the time
but that's not innovation right Apple
didn't invent the mouse doctor didn't
invent containers but they were able to
make it significantly
experience for people to use and they
innovated on that and they you know
worked on refining that until it until
it became popular and easy to use and so
innovation really is about how fast can
you put something out there gain
understanding learn take it back
refine it push it out and repeat that
cycle you know working with customers
understanding how to lower the friction
or you know even the development cycle
right how fast can you ship code to
production in a in a safe way
so that's that's really innovation can
you make a 30% improvement in some
process or product that's innovating
just making things better and if you
have people doing that at a wide level
than the sum of all those innovations
like that's how you become an innovative
company and that's a big focus on
automation
I think automation typically comes from
the bottom up a lot of companies write
engineers say you know we need to
automate we need to vest in CI we need
to vest in build infrastructure but at a
leap level you really have to know that
that's how you get innovation that's how
you make it safe to fail right we're all
gonna push bad changes out we're all
gonna push bugs the question is how fast
can you fix those and revert you know
investing in canary deployments
Bluegreen deployments rapid roll backs
right that is a technical leadership
opportunity to create an innovative
company avoiding process is probably the
number one I would say on the list that
you grow because there's a tendency as
you're adding all these new folks that
they're trying to bring in process from
these big companies that he may not be
ready for so I'll give an example we had
a five-minute UI outage a few years ago
because the developer pushed a bad
config right to production and an
executive we had at the time who's no
longer with us
had a freakout wasn't me on the
engineering team but decided that every
production change needed to go through
them right they needed to prove
everything so we have all these
engineers and we're like no we're not
we're definitely not doing that that's
terrible idea and there was a lot of
friction and back-and-forth and I wish
I'd known about this
except back then but if you've read the
Google lesser ebook which I which I
highly recommend they have this concept
called error budget an error budget is
getting into that friction between
operations management and product teams
my product teams want to move fast they
want to iterate they want to you know
get their code out and have customers
use it I didn't feel it operations right
they want things stable they want to
sleep at night right and executives
don't want to hear it from customers
when there's an outage but the reality
is most apps don't need 100% uptime
you're not gonna you're not gonna get it
so you define what your availability
target is they were saying I want four
nines of availability then I have 52
minutes of an innovation budget an error
budget where I know I'll be down for 52
minutes a year you should expect that
and that allows the product team to move
fast and iterate and make changes and as
long as you're under that budget then
you don't get that you know automatic
pressure from operations or other teams
to a slowdown now when you approach that
error budget you start getting 45 50
minutes of downtime then it's time to
take a step back you know how are you
testing how are you deploying why can't
you roll back faster like what can we
invest in on the automation side clearly
something is is not right but I think
that's a really awesome concept for
enabling innovation that you don't have
to fight those battles and it's a
natural blocker to just add process as
as you you know grow the company and you
make mistakes people want to naturally
add process but that's a quick way to
kill innovation there's always good
process right we're like automation
that's a process but we don't like bad
process and you know when you do that
postmortem
back up and use the five wise approach
so how do we just said you know root
causes developer pushed a bad config to
production
resolution no more configures the
production right we can actually solve
the problem so you have to look and say
well why did the developer push that bad
config okay they they weren't able to
test in our integration environment okay
why couldn't they test in the
integration environment there was
another team testing a big change and
they couldn't get the code in well I
couldn't eat the code in
because it can only support one major
thing in integration at a time right
that's the actual problem is we needed
more dynamic environments for people to
be able to spin up you know smaller mini
clouds and and things before they roll
it out so doing that approach right
keeps innovation alive and reduces
process and you get to the actual root
cause meetings are a symptom of a bad
organization the fewer meetings the
better I think there's a lot of
controversy on people thinking engineers
hate meetings engineers don't hate
meetings we hate bad meetings right we
hate meetings at the wrong time
we hate a lot of meetings there's always
good meetings right so one of the things
we have in our culture is to question
all meetings right just because an
executive or you know someone send you a
meeting invite doesn't mean you need to
take it you kinda have to look at your
schedule and see is there an agenda do I
have to be on this this meeting is there
someone that could send out notes can it
be recorded and someone sends out the
video I don't know if you've read the
Paul Graham article on makers versed
managers but he sums it up really well
where if you're a manager you're working
in 30 minute increments are you going
from meeting to meeting or working very
tactically through the day you're not
building a lot of context when you're a
maker mode you're building something you
need long blocks of time right you need
to think about hard problems put context
in your head and if you're getting
interrupted with meetings all the time
right if you have a meeting at one
o'clock and 3 o'clock ends at 4:00
are you gonna be productive at 4 well
you're probably just gonna you know
check email and go home so knowing that
impact and it's really about meeting
timing that we try and reduce I think
one third of all the responses I get for
why are you looking to leave your
current company comes down to I'm in too
many meetings there's too much process I
don't feel productive and I don't think
enough technical leaders you know really
listen to that and take active steps to
reduce that meeting load on the end
hearing teams especially I've been in
enterprise companies and as you start
moving up the technical ladder it just
feels like you're in more and more
meetings and you have to be in every
conversation and and it quickly becomes
a job you hate so we put this thing
together called no meaning Thursday and
this is an example of something that
started out on a small team so when the
cloud team started within the first six
months we put this blocker in place that
you know on Thursdays you know our
special day right we own our schedule so
no internal meetings no customer
meetings of production issues and live
site issues happen obviously they take
precedence but as a normal operating
procedure no additional meaning Loeb
because we knew that this tendency might
manifest as we grow right you start
adding other people other teams you have
to they're in different time zones
different locations and you can quickly
become you know just kind of stuck in
the rut so we put this in place and once
we built the culture team and started
talking about how we you know keep
innovation as we grow they all wanted to
kind of adopt that concept and so wound
up being something we talked about the
culture team and then raised the
executive team and it was kind of a
no-brainer it's like what kind of
company can't give you eight hours to
work quietly it seems ridiculous when
you when you say it out loud but I know
a lot of companies were that would be
frowned upon so we put that in place
organizationally and that's an example
of one team that showed how effective it
was the surveys that we sent out as
everyone's favorite and most productive
day and we were able to kind of
demonstrate that on a small scale and
then and then grow it up the creativity
is thinking up new things but innovation
is doing new things there's companies
out there that do 20% time or hack days
or you know hackathons but if you want
to you know innovate you really need
kind of longer blocks of time you need
to be able to work with others so we've
brought this to the culture team and
talked about what we can do to
facilitate you know breaking down silos
and letting people work together on
non-scheduled projects and we thought no
we can do
hack week but because we have
representatives in the culture team from
HR finance everyone the question became
well why can't we do this at the company
level
well I can't the entire company be
innovative and take a week to work on
big impactful projects right HR can be
innovative if they reduce the cycle time
for interviews by 30% like that's a
positive innovative impact and how fast
we can move so we pitched that up and
and we adopted that at the
organizational level and the way it
works is everyone posts an idea up on
this internet page that they want to
work on for that week it could be hey I
want to learn spark right for the week
I'm gonna go get a bunch of books and go
off to the beach and learn spark it
could be you know I want to reduce costs
by 30% on the service I know exactly
what I need to do like great you just
you were just innovative I want to work
on a new feature with these three other
teams and we need to fly into this
office so we can be heads down like
fabulous yeah well we have generous
travel budget allocated for think week
where you can go and you know work with
teams you might not normally and just
kind of break out of the rut and do
something fun so I'm gonna walk you
through how we actually build software
and how do we translate that feeling of
autonomy and leadership into our
development process so we start with a
single prioritized list and engineering
of everything that we need to get done
this is customer projects infrastructure
projects automation project security
projects it's all just kind of in a
single pane of glass so that everyone
can see what's going on in the
organization it reduces the hidden
projects that people might not see you
know day-to-day so let's say we want to
build this feature foo customer you know
had a great need for this new feature we
want to build it at the leadership level
we'll add a bunch of context around this
right why are we building through what I
want to vest in it what are the market
opportunities what are the competitive
pressure
building this huge contextual layer on
this this project so that whoever gets
it can work autonomously and understand
how that fits into the bigger picture
how does this fit into the long term
roadmap or where we want to go as an
organization once we get that step done
we'll spin up what we call a discovery
team so we say who needs a cloud person
and a sensor person will go ahead and
spin those folks up and we'll go ahead
and and give them this this feature to
work on but not to to code it but to do
more of a feasibility right spend up to
two weeks and dig deeper like we think
we're gonna invest a lot in this feature
let's make sure it's about the size we
thought let's make sure you know we have
the test infrastructure we need or the
cloud infrastructure with me you know do
we need 10 times more people than we
actually thought so I think this is an
important step that a lot of companies
misses they invest in these big projects
without taking that initial step they
spin up all these people and then you
get into the project and like wow this
is totally different than we expected
and we need all this new stuff so
spending that time allows us to invest
in the projects that we really think
will be impactful so they'll go ahead
and you know put back this feature into
the list with the feasibility how many
people they think should work on it a
rough architecture and kind of event
flow of how it fits in the system and
you know let's say they say we need a UI
person and a product manager so we'll go
ahead if we have capacity and we'll spin
up those folks and we'll go ahead and
give them foo and we'll put a box around
them and we'll call those a virtual team
and this is a cross-section
cross-functional team that could be in
different offices distributed local but
once they're in that box
they're basically an autonomous team and
the tape will elect a leader or someone
will ask to be you know the lead of that
team and they'll be responsible for
delivering that end-to-end they now have
everything they need to go deliver this
project and you know we don't care what
methodology these you want to use scrum
great figure it out you want to use
Kanban fabulous you want to use a Google
Doc great we've had successful projects
just using Google Docs so by not
prescribing that
people a chance to experience and learn
and play with new techniques and allows
for leadership opportunities allows
people to try out hey do I like leading
a team do I like you know being more on
the people side or interacting with
others providing status and in this
model we also don't have any dates and
but not having dates what we give is a
quarterly estimate and a confidence
level so we say well we think this
should land in q3 and we're 8% confident
because you know I'm an engineer and I
know other engineers are really bad at
estimating projects and it's not that
you're bad at estimating projects it's
all the things around projects right
it's like I can get this code done in
two days okay what about testing
integration testing blackbox testing
metrics alerting right run books
operations scale fault tolerance right
that easily adds up sometimes that
especially at our scale to be more than
the project time itself so by not having
dates we sort of factor then naturally
we let the teams decide when the project
is over when they're happy enough with
the quality to a reasonable extent but
that's you know up to the team lead to
figure that out of when this thing is
done right oh we didn't add learning yet
we should probably spend another week on
that or a few days great get it done our
customers want quality so I think that's
an interesting approach that's worked
well for us and you know giving people
that that leadership opportunity you
know enables kind of a leader leader
model where you're you're not dictating
how people work you're just setting the
guardrails giving them some context and
away they go so we'll have a number of
the spun up at the same time and we'll
keep some capacity on the side for
production issues any kind of interrupts
that come in so that the virtual teams
are left sort of untouched and when I
think back to some my enterprise days of
how I would scale this up to a
enterprise org I think I would start to
look at maybe building a triangle sort
of model of this interaction where you
can do it at a department departmental
level or a division level
and you know scale that model down well
it's something we're experimenting with
it's been really successful for us so
what are we done in the people side so
the urge to excel in the lead aren't the
same sometimes I think they may be
offices it's pretty accurate quote for
engineering teams there's a lot of
companies where if you want to advance
as an engineer you have to become a
people manager right if you want to make
more money for your family you want more
recognition the company you're gonna
have to get into management but not
every engineer wants to be a manager
some engineers many engineers want to be
just great engineers want to be
impactful in the organization and
continue to learn and grow so we put
together a dual management engineering
path where you can advance in the
company as an engineer at the same level
and path as someone in the management
track and the key thing is this the same
compensation bands all the way up right
all the way up to senior VP you'll have
the same benefits package the same
compensation same options pool like all
the benefits you would get and the
impact that you would get if you were a
senior VP so I think that's it gives
people an opportunity that to continue
to do what they love if they choose not
to get into people management the only
thing worse than training employees and
losing them is to train them and not
keep them sorry not train them and keep
with technology changing so much there's
so much new open-source projects and
different ideas out there you have to
have people that are going to grow and
learn not that you're gonna adopt
everything that's on Hacker News but you
want to know about things right you want
to know when to apply a tool you want to
get deeper understanding of a tool so we
put in place basically in an unlimited
book budget where if you want to you
know again goal our thoughts Bart
go ahead go buy three books expense it
sit down for a few days and dig into it
right on on work time right because
that's expected that you're growing and
learning I think a lot of people think
they have to learn off hours right we
expect you to learn on hours because we
want you to be you know want you to see
some solutions to new problems as they
come up
every quarter we budget for training and
conferences so we'll talk to folks and
set aside a bunch of budget early in the
quarter for what training you want to go
to what conferences look interesting so
when the time comes up it's not an
argument it's not a trade or you know a
deal okay we have the money set aside go
ahead have fun see in a week an
opportunity across projects people want
to learn new things experience new
things so you're on a virtual team
working with you know going Cassandra it
might be you know Python elasticsearch
you know the next project or you know
get to pick a project that you are more
interested in I think it gives people an
opportunity to kind of experience the
full stack and and stay relevant
we are distributed team not remote
workers I remember being in an
enterprise shop and we had this one
satellite office and they just worked on
one very specific component and they
integrated with the platform and it was
very adversarial it was very you know
they write terrible code were awesome
and they thought we write great code and
they're terrible and it was it wasn't a
healthy culture because we didn't have
any representatives from that team right
in our office so we didn't have that
that team empathy where we could
understand the struggles that they had
and what they were going through or just
talk through it and that was a challenge
that we had as we started scaling up
which is okay we got these distributed
teams and we have folks collocating
around areas we want to build offices
right to start letting people come in
how do we want to structure these
offices so typically you can have very
focused component teams or say okay UI
is in the LA office back-end team is in
this office right sensor teams in that
office and while that makes component
teams have very high fidelity
interactions it really tends to hurt you
at a organizational level because now
you don't have that interaction with
other teams so we actually consciously
decided that we were gonna hire fence
across all the teams in the offices so
you have UI back-end sensor team
services intelligence all kind of
co-located so you can understand other
people
issues you can talk about it and really
you know get that sense of inclusion
which I've seen missing at past
companies open communication is big like
I mentioned soon as you're pass one
floor you're basically a distributed
team so making decisions open documented
but adding context right a lot of people
especially in technology someone will
make a decision and not everyone to
understand it why are we doing that does
it make sense it's wrong technology but
there's always context around it there's
always you know we're choosing this
because of these things and as long as
you can explain them and sort of work
through that rationale I think a lot of
people feel a lot better about that
approach than just saying you know this
is this is what we're doing don't worry
about it so providing context around
decisions if you're having meetings
recording those and making those
available right there shouldn't be
anything you're saying in meetings that
that your team shouldn't hear aside from
you know private HR type issues but
everything should be you know default to
open because you know I think ran said
if people aren't hearing things right
they're gonna assume the worst and so
you want to make sure the information
gets out there onboarding I'll just
admit we were pretty bad at onboarding
the first couple years I think any
startup you join a startup and you get a
laptop and you're told go and go be
productive so we've worked on that and
gotten better put this program together
called business accelerate where every
two months will fly in the team's all
the new hires flying the executives if
possible and just spend a week walking
people through all the teams the roadmap
what products were building what's the
goal of the company you know financial
information getting them up to speed and
a lot of social time after I'm going to
have you know drinks with the team or
local local interaction which i think is
important so we're working on that but
that's it's been really beneficial and
we wish we would have started that
earlier so well that's great but how do
you how do you know how you're doing how
do you actually grade this stuff it's
it's very hard to grade a culture
surveys is probably your best weapon but
people do surveys
it's sort of ad-hoc a lot of times right
there's articles of you know the seven
best ways you can structure survey
questions to know how you're doing but
they're very general and you need a PhD
to sort of figure out what that actually
means you know I tend to like more
direct questions for how business is
getting done right
how much process do it do we have do you
feel productive you feel like you're in
too many meetings do you feel like
you've been given leadership
opportunities you feel like you've been
given training opportunities you know
very specific questions that you can
sort of monitor over time to see how
things are trending and if you can break
that down by the long timers view which
is people that have been there two three
four or five years I think that's how
your culture actually is so everyone's
really exciting the first year right and
you're excited you don't know all the
dirt about the company yet but you get
in a year or two three four and you
start to understand a little more and
that's how your culture really that's
how business really gets done right so
if you can break those stats out with
that and exit surveys as people leave
trying to find out that information
retention comparisons there's companies
out there that give you statistical
packages with companies in your industry
or you know your size so you can get a
sense of you know how well am i doing in
retention compared to them are we better
or we worse right there's always some
some churn at companies you want to find
out are you are you trending well and
then referral rates people are coming in
and they're not referring new hires
they're not excited about the company
like this is this is a big red flag that
you got to be aware of and constantly
looking at its how excited are people to
share this experience with others so
what are some of the key takeaways I
would say start small a lot of this
stuff I know you're at ten thousand
person companies fifty person companies
don't be afraid to try some of this on a
five person team right go ahead and
define your values like what are your
what is your team when I invest in
culturally like do you want to be better
with automation you want to take more
you know pride around broken builds
right think about
what's getting in the way of getting
those values right through the five
why's on why why no one's caring about
broken bills or or why we have no
advancement or access to training
materials like certain starts to talk
about that with with a team because
that's how a lot of this stuff started
with us just a five ten person team and
we sort of spread that around and people
got excited about ideas and then it grew
right it's it's a good kind of lean way
of agile way of testing things but the
main point to take away is culture is
not a passive sport culture is conflict
okay you have to be willing to challenge
your peers you have to be willing to
challenge your management structure and
as engineers who you know myself even
tend to be more introverted right it
gets me out of my comfort zone but
that's the only way to to make sure that
that you're growing right and that
you're actually becoming the company
that you want to if someone's not
addressing that broken bill don't be
afraid to just say hey why aren't you
looking at that like I mean got to get
that fixed there's other people that
depend on that so just holding each
other accountable I think is the the
biggest challenge that I see from a
cultural aspect so I'll just leave you
with you know the next time your boss
complains about you playing xbox you
just tell them you're busy building
culture
thank you and we're always hiring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
