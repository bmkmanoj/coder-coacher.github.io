my name is Kevin Nelson I'm a technical
solution engineer on the chromecast team
for google and so what I do is I help
all the content partners so how many of
you have a chromecast device awesome
everybody so everybody's ready to go so
all the content HBO Hulu Netflix Pandora
NBA MLB you know Showtime all these
companies I've been to their offices all
over so it's kind of fun so kind of
trivia question this is where I wasn't
noon today does anybody know where this
is any guesses Hong Kong close close so
this is where i was at noon yesterday so
this is summer palace in beijing so it's
been this was yesterday also it's kind
of fun and yesterday kind of fun and
this was Sunday the Great Wall so it's
been it's been quite a crazy day I've
been up for over 24 hours at noon I was
in Beijing and because you crass across
the time zone the what is the were the
International time you actually land
before you left so is it noon and in
Beijing and here on stage at three
o'clock but Beijing was fun it was there
for about three days did a couple of
events and some presentations and met a
lot of great people so it's super
excited to be able to come back and talk
to all of you so not only has it been a
crazy day but it's been a crazy month
been all over and monday i'll be our
tuesday tuesday i'll be in New York and
so this is the kind of thing that I do
visit lots of lots of companies don't do
too much presentations and public
speaking but it's more of a hobby not
really part of the work I do cool so
let's jump into chromecast
so we all love to sit in front of the TV
like couch potatoes relax enjoy but it's
also about spending time with others
kind of sitting with your family
enjoying time in your living room with
those loved ones that you have friends
family others and right now in the u.s.
we will watch a heck of a lot of TV
spend a whole lot of time in front of
the TV here you can see you know about
three and a half hours a day people are
watching the television and so you know
we have this convergence between
television and software and this is
opportunity for us as engineers to kind
of jump in as early adopters and be part
of that wave and so today I'll do sort
of a talk that will give you some of the
fundamental knowledge of developing for
chromecast and hopefully get you in a
position where you can jump in there
really quickly
so what is chromecast everybody said
they have one little dongle 35 bucks
plug it into your TV everybody should be
pretty familiar with this one thing you
may not know is we've got Android TVs
out there and all of the Android TVs you
can cast to so any code that you write
for chromecast runs on Android TV and it
also runs on cast speakers so we have
speakers from LG we have speakers from
Sony a few others and it'll work for all
those all those devices so what
chromecast really is as many of you are
aware it's taken that 17 inch really
immersive experience we're really in our
phones really deeply and then that lean
back ten-foot experience and bring in
those two worlds together and what's you
know nice if you think about you know a
traditional TV setting where you use a
remote control on chromecast we're using
the phone
and so imagine you know if I if I ran a
little competition here and I asked half
the room I give you terrestrial remote
controls and said go find a piece of
content and I give the other half your
iPhone or your Android who's going to be
faster right the people with the mobile
phone are going to find it they're going
to have their preferences or going to
have all those great things you know of
their phone the keyboard the voice
recognition all those things and so it's
really you know on chromecast we believe
the remote control is not the future of
the televisions we think the smartphone
is and even you know TV manufacturers
are starting to develop TVs that ship
with smartphones or tablets as part of
their TV and do not have a remote
control and so it's not just us thinking
this direction a lot of the industry's
going that way as well so chromecast
runs kind of everywhere depending on
your definition of everywhere and so
Android iOS and web you know in the
Chrome browser and one of the thing
that's kind of unique about myself is
before I joined Google most of the work
that i did was in the web and in android
and when I joined Google it's kind of
funny but a majority of the work that
I've done has been in iOS so it's kind
of funny to to join Google to become an
iOS developer but I joined a team of
people who are really good at Android
and really good at web and so for me it
was a great opportunity so I've done I
do a little bit almost even match now
but the first probably year I spent at
Google was almost entirely concentrated
on iOS
so we went to build chromecast who
wanted to be familiar any of you could
step in this car and kind of know how to
do it i wish i had a car this cool my
wife would never allow that stuff three
kids it's not going to work simple you
know very easy and powerful that's
really what we were trying to achieve
and so now let me jump into some of the
technology around chromecast so what
chromecast is is a particular piece of
hardware Google cast is a technology and
so I'll probably talk more about google
cast than chromecast so we first
launched a product we just called it
chromecast because there was only one
piece of hardware and it was easier for
people to understand now we're sort of
transitioning to the proper name which
is google cast a cast cinder is either
android/ios or the chrome browser and
then the receiver is a code that runs in
the television or speaker and what's
cool is the code in the television is a
Chrome browser it's a real chrome
browser it's only you know about a one
version behind chrome and what's really
nice you know videos playing a video tag
just like you'd expect any sort of
captions or things like that run in CSS
overlays so it's super easy to great
it's fruit for web developers it's a
great super ez platform most of the
people who I work with you know
companies like HBO and Netflix and Hulu
tell me it's it's kind of unique for
them that it's so easy to develop in
because you have all your chrome dev
tools it's very natural you don't have
to learn a specific language like you do
for roku easier to bugging than Apple TV
so it's a good easy easy place to get
into with your content and the last
definition there is casting and what
casting is is when you're sending
something to your television so you're
kind of watching it on your phone and
then you pop it up and cast it over to
your television
so how does it work you guys all have
one so I'll go through this pretty
quickly but highlight a few points you
may not know so you're on your android
phone you're watching a YouTube video or
some other video that's streaming from
the cloud ear to your device you look up
you see that big television there you go
wow I wish I could see it there you
remember I've got a chromecast to the
television you look down at your phone
you see the cast icon and go ahead and
click on that when you click on that
your phone connects out to your
television and tells it hey would you
play this YouTube video on the
television so I can see it on the big
screen rather than on my small four inch
5 inch display and then what happens is
the chromecast goes out to the cloud
reaches out to youtube with your
credentials and then YouTube shows up on
your TV and then what happens is the
YouTube is streaming directly from the
cloud it's not streaming from your phone
so you're not wearing out you know your
battery your battery is not draining and
you're not using up your data plan on
your phone and so it's it's really the
cloud going directly to the TV then the
phone itself becomes a remote control so
if you want to change a video adjust the
volume any of these things you can do
that from your phone using your phone as
a remote and the last thing that's
pretty cool is that you can actually
walk out of the room you can actually
leave once you've casted something so
it's pretty common for me as a father
I'll throw something up on the TV for
the kids something I'm not really
interested in watching while I need to
actually do something you know if I need
to do some work or some housework chores
at home I can pop something up keep the
kids happy for a little bit while I do
that and so this is a
that's how it all kind of works so now
what I want to do is jump into some tips
for coding for the television so many of
you haven't done any chromecast before
and you may never and so I want to give
some tips that would apply to Roku apple
TV sort of any of the environments that
you might find yourself in so the first
one here is is a bit of a quiz for folks
so I wrote this simple very very simple
web page to be shown as a chromecast
receiver and all it says is hello cast
developers and when I put that up on my
TV you can see this is the TV in my in
my cube it work you can see that most of
its cut off does anyone know why why
that happens
overscan so over scanning is exactly the
answer so what overscan is is it's just
a standard where they suggest not
putting things near the outside and then
it's up to the TV manufacturer and so
for older TVs that kind of wrap and
things they can choose to display that
or not so some TVs have settings and
will let you change it but but the TV
that I show here you know in the
previous slide that's actually the TV
that I have in my cube and its default
configuration and so if you don't pad
with margins you're going to lose a lot
and so you may if you think back or
maybe you can look tonight when you're
watching your three and a half hours of
TV you can watch and you'll notice how
actors faces text phone numbers you know
whatever they're trying to advertise or
show in the in the contents of the TV
they usually don't put that near the
margins it's it's usually in set a
little bit and that's because they don't
know how it's going to actually be
rendered on the television
so the next thing is when dealing with
second screen what you really have to
keep in mind is that when the phone is
remote when i'm doing interactions i'm
looking at the phone it's not like a
remote control where i'll be looking at
a television and so dialogues error
messages any sort of user feedback will
happen on the phone not on the
television so it's a little bit
different a lot of people will do you
know some sort of something like an
alert up on their television and it's
kind of weird where users clicking
things and it'll say not found up there
but the users kind of looking at the
phone and so keep in mind as you're
doing second screen things be it for
chromecast or Apple TV or any of the
other environments that you keep that in
mind the last thing is burn-in right
we've all seen you know when we were
much younger at the library at school
and in the windows 95 or whatever would
be burned into the screen so does anyone
know what kind of televisions this is
still a major major problem for today
which one which one CRT no plasma
absolutely right so plasmas burn in just
like just like old-school you know LCD
stuff and does anyone know how long you
have to sit on a on a particular screen
before it starts to do damage to your TV
any guesses the guess is anybody think
an hour five minutes exactly right Peter
yeah five minutes is at least a
conservative number that I tell people
so it's between five and ten minutes is
usually what people agree on and so if
you're doing something for the
television and imagine someone's
watching a movie and they pause it well
while it's paused after five minutes you
need to shift things around or you need
to change the screen and do sort of a
splash screen and you may have noticed
either your blu-ray player or DVD player
doing something similar and so people
who own plasma screens get really really
angry because they they spent so much
money on their on their television and
they don't want it to burn in cool
yeah yeah logos have to shift around and
move you know you really have to be
super careful otherwise people are going
to get angry and they've spent you know
tons of money so now I want to talk
about the design checklist so do we have
any Android developers in here anyone a
little bit a little bit so i'll mention
really briefly this is not many of you
are so in ILS when you submit an app to
the app store apple has this very
rigorous process where they reject your
app if it doesn't follow their
guidelines at Google we kind of feel not
kind of we feel just you know that's
just as important to us as it is to
Apple so this is sort of a tip if you're
trying to get your app featured so a lot
of times when i'm in a conference like
this at lunch time people will say my
android app has more usage has higher
votes you know more stars than the other
app that's always it's always been
featured and I've never been featured in
the first question I always ask is what
do you think about the UX guideline and
usually it's you know I've ignored that
you know I think I can do something
better or we're reusing our iOS app and
so at Google we really you know apps
that we feature follow the Android style
guide and so when you're doing a
chromecast app we have a huge user
experience guide that kind of tells you
how to do things and and really the idea
there is for it to be very simple and
intuitive and straightforward for your
users you don't want your users coming
into your app and having to figure out
how to do chromecast they've already
done chromecast in YouTube and Netflix
and all kinds of other places and even
if you're writing a game or something
that isn't television content they
understand the model of connecting and
so definitely read this a few times if
you're going in there
so here's an example of how the icons
look in the different platforms we have
to kind of main modes of connecting one
would be i connect to the chromecast and
then I play so it's like I get out I'm
not playing any content locally i
connect to my chromecast and I plush
play on a movie and the other would be I
play first locally and then I connect to
a chromecast and about half the people
do one way and the other half do the
other and so we support both and so as a
developer you just need to keep that in
mind that you know you know your users
could be doing either direction
so now I want to talk about building a
chrome sender so it's really really
simple the chrome senders obviously it's
HTML Javascript CSS most of the heavy
lifting is done by the chrome extension
so there's a chrome extension that users
have installed and that does pretty much
all the heavy lifting so the first thing
you want to do when the window loads is
check to see if cast is available and
really what this means is do they have
the chrome extension installed it is it
enabled at the particular moment the
next thing you want to do is create a
session request and with the session
request you'll have an API config will
define the callbacks they're the
listeners for session request so that's
the listener and then finally you'll
call initialize and the initialize has a
on in it success to tell you if it was
successful and then the last call back
that you're going to be interested in is
a receiver listener and so what this
tells you is is if a chromecast is
available on your network and so
sometimes people will power the
chromecast into their TV and so when
you're using your app you're not going
to see a cast icon because there's no
device on the network and then if they
take the remote and they power on their
TV then it becomes available so this is
the callback that will get called when
that becomes available
so now you've got a cast icon on your
site and when someone clicks on that
cast icon what you're going to want to
do is do is request a session so you're
calling request session so it's
established kind of a socket connection
between the Chrome browser and the
receiver and when you call request
session what happens is up in the
plug-in we pop down a list of all your
devices so you don't have to do any work
to add those devices the subtitles and
things like that all that's done for you
by the chrome extension so then the user
is going to select one of those and
that's where you can begin so the next
thing you're going to want to do is play
a particular piece of content and so
here we have a domain object called
media info which is really the
information about a particular piece of
media and you pass it a URL so that's
really the URL to either an HLS stream
or mp4 and then the mime type which is
the type of data that that is the type
of stream and then a load request is
your loading so think like loading a DVD
in a DVD player a blu-ray that's too
loaded
so now let's talk about the receiver so
the receiver again that's the code that
runs in the television it's a Chrome
browser remember again you can do html5
JavaScript CSS you can use all the
latest you know things there because
it's really a Chrome browser and for
playing video we use eme the encrypted
media extension and then MSC for media
source extensions and the Web Audio API
s and what's really cool is all the
chrome remote debugging stuff that you
know and love is all available for the
receiver so you can actually use chrome
devtools on your laptop to debug what's
in the TV or in your speakers so we've
got three different types of receivers
the first is the simplest it's a default
receiver so with the default receiver
you don't have to do anything you really
don't do anything in your sender you
know in your Chrome desktop app you can
just say I want to use a default
receiver and it can play media magically
automatically for you you can pause and
scrub and all that it'll just load
things and read your me the information
for thumbnails and things like that but
the problem is is it kind of looks like
something that Google built it looks
very generic the next receiver that we
have is a styled media receiver and the
styled media receiver is just like the
default receiver except you can define
one CSS file you can style it and theme
it and make it look like it's something
that you wrote from scratch with your
branding so here's some example of our
sample app where we've made the progress
bar to be yellow we've defined a splash
screen you can kind of change the fonts
you can change pretty much every element
but here you can see the progress bar
class and the the splash class that I've
highlighted
and the last one is a custom receiver so
this is where you write a hundred
percent of the JavaScript the CSS HTML
to build your receiver and it gives you
full flexibility to do whatever you like
record metrics do drm there's really no
limits because you pretty much can ask
yourself if you can do it in a web page
you can pretty much do it in chromecast
there's a few limitations but in general
that's the idea so people often ask me
well can I build it can I build a game
with the cast perceiver well of course
you can because just like you can build
a game in a chrome browser you can build
a game in chromecast
so here's the the simplest hello world
cast receiver and this is what it looks
like so to start with you include one
script cast receiver jas and that's all
you need to get to get our library and
then from there you're going to define
one video tag one media element could be
you know an audio tag or video tag and
then what you're going to do is create a
new media manager and pass it that video
element and the media manager will take
care of of all the the video element
listening to its events and updating
states based on commands like play and
pause and then finally the cat you'll
get an instance of the cast receiver
manager and call start and so this
simple simple code is all it takes to
write a fully functional cast receiver
there's a whole lot more you know
advanced callbacks for listening to
people joining and leaving getting
callbacks when videos starting end
there's all kinds of callbacks that you
can optionally add for metrics and drm
and all kinds of things that you may
want to do but this is the simplest way
that you can get started and this is all
that it takes because the you know the
cast receiver manager in the meteor
manager do all the work for you so the
next thing I want to talk about is
messaging in your receiver so the
receiver has the ability to either
broadcast to everyone in the room or
send something point-to-point so what
you want to do is is think back and
remember that
the phone is a remote control or the
browser is a remote control and so if
we're watching you know if we're all
interacting with chromecast here maybe
watching a movie together we can all get
out our phone or they could get on their
laptop and we can all connect and so you
have this sort of one television too
many viewers or many senders
relationship and so sometimes you're
going to want to broadcast something to
everyone and other times you're going to
want to only send it to one person and
so think about this scenario where we
were going to do a poker game so if we
wanted to build a poker game with
chromecast then we could take the TV and
make it the face up cards and when I
wanted to broadcast out so that everyone
knows the face up cards I'll use a cast
message bus but then if i want to tell
you your private hand that you're going
to hold in your phone all right we're
going to send that out on a cash channel
so that you're the only one who can see
that information so this is how you use
this to type of messaging the cinders
only have the ability to send to the
receiver and so if a cinder needs to
broadcast something he sends it to the
receiver and then the receiver on a cash
message bus would broadcast on the
sender's behalf
cool so summarizing the receiver really
quickly there's one javascript file the
cast receiver j/s the main classes or
the cast receiver manager it's a
singleton for managing the receiver
state we have a media manager which has
a session that you can load pause and
play and then we've got a cast message
bus which is all the communication
brokering brokering the tinnah broadcast
fashion and then a cache channel which
is more point to point so like I
mentioned it's not only about media even
though I've talked a lot about media
because that's how we launch the product
and that's where most of the initial
uptake was now we've launched a bunch of
games so this is driver it's a really
fun game you should try it if you have a
chromecast you basically take your phone
and you're driving the car or driving
the boat it's really really fun and I
can say that it's also a singly like a
single screen experience so I played a
bunch on the on the airplane coming back
from Beijing to keep myself awake so
it's really fun cool game driving the
boat around things like this are
possible with chromecast so don't think
limited to a media experience because
I'm sure most of you probably don't have
media content but you might want to
build a poker game you might want to
build it you know any sort of Mario type
of thing or or something like driver
race car apps it's really great we got
another one called flip flop where you
take your phone and you put it up and
point the camera at yourself and then
you flap like flappy bird and you fly
through the course it's really really
fun and another one that's neat is just
dance now where you dance so it's very
similar to guitar hero but you use your
phone
the interactions and I can tell you that
our QA team absolutely hates that app
they're completely worn out and they all
like what are you even doing you're just
all sweaty yeah can they say a lot of
four-letter words cool so debugging for
the web and chromecast like I said it's
really really easy so chrome obviously
it's all the regular chrome devtools so
how many of you are familiar with the
debugger command yeah so I love it I use
it more than like you can imagine so for
those of you who don't know debugger is
is sort of like putting a break point
but you add it in your code and you can
comment out and Adam and remove them but
personally I'm a big fan of the buggers
and then I'll put a little comment after
it to tell like what scenario i'd be
testing when i would use this breakpoint
so I like doing that a lot and obviously
the console log stuff all that is real
simple oops I pushed twice so the
receiver is really cool where you also
use all the chrome dev tools which are
remote debugging so has anyone in here
ever used chrome dev tools to remotely
debug something
anyone what you use it for use it for
chromecast oh my goodness so I'm sure
many of you have problems when you
deploy to mobile but there are no dev
tools on mobile and it's very very
difficult so check out the the chrome
remote debugging you use an ADB bridge
use Android debugger and you connect it
to your phone and then you can use your
desktop Chrome to debug your phone and
so before I joined Google I ran a
startup we had scrolling performance
problems on mobile they only show up on
mobile desktop worked great we were able
to put a bunch of logs and break points
and figure out what the problem was very
easily using that and so for you web
developers I highly recommend you check
it out because it's it's like an
invaluable tool especially you know
doing any kind of media query responsive
web stuff you're having trouble to you
know maybe it works in a browser when
you resize but not on the phone check
out the chrome remote debugger so last
little tip here it when you start your
receiver manager there's this optional
parameter called inactivity maxine
activity and it's see an activity
interval so what happens is the the
dongle talks to the phone and does sort
of a ping-pong it's sort of the message
is actually ping pong ping pong between
the two and it's constantly checking
like is that phone still out there is
that phone still out there is it
responding and when you're in
development you need to crank this
number up to something high like 10
minutes like this
and this is especially for iphone so
does anybody have any guesses why you
need to do this for iphone clothes in
some battery issues no no so for an
iphone developer so iphone is a little
bit more single threaded in nature than
android because android runs and
services but what iphone does when you
pause on a break point it stops all
threads not just one thread and so what
happens is your Andrew your iphone
developer pauses on a break point and
then all of a sudden all this crazy
stuff starts happening in the receiver
because it thinks you've disconnected
and it starts doing all these other
there's all these consequences you
weren't expecting for just trying to
figure something out on a break point
and so crank that number up and so it
does mean that when you shut down a
device or you know sort of walk off the
network and disconnect in an unusual
fashion it'll take a while for it to
come down so you don't want to do that
in production if you crank up the log
level then I show here on the next line
you get a lot of really really
interesting logs that tell you a lot
more of the internals that will help you
figure out why you're having issues the
next one is window.location reload true
so this tells it to reload the receiver
without caching and so sometimes people
have trouble where they're making
changes or not seeing them and so this
is a this is a really good way to do
that and then you can also so so myself
I actually never do this I actually take
the USB sort of user tip and i plug it
into my monitor and I just I just the
big fat end and I i power cycle it
because it doesn't do a graceful
shutdown and it's faster so you can do
faster development since it's only a $35
device I don't worry about the like
thousands and thousands of power cycles
done so little tip and trick and
obviously you get the console log in the
debugger just like you do everywhere
else so the resources working you guys
go from here developer google.com / cast
you can find all the documentation a lot
of great stuff there there's a link to
the the style guide UX guidelines post
your question on Stack Overflow to
google dash cast and we actually have a
handful of engineers who a lot of their
job is actually monitoring stack
overflow and answering questions there
so at Google we really embrace stack
overflow and really want it to be
successful and and really contribute to
that so that the questions we answer
there get seen by everyone and the last
thing we have is a Google+ community so
that's a great place if you want
announcements and can we do releases
will announce in there and tell folks
what's what's coming so sample apps we
had a lot of great sample apps they're
all on github the first one is a cast
video that's a UX compliant it's a very
complex app that really meets our UX
guidelines the next one is a hello video
so this is really what's the least
amount of codes you can write to cast a
video and this will help you with
understanding how the life cycle works
and what does it take to get started and
then the last one is cast hello text and
that's for the custom messages it shows
how to send and receive custom messages
so how do you get started yes Peter
oh jeez I don't think we're on twitter
yeah I don't think we're on twitter but
we are very active in the G+ community
so so how do you get started read the
documentation there's some flows that
tell you if you want a custom receiver
or if you need a you know to to go you
know kind of picking how you're going to
do things and then download the sample
apps get the sample apps running so you
make sure it's your environment is
completely set up modify them and then
start casting your content and with that
happy casting and thanks everybody
