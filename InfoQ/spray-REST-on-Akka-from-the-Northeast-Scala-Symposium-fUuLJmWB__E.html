author in lead developer of spray and
I'm glad to be having the opportunity
today to introduce you to the project in
this talk I've got quite a lot of
material to cover so I hope we'll get to
some questions at the end if not feel
free to approach meet any time I'm going
to be around today in tomorrow as well
yeah let's dive right in what is spray
how many of you have actually had
anything to do with spray so far
excellent excellent cool so we call it a
suite of libraries for building and
consuming restful web services on top of
acha says it all actually was first
released about a year ago right after
the aqha 1.0 release and we needed it
for our own purposes because we had a
acha one point 0 application that needed
to go into production in summer last
year and we were looking around for
something like spray couldn't find
anything and just basically started to
scratch our own itch like so many
libraries and here we are a year later
four releases later and were quite happy
with the reception and the positive
reactions we got so far so there are few
principle principles that guide our
development here first we want something
that's lightweight right lightweight few
dependencies bill amaka so it's fully
asynchronous non-blocking actor based
that's it we want to have a modular
that's why it's a suite of libraries
because we want you to only depend on
the ones that you actually need and not
just pull in a huge block of monolithic
something right and of course needs to
be testable our philosophy it's it's a
library rather than a framework right
initially we weren't quite clear on that
distinction but we have eradicated all
in mentioning of the words framework
from documentation just to make this
clear we're going to get to that a
little bit so as a sweet it contains of
a few components one of one of the
important ones is it's got a rich
immutable HTTP model which is actually
based on the one by the blue eyes team
so kudos to the blue eyes team for
letting us use that and and starting
this because it's it's great
it has one component the central
component of this talk which is spray
server which is a DSL for the
server-side construction of rest api's
there's also a complementary HTTP client
which works with the same model with the
same abstractions and it's actually
quite nice in many situations when you
have a client as well as a server
working with the same things because it
makes lots of things easier like
proxying or a few things maybe we get to
a one example later on and talk there's
also something that we didn't have from
the beginning on which is called spray
can it's a very thin layer no
dependencies HTTP server also build an
ARCA as the only dependency apart from
Scala what this gives you is basically
it lets you use spray with outside of an
oven servlet container and it gives you
a nice few other things like a
synchronous response and request
processing which you can't do with a
servlet container because the API
doesn't support it and then finally
there's a yet another scholar Jason
implementation that you can use there
are many of them out there this one is
type class-based actually originated
from s Jason that you might know it's
very clean nothing much to say that
actually doesn't depend on acha is the
only component so let's double click on
spray server that's basically as I said
it runs on this on circle containers or
on spray can the servant containers it
supports are basically all the three
point Oh API compatible servlet
containers you can also use JD 70 Tomcat
six if you are stuck on these old ones
and still need to support them basically
all we need is some way of
asynchronously processing the request as
I said it's the tool for building a
self-contained API layer we're going to
get to that in a second what that means
and central element is routing dsl for
defining the behavior that you want and
the focus is web api's not web gooeys
right this is a clear distinction from
the beginning order was clear we wanted
to build something that you as is
focused on the ape
I side so we're not really we don't
really see spray as an as a as in the
same space as play or lift or something
just because it's focused clearly on
api's we're going to see that in a
second when we talk about the basic
architecture that we were that we have
in mind when you build something or we
use spray like they'd say you have an
application you have an application that
you build has your build your business
logic in there you build it using the
tools that you want so you use your
build tool your middleware layer
probably our car maybe not we don't
affect this way we don't affect end in
any way how you build your application
that's your application and it should be
in the way that you want it now say you
want to put a REST API layer on the side
right so you want to somehow connect it
with the rest of the world through and
through a rest layer I've drawn this on
the side on purpose not underneath
because we want we don't want you to get
the notion that you build your
application on top of spray you don't
you build your application on top of
whatever you build your application and
you put in spray on the side so what
happens when a request comes in this is
an actor message actually coming in from
the circled container or from spray can
it hits the API layer and the IPI layer
is going to probably in the interesting
cases trigger some kind of action in
your application this is also a message
now the key point here is that this
action is a domain object it should be
something that's different defined in
the context of your application right it
shouldn't be Jason it shouldn't be XML
it shouldn't be something that's got
anything to do with HTTP you define on
the business level what this action is
and it's the responsibility of the API
layer to do this translation and lifting
in the level of abstraction right now
when your application answers it's going
to come back maybe it doesn't have to
but sometimes or many times it comes
back with a reply and this deploy reply
as well as a domain object right and
again there it's the REST API layer that
actually then translates this down to an
HTTP response so this is the
architecture that you haven't have to
have in mind when you when you want to
build something cleanly
the advantage of doing it this way is
that your application is completely
decoupled right and you can swap out
should something better come along your
API layer against unfiltered or blue
eyes or whatever but your application
stands as it is contrast this with us
with a web GUI application like a real
web application yeah whats would we
that's what we mean when we talk about
web applications you would be building
it with play or lift or something but
you're going to be very tightly
integrated with the framework that you
use and it makes sense for play to be a
framework and give you much more
structure than sprayed us because the
center point of your application if it's
a web application is going to be the
interface right here it's not your
application is some big service and this
is just an API layer so the API light
layer has certain responsibilities you
want to discriminate between different
requests based on the HTTP method the
path the query parameters the content of
the of the request and so on and
obviously you need to treat one one
request this way in another one in other
way and this routing is something that's
the responsibility of the API layer then
as I said you need to lift or decrease
the level of abstraction by marshalling
or unmarked link to and from your domain
objects encoding decoding compression is
something that should happen in the API
layer that your application shouldn't be
worried about authentication is
something that should be happening there
maybe the API layer needs to talk to
your application to authenticate maybe
it doesn't depends still it's it's
living in the API layer then you might
you might want to do some caching you
might want to serve a little bit of
static content that should certainly be
possible if you have some documentation
or something it's nice if you can do
this and obviously since we're trying to
be restful here it's important that the
API layer supports you or does it
properly the arrow handling you want the
right HTTP status error codes come
coming back and since we're talking
about an API you're going to have
clients and in many cases you might want
to have a public
and your clients are going to be some
kind of whatever consumers and having
proper error messages that really are
helpful that tell the guys what went
wrong and how to fix it is crucial in
building a product that's actually
appealing to the outside so this is an
important point now let's look at
example of what it might look like if
you build something like a route or some
kind of API definition with spray this
is just a very simple example and
without telling you much more of how
exactly it works you should be able to
figure out what happens here like it
should be it's quite readable you can
see it all right basically we have two
different ways of completing this
request one forget request one for put
requests and there's a certain path
that's going to be matched so it's very
straightforward let's look at how this
actually works so a route is the central
point in spray and the route in spray is
nothing but an alias for a function type
which is request context to unit now you
might be wondering why this is unit and
it doesn't return some kind of future
right you could think okay maybe it
should return the future on a response
if it's asynchronous that would
certainly work as well what we decided
to do here is use the explicit
continuation passing style which is
basically equivalent you can do most
things that you can do is with futures
in this way and the other way around a
certain pros and cons to the different
choices we consciously made the choice
to go this way because it plays well
with actors and if someone have more
questions on why we went this way I'm
happy to take it offline and discuss it
with you so the key point here the key
object is the request context that you
can see how you use it is basically it's
it's a it's a wrapper around the HTTP
request and it gives you all kinds of
additional functionality like complete
for example there are several overloads
of a method called complete and how you
use it is the most simple route would be
this one you get the request context you
call complete on it you're done
basically when you call complete this is
going to set off a whole chain of
closures and functions that are going to
be executing
all the logic that needs to come after
you applied your out this way to finally
trigger the sending out of the response
to the client you can also write it this
way if you want or you can use something
called a directive and spray which is a
building block in route structure that
is you know made up of all kinds of
smaller chunks to build some complex
kind of some complex behavior so you
could also just a complete with say
hello something right and the complete
with let's look at what it is it's very
simple it basically just cause complete
on the request context and it also
requires that the type that you use for
completion actually has a marshal
associated with it that's type class
stuff that Seth just talked about right
so let's go back to the example and you
know dissected a little bit so the key
point up here is the is the path
directive it's also a directive right
has a name and it has a number of
arguments in this case it's a mini dsl
giving you a way of describing what kind
of paths you want to match right so this
is an order followed by some kind of
integer like an int number but in hex
notation so what it does it extracts
something right it extracts the thing I
was matched here like the hex in number
extracts means it basically if a
directive extracts something it pulls
out something from the request and makes
it available to the inner route which is
something that you nest in there and
that can work then with whatever you
extract it but it's itself again just
another route so it's it's just going on
like this deeper at deeper levels and
you can nest it at arbitrarily deep as
you want so the inner out here basically
consists of two parts which are both
routes again so you have to get
directive and they put directive and
they just filter based on HTTP method
and pass it on to their inner route and
so on and what happens when you shoot a
put request into this structure is
basically the get
directive is going to see it it's going
to decide no this one doesn't fit my
filter so I'm not going to pass it on
into my inner route I'm just going to
reject it and this little tilde there
the this operator basically just
recovers from read from rejections if
you want like if the first route doesn't
want to handle this request then the
next one change in afterwards gets a
chance to do it if this one fits all
good if it doesn't then their whole
request is going to fall through the
whole structure and it's not going to be
handled by this thing and spray is going
to take care that you there's going to
be a proper error message going back to
the client in this case if you shoot a
post request in there the client is
going to see post doesn't work it's a
405 method not allowed error saying you
can only do gets and puts here right you
don't have to do anything spray is all
going to take care of proper error
messaging in this case so when we step
back and look at this thing basically we
see the whole structure forms a tree
right a tree of routes that go on deeper
and that have several branches and a
request flows through the structure in a
depth-first manner up until a level
where it gets either completed or
rejected then it goes back and flows
through the rest of the structure right
so what we saw they're basically still
contained a little bit of repetition
because it was in the get branch and the
put grunge almost the same thing you can
dry it up like this if you just put them
together you can combine directives with
the or operator which gives you another
directive having the combined filter
with an or right so this is also going
to work now we needed to change the
inside of this route a little bit
because we wanted to get at the request
method so you can not use the complete
with but you just write it like this and
then the context give you the way to
actually get to the method now what we
can do here you can actually pull this
out now you can make your own directive
called get or put which is a custom one
that doesn't exist before hasn't exist
before and you can just use that one
right so that gives you a way of
labeling
configured configurations of directives
that make sense a new respect or newer
in your application and you can reuse it
at several times so if you have like a
long large construct you can just use
get or put if you wanted to now if you
look at what's left down there you have
a path directive and nested inside you
have the guest get or put basically a
request is only going to get to the very
to the very end of this route if both of
these things match the path needs to
match and the method needs to match
right and this you can also express
differently if you use the end operator
right so rather as an alternative to
nesting you can just pull those things
together into one thing which is also
going to give you a directive and then
use this one and once again you can pull
that out if you want so now you have
order get or put what's something very
specific in your case so and down the
route there is has become much easier to
read what this is supposed to show you
is that it's possible to really work
with the directives that you write
yourself or that come with spray to
combine it into something that makes
sense in your application and reuse it
in complex structures right the point is
that you can have really really large
descriptions of AP is that are still
very readable because you just name them
properly now another nice aspect of
these operators is that they are
completely type safe so let's look at
what this means suppose we define this
one which is a directive that just
another name for a pre-configured path
directive right what this does it it's a
directive that pulls out it extracts one
int as we sing before now this one
obviously compiles let's let's try to
make up this one like we want to compile
combine a directive that pulls out an
int with one that just filters and
doesn't pull out anything so this
doesn't work you can't do this this
doesn't compile because what's going to
be the common super type of these two
things all right so let's take another
example let's say we try to combine the
auto path with a directive down there
which looks a bit strange it has two
elements this is a regular expression
combined with a double number right so
this one
right most side of this pulls out two
things it pulls out a string that
matched the regular expression and the
double number which is going to be
converted to a double right and you
can't combine that with an or operator
with with a directive that just extract
an int so this doesn't work you can't do
this so spray takes care or the compiler
takes care that you that you don't mess
this up in it that your structure
probably works so this one is going to
work because you extract again you have
a directive extracting an end and the
second thing also extracting it what
this thing does it basically looks at
the query parameter with the name order
and it makes sure that it's it can be
converted to an int cleanly if it does
it pulls it out so you have two
different directives that both pull out
an int and you can or them like this so
this works let's look at this you have
again the thing that pulls out an in and
you combine it with the end operator
with a directive that pulls out a string
so the value of the query parameter with
the name OEM and it and an option of
string which is the expired parameter
that you might have in the river in your
request little question mark at the end
basically says okay this is not required
you know if it's not there don't worry
about it and this automatically gives
you an option so you can use this for
example in a route like this where you
say okay just apply this logic and then
give me the order ID which is the int
the OEM which is a string and the
expired which is an option string
alright let's move on Spray comes with
69 predefined directives so it's a whole
lot you can they do all kinds of things
I work with cookies they work on how to
values they change things about
responses they compress decompress
whatever right we're not going to go
through all of them I just want to show
you that there's lots of meats there for
you to combine in whatever ways you want
them so rather than going through any of
these in detail I'm going to switch over
to this which is a real world example of
what
a spray right no spray route might look
like in the wild so don't worry about
the boilerplate up there that might
change let's look at what's going on
here so anyway okay let's let's go
through it one by one so up here we have
something saying encode response so
basically everything that's inside there
is going to be compressed it's going to
be gzip compressed but it's not only
going to be gzip compressed it's also
makes sure that the request that comes
in actually has accept encoding headers
that match this right if the client
doesn't accept Jesus encoding then this
also just completes the request right
away and says you know this not going to
work you get a 406 unacceptable response
with the information inside of the error
message that you need to accept Jesus
this is all packaged in this nice
directive so for you don't you don't
have to worry about it so this this
thing here just defines the behavior of
the root of the root path so if there's
no further path down there you just
redirect to slash doc very simple and
only get requests so let's go down to
the root path not to the doc this is
what gonna what's going to hit if you
shoot in as request to slash doc it
actually what it does in the inside here
is it says get from resource directory
so it serves up static content that
lives on your classpath in some jars and
underneath this path and whatever is the
sub path behind the path prefix is going
to be taken out of the doc route
underneath your your classpath structure
and then because in this particular
project all this documentation actually
was written in markdown files so what we
need to do here we basically do this
which looks complicated and probably
should have been pulled out and named
with a nice name what it does it
transforms the response and converts
mark down to two it to HTML this is this
thing here is defined in the context of
this application that doesn't come with
spray but someone wrote a function that
changes markdown to HTML and you just
apply it to this round like this
alright so that's the / dog let's look
at this guy so if we have that's the
interesting bit the API what happens
here so we have one thing that says
Jason P with parameter that's basically
JSONP support automatically already
coming with spray clearly whatever is in
here is a JSON API so you want to give
your clients the ability to use Jason P
which is a special kind of JavaScript
wrapper around Jason and that's all you
need to do in order to have this then if
you have the path / AP I / top articles
you go in here it only responds to get
requests it requires that there's a
parameter that can be can be converted
to an int the parameter has to be named
max it makes sure that the max parameter
is actually non-negative otherwise it's
you're going to get a narrow and then
the interesting bit is down here this is
a complete with as we've seen before and
what it does it takes the parameter max
wraps it in a message sends it out to an
actor a topless now the top top articles
service and this comes back with a
future that is mapped to a sequence of
articles so you're at that's the call
the bridging call from your rest layer
to your application right the top
article service lives in your
application it expects you to send in a
get message and it gives you back a list
of articles and this works just like
this because there is a marshal or
defined for this application that knows
how to translate an article into jason
and spray helps you with things like
spray Jason support and so on to do that
nicely so you don't have to do a lot but
this is very readable and shows you
exactly what this route is doing so
someone who doesn't know spray or Scala
can figure out what this guide or what
this thing does without any problem so
you see this this path tub articles if
it doesn't match we're going to get down
here and there is something called token
authenticate that's a custom directive
that someone using this application road
and what it does it's basically what it
does is it looks at
cookie and checks whether the cookie is
there and if it is it's going to extract
a user object out of somewhere maybe by
asking the database or whatever but it
makes sure that only authenticated
requests actually get in here so in
there are few sub sub routes like the
ranking this only request response to
get requests there's a custom thing here
that wraps the this route with some
logic that counts how often the user has
used the API how long how much time it's
been there and so on and then it
extracts a bunch of query parameters
actually five query parameters here that
are all of type int now how do you see
this this ? says if it's not there then
just supply the value that's let's that
comes here right so it's an it's an
optional query parameter with a default
value of zero and just by writing this
brain knows okay the type of this
parameter needs to be an int right
otherwise you couldn't have a zero as a
as a default value so you extract five
things usually you would have to have
pick them up at the end as we've seen
you would have to pick them up
individually as five different
parameters now that can become a bit
clunky in your router definition so
spray gives you the ability to just say
okay wrap it up in the case class like
this one if we actually go there it's a
simple case class defined like this that
has a different in stare right so this
is case class support automatic pudding
of extractions into case classes and
there's no reflection involved this is
all type class based that's all type
save theirs it's fast so you don't need
to worry about it you get here you get a
ranking district descriptor so it's an
instance of this case class and once
again you shoot it to your ranking
service map it to a result and that's
going to be used for completing the
request and so on right there's more
stuff here we have a post this requires
that the user that that was extracted up
there is actually an admin otherwise you
can't do this then this actually
extracts the content of the request so
it does the opposite of marshaling and
marshalling
and it converts it to accounts details
whatever type that is right if it
doesn't work if there's any problem the
whole thing is going to create a proper
error message that goes back to the
client and then once again you have
another service that is actually going
to do the work in your application you
map the result that's it so you see how
this how this works this is just some
stuffs I put in here so there might be
more things where you have different
routes for crud support get put delete
whatever you want to have their and so
on here we might have something like an
old version of this that's still written
in Python and some Django server and if
you use it's also custom but very easy
to write if you spray client you can
just proxy requests back somewhere else
right so you take the request here you
send it out as on the client side to the
jungle and whatever comes back there
just goes back and completes this route
very easy to write no problem with spray
and down here finally we actually serve
some static content some CSS some images
they live in again on the classpath and
public gzipped and they're cached and so
on so this is what I want you to take
away from this is that you can have very
complex definitions that are very
readable very easy to maintain and you
can understand what they do even the
half a year from now when you come back
and look at the code because you need to
fix something okay so that was our real
world example that's the real world
example again just as a backup let me
wrap this up what are the best practices
basically best practices you keep your
out structure clean and readable just
similar to what we've seen so far if you
have a lot of logic pull it out into
custom directors so that you maintain a
very clean structure that is easy to
read don't let the API layer leak into
your application right that should be
separate stick to the clean architecture
this is easily done by just putting the
API project or make it a separate
sub-project underneath your common
project that doesn't even have any
dependency going back in so there's
nothing that your application can depend
on use the unmarked infrastructure it
really helps
keeping your routes clean so don't do it
yourself manually just just d couple it
use the marshaling in the type
class-based way there's blocking okay
let's not go there and then if you used
spray on spray can you can use the cool
plugin the SBT revolver plug-in + J
rebel that gives you hot reloading so
you can have your application run all
the time and just change bits and as you
change them SBT is going to recompile
the bits that are required load them
into your jvm and you've got really fast
turnaround it's excellent there's a lot
of more stuff that I'm not going to be
able to talk about today that's their
support for lift Jason for twirl which
is basically the play templating engine
language that we pulled out and you can
use in SBT outside of play there's
support for scala t there is
asynchronous response push streaming
that we've haven't seen use if you spray
on spray can you can do that that stuff
on testing obviously on how to customize
the error messages all that's possible
and we can talk about this maybe
tomorrow there's a workshop that you
guys are interested let's put spray kind
obviously which has its own things
current state we just released the 09
release this morning it's the last
release for acha 1x we know that we're
behind and I got 20 is out and we
everyone wants to have it use it and
whatever and we we want to do it as well
