going to talk to you about mobile
malware but I have a suspicion that many
of you don't actually know what lookout
is so let me just tell you about that so
we're we're mobile app and we're trying
to keep your phone safe and we have a
bunch of features finding your phone if
it gets lost backing up your data and
the thing that I'm going to focus on
tonight which is protection from malware
threats so what the security team does
at lookout and I'm on that security team
as an engineer is a number of different
steps so you can think of the way that
we deal with with malware and trying to
find malware in the world is that we go
through acquisition we try and get as
many apps in the world as as we can and
then we run through some automated
analysis where we try and figure out
what which of the things out in the
world are interesting for our human
analysts are manual analysis to to look
at and then once we have taken a look at
that at those apps then we can decide oh
this is actually a good app it just may
use some more dangerous features of
Android or actually it's a bad app that
does something bad that might hurt the
the user of the phone and we'll talk
about what bad means in a few different
cases during the presentation so
specifically what does what does mobile
malware doom well now we're authors are
after a few different aims and these are
just a few of them but they're the
biggies their money their your data like
your personal data and contacts and
possibly access to your network
you can imagine a lot of a lot of phones
especially at work at corporate in
corporate settings have access to their
own corporate network to the internal
infrastructure of their corporation or
other enterprise or possibly possibly
even government so access to all of
these things is is really what what
malware authors are after but we're kind
of we try and teach a message that were
not really into to fear preaching
there's there's a really big danger with
anti-malware vendors that everything
sounds like you know everything's really
scary but what we're really after is
just having our users have a safer
mobile experience in in various
different ways so just as as an example
we put out a mobile threat report last
earlier in fall of last year and one of
the things that we talked about is
knowing what your risk is of being
affected by mobile malware and if you
take a look at this this is a heat map
of the world with infection rates for
for mobile malware in in June and you
can see that in the Western Hemisphere
things are sort of light green and if
you can see this it's actually less than
point 2 percent for the very lightest
green and between point to and point
four percent for the the next shade out
yes sir
yeah so so you can take a look at the
report we so the question was what
specifically is then this number
referring to and is it about new new
look out users and yes it is about new
look out users we the the report
actually explains why we chose that as
our our metric it's a little bit
complicated so I don't I want to get to
the code tonight but that's available on
our website and I'd encourage you all to
take a look at that yes sir the question
is does the version of Android make any
significant difference I don't know yeah
okay so there's various ways that you
can reduce your risk and when the
biggest ways is just use official
markets it's not it's actually not
always easy for people in different
parts of the world to do this but here
in the US you know Google is here google
has their official market they do a
pretty good job of keeping malware off
of that market so using using google
play is is a really good idea avoiding
apps from from weird places we've seen
at least one incident of drive-by
delivery of malware so if you suddenly
see that an application is downloaded
after you visited a website even if it's
a seemingly legitimate website probably
you shouldn't install that application
and yeah get a security up I have my own
recommendations well let's hear you pick
yeah so there will be code now that
we're done with that introduction but
before we can jump into the code I need
to talk a little bit about how we how we
analyze applications and how we figure
out what what they're doing and that
they'll give you context for what you're
about to see in the cases of specific
pieces of malware so this is sort of a
fairly common view
of the Android development cycle when
you're creating an app you you get all
this junk together code in XML and
whatever and then throw it through the
mystery box in Eclipse and then an app
comes out right well more specifically
what's happening to that Java code is
you're going through Java C and D X 2 to
produce your classes Dex file and so
looks a little bit like this but what
we're really interested in is getting
back from the classes decks to the code
a lot of times when we need to discover
applications malware applications source
code is not included so there are a few
open source applications that you can
use to to get from your classes to X
back to code and one is box Molly so
small a is an assembler language for for
Dalek and box molly is the is a
decompiler from a from a Dex file back
into this this assembly language as far
as assembly languages go Smalley's like
super easy and really i think quite easy
to read if you have any experience in
you know similar languages that address
real hardware this will be quite quite
simple in comparison and then the other
option is to use a utility called Dexta
charm so what this does is it converts
from dalvik bytecode back into java
bytecode and you know java by now is is
a very mature platform and has a lot of
d compilers for it you know there are
varying quality and and we'll see those
variances tonight but what Dex dejar
does is give you put you or take you
from the android world into the
traditional Java world and give you
access to all of those d compilers
unless you kind of see a semblance of
what the Java code might have looked
like you'll see that there are for
various compilation reasons and D
compilation reasons
some idioms that look very different
when expressed index versus expressed in
java bytecode so those will come out as
very bizarre Java code so given all that
that's what we're going to look at is
that bizarre Java code is it still a
little bit easier than the assembler and
we're going to talk about the money
motive so we talk first about how
premium SMS works as premium SMS is
really the sort of route that gives a
lot of malware authors the ability to
collect money from you without having to
break into your bank account or anything
like that and so this is this is a
picture of how the world is supposed to
work right so I'm going to just zoom in
here and premium SMS if you're not
familiar with the concept when I first
came in in contact with it it was via
various natural disasters a few years
ago you saw maybe like the Red Cross and
other charitable organizations using
this they would say text you know donate
to such and such a short code and then
that would be added to your phone bill
and you'd you would have given a
donation but it's really just a generic
payment system for various kinds of
goods and one that's sort of you know
not quite as charitable is is ringtones
so say you're really you're really hip
to get a new tune on your on your phone
and you want to get that you find a
shortcode provider you text them a
number and say this is the short code
that i want the wireless provider gets
it since the order to the to the
provider of the ringtone the the
ringtone provider sends you a message
then yeah to confirm that you actually
ordered that and want to
get it so it's a sort of double opt-in
you have to both request the content and
then you have to confirm that you
actually requested it so that there's
there's no ambiguity or hopefully very
little ambiguity that you actually did
intend to order it then the US user
confirm that you're super happy you have
music in your heart as it shows here
then a few weeks down the line you get
your bill you see that you order that
ringtone and everybody's happy you have
ringtone they have money good right so
this is this is how things work in in
the u.s. we have this double opt-in kind
of thing there's also like a sort of a
bad scenario in in other countries with
fewer restrictions around this so one
way that you might get charged for some
stuff via this this payment method that
you didn't really want to get is you
download a malicious application and
that then I just uses your phone and
sends a text message to a to a short
code that you didn't know about and then
this is sent through all the the back
channels they actually do the processing
you get your your charge what may happen
is there there's actually usually a
receipt in just about every place the
through is a that may not require an
opt-in but if you've if you've worked
with the SMS stack and in android you
know that you can intercept SMS messages
and use them for you know whatever like
control channel stuff or just present
them in a different way if you're like a
really nicely formatted SMS app or you
can if you're malware just take receipts
and throw them away so that nobody sees
them again so that's that's one
possibility there and then you get your
bill but you've been charged already and
the the ability for you to contest this
with your provider is
limited in certain parts of the world
with certain providers so with that kind
of background let's talk about fake
player this is one of the the first
pieces of malware that was that came out
on on Android and it's a it's a trojan
media player what it does is it suggests
to you that it will play you a certain
type of media content for when you
download it it really only has one
permission so if you are looking at sort
of as a user looking at at apps a lot of
people get worried when there's a whole
lot of permissions but in this case it
only had just the one permission which
is send SMS and that's really all it
does you do not get the content that was
promised we when it's when it's
installed so on so what this is is code
of the the main activity and it's the
that d compiled code that I i mentioned
before and what I'm going to do is zoom
in on this a little bit so I know
hopefully very many of you are Android
developers so you'll see this is an
activity it's got an oncreate method and
then if you don't read Russian and I
don't and google translate says that
this says you know hold on a bit we're
going to request some access to the
video library but then you actually see
what's this a bunch of text message is
sent directly to premium SMS master says
it's it's really very straightforward
requesting access send a bunch of text
messages this is really you know one of
one of the the simplest most
straightforward basis and as one the one
the earliest ones so yeah I think you I
think you get the gist of that but
oh well it shows up as like sorry oh
right so yes how would the app get
launched the app actually purports in
many cases to to be a pornography app so
that was a type of media's sort of
alluding to there are certain
inclinations that might lead you to to
open there so yeah that's that's how
you'd get you to open it yes sir
so the question was that how many apps
want the SMS permission and is that is
that really critical look for it is
really important high-risk permission to
look for I don't know off the top of my
head how many apps request that but it
is used by a number of apps and in a lot
of cases it's not used necessarily by
the app directly it is used for a lot of
legitimate payment SDKs so you may get
an in-app billing SDK for like games or
whatever for any kind of content that
you want in the in the application
itself it may as an SDK require you to
to ask for the send SMS permission and
that uses that to charge your you for
the the content so there are very very
many applications that use send SMS for
for all sorts of stuff I mean it's
really just used as a communication
channel that also happens to do billing
and and texting right so so it's not if
you see an app that isn't just an SMS
app or you know like a text app and it's
still request that it doesn't
necessarily mean anything bad that it's
requesting that permission okay so I'm
going to move on to a very something in
the same vein but a little bit more
sophisticated and it's called alpha SMS
and what it does is it basically charges
you to download apps that are already
free and it has a couple of interesting
features it has a really kind of a
couple of custom encryption schemes and
it shows progressive improvements over
time we see these guys really producing
a lot of new and more sophisticated
versions of a malware in this family so
it started off really simple Orient's so
this is really this is just a utility
function in
in the application and really it's a
rapper that's very common in just about
any application that uses SMS the the
default parameters for send text message
a lot of times you don't need to fill
all of those in so they're doing what a
lot of people do which is just take I
believe this is this is either the
content or the the destination number
and vice versa so there they just want
to send this content to this destination
number and there's some other parameters
and they don't care right so they're
just making a little bit simpler for
themselves so we went from this to this
right this is basically the same
function has the same capabilities and
let me just show you a few of the
highlights of this this beauty so first
thing you might notice is there's a
bunch of string builders grabbing the
value of a number appending that to
another number converting it to a string
and then actually it's not even being
stored anywhere so they're just really
and you know it's sort of random what
the numbers are that are in there so
these are actually basically just no ops
but they're randomized Nawabs so there's
there's all sorts of sort of background
noise that they they add to this
application and then up here you see
there they're creating an array of class
and they're doing class.forname getting
getting these classes and then calling
this method after after after with some
randomized string right well what this
is actually doing is this after after
after is a is a custom string encryption
method and what it or it actually is a
decryption method so they've encrypted
these strings then they decrypted them
back and they're getting a string and
getting the class for that name
so you might recognize from the the
previous slide or if you're familiar
with the the text message send text
message call these three are the same in
the next two are the same the first
three are string and the last two I
forget what they are but these are
actually the parameter types for the
send text message method and then if
you're familiar with with Java
reflection it's actually getting that
method in string one which is not shown
on here is they've stored and have
decrypted send text message putting that
into a local method and then going down
through here doing a few other things
and then eventually invoking that so as
I said you can see this is how they're
assigning the parameters again it's
pretty much the exact same method that
we just saw in the previous slide but a
lot more complicated way of getting
there just to try and make sure that
people like us don't don't find it okay
so they also have you saw one sort of
custom encryption scheme there they also
have another custom encryption scheme
and what this is is it's a decrypter for
a an XML file that they've stored in the
application and I was just talking to to
Sasha before the before the talk and he
was saying he teaches a class on android
security and talk about encryption and
stuff like that you probably heard this
before but don't don't do your own
encryption schemes it's really hard to
do encryption and this this actually
it's not that hard to break so what we
what's actually decrypted out of here is
some SMS numbers to send to send premium
text messages to and also there's a
little bit of scheduling in there
figuring out how often am I going to
send those messages how many times a day
am I going to say those messages on
stuff yes sir okay sorry you just asked
me to speak up a little bit should I
repeat anything okay sorry cool so let's
talk a little bit about data this is
actually really really pretty
straightforward but you can see how yeah
yeah oh what's the question oh it's the
double opt-in so you'll need to the
question was what kind of rules can stop
the SMS attacks that we've seen you need
to if you're an attacker you need to
send an SMS to the number you need to
then get the receipt back and reply to
it with with a response that says that
you accept the charges that can be of
you know whatever level of difficulty
the the provider puts in there and then
you'll get another receipt back you'll
also get a charge on your bill which you
can contest quite easily in the US if
you if you notice that it's on there so
there are a number of rules that allow
for recourse here which are not as
common elsewhere in the world yes
uh-huh yeah okay yeah so he just said a
few years ago he had access to a server
where he could send you a text message
and charge you three dollars for that so
it's hard to do anything about that on
device cool so yeah I'm going to move on
then to the data section this is
actually just really straightforward
there's this family malware called snd
apps and there's really I mean this is
there's not a whole lot to say about how
how you steal data but if you if you
look at what happens here you see a
function which takes in a few parameters
and it has a URL and then it just takes
a bunch of personally identifying data
and you know much to the chagrin of rest
devotees it post saw it sends all your
data as a get but whatever
this is from a different family of
malware yeah a lot of the stuff too so
these are like a lot of people stumble
into this stuff unwittingly and just
decide well what I really need to do to
keep track of my users is index them by
email address even if they haven't given
me that or index them by phone number
even if they haven't given me that
willingly and we don't consider that a
reasonable thing to do okay so I'm not
sure what the intent of the one that I I
saw there the one that I showed you just
now is but the various different things
that you can do with with this data as
you can imagine is sell it to spammers
use it for marketing or just being sort
of thoughtless in the way that you or
lazy in the way that you index your
users and and and deal with sort of a
regular app data so i won't talk a
little bit about what was actually very
well-constructed piece of malware called
not compatible and the function of it
and the code of it are kind of
interesting but the priests are
straightforward to describe what's
really interesting is what what's done
with this how this was delivered and how
it's used to to attack different parts
of your network so it was a drive-by
download and we there were some some
websites right that yes
not really suggesting that
no not so he asked am i suggesting that
they were doing identity theft and and
know that they may not be you know
you've got you've got information about
just your app usage sometimes how people
are interacting with your app what what
activities they take within the
application and how to monetize that
better you know just sort of very
standard stuff that I think a lot of
applications do you can collect that in
a variety of different ways if your
users say I want to sign up for an
account and here's my information and
you have the rights via this terms of
service that I agree to to take that
data and do what you want with it then
so be it right somebody's consented to
that if they take all of that stuff and
they don't say any of that sometimes
it's done without you consenting or
without you even really noticing that
maybe there is no account to sign up for
then then that starts to get into much
shadier territory okay so yeah so not
compatible so there were some websites
totally innocent websites I think there
was a pesticide deal yeah okay thanks
yes there was some totally innocent
websites pesticide I think are a pest
control company in in Florida and
various other places I had no you know
that are not our distributors
intentionally at all got their websites
infected and then all of a sudden there
they were getting a redirect when so
that when you visited their site with
them with a mobile browser you were
being redirected in the background to
download an APK which is an android an
android application that was called
security update and if you clicked on
that notification that you downloaded
something it's a do you want to install
the security update so that was
something fairly new and then what i
would do is basically just use your
phone as a network proxy so this is a
little bit of the code i'm not going to
go too far into this like the other ones
but basically it's really just kind of a
bot your send requests of things to do
on the network and you pass that traffic
through and pass it back and it's just a
straight forward proxy some of the
things that were being done with this
for you know just buying tickets off of
ticketmaster and doing some searches on
on google so not really sure what the
what the intent was specifically but you
know you can imagine this is very
dangerous to let somebody have access to
your phone and redirect traffic through
so a lot of the things I've talked about
so far we're all those it behave within
the permission model of Android and
they've as we talked about before you
know that the app says I'm actually
going to use SMS here do you allow me to
do that and you say yes and then it goes
into something bad but there are some
other ways mostly historical at this
point that you can actually get access
to the phone to to route it to to do
things that are not even allowed in your
permission law there's also a lot of
people who have rooted their own phones
for totally legitimate reasons and there
are some applications that try and take
advantage of the fact that you have
already rooted it and then again break
out of the permission model you know
with root your route you know so there's
a actually a pretty cool like really
interestingly constructed piece of
malware called called gam x
earlier last year and what it does is
downloads and installs apps and then it
runs them while your screen is off and a
lot of the apps that it downloads are
totally legitimate applications that's
just running you can imagine and you
know we can only speculate while why
they were running these apps even though
they're totally legitimate but you'd
imagine an ad revenue or you know
boosting your numbers of users all that
kind of stuff and then just as a
technique that it used this really
interesting zip payload technique which
I'll describe so what you can see here
is really just some of the code that is
supposed to grab your existing route
permission so you can execute binaries
in elf binaries and Android you just
grab a runtime call exact right so you
want to run s you go for it if it's
there then then you can run it then you
can do a bunch of things like you can
what this guys doing all about here you
can you can remount the system partition
and then install your application as a
system out yes
yes so this was a question is is this
isn't this making assumptions about how
the phone was rooted it is but this
holds true quite a lot of the time so
they just need high probability they
don't need perfection the other thing
that I should say about this is a lot of
the really good sort of independent
application roms now they in su
applications if somebody tries to do
this even in this method you're asked in
an AQI screen such and such an
application is trying to grab route do
you want to allow it to do so and so so
that's a really great feature where that
you can help protect yourself so if you
if you don't know specifically what an
app is doing with root you can you can
say no yes
as so the question was what's the
difference between Trojan and malware we
would classify Trojan as being sort of a
subclass of malware Trojan is something
that tells the user that is going to do
one thing and it does another all right
so yeah I think we'll have this
available in one form or another fact i
think i'm doing a screencast right now
that's some way or another yeah a
question back there
mm-hmm
right and so he just said that he gets a
lot of spam as a developer offering to
to get you a lot of installs and reviews
for your application I i meant i can
only speculate as to why this particular
malware author did what it is that
they're doing but that seems like a
really good reason to me okay so yeah so
let me just say here to system apps have
a really special place in in android to
you have to go out of your way to to
uninstall them we have to be root and
install them fortunately these in this
case you do have root or else you
wouldn't be able to install them but you
do you can't just go into the the system
settings go to the apps page and say
uninstall it will say this is a system
app and so forth so oops make sure you
thing I think is cool so this is a hex
dump of a file that's in that came
bundled with this application and you
know text dumps goes it's free standard
as much a hex but you might notice
something weird like right down here
there's there's a PK and a PK at the
beginning of a file as a zip header so
you know looks pretty random so you
might just say well there's a PK in the
middle of some random bytes I don't know
but it turns out this actually is the
zip file and the way that I think it's
lib Z is is implemented and at least on
on Android and and actually i think in
linux do you can unzip this it'll say
like oh there's some crap at the
beginning of your zip file but it'll let
you unzip it and this is actually a zip
file that has stuff in it but you might
notice and go back you might notice this
other thing up here which is like well
so is this file
it's got those PK down here but there's
also some like there's some real strings
up here too and there's like a bee why
up there well it turns out if you look
at the code of the application what it
does is it it may unzip that that zip
file that we just saw but then it will
take the same zip file still zipped XOR
it turn that that'd be why into a PK and
then it's got another zip file this is
it's kind of cool I don't know there's a
neat trick that they came up with and
then that those strings turned into
different strings and there's different
things in there and their various sort
of helper applications that are actually
installed by by the malware so yeah so
I'm about to wrap up here but if you're
interested in this and how to do
reversing and stuff there's a these
these tools that I mentioned you
probably also want to check out apktool
I gave sort of an abbreviated mention to
getting the the other components that go
into an application but there's you know
there's not just code there's like those
zip files and things that I talked about
so apktool can help you got that kind of
stuff out yes sir
yeah so the question is about
obfuscation and yeah so there are
various ways in which obfuscation
especially at the the decks level can be
used to to make these tools not work and
there that's a topic of quite a bit of
research in in this area for these for
these tools and attacks on these tools I
think actually one of our engineers gave
some examples of ways to break these
tools at the last black hat and also
some patches to fix them so yeah it is
this is a battleground to there's there
are people trying to keep people from
reversing their their applications
obfuscations in various different ways
can be used to make these less effective
but you know as with all obfuscation
there there can be put in an amount of
effort to to to surmount that the
application still has to run right so
the other bit that I want to mention as
Sasha graciously mentioned have the
mobile security and privacy meet up
there's a few different things in this
area I think these the guys at passband
have a mobile security meet up as well
ours is the mobile security and privacy
meet up all good meetups to to join and
learn about we talked a little bit about
this kind of stuff at our meetup tools
and techniques for learning how to
reverse android applications and if
you're interested in learning more about
that or it's something that you think
you might want to do and then you please
come and talk to me so thanks very much
yeah I have a question slide
yeah so the question was recently there
have been some Java exploits that have
come out I believe mostly in the plug-in
realm to my knowledge none those have
affected Android but certainly you know
the security model of any system is is
that for attack so so the question was
there are two ways to approach this
problem you can try and reinforce your
your security model at the operating
system level and the API level and all
those sorts of things where you can have
third-party approaches like the one that
lookout has it actually turns out that
in android there is a permission model
that allows things like look out to
exist so in terms of of efficacy we
think we do a good job as I mentioned
it's very difficult to you can allow
certain actions but understanding the
intent of an application or an
application developer is very difficult
and so I think it's it's really
dangerous to go too far to the other
extreme as well and just not allow
people to do anything because you could
very well squelch you know creativity
and all those sorts of things yeah so
the question is is there way to detect
the network activity of of these kinds
of applications which are using your
phones as a proxy and to some extent
there may be there are a lot of these
use their own protocols which are you
know if you know what a protocol looks
like you can start to detect it in so
far as knowing specifically what traffic
may come in and out of it I think that
that be generally harder you don't know
if it's being if that's your phone is
being used as a proxy for specific
targeted kinds of activities or if it's
just being added to like a big tour
group you know so it's hard to say so
the question was first question was
about location tracking I think have we
seen any three
it's that use your location and we have
and those there's a range on the
location so there can be surely
malicious apps that just want to track
your location but it tends to be more
targeted you know if you if you get a
random person's phone and start to track
their location it may probably doesn't
matter to you if you don't know who they
are but they're I'd say one of the
things to be concerned about there is
more stuff that's targeted specifically
at you in a malicious way and possibly
even you know from somebody that you
know if you there are various
applications that allow themselves be
hidden from the user and that's
something that we're not too fond of and
it's you know some of them are
advertised as you know track your spouse
track you know whoever you want and the
you know that's very dangerous
functionality the other question was
about other platforms iOS and Windows
Phone I'm not I don't work in those
areas so I can't say specifically I
don't think there have been many many
threats for iOS at least yes we don't
have data on the the question was is
there any data about how the how users
are affected by permission list when
when installing and I don't know of any
any research on that specifically but I
think it I think has been done in
academic circles but i don't remember
specifically the question was can google
detect any of these exploits a lot of
these exploits are actually pretty old
the so the way that people root their
phones now tends to be more tethered but
it used to be that there were
vulnerabilities in various api's or the
operating system that were taken
advantage of certain phones had certain
specific vulnerabilities and so a lot of
these concerns have been patched up
stream so so it's not as much of an
issue so the question was are we
building up a public database that
anybody can
concert before they install an app and
our model is more that you install our
app and as you install the application
we scan it for you and let you know
about if it has any threatening behavior</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
