hanging up on callbacks more than just
flow control with ekman script six
generators I came up with the title of
this presentation and I was so pleased
with myself that I shared it with all my
coworkers was like you're done with
callbacks you're hanging up on them
right and they all gave me the same face
that you guys are giving me right now so
I probably ought to change the title of
this thing anyways if you can't be
bothered to like sit here and watch me
talk about generators you can see a
bunch of working demos of ECMO script
six generators in action assuming you
have a web browser that implements
generators as they currently exist in
the es6 specification the draft
specification so if you got a newer
Firefox or Chrome Canary you can just go
to this Earl and play around the stuff
and ignore everything on both side well
first of all how many of you have worked
with generators in JavaScript already
yeah couple of people all right what
about fibers in node land no yeah all
right awesome okay well you guys know
everything you can go home now and I'll
talk to everybody else buy me developer
at carbon 5 I live in Los Angeles right
now I'm originally from Seattle I like
to tell that to people when I come up to
San Francisco so they don't think I'm
like a lame la person these slides suck
but basically I'm an aging hipster I
live in Venice so you know we're tight
pants right Haskell so what am I going
to talk about up here other than just
stand round tell jokes this this is sort
of the this is what I would say is like
common practice and JavaScript land
we've got some nested callbacks we've
got some plumbing of error messages from
different different event excuse me
different asynchronous callbacks it's a
mess look at this code think about the
kind of code that you write and wonder
to yourself like can we do any better
well the answer the question is yes we
can do better it's about turning that
code into something
looks like this these two pieces of code
functionally are identical we're
performing some asynchronous operations
we're doing a let's just assume that the
implementation of this get function
issues an HP you get to / foo and post
issues an HP request to bar we still
have the single threaded event loop
we're doing some plumbing of exceptions
back to some centralized error handling
but we can do it in a whole lot less
lines and it's a whole lot less gross so
this is going to be about generators
it's going to be about making this dream
your reality so really what it's all
about it is my position that programming
around asynchronous callbacks is hard
it's harder than it really needs to be
but because of the concurrency model
provided to us by the browsers and and
also in node land it's just something
that we've become accustomed to doing
equi script 6 the draft specification
talks about generators which I will
demonstrate Olivie ate some of the pain
that you're experiencing programming
around asynchronous callbacks today I'll
show you how to leverage these
generators to move from writing your
code and continuation passing style
which would be like asking the computer
to do something and then at the same
time passing it instructions for what to
do next call back to direct style
programming which is what you're going
to see in like Python or Ruby or all
these other programming languages where
you can do you know x equals get to some
earl and you don't move down to the next
line until that operation is completed
without losing all of the magic of the
single threaded javascript event loops
that you love and know today okay so in
order to talk about how awesome
generators are need to enumerate some of
the things that I think suck about
working with asynchronous callbacks it
is my position that it is a non-trivial
amount of effort to follow the path of
execution through a program that is
written leveraging heavily asynchronous
callbacks if you read JavaScript all the
time you sort of just become numb to
this pain but people coming into the
language from Ruby Python Java whatever
have to wrap their head around some of
the strange things that they're seeing
they do things like this we've all done
this the first time that we started
writing JavaScript we're issuing an HP
request to slash token where you
doing the result of that to issue an HP
request to slash profile using that
token so we're doing to asynchronous
things in series and then when we
finally get that last result what we
would like to do is output the profile
name to the console we all know because
we're awesome JavaScript people that we
have to put that in there and all this
nesting is somewhat significant and
these nested functions imply an order of
operations that you can't get by simply
going top to bottom that kind of sucks
I'll also demonstrate that handling
exceptions across event loop sticks
event loop tix is pain so I showed you
this in the first example look at this
code look at this code and think about
what it's doing here so assume that this
call to some lib get data is
asynchronous operation so this
synchronous operation being what it is I
can catch errors with a simple try catch
block that is built into the language
right that's that's good but if I have
errors that arise inside of the
callbacks excuse me if I have errors
that are given to me as a result of some
asynchronous operation and I want to
handle those things in the same way I
have to plumb that error back to some
centralized exception handling mechanism
by virtue of a closure that's kind of a
bummer you can alleviate some of this
pain by using promises but it's a whole
lot of moving stuff around to try to
handle the fact that you can't rely but
you can't easily trap you can't easily
catch errors that are rise across
different tix of the event loop that's a
bummer I think we can do better than
that so as I was mentioning this some
lib get data if an error arises from the
call to get data or something you know
inside of that a synchronous operation I
can use try-catch which is built into
the languages excuse me built into the
language it'll pump it back to this on
error function that I've got at the top
but if anything happens here I have to
pass this stuff up via closure because
they they're not happening in the same
tick of the event loop that this try
catch is is as being invoked last thing
I want to talk about a sink flow control
is hard it becomes easier when you use
some libraries like promises or when you
use
a sink but it's harder than it needs to
be and if you want to do it in just
regular JavaScript you're going to have
some problems of legibility so looking
at this code who can tell me what it's
doing at a high level anybody straight
faces okay I'll give you a hint it's
doing two things at the same time it's
issuing this request to get token and
it's issuing a request to get key and
when both of those things are done then
we're going to issue a post to off and
then after that's done then we're going
to redirect to dashboard and what I'm
trying to demonstrate here is doing two
things concurrently and then something
else and then something else in series
so there's all sorts of lame stuff I
have to do I've got this laser pointer
that helps you point there's all this
lame stuff I have to do to make the call
back to this request know about if this
thing is done such that we move on to
login we can alleviate some of this pain
by using promises but it's still a lot
of code it's a little easier to
understand especially if you're familiar
with promises API but the same sort of
thing is happening I'm doing two things
concurrently and then I'm doing two
things in series we can use async to do
this but my God look at all that code
it's totally it's it's for both its
explicit but that is a lot of code and I
think that we can totally do way better
than that using generators ok so what
our generators I'm not going to read all
that to you but generators are
essentially functions that can suspend
midway through their function body so
we're used to functions that you enter
at the top and you exit out of the
bottom they either return something
explicitly or they return the implicit
undefined but generator functions are
different and that you can re-enter them
in the middle why that is interesting
we'll talk about in a second you may be
rolling your eyes when I'm talking about
equi script 6 because you have to
support IE 7 or whatever thing you have
to do in your miserable job but you can
use some of these features in equity
script 5 compliant browsers today as
long as you're willing to transpile
Google tracer or if you're building some
rad admin tool and you can use one of
these newer browsers like Firefox 27 I'm
not sure how far back you have to go
with Firefox before you
get support for these api's but I'm
using Firefox 27 it's working today
Chrome Canary will work and you can use
the stuff in node right now as of node 0
1 1 with the harmony flag so you can
actually start using this stuff ok so
generators I talked a lot about how
they're awesome i'm going to show you
the syntax and will slowly move from
like the hello world generators into
something that will enable you to write
real code in your applications today
using this direct style that I've been
talking about ok so the hello world of
generator functions is an iterator
there's some interesting syntax here
well first of all let me back up what
we're going to do here is we're going to
output the Fibonacci sequence of numbers
instead of having to generate some huge
chunk of Fibonacci sequence excuse me
some huge chunk of the infinitely long
range of Fibonacci sequence numbers
we're only going to generate them one at
a time so in order to do that we're
gonna use a generator it's got some
interesting syntax that you may or may
not have seen before first thing to note
is the asterisk after function that
designate that denotes that this
function that we're talking about here
is a generator function which behaves
fundamentally in a different way than a
regular function that you used to in
JavaScript the other new word you're
going to see here is yield which can
only be found inside of generator
functions so imagine the code on the
left is is the definition of Fibonacci
sequence and then you know if you move
this chunk of code underneath it it's
all the same program I just couldn't fit
it all in the screen top to bottom so
we'll see how the caller and the collie
sort of bounce back and forth giving
control depending on the state of the
generator function ok so first thing
we're going to do we're going to invoke
our generator function that is going to
return a generator object which we're
going to store in this variable seq that
has not executed the body that we
haven't started executing the code in
the function body yet we just initialize
this generator function now we have a
hook to this thing called a generator
object so the next thing we're going to
do is we're going to call next and next
is going to start evaluating the code in
the body of the generator function from
where we left where we left
off in this case at the very top of the
function so we're going to do our
variable declaration we're going to do
some assignment i equals 0 B equals 1 C
equals 0 we're going to hit this while
we're going to go into the wild block
and we're going to continue evaluating
code until we hit a yield if this were
not a generator function and you did not
have a yield there this would just be an
infinite loop right I've got like wild
true and as we know wild tree will just
keep going until something makes it stop
generator functions are a little
different we're evaluating into this
while loop we hit this yield keyword we
evaluate the right side the expression
found on the right side of the yield
keyword and then we suspend generator
function so we do not move down to the
next line which does this assignment C
equals a be you know bc b and all that
other good stuff so we evaluate as I
mentioned we evaluate the right side of
this yield function and we suspend
giving control back to the caller and
what we yield this expression on the
right side of yield will be made
available as a property of the object
that we return so using substitution
just you know as a thought you know
exercise a was equal to 0 the first time
around so when we yielded control from
the generator function back to our
regular code the value of a substitutes
in for value on the right hand side so
then we move down to the next function
excuse me the next line we call next and
we re-enter our generator function
immediately after the yield point so not
at the end of the line but like
immediately after this expression a
right here on the right so then we move
down to do this this assignment C equals
a equals B B equals C plus be moving to
the next the next number in the
Fibonacci sequence we go back to this
wild true which is still true and then
we hit our yield point once again
freezing the generator function giving
control back to the caller and returning
the value of a which is then available
via the value property of the returned
object here so using substitution you
can see that we now have one you can
kind of see where I'm going here with
this you can mentally map we're going to
do the Fibonacci sequence of numbers and
you can sort of see how we're
think back and forth between the
generator function and the code that is
invoking the next method on the
generator object that it's got a hook to
so I realized this example is a little
lame but it's fund important to
understand the very basics of this thing
or you'll get totally lost when we get
into the more complex examples later so
visualizing multiple entry points the
Fibonacci sequence is awesome but we can
get a little more complex visualizing
what I was talking about where you re
entering a program not at the end of the
line not the beginning of the top but
somewhere some at the end of an
expression so okay looking at this code
I bet somebody can guess let's just
assume that log is an alias for console
dot log can somebody tell me and I'm not
going to keep going until someone tells
me what is going to be output in the
console when I evaluate this code right
here you have five minutes come on
somebody brave huh all right yeah what
do you get mad 100 you are going to see
something like a hundred all right that
was good we'll keep going with this
you're fired okay so we saw before that
the first thing you're going to do with
your generator function is you're going
to invoke it which is going to give you
back this generator object which has
these methods next and so on and so
forth on there so first step invoke POW
generator we get a hook back to the
generator object which we then store in
variable G next line we're going to call
the next method which is going to start
evaluation of the code in the power
generator function body from top to
bottom so the first thing we do we're
going to declare the variable result
then we are going to keep evaluating
code on the right hand side obeying the
order of operations at the language and
forces and we're going to find this
first yield keyword so not not both of
them but just the first one we're going
to evaluate the expression on the
right-hand side of yield and we're going
to suspend the POW generator function
which makes the VIP makes the value that
we yield is the result of evaluating
that expression on the right-hand side
of yield available to the caller so at
this point substitution the string a is
now output to the console it's important
to note that this POW generator function
is now suspended it's in a suspended
state you can read the equus script 6
specification that talks about the
different states that functions can be
in but generator functions introduce a
new state which is suspended which this
function is in right now okay so next
thing we're going to do is we're going
to move down to the next line
parenthesis enforcing an order of
operations is going to ensure that we're
going to call next first before we
output anything to the console the
interesting thing that you're seeing
here which we didn't see in the iterator
example before is that now instead of
just receiving values from the generator
function we're going to pass something
to it so we're going to pass the number
10 from our caller to the generator
function the collie and what that's
going to do is it's going to take this
value and it's going to essentially
insert it immediately at the point in
which we suspended the generator
function before then we're going to
continue evaluating because now the
generator function is back in an active
state we're going to hit our next yield
point which is going to send be or make
be available back to the collar and
suspend once again so a substitution you
now have a and B the caller has control
generator function is suspended so you
can sort of see where I'm going with
this we call next passing to which
substitutes to in at the point where we
suspended the generator function before
and then since there are no more yields
we're going to continue down until we
hit a return statement so we're going to
do some assignment we're going to
evaluate math.pow which raises 10 to the
power of 2 Thank You Man we're going to
store that in the variable called result
and then we're going to return it which
makes it available as a property value
of the returned object that we're going
to get from our call to next so it's
kind of a trip right a be 100 you can
see how we're bouncing back and forth
between the generator function and the
caller yeah what's up
yes you can yield whatever you want it
could be undefined a and B are there
mostly to illustrate the back and forth
sort of nature of this if the generator
function is done i forgot the the name
of the state but if the generator
function is done you'll get an exception
raised when you attempt to tell it to
resume again because it can't do
anything else there's like a finished
state I believe is what it's called in
the egg miscreation alright I'm going to
keep cruising because I know you guys
want to get to your 15 seconds of fame
okay so generators in the real world
bibin achi sequence number generators
are awesome raising 10 to the power of 2
is really cool but like we build real
stuff that we got to get paid to do so
how does this stuff apply to your job
right I talked about how using
asynchronous callbacks it's kind of a
payment but especially for a new
developer to follow the path of
execution through a code that relies
heavily on asynchronous callbacks this
is what I showed before the slight
modification we're still doing our
request to get token we're still doing
our request to get profile we're doing
these things in series and then we
output to the console your name is you
know Billy Bob or whatever using
generators we can clean this up a little
bit if what we really want to do is
communicate that we're doing two
operations excuse me three operations in
series there's no need to do this
nesting of callbacks like you're
accustomed to in regular old JavaScript
plan these two pieces of code
functionally do the same thing do the
get to token first do the get to profile
second and then output this stuff to the
console uses generator functions to do
that well we'll talk a little bit about
it the next slide something you're
seeing here for the first time is this
sinc function and this function does it
reduces some of the boilerplate that you
have to do in order to suspend and
resume and pass values around there are
a variety of libraries out there right
now that already provide this
functionality for you
and run is one of them co co rec i think
is another one if you google like
generator rapid libraries for javascript
today there are a ton of them out there
the reason that i'm talking about sync
which is something that will implement
in this conversation today is just so
you can see how you can write a very
small amount of code to get this direct
style programming feel which are going
to see here so cinq-cinq takes a
generator function in this case it was
an anonymous generator function you can
tell it's got the little star there it
is going to immediately invoke the
generator function which gets you back
that generator object what it's going to
do is it's going to pass a function it's
going to pass this function called
resume and then it's going to
immediately call next which is going to
start evaluating the generator function
from top to bottom the interesting thing
about this resume function that we're
passing the generator is that we can
pass that function as the call back to
our asynchronous operations and when
they are done they via closure will
restart our generator function passing
whatever value they got from their
asynchronous operation that makes sense
you can see this resume is passed to the
generator function and I just passed
this resume function on to my
asynchronous operations as their
callback function I cheated a little bit
in this presentation the signature to
resume follows the node style error
first the return value syntax I kept
going with the browser examples that
I've got here because it services talked
really well but many of the library's
I'm talking about like gin run and Jenny
will handle this more intelligently for
you but ultimately what they do is they
pass the generates use me they pass a
function which will allow you to resume
the generator function that your code is
running in okay so I talked about how
much of a pain in the butt it is to
plumb exceptions around across different
ticks of the event loop generators have
an answer to that as well in the first
example I showed you that the try-catch
only works with code that could raise an
error excuse me raise an exception on
the same tick of the event loop that
I catch block was evaluated which
doesn't do us any good if we want to
raise an error from inside an
asynchronous callback and handle it the
same place unless we do this like lame
plumbing of error messages through
closures with generators you can use
try-catch which is built into the
language right like built into the
language to handle the exceptions that
are raised from the result of evaluating
synchronous code as well as asynchronous
code not interesting right you don't get
that with regular JavaScript the way
that it works with a slight modification
to our sync function is that we can
instead of resuming the generator
function faulting at a value we can
resume the generator function
immediately raising an error at the
point that it's suspended so assuming
that let's say my call to post bar raise
an error or rather like an error that i
want to re-raise like happened I can
easily resume the generator function
calling raise which immediately after
this yield excuse me immediately after
the yield and its expression we will
raise an exception which we can then
catch in the try-catch block that is
built into the language the last thing I
want to talk about is a sink flow
control I showed some examples of using
promises and the async library and also
just vanilla JavaScript to do some
things in parallel and then a couple
things in series the syntax was a little
brutal but we just sort of learned to
accept it and that's you know what we
what we were just gotten accustomed to
it we don't have to do it anymore as I
said this is the old school way of doing
it this is the new school way of doing
it new school i'm totally la so what
we're doing here just like in this prior
example where we're getting token and
we're getting key and then when we're
done with both of those operations we
move on to posting to off and then doing
this redirect we can do this in much
fewer lines of code much less clutter
and it's pretty clear what we're doing I
had to put this array on two lines to
fit it in the slides but the API looks
pretty clean in my opinion you'll notice
that there's vente modification to
the function that I'm past excuse me the
modification to the function that I'm
passing my anonymous generator function
that enables us to do some things like
handle multiple operations concurrently
I won't show the implementation of this
but if you look at my github I'm github
/ laser with an S I've got a super
trivial implementation of this but
basically what's going on here is get
and get to token and post a key happen
at the same time when they're done the
generator function resumes and then the
variable data holds an array with two
things in it first thing as a result of
get tokens second thing as a result of
post to key then in serie you know as
the next thing in this series of things
i want to do i do a post to off passing
the data that i got from both of those
two asynchronous operations when that is
done i have off holding the variable off
holding the result of this post to off
and then i moved down to window dot
location on href changing the the Earl
and passing whatever I got back from
post off so it's pretty clear to
differentiate between the things that
you want to do concurrently and the
things you want to do in series it looks
very similar to something that you're
going to find in a programming language
that typically uses the direct style
like Java Python whatever only you're
not losing any of the power of the
single threaded event loop you're just
suspending the generator function until
this asynchronous operation complete so
the resume ER argument notice instead of
just passing this thing dumbly along is
the call back to these asynchronous
operations I'm actually invoking it here
that is a modification I had to make to
sync basically what it does is every
time you call it it increments the
counter and then when the generator
function suspends and gives control to
the sinc function the sinc function
waits until the counter has been
decremented which happens when each one
of these asynchronous operations
completes when all of the count when the
counters have been decremented back to
zero then it knows that it can resume
the generator function passing back
whatever array of stuff it has as a
result of all these asynchronous
operations it's something like I don't
know like 20 lines of code or some
like that but if you see me after after
the presentation i'll give you a link to
to where you can see that in action but
it basically reduces just incrementing a
counter and not progressing to the next
bit of code until that counter has been
decremented which happens when these
asynchronous operations complete yeah
what's up can you kill a pending yield
action I don't think so if I understand
your question the answer is no but it's
possible we can talk afterwards to see
like if you have a specific example but
to kill yield I don't know how you would
do that in fact I don't think you can do
that okay so take aways walk through all
this code I talked about direct style
versus continuation passing style coding
a lot using generators enables you to
write direct style coding without losing
any of the awesomeness of the single
threaded event loop that you use and
love in the JavaScript runtimes your
programming against today you can
already use these features in Canary you
can already use these features in
certain builds of Firefox you can
already use these features and browsers
that implement the es5 specification as
long as you're fine with the transpile
step if using CoffeeScript you're
already doing some translation right now
it's not that big of a deal to go you
know plugin another piece into that
pipeline if you really want to try some
of these features and your browser's in
your applications today is my position
that their adoption will dramatically
change the shape of the asynchronous
JavaScript code that we're writing I
think the syntax is easy enough to
understand that it will make JavaScript
accessible to people that otherwise bang
their head against the wall trying to
understand the asynchronous nature of
these runtimes this totally reduced well
it doesn't totally reduce that pain but
it really helps to alleviate a lot of
that pain I encourage you to go
experiment check out that es6 dash
genroku app com if you want to see some
working examples from the stuff that
I've talked about today i want to give
some acknowledgement to Toby
Oh Tim Caswell and Andy Wingo on the VA
team these fellows have excellent blog
articles and have been talking about
generators in JavaScript for a long time
back into the JavaScript 17 Mozilla days
I don't know which several years ago
Andy Wingo also has an excellent blog
article that he wrote about ECMO script
six general excuse me generator
performance in v8 so if you're going to
like give me a stump the speaker type
question and ask me about performance
and generators I'll just point to that
link and tell you to go forth and read
follow me on Twitter laser raucous
github laser like I said es6 genroku
Capcom for working a working code you
can look at the source obviously Aaron
Swinson healy com presentations
generators if you want to get hooked to
these slides and step through that weird
like bouncing back and forth between the
generator the caller stuff yourself i
blog at carbon 5 4 carbon 5 and myself
and you you can refine it blog carbon
5.com / author / Aaron thanks
do you have any good questions yes um if
ye yeah sure yeah I think so oh yeah
sorry right so the question was would
you recommend this over nodes a sink
module I presume you're talking about
the async the javascript async library
yeah I find that as long as I am
programming for runtime that's going to
support this API I have really enjoyed
using this API instead of a sink which
has been my go-to I've been resisting
promises forever using the async because
i find that it's api is pretty easy to
understand this i think goes a step
further as long as your runtime is going
to support it so what's up that's an
interesting question your stack traces
look pretty weird with these generator
functions so the answer is it depends
you have to do a little bit of extra
work some of these libraries that
provide this functionality that I showed
with sync actually do some interesting
things when you're running in like what
they call debug mode which will make the
stack traces legible but out of the box
stack traces can look pretty weird I
think that I mean equi script six
specification is still in a draft state
so I would imagine that when that is no
longer in a draft State and browsers are
really starting to put a lot of effort
into building these generator a P is
that you will see a you'll see a better
we you'll be better and able to debug
these things than you are right now
given their sort of like beta esque
nature yeah I was just reading the Andes
blog because I wanted to prepare myself
for this question when I was in front of
you all and he said something which is
always like my go-to when folks are
talking about performance in web
applications which is to say that you're
probably going to be sitting around
waiting on Io so the tiny amount of time
that you're going to spend if there is
any additional CPU time you're going to
be spending working with generators is
probably go
to be trivial relative to the amount of
time you're gonna be spending waiting on
Io I realized that's totally lame like
hand wavy question or excuse me a hand
wavy answer but specifically Andy goes
into the details of doing a problem
without using generators and doing a
problem with generators and he found
that the difference between his
implementation a and implementation be
was a matter of like tens of
milliseconds you'd have to look into his
actual test to like find out if that's a
number that means anything to you but I
totally ignore that problem given the
benefit of legibility that this these
api is like a ford developers like
walking into projects where i've written
code over over the regular asynchronous
stuff that i've been writing for eight
or ten years or whatever cool thank you
