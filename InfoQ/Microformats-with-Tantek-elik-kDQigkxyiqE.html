I think at SF html5 thank you for having
me I think Peter already gave enough of
an introduction so why don't we just go
ahead and get started but so we're going
to talk about microformats an html5
today however I want to start by saying
that everything I put in my slides all
the texts all the code and all that is
creative commons licensed which means
that you're permitted to take the text
or take the code and copy it use it the
only thing that I asked for is
attribution so just as long as you
mentioned it's from Tom tech or linked
to Tonto calm that would be sufficient
I'd like to do that with my work and
presentation so that encourage a culture
and spirit of reuse and an open and open
content it's like a thing as Peter
mentioned we've got an ether pad set up
so if you're if you're online if you
manage to get online Vanessa had some
passwords she was heading out for the
adobe guest login if you go to etherpad
mozilla org slash microformats to you
should see something that looks roughly
like let's see this and this is for
collaborative note-taking but it's also
for Q&amp;amp;A so if you come up with questions
during the presentation feel free to go
ahead and add them to the questions
section they're down at the bottom if
you want just take notes go ahead and
take notes and I've asked that everyone
that contributes this agree to go ahead
and put everything in the public domain
according to CC 0 which means that
everyone can just copy and paste from
this and we use it as they wish and that
just makes it ever easier all around if
you do add notes or questions go ahead
and add yourself and your url your
Twitter to the etherpad there in the
contributor section awesome and go ahead
and type in your name here or else
someone else can type in your name for
you anyway that's enough of that so
that's the etherpad and I see we've got
a bunch of folks on there awesome cool
okay so I'm going to talk about there's
basically three basic areas going to
talk about one is where are we my car
formats today it's been microformats org
launched in 2005 that's like forever ago
in web years eight years ago
and it's been it's on lots of different
sites i'll talk about what's what's
actually succeeded what's deployed
second i want to go over a couple of the
challenges and lessons we've learned
because i think in the development any
web technology it's important to see
what happens where you get stuck what do
you need to change how do these things
internet and improve and third i'm going
to close with where are we today with
best practices for publishing data on
the web with microformats to html5
especially in combination so we're we
spike formats today for a technology
that's that's quote eight years old and
it's been evolving ever since we're in a
pretty good shape actually turns out
according to the crawl by the web data
Commons since 2012 hasn't changed much
microformats our amount account for
about seventy percent of the structured
data that's published on the web that's
pretty impressive when you consider that
there's a lot of different ways of doing
it i think this uh so basically
everything in this dark orange area is
all microformats this big this this like
light colored twenty twenty-five percent
here is claims to be rdfa but it's also
sort of like pseudo rdfa from facebook's
Open Graph protocol which is kind of
like meta tags to point o everyone
remember meta tags right anyone here
using facebook open graph OGP on their
sites I'm not alone raised my hand a few
folks I see about a half dozen okay and
then this like much thinner slice next
to it that's all the microdata as well
which is one of the newer proposals to
come out to to mark up data on the web
so that's what we are with mike from its
today it's pretty good that i want to
come back to i want to talk about like
two principles that I think accounts for
why there's so much microformats
deployed and why continues to grow and
get option and that simplicity and
openness and I think these are both very
important because the web itself was
built with these two principles right
one person one man came up with the
basics of HTML HTTP and URLs and that
meant they had to be simple for any one
person to do it right there like
building blocks plus he did something
that not many folks were doing at the
time as he published them with an open
license so HTML hcp in url we're all
published an open license how many of
you remember gopher way okay more people
use the Open Graph protocol I'm
impressed that's pretty little funny
way to go for code and license of
protocols all that were not published
openly despite being developed at a
university and that was characterized
for the reasons why they didn't succeed
so one of the things we've done with
microformats is that since 2007 all the
work done in microformats is all placed
into the public domain with a license
that's cc0 or compatible and that's
really important what this means is that
anyone that wants to iterate on these
standards proposed changes incorporate
them into a book that you might sell or
presentation might give maybe a talk can
do so and that's incredibly liberating
the what WG also with new standards uses
the cc0 license for them and that's what
i mean by openness like we've learned
how to be very open with open standards
development not everyone else is there
yet but we think that that's a that's
that's where the reasons microformats
has succeeded one such nice side effect
is that there are now up to 19 there 19
different translations of microformats
wiki in progress the most recent ones
are Georgian that's the country not the
state I know sometimes it seems like it
may seem like a different country but
and Turkish so it's pretty impressive
that all these different individuals
from around the world like come to like
formats wiki anyone can create an
account anyone can edit and because it's
all say C 0 anyone can take the content
modify contributed knowing that whatever
they contribute they can always get back
out right it's not like we're saying oh
once you give it to us you know we own
the copyright I'm not going to mention
there's any other standards
organizations my name like most of them
so that's pretty cool but really like it
was any technology with html5 or any web
technology you got to be asking yourself
like we have limited time on our hands
we're trying to build stuff a
premiership to customers why
microformats well why work on anything
at all like why worry about any
particular technology at all and I want
to hopefully go over a few reasons that
will help you with deciding you know is
it worth the investment of time it takes
for me to learn microformats and use
them the first is that how many of you
actually work on a website here I'm
guessing most of you write like
hopefully everybody otherwise why are
you here just want to hear me talk or
careers HTML 5 perhaps if you do with
microformats it's really easy to add
simple
features like add your contact
information download your contact
information and our download events so
every single website out there has some
sort of about page contact information
for company or a person that's an
immediate benefit you can get by using
microformats many companies have events
that they sponsor or maybe event sites
do like meet up and support the age
counter microformat where you can use
that to add to your calendar so that's
like a really simple feature work as my
website so it's like 1h card since 2009
google launched what are called rich
snippets and their search results and
this has been a big driver of
microformats adoption and that is that
if you add microformats support and now
bing supports us in Yandex as well this
is an H review for example you will see
assuming they whitelist your site you
will see hopefully eventually a better
result for your site in search results
and what they found lots of other people
have corroborate this as well is that
users tend to click on rich snip results
more than just normal search results so
that's been a big driver of microformats
adoption the third and I think this is a
really important one and this crowd
primary standards better than most is
that it's really if you build your site
so that others can build on top of it
more people will use your site more
people will find your site more people
want to be depending on your site and so
by enabling people to be tube use your
site as a building block you can do that
and you can do that with microformats in
the following way microformats provide
the quickest and fastest way to provide
what i call it cheap dry api who knows
what dry stands for lots of folks here
in the front row don't repeat yourself
yes excellent so one of the things that
microformats do and a lot of HTML markup
methods do this now is that they
encourage you to mark up the data on the
page as it is that's being published
that's visible that if someone screws up
there's a good chance someone will see
it and fix it as opposed to parallel xml
files or JSON files right for example
RSS right how many of you publish RSS
feeds or read RSS feeds okay is that
number any fewer since Google Reader
shut down or anyone you know okay when I
was a technorati one of the things we
found is
to two-thirds of RSS feeds or i should
say feeds in general well it's RSS or
atom had problems either they were out
of date but they were broken or had
other weird problems that the HTML pages
didn't do so we were indexing blogs at
the time and one of the big things we
did was we said well RSS is so broken we
actually have to index 2.html so we were
indexed in the HTML by like literally
looking at one blog publishing platform
at a time what classes they use huge
pain but we did it the point is if your
if your websites going to have an API if
you just start with adding microformats
to your HTML it's so much less work than
creating XML and it turns out it's more
reliable this isn't a hypothetical thing
where if you build it they will come I
mean yes it's true if you build it they
will come they will call you there are
plenty of other sites that are out there
that are consuming microformats today so
for example readability if you publish
your periodic or episodic content your
articles with H entry markup h-atom
markup then readability will parse that
accurately and incorporate it into their
service similarly with spinner and
Foursquare as well for venue information
all right these are just like a few big
sites that are doing this there's lots
of smaller sites too so that's pretty
cool you build your site you support
microformats you're instantly plugged in
through these other sites this ecosystem
of publishing publishers and consumers
of web data so and lastly this I think
is one of the most important which is
that the microformats approach to adding
data to HTML or letting the data become
more visible is the simplest solution
it's the least code that you can do
compared to other approaches okay so
which microformats now a giving
explanation as to why over the years
there about a dozen microformats that
have survived like the microformats
process the the the crucible of
real-world implementation real-world
tests and that and that's a really
important test it's like well which what
microformats actually matter there's
probably been like dozens maybe even a
hundred different proposals for
different microformats and you know some
of come and some have gone the ones that
these are the ones that matter I don't
know if those are you in the back and
read these but all these slides are
available online and i will put the URL
in there as well h-atom for readability
numerous consumers that's for periodic
information hcard is the fundamental
building
block for people in organizations so if
any information on your website about
people like a social network it makes
sense to mark up their profiles with
each card similarly your about page
organizations and such there's lots of
consumers of those h calendar for events
and again I'm only listening to listen
to microformats here that have seriously
taken off that have support from lots of
different consumers mainstream and small
extensions and browser extensions
Firefox Chrome etc H media this is for
media microformats so if you're
publishing pictures or video this is one
that we saw Google start consuming
recently it started showing up in the
webmaster dashboard we don't know what
they're doing with it but they are
consuming it because if you're if you
have your site set up with a google
webmaster dashboard then they'll show
you oh we found some h media okay well
if you found some they're parsing for it
we're not sure what they're doing with
it h product this is used in lots of
search results h recipe for publishing
recipes this was a funny one because it
literally started as like a few
hobbyists a few foodies deciding hey we
just want to publish our recipes on our
blogs and so let's cope with a format
for doing that so they did they created
h recipe that was years ago turns out
Food Network and a bunch other sites out
there started publishing their recipes
with h recipe i'm not sure why but maybe
they just found it easy to do maybe they
found that the class names were
something they could use instead of
making up their own fast forward to you
know with the past few years google
launches a recipe search product and
they'd launch this product only with
supporting h with with parsing and
publishing all the h recipe h recipes
that are published out there now then
they now support alternate recipe
formats as well but h recipe is
basically because there were so many out
there that's what this entire product
was built on that google supported h
resume if you're at a company or
starting a company you're either looking
for jobs or looking to hire people so
again something that's incredibly
practical and multiplied with even
libraries that are out there the clients
are using to consume it h review i
talked about product reviews earlier all
the major search engines and my chrome
formats extension on chrome also
supports that hu aggregate so
you have pages that show multiple
reviews for the same product this is one
of microformats that some of the folks
in Google helped edit and contribute and
push forward finally we come down to a
few relat relat different services and
those the ones that really taken off our
rel me which is used by google it's used
by the versioning rel me off in the auth
web sign-in technique so this is this is
so people can sign in with their own
domain rather necessarily like using
password it's kind of iteration on the
open ID idea well author this is a big
one in search results google basically
and i think other search engines are
working on this show potentially an
image of the author and they get that
from your author page which they find
via rel author and finally rel license'
it's in order to indicate the license
the content of a page is licensed under
is also supported by the advanced search
services of most search companies so
that's where we are with Mike remotes
today that's really practical right now
you can deploy that stuff becomes
immediately useful to your site to your
users you get value at it right away
what are the challenges and lessons
we've learned over the past eight years
well first of all this just because
microformats have been over eight years
doesn't mean there have been other
efforts there have been so there's been
at least nine that i've counted
alternative approaches over the past
eight years to microformats starting
with structured blogging and on fact
i'll ask how many here do you structure
blogging anyone here published structure
blogging no well couple folks okay so
you remember that and then google base
schemas came out in 2005 as well anyone
here do you use google base a couple of
folks okay and that got shut down
eventually but google switched from that
about two years to google data API and
elements did anyone here publish those
that's even fewer okay like nobody as
far as i can tell all right finally in
2009 yahoo and a few companies launched
comment at org anyone here use or
remember comment tag okay 11 maybe one
finger raised back their eyes
remembers it well as far as i can tell
that got published the blogpost and
never went anywhere so that also didn't
really go finally in 2009 same time that
google launched the Rich Snippets they
launched this RTF dateable cowboy org
anyone here publish rdf date of cali or
content one person the back one sort of
person here in the front anyone else
it's about it okay cult folks so this
actually confirms a lot of what i'm
seeing which is that the memory for web
technologies is about two years like if
it's more than two years old people have
forgotten about it or don't even know it
ever existed which if you think about it
it's kind of amazing that microformats
is still used it's like should not be
dead already know okay um 2010 facebook
launched Open Graph protocol meta tags
and this one I'm guessing a soft few has
raised early about dozen different hands
has gotten more update because they
showed immediate benefit to it you add a
GP all of a sudden you're previews show
up differently in facebook the other
thing that they did is that they use the
we call the open web foundation license
agreement which provides a very liberal
and open license for in terms of
copyright and patents and that's
actually pretty important for any kind
of open technology so the Open Graph
protocol is actually fairly open you
know it's not quite as open his public
domain but they put a nice license on it
that was openly developed and and that
was good them to do finally in 2011
Google Microsoft and Yahoo as much as
Yahoo's searches separate from Microsoft
now or not launched schema.org and I'm
guessing is there other folks here since
that was only two years ago right using
schema.org anyone publishing schema.org
one two three four okay about twice as
many at least as the as the our gift
that did a book about org folks and then
2012 last year Twitter launched Twitter
cards yet another way of doing meta tags
is anyone supporting those on their
websites one anybody else know of you
guys you support everything alright
awesome and then also open metadata org
that was the most recent thing i saw
this anyone support that publishing that
anybody here no one okay so no one on
that one all right well there's been a
lot of different alternative approaches
like I said especially Google about
every two years they seem to kind of
reinvent something about what they're
doing
and they're kind of do but we'll see
we'll see what they see what they
iterate on so one of the lessons we've
learned with microformats well one thing
is that if people keep coming up
alternatives clearly there's something
we could be doing better that's that's
important lesson but one really big one
that we learned classic microformats use
class names like classical summary class
equals description and this worked great
from a simplicity perspective yet it had
two major flaws one is that it would
clash with people's existing sites or
class names like wordpress themes and so
then you'd have to either hack your CSS
or redo your CSS or redo your class
names it was a kind of a pain now those
examples were sort of like the edge case
are the minority but they were enough
that it just caused enough cases where
people didn't pay attention to them but
the worst problem worse than that was
that a site would be built by one person
they'd add microformats great awesome
that person will move on to different
projects the designer would change new
designer comes along be like I need to
redesign the site what are these extra
class names doing in here they're not
using the CSS so I'm just gonna throw
them out because less code is better
right so a lot of sites we saw added
microformats they stayed for a while
then then a redesign they lost them
which I figure what happened well new
person just didn't know that they were
microformats there at all so one of the
things we've done on microformats to
sneak preview here is that we're using
prefix class names h dash star p dash
you dash dt d and e dash five different
prefixes so that when you see these
class names they actually do mean
something different you be like hey this
looks different this looks like it's a
part of something maybe I should look it
up and that gives us at least a chance
that microformats will survive a little
bit better through different redesigns
and such that's that's better the other
thing that it did the side effect of
defining a set of prefix class names for
microformats too was that we actually
came up with generic parsing for all
microformats to vocabularies which is
awesome because now we have a canonical
JSON model which is great because that
means you can write a parser once that
parses all of microformats to generates
canonical JSON so anyone that wants to
consume the data representation of a
site can do so that's incredibly
powerful
so it's easier for the ETA for the
publisher just a few microformats
classes and it's easy for the consumer
canonical JSON to consume all right the
second big lesson that we learned is
that despite microformats being fairly
micro for a lot of people they weren't
micro enough for especially in simple
cases so the simple case is if you just
markup a person's name or even just a
few names you had to use to two elements
and to class names to do it right even
more if you've got more components the
name and the amazing thing is that this
is for simple microformats examples if
you want to use the alternatives to mark
this up in HTML like micro data or rdfa
I can't even show you what these would
look like here because it takes up too
much space it's even more code to do so
because microdata rdfa each have a whole
slew of different attributes you have to
remember which one to use when to mark
things up the attribute values are
larger sometimes their whole URLs right
and this makes it even much more
complicated but that's okay we want to
make them even smaller so what do we do
with microformats to we came up with a
way to minimize very common cases if all
you're marking up is the name of
something the name of a product person
or organization and event all you have
to do is what uses one class name just
one class name if you've already got a
hyperlink to that thing like a person
then you've already got an element for
it and again just adding one class name
will give you the name and the URL of
the item that you're marking out
automatically you just mark up the the
name of the micro format also with an
image tons of sites have hyperlinked
images of products of people of
organizations etc and instead of ask
them to add lots more elements lots more
attributes again one class name for that
very common case gives you the URL the
photo of the name and this was one of
the top complaints that we had one
microformats and we think we've solved
it with microformats too so the question
was is it can we assume the by
convention the image that's embedded in
this hyperlink is assumed to be part of
the hyperlink and therefore parsed out
accordingly and the answer is yes so
we've got some very specific parsing
rules that handle the specific cases and
this
case is it the is the innocent image
inside the hyperlink right is it the
only image so we know hey this is a
hyperlinked image the whole thing is
just one big image great that means
image probably represents what's being
hyper linked in all the cases we found
that's the case it's that's intention so
we can take the source of the image as
the photo of whatever object that you're
marking up the URL as the URL and again
the alt text as the name so potentially
we got three properties for free with
microformats too so this brings me to
where we are so I give you a little bit
of sneak peek of microformats too but I
want to I want to take it back to what
what html5 even brings us in terms of
new new abilities the first is how many
of you publish HTML data tables okay
good about a half dozen excellent so you
know all about how table headers work
and tape and TVs and all that work you
can do amazing things with HTML data
tables in fact i want to show you an
example of an HTML data table that i did
last year okay this might not look like
a table but this is this is this is all
this all this layout is done with CSS
these are all different columns in a
table and one of the ways that you can
tell but that's true is when you when
when I publish this within like a day or
two so it's one big table like I said
500 table rows people all went to this
conference yeah the one row of table
headers and the rest all table cells
very simple the search results for that
table actually showed up as a rich
snippet as far as I can tell this is
completely undocumented in Google's
webmaster documentation but what Google
did is they found that there's 500 it
says 500 plus items nowhere on that page
did I say 500 Google figured that out by
actually parsing the table rows and
counting unofficial okay XOXO directory
cetera summary of the tip of the table
and then they parsed out the table
headers name location website
Twitter and they showed the first two
rows of the table as a table right and
that's kind of amazing like Google's
parsing data tables and showing them as
rich snippets and that's here's an
example of rel author that I was talking
about earlier um that's pretty cool
nowhere is this documented that's the
key right if you just use semantic html5
as richly as you can the search engines
will crawl it and if they could do
something interesting with it in terms
of presentation they will so it's just
another good reason to like always use
proper html5 markup you never know when
they're going to make use of it yes
question because the question was about
two years ago the tables were totally
out of vogue with designers they still
are out of vogue to be clear tables for
presentation bad tables for data good to
very different types of tables so if
you're using tables for layout you're
probably doing all kinds of wrong things
and your site probably looks very very
bad on mobile devices okay you guys have
probably already heard about responsive
design I'm not going to go into all that
learn responsive design it's good stuff
but HTML data tables work great and they
get indexed properly and as long as you
use them correctly like for data not
layout that's a good thing okay by the
way HTML data tables they've been there
since HTML 4 so learn them use them
they're good they're still work on html5
html5 added two important elements for
the representation of data on the web
and that's a time element and the data
element no this isn't this has nothing
to do with data star attributes data
attributes this is the data element and
this is pretty cool because the time
element lets you mark up dates and times
in a structured way you can say time you
can say the daytime is in the standard
ISO format and then you can actually put
inside the time element what the human
readable text should be alternatively
you can also combine them with the
microformats what we call value class
pattern to combine like date and time
values into one property this is the DG
start property we're using here that you
might use for like an events and these
are two different ways of doing the same
thing they each have their advantages
and disadvantage
news in the first instance your you've
basically having to commit a drive
violation because you're saying hey I
want to present a locale specific view
of the date and time but I need to
present the machine readable version the
daytime attribute so you get the low-cal
the second version you only presenting
the date in the time once and so there's
a better chance it's going to be up to
date in fact I first I made this slide I
made a mistake i made typos and typed in
1515 for the date-time attribute here
but it's 15 16 in line I found it later
but I was like you know what I'm going
to leave it in because this illustrates
exactly the problem with the drive
violations if there's a very easy chance
you're going to forget something and
maybe have it missed but maybe something
like a linter could catch this but then
you kinda have to parse arbitrary human
readable dates and times wouldn't count
on it but time element either way by
this a lot of things and you can do all
kinds of cool stuff with the time
element mark up you can mark up years
like the copyright right of a page you
can mark up your months like email lists
or blog archives how many how many of
you have a blog have a blog okay few
folks you also have a blog so i'll
publish so publishing is good birth
dates so you can omit the year and just
have the month in the day you can also
mark up durations and length and like
longer lengths as well whether seconds
or minutes and seconds HTML time element
is very versatile okay the second
element the data element super cool so
we had this pattern in microformats
called the value class pattern value
title they were you had to use one span
to say hey this is an element yet to use
another span saying classical value
title and then use a title attribute
essentially it was this giant hack to
present a way to provide machine
readable information that's the
equivalent of human readable information
when the two are just too different to
reconcile in this case I picked a really
simple example and showed you how we're
able to use the data elements for
latitude and longitude to represent the
decimal latitude and also the decimal I
mean the human readable latitude and
then decimal longitude and then the
human readable a more conventional
so you do that with just class and value
I'm the value is all you need with the
data element the class gives you this
for like a Geo microformat so you can do
that whole thing there and in fact you
can do this like this is like on
Wikipedia today you'll see visible the
latitude/longitude in degrees minutes
seconds but they mark it up so that you
can get it out and get out of with
microformats I don't think Wikipedia is
using data element yet but they could be
and this is what they should be doing if
they do question so right now the
question was our browsers doing anything
with rendering like either the daytime
element like depending on presentation
and all that for Europe or the US or are
they doing anything with fletch and
longitude not yet I'll talk about more
about that later but you talked about
like the International aspects and
that's that's actually a really good
reason like most folks are publishing
one version of website for the entire
world and the ISO date this year month
day is the most internationally readable
form of the date-time so if you have any
fraction of international visitors you
should really consider using isolates
rather than us dates or European dates
especially please avoid using two digit
years seriously then we learned that
lesson like 13 years ago yeah okay I
know right someone said Cobalts coming
back okay so that's latitude launch
that's a data element simple stuff it's
really handy this brings us to
microformats to all right I already told
you little bit about microformats tube
but this is the basic summary like it
really is this simple we're using prefix
class names for the root microphone mic
last name and then for the properties p
dash you dash dt d and e dash and these
all have to do with not necessarily
types of data but how we parse it so
simple properties URL properties date
and time properties and embedded markup
embedded content properties the second
change i made from recommends to is
every object is just a flat set of
properties we don't have sub properties
it's like you have an H card and then
you've got a bunch of properties of the
H card and that's it to do hierarchy we
do nesting so if you have an H event
that has
p location if you want to further
structure that location like as an
address or as a venue like you want to
say this events Adobe 601 Townsend San
Francisco California you use a nested
microformat to do that finally a single
class markup for common uses and I
showed you a few examples of that where
a single class name like H card or each
event or each product could be used to
mark up the common cases of a person's
name name of a product that's been
linked or perhaps an image of a product
that's been linked all the documentation
for microformats to is on mark from SL
org slash wiki / microformats to you can
check it out there each little
capillaries are linked from there as
well so that's the summary alright let's
talk about implementations because
microformats too has a defined parsing
model because it's generic we've already
got numerous parsers that are being used
actively now on websites the most
commonly used one is the PHP one turns
out a lot of websites are back ends are
built and PHP a lot of folks consuming
microformats are now doing so with the
PHP microformats to parser it's
excellent secondly there's the
JavaScript parsers there's both parsers
for browser extensions and a nodejs
microformats to parser as well and
lastly there's the Ruby microformats
parser as well we're hoping to see a
Python one anyone here code in Python
few folks a couple of folks okay I would
actually suggest starting with the PHP
one importing it because it's the most
complete has the biggest test suite and
is really well done the others are in
progress as well make incremental e
improve all the time but the development
community around the PHP microformats to
parser is amazing and they're doing
great work okay so here's I've been
talking about the microphone Methos your
API as providing the simplest cheapest
dry API here's a simple example this
this web page this is the Mozilla web
forward experts or mentors webpage and
we've got images and a little card for
each person that's that is a mentor
their name the description their photo
all of that is also mark marked up with
microformats too so if you look at this
from a data perspective this is what it
looks like
this is the canal club JSON
representation of this page by parsing
it with a generic microformats two-part
sure you get a list of items and each of
those items says what type of item it is
is it's in this case it's an H card and
what properties that has like name URL
note category photo etc perfect for
consumption and doing something within
your web app so if you have a web app
that consumes a list of people and does
something with it you can use this
immediately right and you can use it
with any site that publishes information
about people or lists of people this
gets brings me to the most recent like
amazing development with microformats to
usage especially from an ecosystem
perspective of publishers and consumers
so a lot of the cases I've been talking
about with microformats have been many
publishers publish and the few consumers
consume like search engines right we
don't have that many search engines we
have lots of people with websites very
few search engines this the indie web
however every single website is a
potential publisher and a potential
consumer and that's kind of cool what
this means is that we get things like
any websites that are publishing not
just blog posts not just notes but
replies to notes so this is aaron
parecki website aaron parecki com he
posted a small note it looks like a
tweet right but it's on his own site he
posted a small note as a reply to
laurens post on ash new comm and what he
did was when he posted this he put in
his little blog we said I'm replying to
this reply post his blog posting
software went and parsed the original
content that he's replying to extract it
out the H entry for the entire post the
h card for the poster with their photo
name URL took the whole thing dt
published and incorporated it as into
the context of his post some of you
might have seen this kind of thing on
twitter or if you at reply you reply to
a post right you go to your you go to
the permalink for your at reply well you
see you see the original tweet above it
okay well this this presentation has
been adopted now by independent websites
and we're not doing this it's all
working because he's publishing
microformats too and he's consuming
microformats too
different software different solutions
both using microphones to parsers and
making it work so let me show you the
original post this is Lawrence original
post where you said testing etc etc this
is that comment that he left right so
i'll go back aaron parecki says at ash
new it worked now here's the reply
here's his comment so in the same way we
got federated indie web comments working
automatically through microformats too
because Aaron also published his post
was H entering hcard lawrence original
post was able to pull that in syndicated
copy it and show with his presentation
now you'll notice there's lots of slight
differences in presentation here they
look very different but because they're
based on the same data the contents are
the same and that's pretty cool okay
peer-to-peer web commenting the
notification is based on a small
protocol called web mention that's based
that's that's essentially a
simplification of pingback if anyone's
curious about that particular aspect of
it but the data is all passing both
directions using microformats to not to
be content with just commenting I mean
distributed commenting that's no big
deal right we're all doing that now it's
actually a huge deal and it didn't start
happening until april of this year it's
like three months old it's awesome it's
exciting if you want to check out look
at and look up indie web camp calm if
yorkers more about how that works not
even a month ago wow we did this thing
in indie web camp we've come up with the
idea of well if we can do comments back
and forth why can't we do events as well
so this is aaron parecki again posting a
reply but an RSVP reply to an event post
that's also on an indie web site and
he's posted this with a micro format for
an RSVP in response to this micro format
for an event okay he's saying he's not
attending but again he includes the
context of the event the summary where
it was posted all that location on in
his post permalink on his site if we
look at the event post here's the event
post on Ben wertmueller site and you can
see that an
Rocky's post came through here it said
rsvp'd no again a difference in
presentation because the semantics are
communicated with microformats back and
forth so where does that bring us okay
which microformats to vocabularies can
you use today this is pretty cool like
this is the stuff that's actually
already supported with the new
microformats to syntax and vocabulary
not just with classic microformats
addresses hadr for structure addresses
hcard for any kind of contact
information about information authors of
blog posts show you a few examples that
each entry every blog post we've marked
up with H entry there are already
wordpress themes that do it so if if you
have a wordpress blog anyone have a
wordpress blog ok then you can
immediately deploy this if you either
update your your your template your
theme or edit your seem to include those
class names h event for events and then
one of the key microformats that's been
adopted for this back and forth indie
web federated commenting rsvping system
is well in reply to so that's how an
original post can tell hey is this route
is this post that's linking to me more
than just a mention more than just a
ping back is it a comment is it an
actual reply if it is that it links back
with well equals in reply to on the
hyperlink back to the original post and
that's pretty cool so as I mentioned for
more information on how those examples
of consuming and publishing microformats
work check out indie web camp com
there's the indie at indie web camp
twitter as well and finally if you're on
IRC on freenode where a lot of this
development happens there's the hashtag
indie web camp a channel on freenode
that's pretty cool this brings me to a
little more of a forward-looking point
and I want to talk about it was
forward-looking until recently just a
few weeks ago Mozilla officially
launched Firefox OS phones Eastern
Europe few other countries like Spain
and such and one of the things we've
been working on is what are the ways
that we can consume data like
microformats from the web and provide
additional functionality users this
isn't launched yet we're working on this
so like I said it's a little forward
looking but it matches you will you
to a website it's got contact
information you're on a mobile phone you
don't want to fuss with copy and pasting
all that contact information your
address book wouldn't it be nice if the
browser suggested hey why don't I want
me to add this contact your contacts
application or do you only add these
events to your calendar and suggested it
that way right Mozilla's working on this
but that doesn't mean everyone anyone
else can't either I wanted to announce
this to you guys because that's giving
you one more additional reason to
include this kind of markup on your
pages and those are just two examples
right of really obvious use cases for
contacts and events there's many more
coming yes question right so the
question was so in this kind of
environment the browser wouldn't need
extensions to do it but would be
natively presenting these things yes
that's that's the goal we want to build
in this support to the browser for the
data types that makes sense for the user
and two obvious ones we see our contacts
in events another one that's obvious is
any geo markup or any ad our markup
should give you a hint hey here's a
location shall I map it for you that
kind of thing right and that would be
quite handy on a mobile device you don't
want to do lots of keystrokes you don't
want any lots of gestures you want the
device to anticipate what you might want
to do and provide you those options and
that's one of the things we're working
on so I'm pretty excited about that too
okay we can do Q&amp;amp;A now but before I go
into QA I figure when we do an FAQ I get
some really really frequent questions
about my microformats the first of which
is well ok which fun which microformats
should i use I've heard I for all these
lists give me an overview I want to do
all the right things from my site and
it's not it's non-trivial but the first
thing you should do is for every page
you have use one classic microformat for
whatever the main subject of that pages
and the reason is is that that's what
right now the search engines will see in
detect and represent in in rich snippets
right search engines don't look for
multiple microformats on the page really
what they do is they want to know ok how
can I show you what this one page is
about it's a summary kind of thing and
so that's why you should use at least
one classic microformat now in addition
to that for all the data on the page use
microformats to to mark it up
where you're providing your API that
canonical JSON output that you were
seeing that back and forth indie web
consumption production ecosystem that
you're seeing finally if you are
building your site and you really need
site-specific link previews you guys
know what that means I think previews a
few nodding heads so like when you go
into Facebook and type in a URL and it
shows you something about that link or
on Twitter when you paste the URL and it
shows you like an expanded version of
maybe an image or summary from that page
these are the ways to do that so for
facebook there's Open Graph protocol
meta tags and for Twitter there's a
Twitter cards meta tags as well both of
these are somewhat site-specific and
therefore you should be using them in
addition to microformats which are
consumed by lots of different sites
rather than instead of so always support
the microformats for your site and then
if you need to get site specific link
previews you can do so with those
technologies now of course once you
start doing that once you add
information to the meta tags you have to
be careful that your data stays
consistent so whatever source you're
getting it from whatever checks and
balances you have for making sure that
your data because it's consistent be
sure to check that your Twitter cards
your GP and your micromax data visible
on the page are all consistent so that's
just one morning there okay second
question I get asked very often great
I've added my microformats now how do I
validate them right how do i check to
make sure that they're doing what i
think that they're doing there's a
really nice interactive microformats
parser on pin 13 net if you go there you
can type in your URL it'll give you the
nice little clean JSON output so you can
quickly see am I getting the data that I
think I'm getting for my page it's
pretty cool the other thing the other
tool you can use to see specifically
what is Google doing with my
microformats there's the Google Rich
Snippets testing tool now it doesn't
support all microformats it just
supports the ones that Google is
currently interested in showing us rich
snippets but that list continually grows
so it's a good place to check as well
finally there's the operator plug-in or
add-on for firefox that has a very nice
debug mode and this is useful for local
debugging so if you've got a local HTML
page you're editing and you want to see
what it looks like or you
got some HTML generated as a result some
JavaScript you can use the operator tool
for Firefox turn on debug mode and it'll
show you okay what data is it coming
getting from what microformats lastly I
hired some questions before the
presentation about like how do i create
a new microphone matter how would I get
involved how do I could provide feedback
and there's basically you know three
different ways to do that the first is
check out read and edit contribute to
the microphone matts wiki someone I was
speaking to earlier wanted to develop a
wine microformat for marking up
different varietals different ways that
people publish wine information the web
great let's start with documenting how
people publish wine information let's
see if you know other existing wine
formats we can reuse we can leverage we
do all that kind of work on the
microformats wiki we keep it open we
keep it in the public domain for maximum
reuse second we have a microphone max
Twitter as well and and most importantly
a lot of the discussions about
microformats happen on the IRC channel
on on the pound side microformats
channel on freenode question over here
the question was really if you want to
send data to the browser why not just
use custom tags to the browser and then
change that with presentation on the
client side which you can do with even
CSS right as of html5 you can pretty
much use any tag name you want that's
not in the spec and it'll do something
you can apply CSS to it so sorry or any
angular I don't okay I don't know what
angular is what is it Jessie okay yes
you can use XML markup like that in your
in your HTML and the problem is twofold
first that was definitely tried there
are some limitations with using tags for
mark up the biggest thing is that a tag
can only have one name I'll say that
again a tag can only have one name a
class can have multiple class names
that's super important so if for example
the same element contains information
about the name
the URL the photo other attributes of
the from of a micro format you can't do
that with XML you can't do that with
custom tags you have to use either class
attribute or you have to use nested tags
in which case you're applying some some
odd semantics of like well what does it
mean to have you know one of those
inside the other okay it's just markup
ironically doesn't work well for marking
up arbitrary data it's one of those
ironies or tags don't won't work well
the second problem is every time the
solutions have been tried where it's
like make up a bunch of tags and publish
that stuff you end up with everyone
making up their own tags you end up with
Tower of Babel problem and the whole
point of communicating things with
microformats is interoperability and so
you have to agree on what the names are
I'm there's a there's a pretty involved
process for going through and saying hey
now that we've figured out here the
concepts for a new Micra format how do
we name these and how do we come to
agreement of names so that when we're
talking about the same thing we know we
are talking about the same thing so
that's a pretty big challenge there
might be other ways to use XML I mean I
think it's a I think it's a great way to
experiment but I haven't found a lot of
folks actually mixing xml and HTML 5 and
making it work has anyone here had done
that like deployed systems that use it I
maybe I should learning about it because
I'm always looking to hear about
alternatives and and trying to figure
out like you know what's what's going on
like what advantages of those
alternatives bring or disadvantages etc
all right thank you for your time happy
to present here I'm going to now go over
to the etherpad to see what kind of
other questions we've got
okay lady who is consuming microformats
two in the wild yet lulz yes I'm
guessing that might be from Twitter okay
let's see the biggest consumers of
microformats to right now are I believe
spinners consuming them I hate to double
check with them last time I talked to
Kevin Burton he said they were consuming
it also i'm like okay that sounds good
and every single indie web site that's
deployed which is probably only about
like a dozen or so that are actually
consuming them actively right now but
everyone that's that's there's a
wordpress plugin so everyone that
installs that wordpress plugin to get
those indie web comments to work is
consuming microformats too and again
that's one use case but it's one of
those things that i'm going to expect to
see taking off quite rapidly one of the
things we saw late last year is is that
Google started parsing h-atom we didn't
see any announcement from them saying
hey we're parsing h-atom now what they
did they started parsing h-atom and they
started having it show up not just in
the Google Webmaster dashboard but also
in their rich snippets tester now I
don't know how that changes the display
of Google results whether they started
publishing it and they started they
started consuming it in parsing it just
because there's so much out there right
namely if you look at WordPress blogs
the default themes have included h-atom
for a couple of years now at least so it
makes sense them to do so I figure
there's probably like some sort of
threshold where if there's a certain
amount of some markup published in the
web google will try to do something
intelligent with it and they're probably
constantly running queries running
analysis on like what kind of markup is
taking off or not taking off and if it
crosses some threshold they say well can
we do something useful with it they're
usually fairly practical about that kind
of thing so that's that's one question
do we only have one question any other
questions and I think we have a
microphone as well yes here in the front
row 1 comment following up on the XML
versus the class names thing
you know I don't know how long let's go
maybe five six years ago jquery became
popular and it would probably be i'm
glad there's a job as crypt parser for
meez microformats but it would be
mindlessly simple to do it with
something like jquery and so i think
these things dub tail it's just a kind
of a comment I don't know if you have
any response to that you know that tools
like jQuery make it very easy to parse
out things yeah and if you come up with
these very very consistent standards
like this that are flexible where you
can have things like multiple class
names and all that I think it becomes
very easy just kind of a comment that
you know I've done all sorts of crazy
stuff with xml and HTML and again I
think I've run into a lot of the things
that you have cool yeah I think that's
true like the more the more libraries
that we can publish an open source for
the stuff especially with JavaScript it
seems like JavaScript has taken off and
it's becoming the dominant way to do
things whether on the clients or on the
server with uh with node right there's
even like what script google com where
you can run hosted JavaScript's as well
on the server they've got their own
server environment where you can do that
cool stuff yes over here one second
let's get to the microphone so why
aren't there 300 microformats out there
now that we're all consuming and
publishing already I'm new to this
particular topic the short answer is
vocabulary is are hard yeah but they're
not that hard i mean a lot of every are
a lot of other standards have come and
risen in the last ex many years why is
this one not taken off even for
something specific like like wine for
for music mark up for some things like
that music markup has been a tough one
actually believe it or not and there's
there's there's a lot of there's a lot
of forces at play there there was an H
audio like a format that was developed
and I think as part of that experience
we learned how how Mike Rafael apin
shouldn't be developed and it really
taught us that one of the things what
lessons we learn from that is that email
list just don't work for for standards
development for vocabularies you end up
with a disproportionate
amount of the amount of contribution or
maim email from like one person versus
who can actually read all the email and
that's why we've switched to an i
receiver is RC and wiki based model
there but it turns out there's for a lot
of these types of content there's just
not that much of it or not that much
that people want to research and
document on the web it's easy to make up
300 microformats give me like hey I know
how to publish this information I'll
just make up a microphone mat for the
fields of it what's harder is to
actually follow a scientific process of
weight let's look at what information is
actually published today because if
people don't have the incentive to
publish information currently a micro
format for it isn't going to really
change that information so you're not
going to get adoption and that's that's
the key the second piece is that we try
really hard to leverage existing
standards for data formats so for
example you know one of the one of the
popular ones that comes up as genealogy
there's a popular genealogy standard
called called gedcom it's not make 60ml
standard but it's it is a standard for
exchanging that information and people
have been tried marking that up with
microformats but there just hasn't been
that much uptake of it right there's
lots of different types of data out
there that could be marked up the key
set the key part of that is in order to
make it useful to get adoption there has
to be research and be like hey how are
people publish this data are their
existing standards we can leverage can
we combine those two pieces of
information what are people publishing
what existing vocabularies are there and
then create a micro format and that's
just hard enough that we've only got
about doesn't like I said different
successful microformats and by
successful I mean both widely deployed
being published and being consumed right
there's there's many more that are being
published and that's um that's use
that's interesting but it's not as
useful as as formats are published and
consumed yes question Oh back there
first ok sorry microphone it's to pick
thank you I think you might have
answered my question following to the
previous question is in my experience
with the micro formats and a lot of
formats like dt DS and things from xml
it's it's it's very
very challenging to get a community to
come to an agreement on that format and
you were talking about that for four
microformats and that's one of the
things that sort of you know that I'm
interested in is what is and maybe
you've answered this you know what is
the one thing that the community
community could do to drive adoption of
a specific microformat so what's what's
the one thing that community can do to
drive adoption of a specific microformat
I would say to keep the microphone mat
as simple as possible so a lot of a lot
of standards design there's a temptation
to include as much as possible into the
standard and the thing we've seen with
microformats the ones they've taken off
are the ones that are the simplest and
that that that are the most useful so
even if you think hey I want to add 20
different fields of this microformat
because I am pretty sure they're all
going to be useful you know cut that
number in half add what you think are
the 10 most popular fields the 10 most
types of information about some objects
that are being published today get
experience with how are people
publishing that and then where does it
fall short and that's what we tell
people most people that come to my
currents be like hey I have a great idea
for a new microphone Matt we're like
great what existing microformats are
using today and they're usually like
well none of them like okay get some
experience if you want to learn how to
create a new Micra format that that will
get adopted you need to yourself feel
like get the experience of using a
microphone Matt to figure out okay
what's easy about using microformats and
what's harder so that you can develop a
good microformat for consumption does
that help answer your question okay cool
it's a very tough question I mean that's
adoption is a huge challenge for
anything yes most of the existing
formats that have gotten hammered into
unity have had to go through some sort
of pipe such as a small browser
community mobile devices databases I
mean you don't have a huge amount of
sequel variation mainly because there's
been sequel engines that have consumed
it worse Michael for microformats main
consumer is their own web page so you
don't really have the same sort of
pipe forcing unity and a micro format
that you do a true format I mean not not
to be mean but true format like XML or
sequel the question was I think you
don't have as much uniformity pushing
for a microphone that one of the things
that you get with the generic syntax of
microformats to go back to the summary
page here the prefix class name is the
generic syntax is that anyone can start
publishing class names with these with
these prefixes and they'll automatically
get parsed using the existing parsers so
we have a convention saying hey if you
want to create your own data markup for
a page you can actually put H dash and
then we've said okay use a use a prefix
inside that likes h h dash x dash
whatever you want to start creating new
data objects new properties if you have
a specific community that's got their
own vocabulary like there's the Activity
Stream standard and how many of you
familiar with activity streams extension
to add them a few folks okay some of us
on the indie web are publishing h dash a
s dash microformats in addition to the
common vocabularies for exactly that
reason we're like hey we don't know if
these are going to work as like common
microformats but let's start
experimenting with extensions with
microphones for the page that'll work
really well for common microformats one
of the things you might have noticed
with a lot of these a lot of you know
which microformats should i use h80 are
all the vocabulary of hadr is from the
vcard standard we didn't make up any of
it each card is all based on H dash
cards all based on v card for again the
vocabulary was created somewhere else we
took it we took the subset that it
seemed was useful for the web and we
said let's just use it as is right
invent as little as possible we use the
hard work that other people have done
before you H entry largely reuses Adam
semantics almost always you be used in
the terms from Adam as well H event is
straight from I calendar so those are
familiar with that standard and that's
that's one of the ways we've been able
to get so much progress with
microformats is that we've been we try
to be as disciplined as we can and as
almost conservative with inventing new
vocabulary rellin reply to is a new
thing and some of those vocab as i
showed you early on like h review there
was no good review standard there was a
few attempts at some but nothing had
taken off so that was a lot of work to
come up with the vocabulary like a
minimal vocabulary for a review it
definitely as a challenge and I think
there's a lot of room for
experimentation especially now that we
have the generic syntax question over
here yeah authentic said Kevin is Kevin
yes oh hey um you didn't mention well
tag I thought you thought you might want
to comment on that as well you didn't
mention rel tag yes well Kevin I worked
together coke found in co-creating
microformats and at technorati as well
where we helped develop this micro
format called rel tag I maybe you're
familiar with relic was tagged a few
folks here there okay and for as long as
technorati was a blog search engine we
parsed rel tags within blog posts on
pages and applied them to the post not
to the whole page and the rel the rel
tag value was an exception that regard
almost all rail values and at this point
now according to the html5 standard all
real values apply to the whole page from
the page there on to the page they're
linking to and real tag was an exception
to that we supported that and then
another service call tweet when I say we
start technorati supported that back
then and ice rocket another blog search
engines supported that now as far as i
can tell me that neither of those are
actually block search engines anymore or
if they are they searched a very small
number of blogs and they no longer use
their previous code bases so despite we
coming out with rel tag despite coming
out with multiple implementations for it
it's a micro format that got published
and now linkers on in pages but there's
no one really consuming it
as far as we know unless you know of
someone Kevin yeah we were using it we
were using rel tag as part of reviews
one of the one of the feedback we got
was that it's too complicated like when
do I use a rel versus a property and all
that so we made everything properties
right so we said okay p dash category
there's your there's the way to like tag
things right now simple text and that's
that's kind of where that's ended up
back there two questions one when do you
think the H product standard will be
ready for microformats two point oh and
what's the best way to tag hidden data
or data you don't want to specifically
show on the page maybe because it's is
displayed in a way that would not be
picked up by microformats first things
first you said products right yeah
correct let's see if this is there I
thought maybe it was so if you if you go
to microphone as the org slash wiki / H
dash product you will see a full example
in list of vocabulary for publishing H
product information in microphone rats
too that should answer the first
question second question can you repeat
the question sorry I'm on like really
short memory right now because I flew
from flu time ten time zones yesterday
well it's ready to publish the questions
it wasn't listed on with the format's
rate to use today the format's i listed
switch tabs there we go these are all
being consumed today as well okay you
can publish any of the microphone that's
two vocabularies immediately we've got
all the Specht out for publishing right
away and those work with existing
parsers so no as far as we know no one
in the wild is yet parsing microformats
to h product that's right
what's that google shop we don't know we
do know they are parsing the classic
microformat H product so at least what
you should do like / that advice of like
you know which um let's see here we go
if on pages that represent a single
product you should still use H product
so that it gets picked up by the search
engines but there's no harm and also I
know microformats to mark up for it so
that any micromass two partners that
come along will support as well and
since the parsers for microformats two
are now more actively developed and
being used by sites that consume
microformats we expect to see the growth
there rather than the classic ones oh
that was the last question right what's
what's the good way to markup it and
data haven't found it yet what's the use
case so the question really is about
what do you do with information that you
have to present like once globally to a
search engine versus information that
you don't have to present the user to a
user of a website who has already said
hey I'm in this country or this state or
I've chosen this color or this
availability correct it's a good
question I think clearly for the for the
crawler case you need to mark it all up
and put it all on the page right yeah so
if a user were to come to that page
directly like let's say they search for
the product on google and it was because
it's crawled it comes up in the search
results they click on that they come to
your site for the first time there
immediately prompted with what market
they're in even today there before they
see the page there's and then the page
reloads and it shows what blog reloads
if whether or not the products in stock
or out of stock is there some affordance
on that page to change what market
they're in there is it's a little drop
down in the top menu but my guess is it
probably still shows their current state
right we try to guess based on their IP
but we still prompt them to confirm that
that's the state they're in right but
once you prop them and they've said okay
me that little drop down probably shows
their current state correct so it's
still visible yes so you could mark it
up there good that's true but we want
just when the crawler hits the page we
only we don't have that logic going for
the growler's it's just just it defaults
to California because that's where I
main warehouse is that's cool yeah i
think in either one of those cases you
can mark it up either it's it part of
the the UI for the drop-down or it's
part of the page would you ever use like
hidden inputs or meta tags i would try
to avoid those because those tend to get
out of sync anything that you hide from
the user and tends to get out of sync
that's looking that's been our
experience over time you know meta
keywords is sort of like the classic
example of that yeah all right thank you
all right maybe one more question Oh
what we got one win the back there
someone who hasn't asked yet so let's it
hi I had a couple of questions maybe a
really basic ones um so you showed a
slide but I think you were recommending
to use classic microformats in the body
yeah so is the is micro data considered
a classic microformat it's not okay
microdata is another way another syntax
for marking up items on microformat on
an HTML and that's a see if I can go to
that slide by the way this entire
presentation is on the web it's all
built in html5 CSS and JavaScript so any
of you presenting out there this is the
SF html5 group I want to strongly
encourage you to also do your
presentations in html5 right we should
be able to eat our own dog food yes yeah
that's in sound very encouraging yes yes
yes html5 it works for presentations
okay so with microdata you have to
actually use i'm not going to go through
a whole example but there's about five
different attributes you need to use
to mark that up you can use similar
vocabularies as microformats but the
syntax is much bigger to do so and you
have to figure out which attributes to
use for what purpose and all that as
well so in our experience most web
developers have preferred to use
microformats because just easier it's
less work okay so if if I just started
learning microdata and went through the
trouble of adding all this microdata
markup to my site and now i want to
start adding the micro formats to is it
recommended to just replace it with the
microformats too or just leave both
together so that's that's kind of your
choice if you've already got macro dead
are you working on your site it's less
work to just leave it right you could
add microformats too in addition to the
work you've already done and that should
work just fine and does that help it
gives you that API that I was talking
about I see ya so it definitely helps
there the other thing is that if we go
back to that question on some search
engines it may give you that you know
main subject kind of functionality so
what you can do is since you've gone to
the effort of putting in microdata you
can leave it there you can at you can
still add the classic microformat on
body as well and then add microformats
to for your for your JSON data support
for all the data on your web page yeah
it should be a lot less work than it was
to add the Micro data like a fraction of
the work yeah if it's not get online and
ask no problem and that was the last
question right it was run a real quick
question yeah real quick question okay
what is the actual syntax for the
classic Parker format on the body tag
like whoa the code actually looked like
for marking what's the actual syntax for
market is so the you can just use the
class attribute on the body tag
how do you indicate the subject the
subject is the root class name so if the
page is about a person you would say
class equals v card which is the root
class name for an H card if the subject
is a event you say class equals V event
the classic if the subject is a product
class equals H product H review etc so
whatever whatever is the subject is the
mean is the main microformat that you
use there and there were there was a
here see so here's an example of a
complete geo microformat right so you
can imagine if a page is just about
single onto latitude longitude point you
could put body class equals geo at the
top level that's an example
alright I'm going to leave these slides
the URL to the slides is up here it's
just it's I'll read it out loud for the
presentation as well telecom /
