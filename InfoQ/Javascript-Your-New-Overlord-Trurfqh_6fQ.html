title they you deserve an explanation
so in 2001 I discovered the json data
interchange format the world's best club
data interchange format four years later
it became an overnight sensation because
of the ajax revolution two years later I
was asked to keynote at XML 2007 in
Boston okay what am I gonna tell them
you guys are deeply emotionally attached
to the wrong technology your technology
is making your lives much more difficult
you have no idea how miserable you are
you need to I think nobody wants to hear
that
right you know even if it's true you
know but you you don't want to hear that
so I suggested instead of doing a
keynote let's do a panel you know and
we'll put a couple other guys on so I
can just say the truth and they can say
things that are familiar and comforting
and everybody can hear what they want to
hear and we'll all have a pleasant
evening so so that's what we did the
first question I was asked was does XML
have a future I said well of course it
does because once something gets into
the enterprise it can take decades to
get rid of it so you know there's still
shops that are running COBOL so I got to
figure we're gonna be stuck with XML for
a long long time so we finished the
panel and during the QA one of the
delegates stood up and said we welcome
our JSON overlords okay so it's now five
years later and I'm at a Java conference
keynoting about JavaScript
incidentally last year I met a guy who
was working at a major university and he
said they're still doing COBOL there and
they're hoping maybe someday they can
migrate to Java I said well that must be
like working at Colonial Williamsburg
and he didn't think it was funny oh this
is how we churn the butter and this is
how we prepare the quarterly divisional
expense forecast reports so anyway I'm
here to talk about JavaScript the
world's most misunderstood programming
language it has been misunderstood from
the very beginning and this
understanding continues to expand you
know it's people think all sorts of
crazy things about it particularly that
it's Java's little brother that's still
people who think it's a subset of Java
whether it's interpreted Java which
doesn't make sense because Java is
interpreted Java it's a different
language with a weird history so it has
become the world's most popular
programming language they're more people
writing today in JavaScript than
anything else you could argue most of
those people should not be writing in
any language and you're probably right
but the fact is it's not Visual Basic
anymore that's JavaScript that's that's
who's doing it at the same time it is
the world's most unpopular programming
language in the sense that if you asked
any group of programmers what language
do you hate the most by far the most
common answer is going to be JavaScript
now include people who have never used
it who hate it simply because it has
become more popular than their favorite
language and it includes a lot of people
who are using JavaScript themselves
because they have some fundamental
misunderstanding about it for example
most web developers hate JavaScript
because of the Dom which is the API that
the browser presents to JavaScript which
is not JavaScript if you're the DOM is
one of the most hateful API is ever
invented so if you were to take your
favorite programming language remove all
the standard libraries replace them with
the Dom you would hate that language and
that's sort of the state of the art and
the browsers right now
one source of misunderstanding is that
javascript is a language that people
will use without learning at first which
is a mistake that you would not make in
any other language you know okay I'll
write this in JavaScript but there is no
way I'm going to know what I'm doing and
and people feel good about that
you know out of principle I'm just not
going to know what I'm doing
javascript is the only language that
people will make this mistake about all
other languages you got to know what
you're doing and it's true in this one
too it's just it happens to be more
forgiving than most languages so give us
a little historical context y'all
remember 1995 that's when Java appeared
Java applets look like they're going to
take over the world there was huge
interest at that time in Java applets
and how they were going to destroy
Microsoft Java applets were the biggest
failure in the history of software this
is not generally well remembered in the
Java community but it is true it flat on
its face
total failure Java applets they don't
exist anymore in the web Java exists
mainly as a attack vector it's not used
for application delivery anymore so
another thing that happened in 1995 was
Netscape they had at that moment in time
the most successful IPO in history they
had a browser that was cloned from
something that was developed in Illinois
and no business plan and they and they
shopped way up thank you
so Netscape in and some were both
promising that they had new platforms
that were going to destroy Microsoft and
they decided they should probably work
together otherwise Microsoft would play
them off against each other and they
both lose
Netscape agreed with sun that they
should put java into their browser
because you know why not
they also remembered HyperCard which was
something that had been popular 10 years
before hypercard was this amazing thing
developed by Bill Atkinson at Apple
which allowed for non-programmers to
write very sophisticated event-driven
applications and Marc Andreessen and
others that had Netscape wanted to do
the same thing to their browsers they
wanted beginners to be able to write
sophisticated applications that would
run in the browser and they knew that
Java was not the language that would let
them do that because a beginner cannot
write HelloWorld in Java you need way
too much knowledge just to get started
they want something with a much lower
barrier to entry so they hired this guy
this is Brendan Eich this is the guy
who's responsible for javascript he was
a kernel hacker at Silicon Graphics but
he was had a big interest in programming
languages at the interview he mentioned
that he was getting to write an
interpreter in scheme because he want to
learn more about the scheme and how that
worked and he suggested that that might
be a good language for their browser
because scheme can be really small but
it's extremely powerful it's one of the
smartest programming languages ever
invented and the guys at Netscape was
wow this guy is really smart we should
hire him and have him do this now before
he started work somebody in that scape
found out what scheme was so on his
first day at work they said no you can't
do scheme people don't like scheme it's
got the parentheses and everything we
want a language that people like so make
it look like visual basic or Java
something popular so he threw away his
design started over created a new
language in ten days design
implementation in ten days in May of
1995 an amazing accomplishment but 10
days is way too short a time to develop
a programming language there's some
brilliant stuff in there a lot of
mistakes and very quickly as people
start using the language he lost the
ability to correct the mistakes and they
shipped it as it was which is pretty
awful that the code name of the project
was mocha at that time they were unable
to get a trademark clearance on it so
they had to change the name
so Brendan took syntax and some other
features from Java and also borrowed
features from Pascal and Perl those were
all generally very bad parts he took
some features from skiing took some
features from self these are two
research languages very highly regarded
among language designers but not well
known to the mainstream and was pretty
audacious for him to take features from
these research languages to put into a
language for beginners that was quite an
astonishing thing to do and the name of
that language initially was live script
son insisted that live script was an
embarrassment because the world only
needed one programming language from
that day on and that was Java and there
was no excuse for why this other
language was in there netscape refused
to remove the language both because java
didn't work for the mission they had
intended it to and because they couldn't
afford the engineering costs at that
late date so it looked like there was
going to be an impasse and their
alliance was going to break down when
Marc Andreessen suggested maybe as a
joke but they changed the name of the
language to JavaScript and that they
tell the world that it isn't a different
language it's just a subset of the other
language it's it's stupid little brother
and that'll be our story so netscape and
sun went out and intentionally lied
about what the language was and echoes
of those lies are still going on today
and one other wrinkle son said well okay
but as long as it has the word java in
its name we own the trademark and so
they took control of that and gave
netscape a license to use that trademark
Microsoft took notice of these two
companies in California that were
getting ready to destroy it so they
decided we need to get into the browser
game so they bought spyglass and started
work on Internet Explorer 1
and reverse-engineered jscript and they
did the most careful professional
detailed disciplined bit of reverse
engineering that has ever been done at
Microsoft
they found every bug every error every
design defect that Brendan had put into
javascript documented them and
replicated them and they couldn't call
it javascript because that was a son
trademark and they weren't getting along
the son very well at that time so they
called it jscript Netscape took notice
of that thought oh my God we're gonna
get embraced and extended we need to get
a standard they went to w3c and said we
invented this programming language would
you like to standardize it turns out w3c
had been waiting for an opportunity to
tell Netscape to go to hell so they told
Netscape to go to hell they went to ISO
they went all over eventually they went
to the European computer Manufacturers
Association ACMA and ACMA agreed to make
a standard out of it but if the first
committee meeting Microsoft took control
of the process and insisted that every
one of those errors that they so
carefully discovered and documented goes
into the standard and so that happened
they also had to come up with a new name
for the standard because javascript was
a trademark of Sun and so they couldn't
use it for the standard so after a bunch
of false starts they eventually called
the standard Beckman
which is maybe the worst name ever put
on a programming language up until maybe
JavaFX script and and so there's still
confusion some people think that all of
these names represent different distinct
things but they're all synonyms it's
just three or four names for one silly
language so Netscape sort of self
destructed by 2000 eventually got bought
by AOL which they used for negotiating
leverage against Microsoft in 2000
George colony a Forrester Research
predicted that the web was about to die
another software tech
we'll come along and kill off the web
just as it killed news gopher at all and
that Judgment Day will arrive very soon
in the next two to three years not 25
years from now now if you go to
foresters website you can't find this
anymore but it is an archived org so so
colonies point was that system which did
nothing except deliver static pages
static documents was doomed that the
next step forward was going to be
something that is capable of delivering
applications what he called the X
Internet and Microsoft believed that so
they disbanded the IE team and put them
to work on Avalon to build that very
thing and a lot of other people did too
the surprising thing that happened was
that it turned out the browser was
always capable of doing application
delivery because it had JavaScript in it
and so javascript is succeeding not just
because it is in the browser the browser
survived because there was JavaScript in
it
and it worked so javascript should have
failed at that point when Netscape
failed but it didn't it survived
Netscape it it survived Microsoft's
expectation that its browser was going
to die because it had good parts in it
it wasn't just the opportunity thing it
wasn't just that it happened to be a
language that was in the browser Java
had already proven that that was not a
sufficient condition for victory that
there was actually a lot of goodness in
it now there's a lot of badness in it
too because it was done in ten days and
not properly tested so there's more
goodness in JavaScript and more badness
in JavaScript than maybe any other
language in most languages fall
somewhere more in the middle but it's
good parts are maybe the best parts ever
put into a programming language I'll
tell you about two of them one of them
is statically scoped first-class
functions with lexical closure this is
the thing that JavaScript learned from
scheme the scheme was a dialect of lisp
that was developed in order to explore
caryl Hewitt's actor model and scheme
accidentally discovered this the
consequences of having static scoping in
nested functions it turns out it's
incredibly powerful those of you who are
computer science guys should quickly
recognize this is the Y Combinator this
demonstrates that the lambda calculus is
capable of doing recursion not a lot of
practical value here but it demonstrates
that javascript is a functional language
so you know the best idea that was in
scheme is here
javascript didn't get it quite right in
the same way that it didn't get anything
quite right the biggest thing it's
missing is tail recursion hopefully
we'll get that fixed in the next edition
but functions are first-class it does
all the things that you want in a
functional programming language it's
brilliant the enormous expressive power
here so lambdas first got into
programming languages in 58 when
McCarthy developed Lisp at MIT got
perfected in scheme in the early 70s but
the mainstream never paid any attention
to it because we just couldn't get past
to the parentheses javascript is the
first language to take lambda to the
mainstream and that's an amazing
accomplishment it is no longer unique
there are a lot of other languages that
have followed JavaScript since then
including Python C sharp even PHP is now
doing lambdas there rumors that maybe
someday even Java will do this so
javascript is not just an OK language
it's actually become an influential
language it's something that language
designers are paying attention to the
other feature is prototypal inheritance
this is something that javascript got
himself an object in JavaScript is a
dynamic collection of key value pairs
and each object can have an inheritance
link to another object so if you try to
access a a property from an object it
doesn't have it you can go see if it
inherits it
from another object so instead of having
classes you simply have objects that
inherit from objects itself was a
dialect of small talk developed by Unger
and Smith at Xerox PARC and then later
at Sun labs which was exploring an
advancement on small talk some people
look at the prototype thing as being a
step backward it's actually a step
forward it has much more expressive
power than the classical model turns out
to be much easier to program because you
don't have to do the classification and
taxonomy that's required in class driven
systems that's all just avoided you just
make objects it's a more pure object
system it's very expressive you can very
easily emulate a classical system using
prototypes doing the opposite turns out
to be really hard so it's much easier to
write in a Java style in JavaScript than
it is to write in a Java Script style in
Java because JavaScript has more
expressive power it's actually the more
powerful of the two languages so one of
the amazing things about Java Script is
that it works for beginners that people
who have no knowledge about programming
are able to do interesting stuff so we
see a lot of designers a lot of web
people people with no formal training
and programming are getting a lot of
stuff done and because of its lambda
nature because of its prototypal nature
scientists are interested in this
language and they are doing really
sophisticated research in JavaScript and
everybody in between this is a enormous
range appealing to either of those
extremes is really hard meeting both of
those extremes at the same time is
unique there's no other language that's
able to do this one of the complaints
about JavaScript is that it is slow all
of the until recently all of the
JavaScript interpreters were optimized
for time to market and I was 10 or 15
years ago and have been patched and
crafted over since then so they were
just barely keeping up with Moore's law
but it turned out for most web
applications that doesn't matter
this is Microsoft's research on how
nature websites spend their time in the
browser you see most of the times going
to layout and rendering JavaScript only
taking up about three percent of the
time so if you were to take a javascript
interpreter and make it infinitely fast
you know squeeze that to zero most users
are not going to notice so there wasn't
a lot of pressure to make JavaScript
engines faster but that changed when
Google start working on v8 guys who come
out of the self project and the hot spot
project we're now working on making
javascript go faster for a while it was
thought that javascript needed a type
system in order to become a
high-performance language that turned
out not to be true it doesn't need a
type system it's fine the way it is
and so v8 started this competition
Firefox is in the competition apples in
the competition Microsoft is doing some
amazing work they're all making their
JavaScript engines much faster which
doesn't matter much for web applications
but it is making possible new classes of
applications which we're not feasible in
JavaScript before they are now becoming
feasible so we see JavaScript being used
in real time games and 3d visualization
things that you wouldn't do before in
JavaScript it turns out to be really
good at those things so as a result of
all this stuff we're seeing JavaScript
everywhere so it's clearly the language
of the browser and that's where it first
came into dominance but it's now in
operating systems it's a standard
feature in Windows and in Mac OS and
their new operating systems being
developed specifically to run JavaScript
things like web OS Chrome OS Firefox OS
and Windows 8 so javascript is finding a
privileged position in those systems
javascript is built into the best
databases now javascript is now finding
a new home in the server there's this
wonderful thing called nodejs
which takes the turn-based event
driven execution model that is in the
browser and putting that on the server
and that turns out to be brilliant to
get really efficient web servers out of
that but even better it means you can
now take one body of JavaScript code and
run it in the browser or run it in the
server or run it in the app so you don't
have to write the thing three times you
only have to run it once and put it
everywhere javascript is finding itself
in mobile it's the one programming
language which is available in all the
smart mobile devices and we're going to
see more of that it's even finding its
way into TV sets which i think is silly
because computer stuff tends to get
obsolete really fast but you expect a
big TV to last for many many years and
so having a quickly expiring component
in something that's supposed to be
long-lived
I think is ridiculous but javascript is
now finding its way into TVs and other
consumer electronics devices one thing
that we're starting to see emerging in
JavaScript now is high performance data
structures so nodejs there are buffer
arrays which allow for quickly moving
blobs through the system in JavaScript
so it can handle data in a
high-performance way we're seeing byte
arrays in browsers which can take data
and push it down into WebGL so that GPUs
can now have a high-performance
interface to JavaScript which allows for
very fast 3d graphics intel recently
demonstrated something that they call
parallel arrays where they've got an
immutable array that's full of
interesting values and it has
interesting methods like a Maps method
so you can pass a JavaScript method to
the map method of one of these arrays
and it will distribute the invocation of
that function across all of the cores
that are available to it so we can now
do very very fast multi-core operations
in JavaScript this won't be in the next
edition but hopefully will be in the
Edition after that
JavaScript's becoming a high-performance
language one of the problems with
javascript in particularly in the
browser it's is its performance problems
where I'm sorry it's security problems
and there's been some interesting work
there for example google's kaha is a
javascript to javascript compiler which
will add a lot of indirection and case
checking to make sure that a piece of
third-party code cannot break out of its
containment so that's the first step
towards solution of the mash-up problem
my own ad safe system does a similar
thing without the need for code
rewriting so it's a it's more efficient
but they're both both based on the same
capability model things that were
learned in the kaha and ad safe projects
were fed into the es 5 project so the
strict mode in other features in es5 are
there in order to help us make the
JavaScript a secure programming language
google's doing some really interesting
work advancing that idea something
called distributed resilient secure ECMO
script or dr. says which combines secure
JavaScript with the after model in a
fully distributed way which allows
JavaScript to migrate out into the cloud
and be the language that goes everywhere
with an inherently powerful security
mechanism built in really wonderful
stuff but the most amazing unexpected
thing is that JavaScript has become the
universal virtual machine we always
thought that the JVM would have that
role it turns out it's JavaScript it
turns out that the JavaScript parser
does a better job of code security than
the JVM bytecode verifier and because
it's a higher-level language it's
actually an easier thing to generate
code for so the first of these was
Google's web toolkit Google is
translating Java into JavaScript so that
it can run everywhere
amazing I don't really get this myself
because javascript is actually a better
language than Java is particularly for
the sorts of highly interactive
applications that we do on the web
and you don't get any of the benefit of
its good parts if you don't know that
you're in that language so as a result
but on the other hand there are a lot of
people who really like the idea of not
having to learn anything or change their
mind about stuff and wit is perfect
for people like that and so it's finding
a big following but it turns out there
are a lot of other languages that are
doing this too this is the most
interesting one for me this is something
that was developed at Princeton
SpiderMonkey is the JavaScript engine
that was developed at Mozilla it's the
thing that's in Firefox and it's written
in C++ you can give that to clang and it
will produce a LLVM file you give that
too and scripting it turns it into
JavaScript not very good JavaScript but
it's JavaScript it runs and it works and
then you give that to Google's closure
compiler which turns the crappy
JavaScript into better JavaScript
closure does heroic things and some kind
of terrible things in order to make the
code as small and as fast as possible so
then becomes feasible to run and that
produces something called J SJS which is
a true JavaScript emulator that is
written in JavaScript that runs in
JavaScript which has no dependencies on
any of the JavaScript environment yeah
it's amazing who would have thought you
could do this stuff so suddenly there
are a lot of new languages being
developed specifically to run in
JavaScript so there are over a hundred
of them the most interesting one is a
most influential one is CoffeeScript
CoffeeScript takes JavaScript removes
all the bad parts so it just keeps the
good parts of the language removes the
Java flavored syntax replaces that with
a brand new syntax which is really
lightweight really expressive and nice
it's been said that no language can
succeed unless it has curly braces and
looks like C and CoffeeScript is saying
no that's actually not
that you can come up with a wholly new
syntax without curly braces and without
semicolons and it's great and it's
inspiring a lot of other people to
develop variations on it and wholly new
languages a lot of interesting activity
there but even more surprising is that
all languages are now being translated
to JavaScript this is a subset of a lot
of the languages that are being done
some of these are not finished yet but
some of these have multiple professional
implementations like c-sharp and Java so
it's now a viable thing to take
languages and programs written in pretty
much any language and move them to
JavaScript so they can run everywhere
it's amazing so that's putting some
pressure on the design of the language
to become a better compilation target
javascript has a small number of control
structures and if you have a language
that doesn't exactly nap onto those
structures that the code you have to
generate is kind of awkward so they've
been demands for adding go-to to
JavaScript and that's something we don't
want to do because it took us a
generation to realize we didn't want it
and if we put it back in we can't put it
in just for the compiler writers because
the web developers will find out hey did
you know you can do go-to and then we'll
be stuck with it for at least another
generation so we don't want to do that
but we aren't going to add tail
recursion optimization in the next
edition which is great because it turns
out that if the last thing a function
does is return the result of calling
another function or itself you can
return change that jsr ret sequence into
a jump and jump as a go-to so it gives
us a very structured elegant way of
adding go to the language which also has
lots of other benefits allows us to do
continuation passing style and and other
things so that adds even more expressive
power to the language so unexpectedly I
mean nobody expected this javascript has
become the most important programming
language it's the most future facing of
everything that we've got nobody wanted
the
it just happened because it had all this
goodness in it and it and there was a
lot of luck too so I got to wrap up so
before I do I just want to say one thing
so a personal note I never wanted to be
the JavaScript guy and I wasn't like I
decided oh yeah that language that's the
thing I got to get behind that I got to
be someone who's known as knowing
something about that being advocate the
first time I saw JavaScript in 1995 I
thought this is the stupidest thing I've
ever seen I'd that and I was pretty
confident that I was right
five years later circumstance and having
spent twenty million dollars trying to
develop a Java client application that
took three minutes to load convinced me
that I needed to take another look at
JavaScript and in looking deeply at it I
discovered it's got lambdas in it um you
know and suddenly all this potential
opened up and so I started writing about
how this language is misunderstood and
and and I became the JavaScript guy and
I'm still not comfortable in that role
it's not still not what I ever wanted to
be but I seem to have been stuck with
this language and and that's likely to
continue because the language is
becoming even more important so this
isn't something I can get away from I
sincerely hope this is not the last
language that would make me really sad I
mean there there are there languages
that we see that are quite amazingly
wonderful I love closure I love Scala I
would like to see those succeed but both
of them have really high barriers to
entry and so they're not available to
the mainstream in the way that
javascript is I hope somebody else can
figure out how to make a language which
is really easy to start with which also
scales up to do the the wonderful
functional stuff at the same time as
JavaScript did I mean JavaScript got so
much wrong and we have learned the hard
way about all of that longness
somebody's got to figure out how to do
it right it shouldn't be that hard
so I thought that's all I got for you
