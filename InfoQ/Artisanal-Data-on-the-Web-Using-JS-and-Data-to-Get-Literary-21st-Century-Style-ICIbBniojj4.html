serigraph Palermo I'm talking about
literary data on the web this might
perhaps be one of the weirder
discussions I'm going to talk about
making data art I'm a designer first and
foremost I've learned to sort of write
JavaScript and do all this stuff because
I care about putting art on the web more
than anything else I think and so I want
to talk to you guys about why to make
literary data art you know so we're
going to talk about you know since the
JavaScript conference I'm gonna tell you
why should do it with JavaScript and
data and you should put it on the web
I'm not gonna talk about code at all
because you are all very smart people
who I know know how to look things up
and figure out how to do things so you
don't need me to tell you about the code
I'm going to tell you about different
and interesting ways to think about art
and why we should be doing that and what
kinds of questions we can ask and at the
end I'll have a list of a couple of
different resources and eventually I
will put them up on the web too so you
guys can go ahead and click through and
have a place to start but no code and
one last point just a note before we
start is about using the word art art
means a lot of different things to a lot
of different people and you know many
bars have made tons of money providing
drinks to people who want to stand
around and argue about what art means
all day and i highly encourage you to do
that with all of your friends because
it's really fun but today I'm just going
to go with the broadest interpretation
and say that art is about experimenting
and exploring things you like and
calling it art and that's it so anything
you do that's that is art I give you the
official badge of our dienes right now
out of that so why should we undertake
it I have four excellent reasons one is
to understand ourselves the second is to
understand the systems to which we are
subject and subject others could argue
that's a subset of understanding
ourselves the third is to expand our
horizons data ly speaking and the fourth
and the most important again is because
it's fun so all of these other things
don't matter one little bit at all if
it's not fun and if you don't think it's
fun then you should totally go do other
stuff that is fun because that's what we
need most of all but I hope you think
this is fun so let's talk about
understanding our
this is where I say some very truthful
cliches right we live in a time of
accelerating technical change and as
developers we get to be at the heart of
it and that's an excellent privilege but
at the same time the way we talk about
data and code sometimes is really
lopsided science and tech have their own
biases you know including assumptions
about objectivity and infallibility of
data and it's really hard to critique
this within the owns the system that
says this it sort of precludes it
encloses over itself but on the other
hand we have humanities particularly
history and literature and they have is
their project placing humans into
context and then systematically
criticizing the context in humans in
pursuit of understanding and in a lot of
cases so I do work with Bay Area digital
humanities you know and we find that in
the Academy a lot of humanities folks
end up turning up their nose at tech
finding it to be this strange foreign
land but when humanitarians do that
they're also sort of giving up their
mission which is to push people in the
context that they're at so clearly we
need to make both of them fall in love
and when we do this each side can help
fulfill the other ones shortcomings and
when we do this we understand ourselves
as we are today and make decisions that
are good for tomorrow so that's
understanding ourselves but what about
understanding systems so recently I went
to the i/o festival which is different
from google i/o but supposed to a
festival full of people who like to make
data art and I've gone for the last few
years and it turned out that this year
something was different and what was
different was that people were feeling
really defensive about data people who
love using data to make artwork all of a
sudden you know they're snowed in and
there's the NSA and people with a lot of
power using something we love for ends
that we don't believe in and there were
a lot of talks about people either
looking at the NSA itself or talking
about what you can do or even talking
about small data which is sort of what I
talk about because you know in the end
when we do work with our own personal
thoughts and ideas in a way it's sort of
speaking truth to this power and the
same thing right with Facebook what came
back right after I oh and you know
whatever one thinks about research
ethics there were a lot of people who
felt very scared and manipulated by the
kinds of work that we really love
I mean sheryl sandberg she doesn't give
a right like they don't care but we
do and when we do work together again
when we pull together this code in this
art and this data then we have our own
little tiny human sized pocket of
resistance by understanding the systems
and it's not going to go back in the bag
so we can't just ignore it and say this
isn't important so we should do it on
our terms the third reason which is much
smaller after that sort of flight of
fancy is to talk about expanding our
horizons David Lee speaking and that's
to say we can push regular data
visualization further by experimenting
with it in cases where it's perhaps a
little bit safer here is a terrible
example of a chart of people
experimenting with it right somebody is
like hey let's like make this murder
rate chart look like dripping blood
which sounds like a great idea until it
gives the exact opposite of the
impression given that the deaths went
down when in fact they went out fairly
significantly and that's a bad way to
experiment with data but this is a good
way to experiment with data this is a
piece by accurate about different about
art auction prices and in this case this
work came from Georgia loopy who i saw
talked recently and you know this comes
from her playing with data in a safer
place in finding things that are useful
and have something good to say and being
able to do it beautifully like i said
before because fun we can i'm gonna show
you guys some examples after this but
the point is they should be fun and they
should be funny and they should be
interesting and that's the best reason
of all so literary data when I talk
about literary data I actually mean two
things on the one hand there's artisanal
data which is basically using the same
workings as literature with work that's
not language and then on the other hand
there's just work in which words and
language are the data themselves so
we're going to talk about both our teas
little data is where my interest and all
of this started and when I talk about
artisanal data I mean data that's small
fragmented incomplete and this is
interesting because it stands in
contrast to a lot of the work we do with
data viz which is about pulling together
as many tiny points as possible and then
looking for a pattern inside it and that
can tell us a lot about humans as a
whole but where are we inside it if any
there we are a tiny little demographic
dot but is that even us I'm not average
I don't think you are so we can do
something different with data and that's
by starting with literature and the way
literature works is it gets us to
identify with characters who have
nothing to do with us and our utter ly
unlike us but because books are these
incomplete pieces that require our
imagination and our empathy to bring
them to life suddenly those characters
lives are a little bit more inside us
and we understand that better and that's
the same work you're doing when you work
with incomplete data sets and asking
your audience to fill things in they
start to imagine and feel them the same
way so the first example that I really
like is first chapters which is by
stephanie posts avec and the works been
brought into d3 by Jim blanding ham and
the way it works is she visualizes novel
openings as a series of completed
sentences the length of the line matches
the length of the sentence and they go
around and around in a very pleasing
layout until the end of the chapter is
reached and this is the extraction of an
experience the formal expression of the
novel is the expression on the page
here's Hemingway he's known for his
brevity but we can see that in fact the
sentences are long and the chapters are
short giving us that sort of light and
airy Hemingway feel next we have 1984
and look at it cluttered up all on top
of itself just as claustrophobic as the
dystopian system that it's telling you
about finally there's the Great Gatsby
right this is an interesting
interstitial you can see sort of groups
of sentences and an excellent point here
too is in the d3 which this is just a
little cover but you can see that
there's some actual mistakes in there
and that by bringing it from just a hand
made into the code or even adding
another deeper level which is wonderful
and each of these is an expression of
what it's like to read that novel in and
of itself and to experience its form
another literary example is this is a
day in the life of a new york city taxi
cab made by chris wong and this is
anecdotal data in the sense that he
actually took a data set they told you
about all the taxi cabs and brought out
you know a piece of each taxi driver
going across and we have the character
of the taxi driver who's the most
obvious and we start to put ourselves in
his shoes but even better this has a
second level this has the level of the
characters in the cab that is you can
bring in and fill in things you might
know about this
you're somebody else brings in all of a
sudden you have another character that
your imagination is making come to life
the next example here is quantified
breakup and in this case this has much
more traditional database right we have
a bubble chart we have line charts but
instead it's about the author's divorce
and each chart when pulled together just
as surely is words on a page work to
make a space for our imaginations to
fill in and bring to life finally this
is the timeline of neglect which is a
piece I'm working on it's definitely not
complete but what it is is the
visualization of the books I own and do
not read they'd sit on my shelf and
sadly decay piece by piece right but
instead I've taken JavaScript this is d3
and made it you know so that as every
day goes on on the webpage these books
will decay before our eyes until I start
reading them and so in each example date
is not nearly a great admirer ourselves
but the stuff by which we express the
specifics of who we are and right here
is the mechanism where data becomes
literary and the transformation is
wonderful because even more than opening
up a new rich perspective through which
to work it opens up an opportunity in
Harrington literature which is the
tradition of using the way we deploy our
tools to be a critique of those tools
themselves you know you can ask these
important questions and Jonathan color
who's a really great literary theorist
he writes you know literature's a
paradoxical institution and it lives by
exposing and criticizing its own limits
hmm by testing what will happen if one
writes differently and you know when we
look at the basis of what we do and we
and we work with our cheese and all data
in the realm of the aggregate we express
our truths and test our tools to
discover what lies beneath and when we
see the stories we want to tell and the
stories the tools try to make us tell in
their clash eventually we ourselves are
revealed so that's one way to do it that
is our T's inul data the next entirely
different approach is to use language as
the data itself so in this method there
might not even be visualization at the
end it's using methods of data handling
but there will be play
fun so sort of the theoretical basis of
this briefly is in task of the
translator Walter Benjamin who's a a
twentieth-century literary theorist he
talks about how impossible translation
truly is because words in the context in
which those words take their meaning are
so tightly bound together that you
cannot say that brought is pair you
cannot say that bread is the same to the
German into the French it's not the same
for all of the cultural context in which
it sits but if we look at the space in
between those words and start
emphasizing it and we do it without it
being boring we can use absurdity and
abstraction and we can play and we can
start to see these spaces and the
meaning that we imply inside them so one
example is padded tab and this is
perhaps the most abstract example it was
actually made as an animation as a sound
animation kit is what they call it and
what it is it's a web page you go in you
type in different words and they make
different animations and as you hit the
spacebar and change you change the
register in which the word is being
typed so each of those images is the
same word but we can see how it feels
just a little bit different based on how
we type it what would happen if we typed
in Tyner novels into this and change the
registers of them what does that say
about translation another excellent
example less flashy is the patent
generator by Sam Levine and in this case
he's used a Python library called
pattern to do natural language
processing and turn works of literature
into patent applications right so in
this case this is the front piece is
looking at the Communist titles for the
Communist Manifesto and what he's done
for titles is append something like a
system device apparatus sometime web
based in front of sentences that look
like patent sentences right so the
communist manifesto is also a device and
system for appropriating intellectual
products makes perfect sense and it
tells us a lot about what we do when we
write patents another thing that does
the same work are BOTS bots are great
tiny subversions sky he was talking
about his BOTS at i/o and it was really
fun so here's two BOTS there's two
headlines right which does a lot to
expose just how structured headlines are
when we think about the new
is that you can basically take two of
them together and swap out various
pieces and it makes sense for a certain
quantity of making sense likewise the
game idea machine will go ahead and give
you some game ideas and you know it
shows how you look at games and it's
funny finally there is a work that's
using literature is data that's a little
bit different and a little bit more
serious but likewise super important and
that is Matthew Connolly at Columbia is
a historian and they've been using data
techniques there to look for holes in
government documents to look at things
that are redacted and when you pull
together all of the different holes and
all of the different redactions it tells
you exactly where to start looking to
find out what the government isn't
telling you or to find out what you
should be sending FOIA requests for even
that's a really big problem historians
have you know what are you looking for
if you don't know and it's hidden and
here they're using data to go ahead and
figure out where to look so these are
all the different ways that you can work
with data in literature excuse me mmm
and hopefully make really exciting stuff
so are you guys ready to start yes you
want to begin you want to make something
but you're not quite sure where you
should start so one thing I like to do
is think about the questions I can ask
what do you love that has nothing to do
with tech right because we're bringing
in what we want to do is bring in
something that's human and belongs
deeply to us but may seem somewhat
foreign in the context that we're in so
if you can think of something what can
you make with that what system has
assumptions that you want to explore
when you go to do something what is
chaffing what doesn't feel right another
way to start asking yourself questions
is are there just tools you want to play
with it's perfectly fine to start with
the tool right t3j s has a big gallery
look at the layouts and say I want to
make something with this layout what do
I have that seems to fit there's also
the pattern library that's what that
pieces at the top right you know do you
want to do things with language make
some plugins put some things up or a
topo time which is what this last
figures from a friend of mine Elijah
Meeks has been working on and it's a way
to create timelines
fuzzy time and when that can be
interesting and important or just look
at something beautiful and say how can I
remake that with data these are silver
leaves you know encased in wax but is
there a way to make a web-based version
of this that because we are using
computers and we're using algorithms to
create what we're making can we do this
with data and will it be this beautiful
so once you know what you're going to do
you just have a quick little process you
probably write code so you know a lot
about the creative process already I
don't think any of you haven't you know
sat in front of a big screen and been
like holy hell what am I going to put on
it which is you know the very important
starting point of the process but once
you're finished flipping out I'd like to
start off with sketching whether it's
sketching my own idea I think sitting
down with paper makes it really helpful
the woman who did that piece with the
triangles Georgia loopy she likes to
sketch just images of things that she's
seen and enjoyed and you know slowly
that works her way into her Minds those
are different ways to start with
sketching then you should gather your
data remember this doesn't have to be
perfect the goal is for it to be
imperfect um then you want to test your
data and you will fail I promise um and
then you should you know test it again
do something different mess around
change your sketches until you get
something together that will work and
the fourth and most important point is
to make it work and then show it to
other people and see if it resonates it
doesn't have to be popular right because
it's art like nobody has to like it
maybe people won't get it now I'm in 50
years it'll be great in genius but the
point is to show it to people and get
feedback so that you can go and start
your next project all over again so
these are a couple of different things i
recommend interactive data visualization
by scott murray is sort of the o'reilly
intro book to date of is and 2d 3d three
is great there are certain parts of it
that are a little bit finicky I think
you know flipping through that book is
certainly worthwhile and then d3.js in
action is the intermediate one lately
there have been some great post to about
performance by Irene roast using canvas
with d3 surely woo wrote an introduction
and she's written about using d3 with
backbone that can be sort of a sticky
piece when you start using d3 to decide
which component should really own the
data and the rendering and how they work
together so there's a lot of great blog
posts
but in the end you know I just hope you
want to do this ask questions poke at
stuff make your computer do the hard
work for you express your incomplete
truths share it eventually and if you
keep doing that no matter what kinds of
bad things unethical people do with data
we can make our own sort of person sighs
resistance and together we will do a lot
of great work so that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
