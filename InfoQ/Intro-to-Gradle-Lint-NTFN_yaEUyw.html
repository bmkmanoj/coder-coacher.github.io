from Netflix as Han says we've worked
with Hans for the past couple years I'm
here to demonstrate to you great a lint
which is still kind of in pre 100 it's
been around for about a month then we're
using it internally at Netflix but it
continues to evolve rapidly so there'll
be a larger form of this talk at Gradle
summit if you choose to come and buy
then an impurity more fully fleshed out
but to understand why we needed to yeah
I can certainly do that yeah to
understand why we needed to develop a
great Olympian first of all you have to
understand the Netflix we have this
cultural principle called freedom and
responsibility and I say the assignment
operator is intentional because really
that freedom and responsibility culture
defines Netflix it's why Netflix is what
it is so what that really means is that
every team every engineering team at
Netflix can develop in really whatever
fashion they want they use different
languages they use different build tools
sometimes they don't always abide by the
same operating system so it's you know
there's a wide range of things going on
there that and really these different
technologies and techniques of different
teams use suit the individual functions
that they're working on so it's really
great however I work for the Netflix
developer productivity team and that's a
central team a centralized team that's
supposed to help all teams build their
code more efficiently so for our team
we've got kind of one part social
engineering and one part software
engineering as we try to convince
everybody that they want to they want to
move forward and they want to do the the
next greatest and best thing even though
their build works today so that's kind
of challenge that confronts us so we
introduced so rather than in one other
piece of context we have about 5,000 I'd
say there's more than 5,000 distinct
Gradle files at just in the wild at
Netflix so if our team of roughly four
people that work on Gradle wanted to go
make a change through all 5,000 of those
things it would take quite a while so we
want to be able to somehow automate this
so what can great
it's helping us right now remove cruft
we we get a lot of questions from teams
we we tend to identify bad practices
that are just universal a bad so we want
to be able to bar those practices and
help teams not do that we want to be
able to sanitize dependencies do things
like keep the Gradle version up-to-date
so of all these various teams maybe
three or four thousand these builds have
the Gradle wrapper checked in and we
want to go to the next version of Gradle
we want to be able to push that along
but most importantly we want to be able
to auto fix violations that we find so
if any of you are familiar with linting
tool like es lint does a great job at
surfacing to you what the problem is
it's a specific piece of code that
that's causing the problem maybe even a
little hint as to how to fix it honestly
that's not enough I think for a lot of
our teams they're just so busy trying to
deliver business functionality and doing
what they do that getting your report
with a bunch of lint violations just
going to be aggravating to them so when
when we give them a violation we want to
be able to give them a fix and be able
to have one command to always just fix
their builds importantly though we don't
want to do it for them because you know
if we do something and we break
something that's also bad so this is
definitely this is a tightrope walk that
helps us preserve freedom and
responsibility but keep the engineering
teams moving forward with best practices
and that we've identified so it's a lot
of explanation sorry this is you know
like great apply any Gradle plug-in you
apply it no surprise there
and then there's you basically define a
set of Gradle limp rules that you want
applied yikes that's kind of small but
we're gonna roll with it so rules are
composed of a source file and also a
sort of a metadata resource file works
very much like a Gradle plugin source
file resource file and so the Gradle in
plugin can scan the classpath looking
for these rules that you've provided and
somewhere in an enterprise II way we
have like a we have a
in its grip that we apply to most of our
builds somewhere in an enterprising way
you can kind of define the rules that
you want to apply across the
organization
and that's kind of how we roll with it
to run it you can of course just run you
know Gradle w-went Gradle but the way
the grit the lint plugin is written it
attaches itself to the end of most tasks
so when you run builder you run tests or
you run assemble or any of those kind of
things
the lint is going to run and it's going
to report violations at the end of the
build it's not going to change your code
it's not going to do anything like that
just going to give you some warnings and
then finally if you want to take action
you can just run its Gradle went just
fixes everything so let's see an example
of this in action with one of our
open-source dependent or open source
project called priam which is a great
example I think of a team this is from
our are basically like database type
folks so they have a real like narrowly
focused specialty on optimizing
Cassandra getting these kind of things
to work they're not going to care a
whole lot about their Gradle script and
you're gonna see that in a minute the
I'm gonna I'm just going to go ahead and
and run the fixes I'm gonna compile as
well that what this build is going to
show you is a rule called the unused
dependency rule and I'll explain what
that does in a few minutes but it's
gonna run
so this is a team that had taken a bunch
of dependencies there's several sub
projects in this big multi project bill
and they weren't really sure what
dependencies they wanted to use it's
kind of like copied the set of
dependencies from project project you
know not unusual so here you'll see that
the lint rule identified all these
unused dependencies so we just struck
them all you know basically and if you
look at the diff you can see that for
any one given project we've just wiped
out you know a lot of the dependency
doesn't leave a whole lot actually
remaining but that's good this is really
important to us because we have like I
said about 5,000 inch projects I don't
even honestly know how many of them are
really actively in development but if
you have a really low level project that
gets that's good that gets pulled in
these kind of dependencies that get
struck like this one is a killer right
here right guava 15 guava 15 it's going
to provide a recommendation on that
version to all of its down streams so
anything that pulls in whatever this
library is it's going to now have this
version recommendation if that thing
that pulled it in god forbid actually
needed to run on guava 14 hurdles going
to conflict resolve it up to go out with
15 and that might cause a runtime error
so anytime we can remove unused
dependencies it just it just lessens the
scope of version conflict resolution
problems which are the sources much evil
in the Java world so that's kind of cool
kind of hidden behind the scenes here on
this unused dependency plugin
specifically it not only removes as a
simple minute right now it not only
removes unused first-order dependencies
it also adds transitive dependencies
that you actually have compile time
references to so that's kind of one of
those things people you know
accidentally sort of depending on a
transitive dependency then that
transitive depends they no longer exist
and suddenly your code doesn't compile
anymore that's no fun a line fixed
first-order dependency versions with
transitive is when conflicts are
resolved that's that's a mouthful but
there's been this argument we've heard
from teams that come from a maven
background or they used to maven
all vain conflicts with nearest but the
nearest version first and Gradle adopted
the IV strategy which is latest version
wins so it kind of goes back and forth
honestly there's pros and cons to both
there's not really one that's
objectively better so at least what this
will do say you have a first order to
pensee and you've you've said I want
guava 15 and one of your transitive
somewhere deep down is requires guava 18
you're actually going to get guava 18
you just may not know it so we won't
when to go ahead and surface that and
save word we're just gonna replace what
you thought you wanted with with guava
18 so at least we're decorative about
about what we expect and there's no
surprises and then lastly and this is a
source of much consternation as well we
shuffle first order dependencies of the
correct configurations this really hurt
us when we moved from Java 7 to Java 8
we had some people with like bad fine
bugs dependencies that were no longer
Java 8 compatible it really didn't need
to be on the compiled scope but they
were so they were whining and that not
only do we have to go after the teeth
the the team that had that first order
dependency and the compile scope but
then any older versions of that library
that were previously in existence but
you can had to walk all the way down
stream J units another one people kind
of sloppily put that in compile
sometimes or runtime it really belongs
in test compile so we'll well look at
the actual usage you're gonna find the J
units used in your tests so we'll move
it to test compiled and that helps out
quite a bit as well so let's create a
simple rule just to see how that works
and this is going to be a completely
hypothetical example but from a scenario
we considered at one point which our
team kicked around this idea of
requiring getting freedom and
responsibilities this is tough but
requiring everybody that creates a war
to publish it to our binary repository
so we could scrape some insight into it
we didn't actually do that but let's
suppose we had to plug in a Gradle
plugin called Netflix war publish that
would do that work for us just you would
just publish it we'll just pretend that
exists so
here's an example of a rule this is a
really naive implementation and we'll go
through a few iterations so to create a
rule you just create a new class extend
gradient rule this has all the
functionality like all the the visitors
of a groovy ast visitor this is also an
extension on top of code narc so it has
any of the code narc visitors as well
plus Gradle int rule has added some
specific visit methods for Gradle
specific constructs like visit apply
plug-in visit dependency visit exclude
things like that you know physical
configurations basically DSL constructs
that we think are gonna be people gonna
write rules around quite a bit so you
don't have to reinvent that every time
so here we're going to just say whenever
the war plugin is applied so whenever we
see a visit apply plug-in and we see war
we're gonna add a lint violation we're
going to say Wars must be published and
then we're going to provide the auto fix
rule which is just insert after this
particular ast method and we're gonna
provide a message for the user or this
is actual fix applied plug-in Netflix
org
- publish and that's that so you had the
violation you add the auto fix and
that's the way it works like I said this
is a naive implementation because
suppose that what's number two suppose
that somebody has already applied the
Netflix dot war published plugin then we
don't want to apply it again so let's
make it a little bit more complicated
Gradle wind also has a bookmark method
method so you can when you see a
particular DSL construct you can just
bookmark it for now here will bookmark
apply war where we see it and we'll
bookmark the apply War publish where we
see it and then at the very end and
visit class complete which is kind of
like that very last visitor that the
groovy ast uses we can say if apply war
is present but apply war is not pretty
sure is not present then we add the same
violation so version number two version
number three just to demonstrate that
you can do slightly different things
than just inserting we're gonna do the
same thing we're gonna bookmark apply
war bookmark apply war publish and at
the very end we're gonna add a lint
violation but rather than inserting
another plugin we're gonna replace the
the apply war with with our new thing
this assumes that this war published
plugin applies the war plugin for you
which it probably would if we actually
implement it something like that one of
the thing to note here this is you know
this advant violation returns a
violation replaced with returns the same
violation so you can compose fixes
sometimes there's there's some several
fixes for any one given whip violation
so you can do that as well
number four become Gradle model aware if
we implement the special Gradle model
where interface we can actually use the
Gradle model itself because the war
plug-in may be applied by some other
plug-in that's not visible to us in the
source of the build a cradle so in this
case we want to actually look to see
does the resolved Gradle module or model
have the war plugin applied and have we
yet applied the war publish plug-in and
if not inserted there's four variations
on basically the same thing that
hopefully show you a little bit more
complexity and really I promise to be
short and sweet I think that's that what
are your questions about anything
Netflix related to and we can bring hans
back up here as well yes yeah so the
question was since we don't run and
check in the changes how do we force
people to run that was actually the
million dollar question before we
release this thing into the wild inside
Netflix and you know so you just have to
observe it empirically and in the first
like three or four days after it was
released I think about 200 teams that
already just had just done it so you
know we we try to kind of have like a
build owners group that we email there's
not a whole lot of participants in it so
people discovered it and
and gone about it and done it so that's
the key is you know surfacing something
that's easy to do that's that's painless
you know and it's just super obvious so
we ever took the extra step of teaching
Jenkins how to ansi color Gradle output
so that the warning was like red you
know they like they couldn't avoid
seeing it if they looked at their build
output in Jenkins so it's just like and
that's what I think is fun like I said
you know the developer productivity team
it's like half social engineering half
software engineering before we did this
we just admitted a lot of warnings in
built and built and what we found if
people just ignore them you know I I
finally broke I broke not the bill I
broke when I ran a build and the only
output was just warnings how do you not
do something you know but that's the
thing you know there's gonna be some
people in the organization they really
care about builds but you know a lot of
people are just you know narrowly
focused on delivering that really
valuable business functionality whatever
that is so anyone can do to kind of take
care of it forum is good yeah the
question was have we considered
enforcing standards by breaking builds
if for certain violations I think our
current approach is this all the lint
rules that we introduced there's some
that are open source or some that are
internal all the no we were always
really so far our warnings we also
publish metrics there's a hook in Gradle
into publish or do something with the
violations basically and we publish
metrics so we can basically track
violations specific violations over time
by team so we'll see a violation
hopefully you know fall to zero and once
it falls to zero then we'll probably
turn into an error to slam the door
behind them so they don't you know
reintroduce something that we've we've
gotten past already but yeah we're
trying to be in the we just never want
to be in their way if we can if we can
avoid it the and the you know the other
good thing about the the metrics is if
we get down to say like 10 violations
remaining over the past week and they
all belong to the same team
it's not that onerous for us for to go
to a team and you know give them some
one-on-one coaching it help and we're
totally willing to do that it's just
when you have to get all 5,000 builds
that it's it's pretty hard to do so yeah
and the question here is can you prevent
them from promoting to production for
certain errors absolutely could we could
fail to build AI it's just not the
Netflix way so it's a freedom
responsibility thing I'm gonna surface
it for you if you want to proceed with
this this error or this warning
good luck you know but we trust that
they know what they're doing that they
you know that it's not the right time
that there's some misalignment and then
we'll come back to it and get take care
of it eventually absolutely I I meant to
demonstrate that in a way but the
question was can a project you know
decoratively say this is not a problem
for us like your pattern-matching logic
isn't good enough
we the plugin does introduce a contract
where you say Gradle went ignore open
block and then anything inside of that
block it's ignored or you can be
specific you can say Gradle went I'd
ignore and then provide a list of the
rule IDs and it'll just ignore those
rules what we like about that approach
is you know people aren't turning off
wenting altogether and they're adding
some decorative statement in their bill
that says I'm choosing to ignore this so
when that person leaves and somebody
else comes in and goes why are we
choosing to ignore this at least it's
there as president its visible because
otherwise often what you'll see is like
a - x-linked gradle like somewhere in a
Jenkins configuration nobody even knows
it's there doesn't know that it's being
ignored and you know bad things happen
so yeah I think this gentleman has a
hand up over here the question is for
all the distinct Gradle builds that we
have in the wild have we tried
categorizing -
usage we do have another tool and I
could I could show you this a little bit
later but we have a tool called
Astrid internally which does you know
scrapes up all the dependency
information and allows you to start from
somewhere say start from some project
and look at all the downstream usages of
that project at specific versions or
times shows you where it goes all the
way into production and see it says you
know this library is being used and
these aSG's and these regions and so
forth yeah yeah I think there's a
question here how big is the developer
productivity team relative to the total
number of developers so the Gradle folks
here is about four and that's just a
subset of developer productivity there's
nine of us total there's some some of
them work on the bakery you know help
with artifactory and and our continuous
integration environment so there's a lot
of functions and there's roughly eight
hundred engineers all together so I
don't know whether that's big or small
but it is what it is yes the question
there's another sore point the question
was are there any non JVM projects that
use Gradle yes pretty much all of them
do so we have an increasing amount of
node users at a Netflix to be perfectly
honest they use Gradle kicking and
screaming because whether it's
reasonable or not a lot of our developer
JavaScript developers don't even want to
have a JDK installed on their machine so
what we do use it for is right now our
OS package functionality which takes
whatever your end result is that you you
want in the cloud and turns it into a
debian package which then gets passed to
the bakery to turn into an Amazon
machine image which then becomes the
unitive of deployment that you know the
like taking the final node app and and
creating a dev out of it
winds up in a in Gradle script so they
use something like webpack you know to
actually build their code and then
there'll be a secondary step to build
the Loess package the question is is
Gradle the only tool in use or is there
still some maven and ant what freedom
ring again wherever there's freedom and
responsibility you can guarantee there's
going to be some variation some some
good examples of wise maven is still in
use we have people that specifically
contribute to Pig and Hadoop and that
whole infrastructure some of them are
like owners or committers to those
various projects and they're all maven
based it's just you know historically or
whatever that's that's how they've been
so they'll continue to do that yeah yes
it's it's the path of least resistance
it's the it's the paved road if it's so
to speak so if you for example if you
use maven you know what are you gonna do
for OS package you're gonna happen you
know we don't provide a maven solution
for that
so you either rolling your own or you're
you have a secondary step so most people
are going to use Gradle because that's
the they just don't want to think about
that step we've thought about it
it's just easiest for them yeah the
question is would we migrate from those
those users from maven to Gradle if
anybody's on maven today they are for a
reason like the pig and to do folks
there was an effort a couple years ago
we were on it an IV based system we
moved to Gradle yeah there's a huge
migration effort there you know I don't
think there's anybody who left that's in
you know unintentionally still on a
build system other than Gradle
