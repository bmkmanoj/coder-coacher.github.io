the authors of meteor and what I wanted
to do today was just talk a little bit
about where we've been for the past year
the road map to 1.0 and then focus most
of the time on two things one is I'd
like to talk about our recent work on
packaging which is something that will
be coming out I think this week actually
as version zero six zero we have a lot
of exciting stuff to say and show on on
that and the other is just to leave time
for questions I hope that you have some
I have always enjoyed this as a more of
a back and forth so I'll keep my remarks
fairly brief and then we can kind of
take this in whatever direction you guys
are most interested in so meteor is a
platform for building applications in
JavaScript and for those of you who've
had a chance to play with it I think
you'll understand what I mean when I say
that it's radically faster than really
anything else out there for building
native html5 apps where most of your
code is written in JavaScript or
CoffeeScript and runs inside the browser
or inside something like titanium rather
than on the server the way that we've
written web apps for the past 10 or 15
years and I don't want to dwell too much
on the motivations there you know
there's a trend I think quite clearly
toward software moving from the server
to the client
it's a massive change it turns out and
something I'd like to talk about is how
when we make transitions like this in
the computer industry and and the rise
of the web the move from Windows
software to the web was the last one of
these when we make these changes it not
only changes the applications but it
disrupts the stacks that we use to build
them and so I think what we've all
struggled with for the last couple years
and the reason that you're all here is
the challenge of how do we build this
new style of application
it's just fundamentally different than
the tooling and the practices that we've
learned over the last ten years building
for a server centric environment I don't
want to dwell too much on that because I
think we've already read that gospel and
we all believe it
the other thing I don't want to dwell
too much on but it's worth touching on
for just a second is why it's so damn
hard it's it's way too hard to write an
application like this and part of the
reason I think boils down to an
inconsistency between the tools that we
use and the needs of the architecture
that we're pursuing and and just to give
a little bit of color out I'll pick one
example which is the wire protocol or
the network interface that we use
between the client and the server so the
web of course grew up around a protocol
called HTTP HTTP is designed
fundamentally for delivering static
documents right from a web server down
to a essentially a dumb terminal that
displays them it has a lot of support
for things like caching write an e tag
that tells us is this document newer or
different than something I've previously
retrieved it's a one-way protocol it's
request response it's stateless these
are all things that are designed with
that document model in mind and of
course what we've been doing the last
few years is using it in a very strange
way to give us bi-directional stateful
conversations between client software
that has intelligence and the trusted
server environment that still holds the
data that that software needs so I think
the ideal version of this is a WebSocket
but of course today WebSockets in the
field have a number of downsides and so
we've used various tricks involving xhrs
script tags that return parsable
JavaScript all kinds of other things
right so that we can mimic a stateful
back-and-forth conversation between the
client and the server well it's probably
no surprise that there are a lot of
rough edges to doing things that way and
I think most of us run into some of them
as we build our apps it's not so hard to
do an xhr and get back
some data from the server it's not so
hard to consume a rest endpoint from
your JavaScript on the client but we
start to run into some architectural
limitations so for example there's a
round-trip delay to a server and when
your application is far away from the
data it's less and less acceptable to
pay that round-trip delay every time we
need a piece of data from the server and
I think we sense that I think we see
that when we try to consume a rest
endpoint from a JavaScript library on
the client it kind of works but we end
up building an ad hoc cache of some kind
we find that that cache now gets
out-of-date and so we have to build some
sort of system where the server can push
updates to the client in real time and
when we hear about a real-time web what
we really mean are these these
invalidation messages this ability to
push information down to the client when
the client has no reason to know
otherwise that the date has changed and
fundamentally what meteor is is a
platform that we've written that
captures the best practices for how to
do this in a in a way that thinks about
the problem from first principles so
rather than holding on to a lot of the
legacy technologies and a lot of the old
practices for structuring an application
rest for example being one of them we've
built a platform that's designed around
the client being a first-class piece of
software and a protocol that allows the
client to communicate in real time with
the server that it depends on so if you
watch the screencast at meteor or if you
play around and see how quickly it is
maybe we can get into some of this as a
live demo in a bit how quick it is to
build an app where you have multiple
browsers looking at the same data the
screen updates automatically when
someone makes a change it's secure and
it's scalable the reason all of that is
so fast and easy to do is because we've
started from these first principles and
built protocols and packages that work
well together in that new environment
okay so what that is context it's worth
talking about the the roadmap of where
we are and what's coming for 1.0 and
then I want to dive into package
as an example of a case where rethinking
some of the existing practices can be
really valuable and I think what we've
come up with and what's available now
in the release is a is a more productive
way to write software that has both a
client in a server component so there's
a few things I wanted to highlight as I
think the major things on our mind
between where we stand today and and
what I would call a 1.0 that roadmap at
roadmap meteor comm is actually a Trello
board so I would encourage you to go
there and please leave comments and vote
on the things that are most valuable
there are certainly some things I've
left out here internationalization for
example has become a highly requested
item but I think these seven really
capture the the key components that we
want to deliver a really seamless
developer experience for it and there's
a lot to say about all of them but for
today I really want to focus on the
first and the last on packaging and on
testing because they go very well
together and this is what we have been
focused on as part of the o6o release
process for the last few months and
again I want to leave plenty of time for
for your questions so I'll do an
overview of what what's coming and show
you a few things on the command line and
then just jump right into Q&amp;amp;A so meteor
oh six zero is available as a release
candidate today there's you can install
it and and use the release version I
think it'll go out later this week in
general availability the major change in
o6o is a move toward what I would think
of as a distribution model and and this
is something that has been present in
meteor from the beginning but not
something we've talked a lot about and
I'm hoping to use today as an
opportunity to share some of our
thinking for really how that works so I
think of meteor is a couple things put
together one of them is a collection of
what we call smart packages these are
individual libraries individual units of
functionality that's the first thing and
the second thing is
a tool a packaging tool that bundles
them all together into a working app
maybe you can think of it as a
combination of you know NPM or your
favorite packaged tool plus make or s
cons so I think of a meteor app as
something that looks actually a lot more
like the old UNIX applications that we
wrote and see that had lots of libraries
rather than a web app in the sense that
the the meteor tool is a linker it takes
the different packages pulls out the
pieces that you need and then bundles
them into a JavaScript almost looks like
a library right that we shipped down to
the client and run on the client so when
we think about packaging the the
architecture I described with software
on the client is I think vastly more
complex in some ways than what we were
running in the old server centric
environment and let's touch on what that
means right one of them is that we
literally have millions of copies of our
application running at the same time in
the case of a large web scale
application I mean literally a million
copies right and they're all running on
slightly different platforms so I have
varying JavaScript browser VMs of course
on the desktop I've got another set of
environments on my mobile devices and
potentially those mobile devices are
running native code that talks to the
same server or potentially as I said
they're running something like titanium
or some other embedded JavaScript and
I've got servers that are potentially in
multiple data centers different parts of
the world and as I mentioned the
networks between these things aren't as
good as we'd like when we're used to
writing software in the server
environment we can trust that the
networks between our different
components between our app server and
our database for example are fast and
reliable
that's not the case when it's the
network between my mobile phone and my
web server on the other side of the
world so it's a different environment
and the crazy thing is we have code
that's actually shared between both
right so in the in the modern JavaScript
application we might write
all functions and validators and other
routines that are literally shared this
same exact code runs on both the client
and the server and so that demands I
think a different way of thinking about
packaging than what we're typically used
to where packages in the node or the
Ruby world or an RPM land are
essentially tarballs of files we have a
bigger problem to solve here and so I
want to talk about six things that
emerge as principles for what a package
system designed for a client centric
environment looks like and I want to
start with this idea that we have these
two environments that we've got client
code and server code and the packaged
answer has to be equally comfortable
with both so if we are comfortable with
server-side JavaScript programming
certainly we know about NPM and when
meteor was released a lot of people
asked why we didn't use NPM as the
native package format for the meteor
packages and the answer comes down to
this client-server duality on the server
NPM is a clear winner I think but
packaging for client-side JavaScript is
actually quite a bit different and
there's some other technologies that
have emerged as potential candidates you
know Volo and you know twitter has bower
there's asynchronous modules there's a
number of different approaches that
people have looked at and frankly the
most popular I think still today is
wrapping your whole JavaScript file in a
closure and just linking to it
right that's packaging on client-side
JavaScript today so we want something
that's flexible and that can work across
both of those so what I have on the
screen here is an example of a package
descriptor and meteor for the underscore
package this is about as simple as it
gets it's one javascript file that runs
without modification either in the node
environment or in the browser
environment and what we have is we have
a package dot on use call that in this
case says the package is available on
both the client and the server and
that's that API dot add files that takes
a parameter which we've set to both
client and server as
a set of environments where it works
this is what packaging needs to look
like if you want to have a consistent
environment in both places and so in
meteor I can type meteor ad underscore
and the underscore library becomes
available to me both in my server-side
code where it's been loaded as a node
package using the require style and on
the client where it runs as part of the
bundled up uglify JavaScript bundle that
we send down to the wire so that's the
first requirement the second requirement
is as I said meteor is is I think you
can think of it as a build environment
and a linker as much as anything else
and packages need to have a role in the
actual build step of the application as
well as the runtime so we can think
about the code you write that actually
runs your application but we can also
think about a package like CoffeeScript
which actually doesn't do anything at
runtime CoffeeScript is JavaScript that
runs during development time and takes a
coffee file that I've written it and
emits the equivalent JavaScript so the
CoffeeScript smart package and let me
just put that up for you actually
registers an extension if you look at
the bottom of the screen and then runs a
handler whenever the build environment
encounters a file that matches that
extension right so here's an example of
how now I type meteor add CoffeeScript
and automatically the files in my
project that our coffee files or
literate coffee files are compiled on
the fly and if they change the build
system automatically reruns this so that
you get new versions of your files
compiled in real time so there's lots of
examples like their stylus and sass and
other pre-processors all fall into this
category we also have in meteor packages
that alter the configuration of your
project so you can use a package as a
way to specify deploy settings or other
things that affect the development
environment rather than the runtime
environment and speaking of deploying
you really want your package to be able
to affect the environment
it runs in in production so thinking of
the set of servers and the set of
resources that we have available for the
application as a first class thing that
the package system understands so one
example of this would be sending email
so we have a smart package in meteor
called email and obviously that sends
code to the server environment that
allows you to do email dot send and then
deliver an email but the other half of
the story is that to send email on the
real internet you need a bunch of other
stuff right you need some kind of SMTP
endpoint that you can talk to and you
need to provision that endpoint well the
idea of a smart package is that the
package configuration itself ought to
describe those resources and so today
when you do meteor deploy and you ship
an application that includes the email
package the application container
automatically provisions an SMTP
endpoint for you to send mail to so you
can seamlessly do that just by typing
email dot send in your code that's
something we'd like to make more generic
and available as part of the packaging
API and that way you can define a
package that actually influences the set
of resources available once it's
deployed on the public Internet another
example might be an incremental search
box so imagine a widget where I have a
text box and I can type and as I type I
do type-ahead search and return a set of
results in some drop-down window so that
clearly involves some client code that's
where my HTML templates are defined and
so forth it probably has server code
because I need to run methods on the
server to query the database as I type
I'm not going to ship all the data I'm
searching down to the client in advance
but in the extreme case it probably
means a Lucene server right or it means
a Postgres module that does full text
indexing or at the very least it means
setting up a certain set of indexes on
your database in production and so the
smart package format needs to be able to
tell that deploy environment about these
configuration settings in a way that's
not part of your Apple
patient but it's actually part of the
package that you've added and it's the
same for any application that would use
that package the fourth thing that I
think is very important and that gets
back to the principle of making
application development super easy is
curation and so one of the things we
want to do with meteor packaging is make
it easy to see a set of packages that
work well together and have been tested
against each other in a in a more
structured way I should say so you can
think of this as the paradox of choice
and I think the the rise of lots of
small modules that do one thing well has
been a great trend but also actually
causes challenges for developers with
respect to this so I have a screenshot
for example I hope this is big enough to
see so I recently ran into this problem
where I wanted to parse some XML on the
server side of my application and if you
search for XML parsing in NPM you
actually find a lot of options we have
HTML parser with less explosions that
sounds good
we have a parser that's forgiving and
runs in both node and the browser we've
got a parser number two which is also
forgiving and this kind of thing comes
up all the time right so this is a
challenge for me as an application
developer because I don't know how to
think about which of these packages I
should be using and in my experience
what I tend to do is look at them and
actually look at the code and see which
one actually feels like the right fit
but realistically that's not what I want
to be doing most days and I think this
is an example where a little bit of
curation and the ability for the
community to surface popular packages
and flag them as reasonable defaults in
the package system without preventing
people from submitting any variation
that solves a problem or takes a
different approach or whatnot
I think that becomes more
important particularly when again we
have this explosion of smaller modules
and a typical project may have a dozen
or two dozen separate packages in it and
what comes along with that is release
engineering so what I'll show you in a
second is how you can think of the
meteor distributions as a a set of
packages that we have released
engineered as one and they work together
and they've been Qaid against a bunch of
different browsers and in a bunch of
different settings so that you have
confidence that those packages are
compatible and are tested well together
the way I think of this is release
engineering isn't something we should
push onto the shoulders of the
application developer it's really a
responsibility of the platform I think
and I think we've lost sight of that to
some degree again the the the ability to
quickly and easily publish packages is
fantastic but I think the downside of
that has been sort of this expectation
that each individual application author
each team of developers is going to take
responsibility for their own QA cycle
not just of their code but anytime they
take an update I think that's a step
backwards and so what we are doing in
the meteor packaging space is giving you
pinned versions of packages that we have
tied together in a QA process and then
called a release and so you can use that
and you can use that knowing that those
pieces are tied together and the other
half of that is ensuring that every copy
of your application uses exactly those
packages at exactly those versions and
so we think it's very important to pin
packages to specific versions and that
gives us what what I call repeatability
or the way that you can know that might
check out and your check out and my
deploy and your deploy aren't using
subtly different versions of a
downstream dependency that someone
updated while we didn't realize that was
happening so in meteor when you add a
package you are tied to a specific
version and to a specific version of its
dependencies all the way down the chain
so those are the six things that really
for me sort of set the stage for what we
want in a modern packaging system
and what I'd like to do is show you how
a couple of these things work in zero
six zero and then just take some
questions okay so let me let me create
just an example application real quick
and if you haven't seen meteor I'll just
spin this up and
I'm running an application called
leaderboard this is one of the examples
that comes with meteor it's I think like
30 lines of JavaScript or something it's
we've got a list of people on the screen
and I can click a button to increment
the score and if you haven't seen meteor
before the neat thing about this is that
everything is persistent so as I make a
change in one browser the same result
happens in the other browser and my
screen is very small so forgive me it's
hard to get all this on at once but
there we go so again I increment the
score on one side and it happens on the
other so I'm running a version of meteor
and I can ask what version I'm running 0
6 0 RC 3 so the first thing that happens
in Euro 6 0 is that I can individually
track meteor versions per application so
rather than installing a particular
meteor version on my laptop and then
using that everywhere each application
has its own version and I can actually
run my app against older versions of
meteor so I can do meteor - - release
and I believe there's a RC - for example
and I'm now running the same application
against an older copy of meteor and I
haven't changed the configuration of the
app the app is still built against 0 6 0
RC 3 because that's the version I have
on my laptop when I created the app but
I'm temporarily running against an older
release just to see if it behaves the
same maybe I found a bug and I want to
make sure it's not an update in the in
the actual version of the software I can
even downgrade so I can I can update the
application permanently to use release
RC - and then of course I can run
against a newer copy one of the neat
things that this lets us do is we can
now ship test releases that fix
particular bugs for example so I'm not
limited to 0 6 0 RC 3 right if someone
reports a bug we can cut a you know
meteor fixes issue 207 and then just say
try running your app with meteor run - -
release fixes 207 and let us know how it
goes so one of the big advantages I
think for us is going to be able to
turnaround fixes and do release
engineering on a much faster time scale
because we can narrow down these
differences to much smaller variations
in the release so that's the first thing
I wanted to show you
second thing I'd like to show you is
internally how these releases are put
together so I have a check out of meteor
and actually I'll show you this so my
install of meteor in my home directory
has a couple directories in it and I'll
go into the releases directory for a
second and I'm going to open up the
configuration for 0 6 0 RC 3 which is
what I'm running and the only thing in
this file is a version of the tools this
is the command line bundler the meteor
command line tool and then a manifest of
packages that are part of 0 6 0 RC 3
where each package has a particular
version a shot right and that's it the
the entire release is just a manifest of
what these packages versions are tagged
to so again an app on 0 6 0 RC 3 is
precisely these application or these
packages and I can go in and show you in
the packages directory what each of them
looks like so let's take a look for
example at Mongo live data for example
which is our gasket between the Mongo
database and the wire protocol that
meteor apps use and inside my package
configuration I have a dependency on
MongoDB 1 to 13 which is a server-side
node module that is the Mongo driver so
I talked about pinning versions of
packages let me show you what that
really means I'm gonna see if I can do
all this on one screen so I'm in the
application i created i'm gonna run
meteor
and while my application is running
let's say that I'm working on a fix to
the database package or I'm taking an
update and I have a bug and so I want to
downgrade my package just forgive me I
have the wrong file open work meteor
packages Mongo live data package j/s and
let's say I want to downgrade to version
one to twelve to look at a performance
degradation or something so I saved the
file and in real time meteor is going to
notice the dependency change on the npm
module fetch the new version of the
MongoDB NPM package shrink-wrap back so
that it's tied in to the version of the
application I'm running and then restart
and do a hot code push for my app and so
I still have my app running and I hope
that that version of the driver doesn't
you know change it but now I can test my
app against an older version of the same
driver and it appears to still work
that's great
and I can go back you know maybe it was
one to ten that was actually better
and so again meteor will restart fetch
any necessary packages and when that
happens meteor is generating that
shrink-wrap file that I mentioned so
internally what we have is the Mongo
live data package that I've been running
has determined one to ten which of
course came from my configuration but
that also depends on the Beeson package
at version 0.15 and I'll just go back
and go back to the original one two
thirteen update my server once more and
if I revert
I see that the dependency Beeson also
changed automatically based on this new
version of the Mongo driver and which
package that it used so this is an
example of how we can pin a specific
package and use different versions of
that package let me show you something
else so let's continue to look at this
this package we have a test framework
that lets us look at package testing so
I want to do meteor test packages and
let's say that I'm interested in this
Mongo live data package that I'm running
so test packages spins up an application
and this is actually running a test
suite that covers the behavior of that
package and so now on localhost 3000 I
actually see the regression test suite
for that particular version of the live
data package and as tests run I can see
that they pass and I'll give you another
example of that I can come over here
let's open up the mini Mongo package for
example and
let's see if I can break something so
I'll open up the selector implementation
actually I'll tell you what I'll do I'll
go to one of the tests for mini Mongo
which is our in browser database and
I'll just change one of the assertions
and I can run the mini Mongo test suite
there's a failure and if I change this
test back
I should see the test update in
real-time automatically each other that
they're passing and again all of this
has been pinned down to the version of
the package that I'm running as part of
my app so it simplifies the release
process by letting me again try a
different version do a temporary release
if we need to have people update to that
release temporarily and if that works
then we can promote it to RC 2 RC 3 and
so on for a final release copy the last
thing is what I touched on before that I
wanted to show you is the use of NPM in
the packages so in 0 6 0 meteor packages
can depend on NPM packages and so just
to go back to that example and show you
how that code works in my Mongo package
I have a control file line that says
this package depends on the NPM MongoDB
module and then in my driver I can just
call NPM require to fetch that version
of the package and again it's been
pinned to the 1 to 13 that that I
already described if I had another
package in my app that also required the
MongoDB driver there's no requirement
that those two packages use the same
version so when I bundle up each meteor
smart package it's going to calculate
its dependencies separately and and
package those up so I can actually have
multiple versions of those dependencies
in use at the same time the point is
that each package defines the exact
components that it needs
to use for running according to the way
the package author thought was correct
and then the meteor release defines a
specific version of that meteor package
that you can use in your application and
so that's the gist of zero six zero it's
a it's an update to the tools so that
meteor is a distribution of packages
very much like Kubuntu or Red Hat I can
use whichever ones I like I can update
them separately but the guarantee with
the packages out of the box is that
they've been release engineered together
so that all of them work well together
and more of that burden is on the
shoulders of the platform developer and
the package developers and less on
