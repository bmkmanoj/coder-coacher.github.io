twitter handle is I've got laser pointer
North is up if you if you find this
interesting first a common misconception
that I correct you say it like let's
discuss notnot discus a very common
misconception however no longer and I
used to say this upfront we are hiring
and I think thing to talk about some
very interesting things and we've lost
more interesting things so if anything
like piques your interest a we will pay
you to do that uh yeah so first if I ask
you to raise your hands how many people
will raise their hands alright that's
like eighty percent okay pretty good so
how many people know what discuss
actually does like oh wow like all of
you this is great sweet skip this slide
this is a product like this is a picture
of it like a year ago I have not updated
these slides and yes those comments and
really we see as building community
because we allow websites to manage
their community and grow it by
interacting with it as well as giving
spam and other moderation tools and then
also this larger community of people
that use our product across the internet
it's allowing them to friend and follow
semantics so we're pretty big this is
again this is from februari and we've
crossed a billion unique visitors per
month we have lots of visits all these
numbers are just way bigger now and we
also have systems that have very high
concurrency so we've got lots of
visitors but they don't line up all
nicely one in a row like they want to
come at the same time like what's up
with that and so we also have super-high
concurrency along with high aggregate
numbers so what technologies do we use
mostly python there's this
definitely JavaScript that's how you get
on a web page but i'm here to talk
mostly about the python we love python a
lot it's really great why do we love it
well it's really fast to develop with
and you know people argue about the
actual cpu speed will let them argue but
i think it's under the undisputed that
python gets out of your way there's no
you know you look at the Java HelloWorld
you look at the Python hello world one
of those is one line and one of those
like 15 lines it's got great community
look at this room it's full of people we
love it because there's a great
community around it and us along with
all of you release awesome library
packages that it's super easy to just
use I didn't write simple JSON someone
else did and it's awesome I use it all
the time it's also just like a super
active language we're not even keeping
up with the head of the language we're
just finishing our transition to 2.7 but
I love it that other people are out
there thinking of what's next and where
the problems that gonna be facing next
year and keeping on charging ahead with
that and like also pipe I there's
multiple implementations of it they're
super active so those are really great
but most importantly we've been doing it
for like six years so we've kind of got
our loop of how we develop down really
pat how do we do that well this is like
the most one my most frequently asked
questions it's not about any of the
technologies is like how do you actually
do work hey well slide so the first
thing we do is we don't actually commit
code we dip the code so we use this tool
that out of Facebook called fabricator
so we make a diff of our changes and we
upload this fabricator thing it's nice
little command line tool that does this
all people review that as well as a
computer computer also runs the test so
that's jenkins and then once both of
those once the humans and the test
runner agree that it's good code we do
our get push and then then we wait so we
do basically continuous deployment but
that basically is like 12 like eight
times a day eight on like a super hot
day but usually because we have to fix
something not because we were like super
productive so so yeah so we are moving
to try to deploy every commit for
reasons I'm going to talk about later
but right now it's basically daily so
there's a breakdown of what that python
is ed's almost entirely Django so two
years ago that was like ninety-five
percent Django now that's like maybe
seventy percent Django and I totally
made those numbers up but they're
roughly accurate uh so what is in that
gap like so we've got this I wanted to
do pie charts but I couldn't figure out
how to use numbers so I must be really
stupid because I couldn't use an apple
product um but I love bug Thank You
Cindy okay um so what's in that growing
gap let's talk about that but first just
a little bit more detail about skip
slide so how do we like was a little bit
more detail about that workflow and why
are there some pain points in it you
know so again our stack is almost really
gel gel or a django and celery and we
put that on top of postgres and rabbit
and every one of those technologies in
the top we're just like pushing to the
match we've got like this hundred and
300 gig of rant like gig ram master
database that's right post grads and
that's just got like tons of read slaves
like we're super read heavy so we just
got this giant and it's got like thirty
two processors in it that they're all
like super big processors they're
probably Zeon's or something or whatever
Intel is selling us now it's crazy and
same with the rabbit machines and
they're all just like push the limit and
so uh that's one of the reasons for the
chocolate what are other options there
so yeah so again we roll up commits for
deploy where potential problems with
that well it's a rollup so I'm perfect
of course but my co-workers might not be
so sometimes sometimes they
they have a bug and we have to revert my
perfect code which was gonna increase
revenue for the company but now it
doesn't go out till tomorrow so revenue
doesn't go up until tomorrow but
sometimes I'm less than perfect and this
is true i left a pvp that set trace that
got through code review and that will
that's just it's just looking images
like break it just like stopped and so
yeah um so sometimes things do get
through so you know we have super-high
scrutiny in that code review but there's
like discusses it's a relatively small
engineering organization for that over a
billion hits a month uniques a month
we've 17 engineers that are committing
to this code base right now and but
that's still a lot of commits that we're
all generated day so we've got a pretty
high volume of code review so round trip
time for a review can be up to 24 hours
and then also there's just like legacy
kelly we still support api version 1
point 0 and that thing is the worst stop
using it if you're using it so we can
delete it so we're problems that just
don't fit into that stack of Django and
celery on top of post cousin rabbit well
super high concurrency problems so
what's super high concurrency mmm i
previously wrote our real time system
and that was seen between two and five
million concurrent users depending on
the mood of the internet and whether or
not a new pope was being selected at the
time or other like the Boston bombings
was just through the roof like everyone
was on the internet the same time they
all went to CNN and yeah so that's crazy
so um very high concurrency problems
also we want to compartmentalize risk so
sometimes you have a task that is very
volatile and prone to failure or Eva
task that's very sensitive to failure
it's like oh we made it it's gonna make
us tons of money but if you like blow on
it it will just like fall over so those
are both reasons to to try and do some
sort of isolation for that code
sometimes we need speed like sometimes
Python is not
that's enough and we have super well
traveled paths code paths like let's
optimize this and let's put it in a
language that's just only fast but hard
to read but sometimes you just want move
faster than individually like oh man
these guys are solving really hard
problems i want solve this new problem
that's really small so i need to move
quicker than those other guys are also
fun what is the point of all this if
we're not having fun so sometimes you
see like explore new options and
technologies so yeah so what did we play
with well the first thing we started
playing with was engine X real time was
one of our earlier products that was
using engine X as a core and it was
basically engine axis serving Python
processes but as we started exploring
that ecosystem we really started seeing
a lot of cool stuff like engine X
modules we found there were engine X
modules that could just wholesale
replace banks of servers so one
specifically that I talk about in this I
love this laser pointer in this talk
from Pike on this last year I talked
about how we use the engine X put stream
module 2 I think that's like 11 engine
Xbox could replace like 15 G unicorn
based things that we're basically doing
the exact same work as well as a bank of
Redis servers to so that was our first
thing so if you want more detail on that
like I talked for probably 40 minutes in
that time the next thing was like engine
X is awesome what's this Lua thing well
Lou is a language that embeds really
well in other languages or other
processes so engine X and both Redis now
you can just run Lewis scripts and lua
is almost pythonic almost and so it was
really easy for us to just build start
building and features in there I'm going
to just show an example when those in a
sec that link is not to discuss code
that's to me playing with it to see if
it would work but that is basically is
an engine xbox that you can just run or
like anything that you reverse proxy to
so anything that listens to HTTP and
it's going to do
persona authentication checking in the
middle and that's all done in the web
server so it's not even gonna the
request will never even at the back end
if if you don't authenticate on the
right domain and the whole point of that
was till I say hey designers they want
to do cool things too but they don't
know how to do authentication I don't
want to trust them but figure out how
off works so I did it and the last thing
is go so I've been talking about this a
real time thing I made well eventually
it was seen like 10,000 concurrent
events on our back end so we just kind
of there was the front end that we've
replaced with engine X already then the
back stream processes of that were just
seeing so much concurrency of just
messages that people we had to broadcast
to the internet that we ended up
rewriting the thing go and that worse
that's in production right now and that
was not me that someone else that has
super fun time playing with that and but
it works really great and we got out in
one week because it was isolated and
separate was great so here's an example
of lua and it is not indentation
specific apparently that isn't her but
yeah so this is what this is doing is
this is code that we are running in
production I think and it's basically
it's a thumbnail service so if you hit
our servers and you see a thumbnail of
something it was that's with this code
so this will a engine X will actually
spawn a brand new thread for every
single request so they're super highly
concurrent because they're all
individual and because they're their own
threads they also have like code
isolation in here so that means that two
concurrent requests I couldn't be able
to even know each other exists you not
play in flask there's all as stashing of
Global's and stuff and so that's just
naming a Global's and thread locals
that's just not even concerned with lua
so this is just gonna hit in bed lee
it's gonna get the image and its gun and
return the thumbnail right there or a
URL to the thumbnail so this is just one
example of this was a couple servers
that were previously doing this in
python and we replace it with
a server that does it in and it's
actually the engine X process is doing
other stuff too it's it's so much more
efficient but again we love Python and
python is really great for a lot of
things especially when I was saying
isolation and iteration speed if you
don't need that like you know last 2%
performance we stick with it the I keep
on saying like isolate failures but I
really want to say is like it also level
8 is a platform for success it really
allows someone to iterate faster so yeah
so what do we do for writing Python
services well we've a strong tradition
at discuss of trying it neways all the
time so the first thing we tried was
just like a cron job of a Python script
so if name equals main that do stuff we
also just have like simple whiskey
servers like yeah we just need to serve
like one thing and then we also have
xml-rpc where servers which is the worst
thing ever but it actually works really
well for this exact one use case where
we have it's serving a proxy object so
we can in development it's the exact
same code and we can access production
data but we can filter out any write
command so it's just read only access
and we can enforce that by having a
proxy server but it works great uh 41
deploy and and then you have to like do
it again and that's usually you nagging
the ops guy say oh can you ssh in and
like get check out and and we run that
process and kill it and it didn't work
that time shoot ok and then Tess it well
so yeah so lessons from that is just
that consistency across those services
was horrible and we want it we want
people load config from the same
location we use zookeeper for config you
should do that oh you don't want to
write this code for a zookeeper well
you're the one writing your own little
service you have to do it simplicity is
good because then anyone can just pick
it up and run with it without having
understand your own little world
modularity is good because everyone
wants to do the same config rigging
right so we should we should maybe make
that a module or something uh and copy
paste is bad so don't just copy that
guy's config loading code because you're
gonna change it and then it can be
different and has to be bad because yes
I know you're going to change it I know
you say you're not going to you will and
then not bugging ops is the best because
they are always too busy for me so what
did I do we wrote some code called
discuss service and we actually wrote
two things called discuss service it's a
little confusing the first thing called
discuss service uh-huh is this code
shortly afterwards the thing called
discuss service works with this code to
do auto deployments so we basically made
an API in Jenkins where once your code
review happens if your codes accepted
and Jenkins runs the tests and they pass
Jenkins will auto deploy it as long as
you use setup I correctly as long as you
know your setup high-test stepped up I
install basically we just said setup I
as our API and so that was just like a
killer decision to make it so ops
doesn't care anymore we just have to say
oh yeah conforms to the API they're like
okay push the button now we have our own
new low pipeline that deploys of service
so what does discuss service so well the
goals were that we want to be consistent
with respect to config with respect to
switches which is for us are how do you
AP test right so we're gonna have how do
we report on that information and how do
you get whether or not you should be
doing a beam test we want consistent
logging and error reporting we use a
program called sentry at discuss which
was written at discuss and is also
available get sentry calm if you want to
just install it a lot of our guys does
that now instead and record stats we use
stats d but we want be it reporting the
same stats everywhere as well as just
other internal systems so and most
importantly it should be easy to run so
the first thing and discuss service is
the at service decorator it's the
equivalent to the kind of like at Maine
or if main option and it looks like this
ah what is all this indentation all
right so man it's not real code this is
in rich text format yeah um yeah
pigments right here okay so i'm
importing the service decorator and then
i decorate the my function world and it
prints hello world and the way i would
run this is with the helper program
called toil so you say toil run hello
dot world that is a Python path to the
object in the Python in the hello module
and it will run it and it will also do
lots of other stuff for you but as far
as an application developer is concerned
they just care about what's inside the
function but sometimes you're like me or
like I care about more so I gave more so
there's a class called service and it
has more decorators that you can use the
handler decorator is going to give you
access to that's how you define what's
the main method in a class and then
there's some lifecycle handling
decorators that execute as hooks around
config set up or update config so a
little bit slightly more complicated
example this one is going to do so we
see we're inheriting from service and
then we have the handler decorator
saying oh world that's the what you're
going to run when someone does the run
from the command line and then post
config so this in the background the
service is going to go it's going to
load some config files from zookeeper
it's going to load them from the
environment from environment variables
and it can also load them from config
files both default config files that
have a assumed position in the module as
well as overrides from local config
files and so that's all that happened
the background
and then after all that happens I'm
gonna get oh hey I wanted to get the
Redis host and the rest port I'm going
to just set that up on a little instance
variable and then I can access that in
my main method up there and it's run in
the exact same way as it was previously
uh when we were working on this we kind
of found that there were some things we
were doing really quite a lot so we were
making a lot of web services so we just
kind of made a flask service mixin and
that's going to just allow you to get
all that config in the same consistent
way but it's also the act just like a
flask app gee event service that's
basically i love g event personally is
great for concurrent io at pretty
reasonable and high levels Retta service
that's just is basically and give you
that Renaissance of you just like you
saw here it bae does basically this
kafka service Kafka's @q use internally
and jingle RM service this is doesn't
currently support actually using Django
views or anything but we use Django a
lot like I said previously and we have a
lot of institutional knowledge around
how that Oh RM works so we really wanted
to support the Django database as an
option for these services so here's just
like one example of real-life discussed
code this is the shell class so this is
a for when you're developing something
using discuss service it's just going to
dump you right into an I Python shell
almost identical to in Django a managed
pie shell would so it's going to load
service contacts and you're gonna have
access to your in since you're inside of
the shell function even have access to
the self variable so you can you know
self dot Redis and run forward with that
and do cool stuff and you can see i use
the Redis mix in here too to get access
to Redis so i've mentioned uh yo what's
important which part Oh
so a great question so the question was
wise what is this doing that's difficult
to do otherwise so if you're just going
to load up Python or like if you want to
just load a I Python shell or something
you can totally do that but what the
service framework does is it is going to
connect to all those other services like
a kazoo and I'm sorry naaku zoo zoo
keeper and other things so what this is
doing is this is doing all that
bootstrap code such that when you dumped
into the shell you are connected and
have access to all those services so
it's it's already connected to databases
it's already connected to its like in
Django's manage a pie you can just start
accessing objects right you can say like
that my models objects at all because
it's connected to the database this is
doing the similar work but using the
discuss service framework so yeah so I
really wanted to show more examples
about mix-ins because I think they're
really awesome as a way to organize code
so I'm gonna need you to use your
imaginations for a second these are
slides from my previous talk so they're
going to talk about pipelines because I
was talking about data pipelines not
services so pretend that it says service
instead of pipeline but the concepts
really similar so in the pipeline
example the pipeline had a life cycle it
has four stages where basically you're
going to say hey I want to parse this
data I want to compute some data I want
to publish that data and then I want to
handle an incoming message somehow and
so just like the services where I had
that Redis service doing just one
specific thing these are now a couple
examples of very specific things that
you can do in those in this pipeline so
the first one is just an elegant parse
JSON input right and it's only doing the
parse step and anonymized is only doing
the compute step it's it's in case the
NSA is listening we want to just return
no data and then we have the compute
step this is the super secure one so
we're gonna rot 13 that data
super skier and then we're going to
publish to hgp a web view a URL or a
file or something and that that's an
append cool so yeah so then when you
want to actually use these you just kind
of pick and choose because as long as
you're not using the same stage twice
they're going to mix in really well
you're not going to have any this is
technically multiple inheritance but
because they were specifically designed
to not overlap with each other they work
really well like this so you can just
say oh I made a JSON parsing anonymizing
HTTP publishing pipeline or a JSON
parsing super secure pipeline to a file
as cetera and so that's cool because I
didn't have to copy paste anything is
really modular as you add more you can
mix them together really well but the
best part is the testing story because
the tests look just like those mix-ins
so assuming I had tests of these names
to correspond back to these original
things you only have to test one thing
per class really well if you were to do
this by either copy pasting code or if
you were to make each of these pipelines
individually now you're testing is also
getting replicated out so I just think
that's the best paradigm ever because
your your tests are super super
straightforward and they're simple
because they do each one thing it's just
about having well-defined interfaces
there's no real good segue here because
this is a beta test talk so I'd like to
thank everyone here for being a part of
this I'm giving this talk a later
conference uh but yeah so we have lots
of open source stuff because I've
mentioned several open source things
that we use like engine X like Django
we've contributed back to both of those
as well as several other things this is
just a list of things I briefly
mentioned some of them not but century
is what we use to get errors in check it
out it's the best thing ever if you
haven't done it it
it's going to tell you what exceptions
are trending in your system nie this is
how we manage ring base Redis
connections Django mail views is
something that we released recently it's
sending email like cool formatted ones
that look pretty from Django gargoyle is
how we've done switches a be testing
previously and we're just starting to
try out our rewrite of it called gutter
which is just like super powerful that
you get to lay right awesome things and
it works for more than just Django
gargoyles Django only gutter person
everything so if you want to check that
out go to github page and unfortunately
discuss service is not open source yet
but I've talked to a lot of people that
are solving the exact same problems and
I want feedback should we open source it
what people actually use what would
anyone like raise your hands if you
would actually use this all right like
maybe okay cool like some people so yeah
so if this was into you um we're hiring
and we I I run meetups I run a meet-up
called arch camp which is more
architecture centric we talk a lot more
about ways to solve problems that scale
less about a particular language so if
you want to hear more about those engine
X scalene solutions or our next one is
going to be on segmenting data and how
to do recommendations i'm building an ad
server now so that's near to my heart i
also run the discuss meet up which is
hackathons and happy hours so join those
so just a quick recap what I just talked
about we love Python but not everything
we do is in Python because sometimes
other tools are better for the jobs not
everything is a nail and we have more
than just a hammer let's see services
are awesome but they have some problems
and I've got some questions about those
next if you have answers mix-ins are the
best ever especially for testing and I
don't have all the answers so
how do you guys run services like how
did you end up segregating your code uh
I like cues I like stream oriented data
but do people here like RPC just
everything is a website like what do you
do what do you do what do you do for a
hot super high concurrency because I do
this all the time too but I like right
in Python more than I like Ryan Lewis so
if there's an answer there um do you
guys like lint or anything your code
before you commit it and if you do how
do you filter on like you know p DV that
set trace is technically going to be
Pepe compliant but you know you still
don't want to eat your code so if you
find a solution to that like can I have
it that'd be great and then the last
thing is so dev does evil production or
does it like when we're using manship I
run server sometimes as different
behavior then when we run it with you
whiskey so do you guys just like say I
will probably work because that's what
we do I would really like to be better
than l will probably work the same
because I've seen it not work the same
so yeah so that's my questions for you
and that's all I have so thank you for
being my beta testers I hope it was good
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
