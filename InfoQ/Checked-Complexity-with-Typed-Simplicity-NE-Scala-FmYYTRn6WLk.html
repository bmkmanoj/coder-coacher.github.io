so my name is a adelbert shank I'm a
software engineer at Fox and today I
wanted to talk to you guys about check
complexity with time simplicity and
essentially what i'm trying to say here
is I was looking for a way to build
construction by programs in a way that
was does compositional and that at the
very bottom layer was was sort of
foundational building blocks I could
trust and it wasn't like a big mess I
was looking for something very simple a
foundational and that we would build
more and more complex things on top of
it and so this was sort of inspired when
i first started programming an industry
where i saw a lot of people create all
these objects and they would talk about
things like abstraction and
encapsulation and information hiding and
then when they went to go test your
program I would see them mock out like
so many things just so they could they
wouldn't have to like to reach out to a
database when it has force in something
over to network with me test and so this
seemed kind of backwards to me because
if your code is modular enough it seems
in principle you would be able to just
inject or swap out the component you're
trying to test and you wouldn't very
rarely have ever had to mock anything
and so when I was looking around a lot
of people were telling me that I should
check out this thing called ml modules
so standard ml and o'callaghan's notion
of they have a special module system
that is fairly just really highly
regarded especially by Rob Harper and so
I spent a few months looking into
looking and learning and writing some
standard mmm and I realized one of the
big things that's really related to what
I was looking for was code and concept
reuse i would like to be able to add
some in the context of that mocking
thing i would like to be able to
structure my program around the fact
that depends on x y and z and then I
should be able to take that entire
program tell it for production I want to
use this live database this live network
dis life whatever and if we're testing I
should be able to easily swap in a
testing thing without having to rely on
anything like walking or anything that
that messes with
with like the one time step stuff that's
very simple and this this also led me
down to explore other other approaches
so mo modules was a big one for me type
classes were also a big one for me and
general just functions and functional
programming and things and as I learned
more about functional programming about
pure functions composing effects
verifying errors and side effects as
values I realized that this allowed me
to reuse the same not only the same code
but also the same concepts and at the
very bottom layer I realized that a lot
of this the benefit I was getting was
due to having an expressive type system
and so that's going to come when the
rest of the stock is I'm going to walk
through a bunch of type system features
at Scala has that other languages may or
may not have and show some examples of
where I found those features to be
useful so there's going to be a lot of
code in this talk and as I was making
these slides I i know i tend to iterate
on slides a lot and i wanted to make
sure whatever code I showed was valid
code I didn't want people to be able to
I copy and paste my code and then have
it not compile and so I end up making
these slides and report yes which lets
you write your slides I'm mark down and
these are actually compiled so all the
code you see today's going to be has
been compiled against call 211 cat 04
time projector 407 using Tut and so Tut
is a tool by Rob Norris which basically
takes markdown files and then make sure
that all the code blocks should put in
there compile against a specific version
so all it could you see today and these
compiles so the sort things awful will
start relatively simple as sort of a
necessary tools when we do functional
program is the ability to use functions
as values and so we we sort of had
functions because we wanted to be able
to reuse some some sort of copy some
yeah basically some computation we don't
want to write the same computation over
and over so we had functions and then
we'll just pass necessary primers to the
functions and the functions what do the
work that we need it and so we might
start off by writing a function that
just doubles all dated journalists
and that's that's financial two very
simple and then we said all right now
we're going to add 50 to each element of
the list and the codons of being pretty
much the same safe for that one part
where you actually apply the function to
to the element and then and then you
recurse and so if you don't have
function as value as you end up or doing
something kind of strange like having a
class that emulates first class function
you end up having to rewrite functions
with the similar structure and so once
you have functions values and I think
this is really well-known scholar you
begin achieving a higher degree of
queries you don't have to keep writing
the same thing over and over again and
you go further with this a skull will
also has type parameters and this is
Java has generics super post kind of has
this with with templates and it's the
same problem right it's a similar
problem but from a different angle we
write say want to concatenate two lists
and we say we have but we don't let's
pretend we don't have Ted parameters I
want to concatenate two list of strings
so you write it and then you say now I
can kinda to listens but you can't reuse
old one because the inner thing is
different and so you rewrite pretty much
the exact same code and with head
parameters they essentially allow you to
abstract out irrelevant information
right stuff that is not essential to the
algorithm itself and allows you to what
you've affected that way that gives you
a wider surface of a wider surface area
for what a client code can call your
function so instead of saying we're
going to concatenate to bliss events and
we're only going to work on end we're
going to say we don't care about the
fact that it's an end toward to string
or a double or whatever we just care
that these two things are lists and
we'll work on that and you can with that
you can even pass in a variety of types
so that again gives us a degree of code
reviews and then we can combine these
two features you have a parametric
polymorphism and also function as values
to give us really cool and really
reusable of things and so one of the
things I learned when I started
functioning is that does this full rate
function which sort of at a glance look
strange to type signature certainly
looks a little
Plex but it's very it's highly reusable
to the sense that you can implement an
incredible amount of list function that
wave all of those functions clearly in
terms of fulbright and so that was that
was really cool to see so this is just
with function has values n and type
parameters so to go slightly deeper into
type parameters you can think about type
parameters as a like Universal
quantification and logic basically when
you we have a type parameter you can say
so to apply here in the trade it says
for for any a you give me I will produce
you na right and this is essentially you
can choose any way you want and if you
choose an interview choose a double if
you choose string whatever I can satisfy
because I don't care about what a you
choose my my function or my implication
works regardless of whatever you may
choose you can contrast this with
existential quantification right and the
and corresponding two types there's
existentially quantified types and this
manifest is of two ways in skul the one
I'm going to talk about now is in the
form of type members and here instead of
saying for all a lie my function holds
you're saying there exists some making
that I'm not going to tell you but there
exists some a such that my function
works and so from this from this angle
it becomes not you choose any a you want
its I have chosen an A and you don't
know what it is and what and so here we
see when we try to do the same thing we
did in a previous slide you can't do it
right because you're saying you're
asserting that the a there is an int and
you but the type checker see is that
well it's abstract I can't I can't
guarantee you that that is ever going to
be an it so it doesn't work and this
sort of leads to the idea that
existential quantification is
information hiding right if you have
something that's that's relevant to to
your algorithm or to your computation
but something that they should not have
to know about way station not know about
the concrete form of it and we can see
an example it is that example I have
this stack and so we have to
types in play here one is a universally
quantified days which is known to you
this is something that you you do want
to care about right because you want if
you have a stack of auntie you want to
know that the stack contains it in so it
can be universally quantified but the
representation of the stack you should
not care about right I've given you some
API and you should be working against an
API as you never actually depend on what
implement what implementation the stack
is using so we essentially quantify over
the representation and so as an example
if we take this sort of stack module as
a parameter we can push me know that
it's an end so we can push 1 2 3 against
empty but what we can't do is sort of
say well I bet the stack is it as a list
under the cover so I'm going to just
push one onto the suppose it's back to
list 2 3 4 and the type check will be
like no you can't do that because for
same reasons before it doesn't know what
representation even eggs right this is
existentially quantified and so what
this allows you to do is prevent that
the type of still exposed in a sense
that people can get ahold of a value of
that type and this is what empty gives
us but they are not allowed to do
anything with that type that you don't
allow them to do and I've used as before
to in a similar way but to but this also
enforces that they never depend on
implementation detail they don't care
about and so I should be able to take a
completely different limitation of stack
and give them that and their code will
all work because they've never did never
liked leverage the fact that the
representation under might be a list I
can change it to like a victor someday
and their code whistle work moving on to
a different type system feature and we
talked about kinds and higher kinds so
to give a brief introduction you can
sort of think about kinds as the type of
types and one way I think I heard Daniel
it once was the types are two values as
kinds are two types and you and we
usually talk about kinds in this
notation we use a star and you can read
it as type and so the things the the
kind that everyone's sort of familiar
with is just a plain type and it's a
concrete type that you can you can have
a value of so
integer character list of in whatever
and then you can have type constructors
or unary Tecna structures that given the
type will give you a type so list and
vector future you give it an int and it
will give you a future of in or you give
it a string and it'll give you a vector
straight a given type it will give you a
concrete type and then you can imagine
same thing for binary for binary types
and three area types and so on and so
this leads us to fire kinda types
something that not many languages
support and as far as i know the
languages bearing nursing industry today
that do support this are probably just
scholar in high school and essentially
how are kind of types are types abstract
/ tech instructors and so as an example
so these are often used in the context
of type classes and as an example we
have this idea say of a functor which
abstract over a tight constructor and if
you look at the kind diet they're the
kind is given a a type constructor i
will give you a concrete type right and
so functor there let's see if my mouse
work yeah so it takes a type constructor
and and then it has the map method on it
this is distinct from if we like say
move the a up here because then you
would have to define like the instance
for a if we set f was a list and then we
set a is we would have a different
instance of it for a list of into lists
of string list of double and so on
whereas if you're able to just primer
eyes over the type constructor then
we're saying this we fix f to be a list
and then we make map parametric entirely
over a and B for any choice of AMV that
you choose and so this gives us
essentially generics of a higher kind
rate it gives you a higher degree of
being able to abstract in your code and
as a sort of example because every all
the code in here has been run through a
compiler I have to find a functor that
just given the list so it's not a list
of in or list of spring it's just the
list a constructor and I have an actual
type back and this allows us to achieve
something really essentially having just
like plane the plane and universal
quantification that we saw before it
gets us things like whisk and cat
reversing on the list or whatever but
being able to now talk about higher
kinda types to be able to abstract /
type constructors gives us a very large
degree of code reuse and so on I want to
get too much in a detail here but here
we're saying we have a list of a and
then we have a function that goes from a
to some g of be right where g g is free
here where as universally quantified
here such that g has this instance and
and so essentially this instance has
given it it abstract over things that
given two independent values in the same
context you're able to take those things
and combine them together so you can
imagine its future where you zip the
future together or it's list we
concatenate or option where you combine
them only with their both some and so we
write this function once and for all
against a list of a and then for some
sort of G and we can use this in the
context of option where r g becomes an
option and so let's say we try to parse
an end and then when we give it a list
of everything in so we get if we pour is
old and successfully we get a sum of the
list of results if anything fails then
we just get done back and that's just
behavior of options applicative instance
that same exact function allows us to
essentially do sort of like a fork join
thing where we take each element of the
list for call for computation and then
eventually collect all those so if we
forgot many futures and we are able to
collect all those features into a single
list and in that exact same function can
also be used with lists and many other
many other data types to do a variety of
things and I've only read your burst
list once and in fact you can further
abstract late damn workshop where you
don't fix it to be list you can fix it
to be a different type restrictor but I
won't get into that today and the last
thing I want to talk about was embedded
dsl's and I think over the past 23 years
the idea of embedded dsl's and
specifically including using
free known as has been pretty popular
and essentially the idea is you build an
AST of a DSL that your domain isn't so
maybe you're writing a DSL for database
access your writing a DSL for talking to
HTTP and the core idea to think that
lets you reuse code a lot is it's
separating the structure from of your
your program from the actual
interpretation and you can think of it
sort of as like a mini program extend
your program right hand side you have
like this small program that knows how
to talk to a database and only to a data
and that's all i knows how to do and it
lives inside your actual program the
source file that you're writing and then
you can pass all these ases and running
your program not never actually
interpreting them you just have a bunch
of these data types these values these
structures describing what you want to
do and you don't actually interpret them
until like the very end of your program
and the usual including zuv this come up
in like free monad free applicative and
finally tagless and because there's been
so many examples of free mon as if we
applicative just there's countless
number of talks in and documentation
around that i decided today that i was
going to show or run through briefly to
finally tagless approach of of doing an
embedded dsl so we can start by so the
example i'm going to do is basically a
read write something that can read read
something maybe off console maybe off
fiio maybe off the list and it's
something that can write write something
so it has two things you can do and then
i have the Dimona out there to say that
essentially to capture the fact that
maybe you want to write something that
we read so to capture the dependency
between the two possible dependency or
bindings and then so that's going to
that's going to act as our interpreter
and then we're going to write another
data type called RW that when given an
interpreter will actually produce or run
the rundal effect right so you can
imagine we have a read/write structure
or AST but it hasn't been interpreted
yet as so nothing has actually happened
it purely store structure and you can
define monad for it by virtue of
basically delegating all the work too
the interpreter but again the RW data
type that is not interpreted yet and
then you define some smart some smart
constructors that correspond to the
evaluator you have so here we have read
which doesn't take any parameters and
just gives us a string and then we can
write which given the straight world
will presume we write it and will have
any meaningful value to return to you
and so we similarly we have the reader
writes more constructors that construct
our W instances and so we can construct
a program this is we're going to read
we're going to read something went into
X with every something 12 why we're
going to concatenate those two strings
that we just read and we're going to
write that back up and so this returns
immediately this doesn't do anything
again that's what we have this RW unit
that has no meaning whatsoever and then
we can write an interpreter for that
using the console so so ID or it is sort
of an at least encoding here is the
finest just a type alias or type ID of a
it's just a itself so it's essentially
you can think of it as the every any
plain value have right idea is just
equal to end idea of list of string is
just listed string and then to read you
use the standard use standard in to
write you just print line it and so we
have an interpreter now and we take the
program you had before I make a run it
against the standard i/o interpreter and
then it'll read two things off console
and dental open to console we can also
define a different evaluator which uses
the statement at which I captured here
as to list of strings one of the list of
strings will contain everything that's
going to be feted so each time to ask
for each time I read something I'm going
to give it one element off to input
listen each time I buy something i'm
just going to concatenate it or
pretended to the output list and then
you're able to read and write by sort of
by just passing it a new state and a
result of what happens when you read
something or what happens when you're
right something and that exact program
that we had before the one that I define
like two or three slides back can be run
against dis interpreter and what'll so
this part just gives us
an instance of state that's now
expecting tell me what the initial
status and then I'll run all your
instructions against that state and if
you are giving this initial state over
here and so we can take that exact same
program and run it against a completely
different interpreter and now we're able
to enter you see here because I only
read twice it didn't actually read these
two but it did it did read these first
two and then it wrote Hawaii's gotta do
that and so we're taking the exact same
program I'm running it against
completely different interpreter so you
can imagine if you pass around a bunch
of these these ast is around your
program at the very end of your program
you can say all right now for production
use we're going to run it against this
interpreter and for testing us we're
gonna run against this interpreter you
can make sure everything is good and too
in summary plain functions just allow
you to reuse computation stuff that is
fairly common functions as values allow
us to write very high way generic
commoners so stuff like fold right stuff
like map flatmap type parameters also
abstract away unnecessary details so you
don't care if it's a list of intra
listening when you reverse it abstract
timer much allow you to enforce stuff
hiding of irrelevant detail detail that
sort of will still be exposed but you
don't actually want you to know what it
is higher kinds essentially allow you
for higher order distraction being able
to extract over things that you
otherwise will not be able to and
writing all these e DS EDS L such that
you separate the structure from the
interpretation allows you to run the
exact same structure against a variety
interpreters and so some of the stuff
that i found was really useful when i
was writing we're learning about this or
two related papers which essentially is
talk they start from a very plain lambda
calculus at a day they slowly add on
more and more type system features and
show how what degrees of abstraction of
homeworks that we use you can get as you
add more things and it was also a really
good talk by roca met i think last year
that's on youtube talking about how you
can achieve also a lot of code
used by using texts so I have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
