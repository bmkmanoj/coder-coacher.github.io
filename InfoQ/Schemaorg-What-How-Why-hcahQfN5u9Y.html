oh sweet you and by the way this is not
Russian
my t-shirt is exactly honest which means
reflected reality which is why it's
written backwards and it's in Ukranian
you have look in a mirror to see it the
right way around but even then so I'm
going to talk today about schema.org I'm
Charles I work at Yandex
how many people have heard of chart
don't worry about that how many people
use schema.org today a couple how many
people have a think they have some idea
of what it is and how many people are
like you know tell me what schema.org is
okay so we've got a big mix and how many
people know Yandex how many people have
used Yandex you've heard of it
so a few haven't heard of it in in
California your Yandex is sort of like
some random startup it's actually a
billion-dollar company in Russia it's a
search engine that does maps and mail
and money transfer and music and markets
and even things that don't start with em
it's a big company in Russia it does
about 60% of all search in Russia on the
web so it's one of the few markets where
Google is not at all dominant but it's
mostly been a Russian company enough
advertising
what is schema.org what's the what's the
point of schema.org schema.org is
tagging right so we're putting tags in
web pages so no you know like well it's
not quite like XML as I put on the title
pages like yeah metadata like it's 1999
when when you search engines started
being a big deal in the mid 90s people
were like are you know we're going to
catalog the web and so we're going to
have to put all of this metadata in our
pages so that search engines find us
and you me you may remember if you're
old enough things like meta keywords and
descriptions and stuff and that was
going to go in search engines and you'd
suddenly magically rose to the top right
and you'd use stuff like Dublin core and
it was great except it didn't happen
search engines didn't use much of the
metadata that you put in your pages
do I know why well Larry and and other
search engine people said yeah we're not
going to do that but there was a very
sound reason for it
which is basically metadata because it's
not visible stuff in the page we just
get stuffed with spam terms for climbing
up the search engine so you'd go and
look for you know any kind of
information and there'd be some page
have had lots of the right keywords and
the right description and you'd open it
up and we get another porn site it was
basically used for spamming search
engines and that meant we couldn't rely
on the results so search engines stopped
doing it people who collect their own
information and manage their own
information they use this stuff people
who do met the data as my mother says
because that's what she does
library people they've been using
structured data in their content in
order to look after it and manage it but
it never worked on the open web right it
worked in structured search engines in
libraries all over the world and inside
companies that organize their
information we've seen a bunch of stuff
you know I mentioned some names here I
think I'll just skip them because
they're they'll come up again so
schema.org is metadata for search
engines you put labels in your pages
here keywords in your pages and search
engines do actually read it and you know
what why right what's the
prints between 1999 and now watch okay
went by a few other things went by you
know we have Pope from Argentina we have
a right yeah we have peace in our time
but we the search engine companies have
massive amounts of anti spam detection
and analysis to block spamming and to
block blackhat SEO so we're much more
confident now in our ability to look at
a page which has keywords all about you
know whatever it is you were looking for
football stadiums for children or you
know rowing clubs and discover whether
it really is a rowing club or a porn
site so we are able to do much more with
the data to rely on it more because we
can quickly detect when people are
telling lies and schema.org is an
initiative it came from Google but it's
Yandex Yahoo Microsoft like the Bing
team and Google are the four groups that
are involved in driving it and making it
happen I'll come back to that at the end
of the talk and and yeah it's like as
keywords runners tagging things it's not
rocket surgery it's page descriptions
you know this web page is about a
business we sell week once a Goose's
Bridals and we're located on you know
one suburban street and our telephone
number is something or this is a picture
creative work and it was created by
somebody that's published somewhere
information about a book information
about events
so yeah if for example you ever had a
webpage for a kind of web conference you
might find that that that page would say
well yeah what what is this page it's
the page about an event an event you
might have a date like the 12th of July
and a location like PayPal campus and a
name like open web camp and you put this
data in and you mark it up right you put
explicit data to say this is the name
this is the location this is the type of
thing yeah
conference or a flight or a language
there's a whole vocabulary which I won't
bother showing you no I will show you
just quickly like what you have this is
all of the things in schema.org blah
blah blah is just a giant list of terms
and properties so I'll tell you what I
mean a term is a thing right an
organization an organization has
properties like its name you might have
a location you might have 50 locations
because it's a multinational company
that has offices everywhere and you know
they sell burgers in might the location
yeah might be a specific type of
location so you have a location which is
a burger restaurant and there's all
these terms in here you can look at them
at your leisure and I'm going to skip
them now and the basic idea is it's easy
right the you take some HTML what I have
here is a couple of spans Catcher in the
Rye by JD Salinger and and Catcher in
the Rye I've made that a span and I've
used in this example microdata which is
a part of the html5 work to say
mm itemscope so we have all of the
things I'm talking about in here our own
type skimming a dog book we're talking
about a book it's got a name there's got
an author and there's a URL to the wiki
page the Wikipedia page which doesn't
fit on my screen because that's how your
presentations go but you can imagine the
end of the URL we started out using
microdata which is one way of doing
markup you basically you put attributes
inside your HTML so it's not very
complicated you just highlight something
tag it you say you know I'm using schema
or book this is the author this is the
thing rdfa is a different way of
describing of doing the same thing how
different like at first glance trivially
different right is there saying itemprop
equals schema.org something we say vocab
and type of instead of saying item type
is a name we say property is a name you
can look at ODF a or microdata pick
which tool suits you better and use that
basically when you use this markup in
your pages we the search engines who are
indexing it we go looking for this stuff
on purpose we want it json-ld is another
way of doing exactly the same thing the
the difference is when you have json-ld
and since in a script tag on its own and
it doesn't appear on the page anywhere
it's invisible but it's the same this
information and the page before they say
the same things you have a name and a
business with a name and a phone number
so there are a few different ways a few
different formats you can use to put
your data
into your page this really depends on
your toolchain how big is the uptake
it's big in our indexes and each of
those search companies has their own
index no one will tell you how many
things are in their index Google might
because everyone believes are the
biggest so they might say actually how
many things they find everyone doesn't
when you know how much bigger or smaller
they are but all of us in our index find
about 10% of the content is using
schema.org markup don't you been around
for a couple of years so that's three
years so it's a pretty fast uptake that
that's a very big distribution of
content on the web partly because a lot
of the stuff on the web is old right so
a lot of stuff that's new and a lot of
big services are using this markup to
make it possible to find things and to
really know what they are so what does
scheme you know describe as well as
describes all kinds of things you can
describe a volcano turns out you can
give a Viognier you say this page is
about a volcano and here's the volcanoes
fax number and opening hours it's very
useful to know when a volcano's opening
hours are well yeah it turns out that no
one's actually as far as we know marked
up the opening hours of a volcano
medical conditions movie rental stores
how many people have been in their life
to a movie rental store this is a kind
of local business right it's a physical
location you can make the defense
establishment yeah sort of thing you
find all over the the way all over the
web it's like where's my local defense
establishment I might wander down and
pay them a visit
HVAC business I saw that I mean what is
an HVAC business so I looked so I looked
in you know the documentation
and said HVAC business and HVAC business
okay so you know someone told me what
that really is it's heating ventilation
and air conditioning
who knew but there's a lot of detail in
there everything you can just go all
kinds of things I sure put an Asterix
here too but I didn't
some of the fundamental ideas behind
scheming a dog we'll keep it simple why
do we use this really simple I DFA or
microdata markup if it's simple people
get it right yeah if we make some really
complicated super powerful super precise
ontology describing every single thing
people get it wrong if you know if we
ask webmasters to decide whether they're
talking about an event invitation or a
possibility of going to an event or you
know a notice of an event that you can
turn up to they will randomly choose one
of the three and we will have to handle
all three and that just means you do a
whole lot of aliasing and you get no
value right none of these terms if the
terms aren't different from each other
in ways that simple developers
understand and in my case in Russia
where most developers level of English
is pretty basic if they don't understand
the difference they're not going to get
it right so it's really important to
actually keep it very simple it's a it's
a very flat structure everything to a
rough approximation everything in
schema.org every term every type has a
name and it's URL is HTTP schema.org
slash whatever that's it there's no
complicated nesting paths and sub
structure
in the way things are named location
there are locations and then there are
subtypes of locations so you can have a
location this is a location you can have
you know this location is a movie rental
store which is a type of location it's
also a type of business and there are
very basic data types your text you have
URLs date times and and you can have
float or integer numbers because like
everybody knows the difference right can
someone can yeah how many people can
tell me why prices should be written in
integers how many people understood the
explanation right half yeah this is kind
of complicated if we said decimal number
maybe people would get it but but even
this is sort of dicey but yeah you do
need it for certain things recently we
started making schema do a few more
things action because we all want action
right
what are actions that the web does
things you don't just look at pages
about books you don't just look at pages
about movies you watch the movie you buy
the book you steal the video game no
don't steal the video game that's very
naughty I'm going to come back to video
games in a minute but for example take a
page like Aeroflot are you as you might
if your Russian is good you can book a
flight you reserve a seat you can check
in for your flight you can find out
where I know if they left your luggage
after you've arrived
these are all things that that the
website does and if you go into a modern
browser a modern search engine email
clients Gmail Yandex mail they start to
show these things directly right your
search engine result is no longer you
know Aeroflot and you know the first
line and a half of description about
Aeroflot or Joe United Airlines remember
to fill in content here it's it's
actually got you know Iberia reserved
about weather book a flight check-in
those links are in the result in the
search engine page or you get an email
you know with your flight ticket and
your email program it actually has a
button on it saying you this is a flight
reservation click here to check in so
you don't have to go hunting through and
find the URL and do that stuff if you
mark up where the check-in thing is then
software because it's clever but not
very can actually find out and put that
front and center in the user interface
to make it faster for you to get where
you're trying to go so the idea of
actions is to mark that stuff up there
are a few simple things I have examples
here which are kind of randomly selected
the basic you have a potential action on
a website somewhere in this example the
type I've used json-ld because I copied
and pasted examples from the
documentation it's a search action so
you're searching for something and you
the target
it's a pattern that's example.com search
equals something and then we've got some
parameters about it so you have to have
a name the maximum length of the name is
going to be 100 this tells you when when
we put up the link
in the email client or in the search
engine results we know what the
parameters have to be so we can put the
right size text box or we can tell you
which fields are required before we
bother sending you to the web page and
finding out that you know no you've got
to go back and fill half of it in again
and a another example little bit more
complication like a two page example
because it's really complex
that makes it ten lines twelve lines a
potential action which is a buy action
go and spend money do stuff you have an
entry point into the process you can buy
something and we know things like how
how the data should be encoded to send
it there what type of data you're going
to get these are just simple things that
if you have your website and you want
people to be able to get directly in it
you have to explain what you're asking
for right because what happens is that
people don't necessarily start at your
website you know they're linking
straight in from as I said their email
client in the NX browser if I go to
Aeroflot in the address bar actually get
a button right up in the address bar at
the URL bar at the top I get the book
flight check-in I think there's one
other one that would put there so so
people go straight in they never even
see the search page that's done by the
browser pulling the data out of the page
or in in our case because our browser is
linked to our search engine yeah when
you when you get suggestions some of
those are your history some of those are
your search history if you have a search
history on Yandex so the browser is
doing processing it might be going
backwards and forwards to the server it
might not might you might say no no
don't do that and it only does stuff in
your history but it can analyze the
stuff and do it on the fly and you'll
get back a result which is
we've completed the action yeah you've
made the order you've got an order
number you've got a confirmation number
and we're processing it get back to us
eventually if you're lucky no it doesn't
work like that
every e-commerce system is perfect all
products are delivered on time in good
condition if not earlier
Shh don't tell her so yeah as I said the
goal is keep it as simple as possible
always right so simple that it's hard
for people to get it wrong if they think
of it if they read the documentation but
as simple as possible as part of the how
you should do things but no simpler
right don't don't make things too simple
so we've recently been working on
putting in stuff about sports sporting
events sporting teams rock bands TV
series and they turn out to be quite
complicated collections of information
how many people here go to IMDB right so
I'm just about unique I think I've been
there twice I don't go to the movies
either and how many people go watch some
TV series legitimately
good job that so the example I picked
here is here in San Francisco 49ers have
a quarterback who's Joe Montana right if
you're old enough sometimes it turns out
sometimes they have a quarterback is not
Joe Montana actually for most of their
history and so you can say if 49ers have
an athlete who's Joe Montana and it's
like well as you know
they don't even have an athlete is Joe
Montana anymore he's not he's not part
of the team so how do we deal with that
and we came up with a beautifully
complicated structure we rolls which are
work in progress still add a layer of
indirection because every problem can be
solved by a layer of indirection so
instead of saying the 49ers have an
athlete is Joe Montana we say the 49ers
have an athlete and this is roll we have
a few roles like performing performance
roles or actors and the role is an
abstract concept right actually whatever
this role is yet there's an athlete who
does it
it's called Joe Montana and there's a
start date which is 1979 and there's an
end date which is 1992 but I haven't put
it in the example and so if you this
athlete is actually the same as this
athlete that's kind of dodgy right but
it works it doesn't have to be the same
it just turns out that we've only got
one athlete property so so we may have
chosen the names badly we probably have
but the the basic idea is role is this
just sort of abstract concept
I drew stole a picture from the internet
that that explains the idea and it's
slightly if this example is ghostbusters
Ghostbusters has an actor
you could just say Ghostbusters has the
actor Bill Murray done and then you
could say Bill Murray's character name
is dr. Peter Venkman that's great except
that Bill Murray
actually has a lot of character names in
a lot of different places and if you
just say Bill Murray's character name is
dr. Peter Venkman and Ghostbusters has
Bill Murray it's like great those are
two statements but they're separate and
you say Bill Murray's character name is
also Joe Bloggs you've got three
statements and you got no way of
figuring out how to separate them out
and that's why we put this performance
role in the middle so for ghostbusters
there's an actor which has these various
properties and for some other movie not
being a movie buff I can't really tell
you anything else Bill Murray's ever
been in which is probably almost unique
in this room yeah so anyway in these
other movies you have an actor who
happens to be the same Bill Murray but
it has different attributes within the
context of that role so that sort of
takes a tiny bit of thinking this is
really an abstract concept right
everything else so far in schema has
been pretty concrete no no he he must
become a primary on his page right this
page is Bill Murray yeah yeah no yeah
it's a good it's a very good point and
you're right on Bill Murray's page you
know this page is about Bill Murray and
Bill Murray has a performance role of
actor in Ghostbusters which actually has
a role where the movie is Ghostbusters
and the character name is Peter Venkman
and he has another role where the movie
is or the Caddyshack and presumably as a
character name that all of you know
because you're all cleverer than me
apparently
so we can describe almost everything I
come back to Bill Murray but I'm going
to talk a little bit about what we're
doing now it seems if you look at the
vocabulary we have we don't love hockey
stadiums we don't have a term for hockey
stadium so this does not go down well in
Russia in Russia hockey plays you we
don't have anything for game and not
that there are many games on the web but
apparently there's still a few people
who like to play them we learnt
everything for translation thank you you
can mark up your book but you can't say
that it's a translation of another book
or you know we have men's clothing store
and we have clothing store there's
nothing for children's clothing or for
lingerie or for milliner's or for
various other kind of shops yet the the
basic point is because this stuff is
pragmatic and done on an as needs basis
it's also kind of scrappy so I talked a
little bit about how the whole thing
happens and we it started out because
our v Guha a guy who among other things
made the what's related button in
Netscape you know I remember Netscape it
had this button what's related you can
go and find things that were similar all
right so so really this is partying like
it's 1999 this is not new ideas this is
stuff that people have implemented
shipped re-implemented reimagined and
reshaped and we sort of opened it up so
right now there's a public discussion
forum which is discussing vocabularies
what kind of things do we need we need
video games
we need hockey stadiums you can describe
a lake or a sea or a river but you can't
an island so random gaps we put there
people write up their proposals and put
them on the web somewhere right to the
list and say look here's my proposal and
the search engines decide right the the
for search engines actually look at it
and say well yeah we'll do this no we
don't think this is ready translation
should be coming soon but it was part of
a giant proposal from a bunch of
professional librarians and we looked at
their giant proposal and we said yeah
that's really good it's based on Ferber
anyone know what Ferber is Ferber is a
standard for describing the relationship
between various instances of a work and
and the work itself so you have Romeo
and Juliet right everyone knows what
Romeo and Juliet is and then you have
performances of Romeo and Juliet and you
have scripts of Romeo and Juliet you
have performances based on particular
scripts and you have Bayes lumens film
of Romeo and Juliet which is different
from Roman Polanski's Romeo and Juliet
and describing how all of these things
are related to each other
hardcore librarians have really detailed
ways of managing all of the
relationships and being able to figure
out what was descended from what new
West Side Story is based on Romeo and
Juliet but it's not quite Romeo and
Juliet right it's just the same story so
they had this huge thing and say yes
schema.org needs that so you can
describe the relationship between all of
these creative works on the web right
yeah
professional librarians get that right
sort of 80% of the time we reckon
webmasters will be lucky to get that
right eight percent of the time so we're
going to take some things out like 99%
of it and we've got down to a few
relationships that are really key
and we think are clear enough and easily
enough distinguished that they will go
in but they're not there yet there's a
another part of the evolution how it
happens we started out microdata if you
look at scale today and you look at the
FAQ it says you know why do you use
microdata and in the faq it says well
microdot is a very pragmatic choice it's
very easy for webmasters to use you know
it's part of the html5 standard and lots
of web developers know it and if you
look at the github page for schema.org
there's a pull request saying yeah but
we don't see that anymore because we no
longer believe it we we discovered for
example in microdata it's very hard to
change the order of the relationship
right so doing that thing about Bill
Murray is an actor in a movie and a
movie has actor Bill Murray
you need one property to point each way
that means you've got to have twice as
many property names that means the whole
thing gets bloated and it's hard to
process a DFA and json-ld
both just allow you to invert the
direction of the relationship so it's
quite easy you can do it with microdata
but it does your head in you can't mix
vocabularies in microdata
you say schema.org everything's got to
be schema.org terms you can't use a
Wikipedia term or some formal vocabulary
term for medical conditions on top of
that is there's no way of actually
marking that correctly in microdata
people have json-ld and RDF a tool
chains because you can do that using
json-ld and rdf a because what it
doesn't say here is don't say the formal
data model of schema.org the actual way
we think about it underneath
is ODF so so if you know IDF it's like
we're really really doing IDF it's what
we're really really putting on 10% of
the web and all this famous semantic web
link data astronautics stuff that will
never work turns out to work really well
if you do the simple things but it makes
the complex things possible which is
what we need and what microdata is very
bad for so said we started at Google
we're kind of opening up right with over
the last two or three years the thing
has become much more public much more
publicly driven you know they added
Yahoo was sort of a launch partner and
then Microsoft got on board and then
Yandex got on board within a couple of
months we've recently shifted the actual
content of the website from internal
Google stuff that was horrible to try
and deal with we had to beg someone at
Google to change things to github so
people like me can just go make a change
a pull request and change the
documentation we're trying to put out
more information about what we do we're
trying to put up more examples we would
like to do translations we Yandex would
particularly like to translate the stuff
into Russian because most of our target
market speaks Russian so what else is
coming we need to clean up the
vocabulary yeah you should be able to if
you can describe a river as different
from a sea or a canal you should be able
to describe an island as being an island
because there are a few around the world
yeah you get a you go on holidays to
them that's what they're for Australia
yeah we need to do more work on roles
and actions yeah neither of them are
really finished yet
they're quite complicated we've spent a
long time getting them to a point where
we think they're workable and we've only
just started putting roles into the
vocabulary but for stuff like TV series
we're going to need a lot more than what
we've got already
sporting statistics the history of
cricket matches other important things
and relating to other vocabularies so
the people know Facebook's open gruff
and yeah similar right as metadata you
put in your pages and it basically
provides the kind of information that
Facebook systems are interested in as
this is about a person and I have a cat
and here's a picture of me and my cat
who is my friend so I had to get my cat
Facebook account so I could have a
friend Open Graph is very very simple
there is probably more there are more
pages using Open Graph then using
schema.org there's a lot of Open Graph
but it's also very very shallow so you
might have a few statements in Open
Graph where you'll find pages right now
shipping big blocks of schema.org data
so overall we find more data recorded
using schema.org but both of these
things are they're really big right and
they're really big because search
engines use them and we use open graph
stuff as well obviously because we can
process it automatically one of the
little lessons here is if you're not
looking at this stuff and other people
are there ahead of you so remember that
and we don't want to put everything into
schema.org partly because if you look at
the vocabulary is pretty clear that
we're not very good at figuring out
everything you need partly because in in
lots of specialized fields people
already done you know 25 30 years for
centuries of work on classifying things
and actually have all of the stuff that
you need available on the web already
don't we don't need to put all of the
Linnaean classification of biological
names into schema.org
you could just use that from some other
vocabulary if we make it clear how you
do that fine print is playmates belong
to their owners none of this stuff is
guaranteed we move step move fast and
break stuff that's probably a good thing
a lot of the things we do first off are
not very good so we have changed terms
we deprecated terms if you look in the
vocabulary you'll find a bunch of things
where it says the term that you see if
you look at the detail page of that you
will actually say yeah this has been
deprecated or this term deprecates some
old term we just publish the current
version the search engines individually
have the information about the old
deprecated term we individually decide
whether we're going to keep on
supporting it or not and that really
depends on individually whether we find
it in our index different search engines
have different footprints over the web
as it were and so they actually see
different stuff the statistics are quite
different if you look at what Google
indexes and what Yandex indexes there's
a whole lot in common but the whole
longtail stuff those indexes actually
look quite different they're different
shapes and different content and that's
what I wanted to tell you about
schema.org is now your chance if you'd
like to to ask questions which I may or
may not be able to answer thank you okay
I'll start from the front thirty nine
and a half that's not as good as it was
but
yeah it's it's a big company yeah it's
got 8,000 employees or something right
the question here first no sadly yeah
once you go out promising to the web
that if they put microdata there and you
get a lot of microdata and a lot of that
stuff never changes we can't sort of
just abandon it but if you start new
today I would definitely encourage you
not to use microdata yeah you'll find
other people who say yeah it's not that
bad you find people have that their
tools set up to do it the part of the
micro data thing is our fault when when
the Yandex engineers were first looking
at schema.org now like yeah Micro data
that's a great thing yeah that looks
really simple you know the spec is
fairly well written it's easy to
implement the IDF a spec at the time
wasn't as good they went out there
preaching Micro data you could have done
here to Russia
so in our indexes microdata is much
higher proportion than in any other
search engines index yeah so a year ago
pretty much all the documentation said
microdata and and and as I say our FAQ
you know still says why do you only use
microdata and there's an answer about
how microdata is so good and hopefully
my pull request will be accepted today
or tomorrow and the FAQ will be changed
to say actually seem like a pragmatic
decision at the time turned out not to
be so good all the search engines now
index other formats as well and yeah
well sort of look and see the the
benefit of a DFA is that it's a mocked
up page content right stuff in the page
so you look at your page you change your
page and you see what you're changing it
doesn't get forgotten and lost in a
corner the benefit of json-ld
is that it's Jason it's really easy for
people who are writing tools to process
it and change it and manipulate it and
check that it's up to date you know we
validate the that's the webmaster Yandex
comm is a bunch of tools for webmaster
micro tests that XML is a validator for
microdata and I DFA and Jason you can
check what data comes out of the thing
so I suspect we will continue
de-emphasizing microdata until we stop
saying it at all
there is also politics involved Micro
data came out of Google and you know was
put into html5 as far as I can tell
specifically because Hicks he hates rdf
microdata is that the only format we use
which is not one-to-one map a ball with
IDF it's kind of you can do it but it's
painful and that turns out to mean
interesting things that you can do
without EF data are much harder to do
with microdata so yet this is the ENDEX
browser that I'm using yeah the slides
sitting here at the moment I will give
them to John and Thomas if anyone wants
to give me a USB key I'll give you a
copy it's no big deal yeah the is so
search engines are sort of the obvious
consumers but in fact the data is there
anything and and this is a bit
terminology question things that go
looking at content on the web
yeah they are generally some kind of
search engine but not always so I use
the example of the browser like directly
reading into pages and with the action
stuff Gmail Yandex Mail
actively use that right now in the email
client so you get a you get an email
it's got the the actions schema.org data
encoded somewhere in the email and they
use that to put right at the top of the
email action buttons in all kinds of
applications that can use data it can be
built on this so part of the question is
what are they going to do because it's
the search engine guys who make the
decisions about what goes in it's likely
that it will be kind of search engineer
focused for a fair while but yeah you
could imagine like micro blogging
platforms stuffing your tweet Twitter
and Weibo and those guys taking data and
being able to connect things up you know
LinkedIn might might take data and
actually use data about people to make
new connections the the open graph stuff
that Facebook does it's blindingly
obvious to all of us including Facebook
that if we figure out how to combine
these things then we can make more
interesting we can learn more about the
web we can learn more about the
information there and we can make
interesting applications that are not so
much search engine e you can build games
on it so people people have things like
geocaching games and so stuff that
actually applies to the real world yeah
there's a lot of things you can do with
information that are not just searching
it that are actually acting on it and
building something on top
yeah it's probably not the only thing
they're using thank do we Google I don't
know the internals of all the stuff
they're doing but yeah which it's where
we're going we also use heuristics right
we we do text analysis of airline
aeroplane pages to find out where
they're booking thing is and we can sort
of do that and we're less likely to do
it for bus companies because there's
more of them and it's less reliable
because yeah we get more and more
complicated heuristics if we can get
clean data then that's what we want to
encourage so yes we use it and yes it's
helpful for us to do so yeah tip but
that's actually the normal case the
question is can you you know can you use
schema.org data without the browser
going to schema log and looking it's
like yeah browsers typically won't go to
schema.org and look stuff up search
engines will the browser's hard-code a
few bits of schema that are interesting
to them and that they have some useful
way of processing and they've got that
built in the browser it's not like
they're going to schema and looking up
thousands of properties and figuring out
that the data manipulations if if you
had a real graph crawling visualizer
then it might do that kind of thing but
that's a fairly specialized application
most of the time the browser's not going
to go and check out schema.org and
download it to see what's happening so
so I don't and I'm one of the guys that
uses it it okay so the question is you
know for example in BMX but in lots of
things we take a very restricted subset
of a large carefully thought-out
vocabulary and people who worked on that
vocabulary or who used it say
and the example is the library catalog
young stuff they said but but this stuff
is your carefully thought-out and covers
all the information that people will
want and you've only got like three
properties that do a really half-baked
job of enabling that data to be recorded
the answer is yeah that's exactly right
and and the reason is the half-baked job
we do you're we're aiming at Joe web
developer and she's quite bright
brilliant CSS designer super JavaScript
shops never really spent five years
studying library science and it's just
not going to read the phurba spec and
get it all there
Joe librarian doesn't know squat about
CSS or JavaScript can't even get HTML
right but actually understands how to
classify all of this data perfectly
accurately so if you're a library you
know and the people like the BNF the
National Library of Parrott of France
and national libraries are using this
stuff if you're a library you need to
have proper library quality information
and you get that by having proper
librarian quality librarians put in the
right kind of information in your system
and you can put a subset of that as
schema.org data the reason for using I
DFA is and not Micro data so you can mix
Ferber for example and schema.org in the
same page it's it's trivial to do you
just tag a couple of things might have
two tags because the schema little name
is something and the Ferber name is
something else but basically you have
the same information and the BNF does it
because 80% of the document records like
the final records that get found in
their search system
don't come from their own search
interface so people go into a search
engine look up some item in the library
and go from the search engine directly
to the actual book record that says you
know the ISBN and we're on the shelf it
is and how long it's been overdue rather
than going through the system so yet
though those high quality information
systems they are the high quality
information what's on schema.org is a
rough subset that's good enough for the
web and it's simple enough not to get
broken right if we asked all web
developers to use you know Ferber what
we would do is generate so much garbage
Ferber on top that that you would lose
the quality information because people
would stop processing it so you have
different levels of quality for
different jobs so McDonald's is not I
hate to say it McDonald's is not the one
true restaurant right but El Bulli is
closed so you know you have them both
they serve different needs and it turns
out that individual people can eat in
different places can do different things
according to the context of what they're
doing today and yeah please please
please do not go and tell your
librarians that they should only use the
schema.org data set that would be like
burning down 2/3 of the library
don't knock card catalogs they're very
cool so yeah because it's really hard in
most library systems now to scribble a
note on the sides and by the way this
book is really tiny it's next to the one
called something which you can actually
find on the shelf and yeah yeah the true
information systems are the ones that
you need to have for professionals but
for the web for ordinary people finding
ordinary stuff this is a good enough
fast enough and won't break solution
yeah so the average developer
occasionally does this and he pretty
much yeah have a look at what's on the
web you know try and find out whether
there's 40 proposals already and you're
just making a forty first because that
would just mean we've got to read this
one as well before we figure out which
one we're going to do this public vocabs
at w3.org that's a mailing list that
anyone in the universe can subscribe to
its full discussion it's not just for
schema.org it's actually for discussion
of vocabularies that are meant to be
used by the general web so fo
friend-of-a-friend shock which is a
social interaction vocabulary few other
things can be discussed there as well
but that's weird you know Joe developer
goes to say we should have this and
because all the schema.org people read
that and they say oh yeah we should and
and we do get a bunch of useful
contributions already yeah there's
there's a wiki on w3.org there are
individual groups set up their own
wiki's so it's not like there's one
monolithic proposal wiki there are
wiki's on w3c that you can use but you
don't have to and
I'm actually have to stop because we're
going to get kicked out of the building
so thank you very much for your
questions if you have more questions
schema.org is the documentation which is
permanently almost up to date with a few
errors there's a github where that site
is actually stored the webmaster thing
and and everyone can send an email just
any other Charles at this address I
promise you'll get a reply thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
