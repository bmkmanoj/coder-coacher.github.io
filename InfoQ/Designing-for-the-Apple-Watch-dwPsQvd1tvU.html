alright well it's a great to be here
thanks for everyone for showing up wow
this is a really big screen and probably
the bigger screen I've ever seen but
anyway let me just step back a little
bit and tell you how I really got into
Apple watch and tell you a little story
behind behind the this whole project
that I did so let me ask you who your
travels on boit anybody so have you ever
faced a situation like this where there
was really no room but standing room and
this is how you basically had to stand
for however long it took from to get
from point A to point B yeah so yeah I
live in Union City so I think for to San
Francisco every day and this was not
uncommon for me and it was very annoying
right away because I like to sit down I
like to be productive i like to do stuff
for my computer in and relax so this is
really how i like to board a train now
there's actually way to do that there
are tricks does anyone you know how how
to get yourself on a train like that any
ideas yeah yep you go to the end of the
line or you go back a couple of stops
right and so that's actually something
you could do but it I think just takes a
little extra time maybe it takes another
10 15 20 minutes or so but then I
decided well you know what if I had all
the information of when the trains are
actually arriving other schedules but
the real time information I can just
kind of I can hug and make a pretty
educated guess on how far i need to go
back to get that empty train and and be
on my way so basically i rely on this
sort of information that you can see on
the station's right it has pretty
accurate information it shows you which
stations are i mean which trains are
departing but
I don't know if you've observed how
often you see this information most of
the time you see something like this or
a safety warning or some sort of thing
to watch out for your digital devices
right actually I complained to part
about that and said like hey I actually
sent him a note I need better
information over here can we at least
cycle the more useful information in
such a way that I can at least see that
fifty percent of the time instead of ten
percent but I said now we can undo that
because we have like disabled people who
need to see this in case they cannot
hear the announcements so anyway then I
decided well you know what it looks like
bart has an API for this departure
information so that's when life part was
born so live part is the iphone app that
i created to solve this problem
basically this iphone app shows you all
the departure times for the nearest
station that is that's closest to you
and you don't really have to select
anything else you just open the app and
boom the information is right there so
if you were to open the app right now
you'd see powell and you'll see all the
departure times in power and now when I
board a train it typically looks oh yeah
there's my advertising my facebook
advertising when I bought a train it
typically looks like this there are few
people there but plenty of seating and
I've been doing this basically since
January so no problems there and I get a
lot of coding done and it's super
efficient the only other thing that
bugged me still was if I had to
basically go you know I run into the
station and you know I always had to
grab the phone out of my pockets and
sometimes it's a little tight and
sometimes other stuff falls out of my
pocket with it right that's a like
credit cards and other important stuff I
thought you know it would be really
great if I could just look at my watch
and see what the what the departure
times are
so that's basically where the Apple
watch app of life part was was born so
we launched that on april twenty fourth
and if you remember that day that was a
day after the watch came out when I bro
twenty-third and actually for this
portion I did I'll do it by myself I
actually recruited a friend of mine
Jeremy can you stand up Jeremy so he'll
say a few words also later on but he
basically helped me kind of transform
the watch I mean the iphone app that i
had into a into this watch app or over
here so it's been running great we've
got i think by last count about 1,400
people are so using the app and it's
still counting so this is basically the
context in which i want to talk about
design for apple watch because we've
we've done it where we've gone through
the journey and we also learned from
actually pushing a watch app what are
the kind of pitfalls that are involved
in designing and developing an apple
watch at all right so first whoops first
I just like to answer the question why
does it matter why should we even talk
about about designing on Apple watch is
it even relevant in the future so I
contend that the answer to that is yes
if you look at where wearables are today
and you can see a lot of products in the
market that are there some of them have
been there actually for a long time and
this is just an area that keeps on
innovating headphones have been there
for decades right and yes they keep on
improving but those are really variables
here's a device that I actually just
found out it's called this tego arc and
it's a it's a wristband but you can
actually on your iPhone select what kind
of patterns you want to a show on your
wrist band so it's eating right so it
doesn't even need light or something
it's the same stuff that your kindle is
made of like I ink that's an interesting
wearable you got google glass and and
all these other competitors and that
that would be very interesting
technology to see where that's going and
then of course there's a whole app store
of smartwatches and fitbit's and all
sorts of work out here there's there's
even clothing now that that that can
measure your heart rate and and things
like that so in my opinion rebels are
here to stay and therefore it's really
important to learn the pitfalls of like
how the designing for a watch app and
and how it's really different from a
phone app or a weather oh and then
finally also this is just some research
that I did the other day and believe it
or not for a 1 dot 0 iteration of over
device the Apple watch is actually doing
really well in terms of customer
satisfaction so when the ipad came out
in 2010 the this satisfaction rate was
about ninety-one percent for the iphone
it was a little better ninety-two
percent and for Apple watch it's
ninety-seven percent and that had a
sample size of not 800 people so that's
that's actually pretty good despite its
shortcomings people are buying them and
people are happy with with the device so
I also for this reason it's really good
to know how to design for the watch and
what to be aware of and that's what I'm
going to be tough talking about today
alright so what I wanted to highlight is
a while you design for Apple watch there
are certainly certain things that are
still the same I mean certain design
principles will still hold through
whether you're designing for a foam or
for a web app so I'll walk through some
of those a little bit but then there are
also certainly things that are quite
different because of the technology and
the architecture of the Apple watch and
I will also go through those so first
let's take a look at the common design
principles that that the Apple watch
shares with other other hardware so the
first one is a user-centered design so
the idea here is that when you're on the
phone or on a watch for that matter or a
web app what you want to see on the very
first screen when you log in or when you
open up your app is information that is
relevant to you right it's this is my
stuff I want to see information that
pertains to me I want to know what I
need to do next so there are a couple of
examples here let's see oops yeah so in
our life part example right now the
closest station from this location is
pawel so that's I just want to see stuff
at powell and that's it good i don't
care about the departure times in
fremont right now so that's user user
centric design oh sorry here's another
one an example this is Evernote and so
ever know it's a popular app they also
have a watch app and over here it shows
all the the most recent notes that
people have entered okay that's that's
good and on the watch it's the the most
recent thing that they did in New York
trip and then also a way to add more
content right so user centered design
that is a team that is that will always
hold through
by the way if anyone has any questions
in the meantime I'm okay with answering
them throughout this presentation we
don't have to wait on at the end oh yes
framework for development CSS no not at
all so for Apple watch we've just used
Xcode objective-c now you can also do it
in Swift but there's no CSS at all so
basically what you would do is you will
design storyboards the way it's the same
way that you would develop an iphone app
yeah so we're not I could imagine that
it's at some point in the future maybe a
framework like PhoneGap or titanium
accelerator might get into the space so
that you could really just create one
app but we're not there yet
Cordova our phonegap I don't think oh it
doesn't have a browser it has no browser
the the watch does not have a browser at
all so so the answer is no right now but
something that I will also share at the
end of this presentation is what's
coming out in the future in fact
yesterday watch OS tudo was just
launched and so I'll it is expanding its
functionality a little bit it's not
quite there yet it doesn't have a router
yet but I'll at least touch upon those
things okay well that that's an
interesting point I definitely like to
actually research more into that yeah
thanks all right so the other principles
that still hold through our hierarchical
navigation so here's an example for Yelp
on the phone and Yelp on the watch so
what what this sort of navigation means
is that you always go from the higher
level and drilling down into into more
detailed levels of master to detail to
detail right so in this example you'll
see restaurants bars etc high level
categories and then if you drill down
the restaurants then you'll see what's
what's your nearby you and what is
popular and then you click on one of
these and then you'll see the detail
oops sorry here we go and the same thing
holds true for their watch app it's a
its highest level category detail list
of restaurants and then the detail of
the restaurant right now you'll see that
the watch version makes a much better
use of real estate right there's a lot
less in there and only has the most
relevant information but the principle
of hierarchical hierarchical navigation
so holds true so so that's still the
same
and then you know displaying information
above the fold that's that's even more
important for the watch now then that's
principal it's true for web apps iphone
apps particularly so far for the watch
you don't want to be scrolling through
now if you had a table like this one
over here using the what they call the
crown control you can actually scroll
you can scroll pages oh and a content
but you don't really want to do that a
whole lot okay but is in fact possible
all right so yes you can also scroll by
flicking and that that's also that's
standard behavior for tables on the on
the watch at all right so we've got
cover we've covered some of the common
design principles that all true so now
let's talk a bit about the things that
are different on the Apple watch and and
a lot of these concerns I just them from
the technology and architecture of how
Apple watch is built and how it really
interacts with your phone so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to talk a bit
about the architecture of the watch
because that actually puts a lot of
limitations on how to watch how you can
really design for the watch so first let
me let me share at a very high level
what what's happening behind the scenes
right so the watch the Apple watch as
you have it it won't it really isn't
cannot do very much without a paired
phone there are only a few apps like a
clock for example that continue to work
so that's good to watch right so but
everything else it needs it's a compaq
up it means it's a app on the phone that
that it needs to exchange data with
right so
this is what it looks like every
whatsapp has a paired iphone app under
the covers do you watch kit as they call
it is considered an extension of the
application so I know this is a design
crowd but I'll go a little bit technical
over here so what that means in the code
is that we we we control the behavior
and we get all the data on the phone and
then we send it through the watch via
bluetooth that's a Bluetooth connection
that is there now it's because of this
architecture that we run into various
sort of limitations on the Apple watch
and pitfalls right so what the watch
does do is it does the rendering so it's
got its own story boards it has images
and it basically uses the watchkit to
get data from the phone and then also it
processes gestures tabs things like that
and sends that information back through
to the to the phone so that it sort of
acts like dumb terminal or like a
browser now one thing one myth that I
want to dispel here is that the myth
that the Apple watch is underpowered it
actually has a pretty good processor it
has its processing power is about the
same as an iphone 4s which is not too
bad okay but it is it's not the power
here that's the problem it's the the
need to have this Bluetooth connection
and pass data back and forth that that
is a bottom line okay and I'll show you
how that really affected our life part
of a band what we did to resolve that so
the other issue also is very life so
knowing that the processor is actually
not a it's not another power profit per
processor it's like the equivalent to
the 4s but Apple there's a lot of tricks
to to keep its power consumption low so
when I show like this
this app to somebody it will blank out
it will time out probably in like 20
seconds or something and I have to keep
on doing this now to people that that's
this one one of those things like other
watches like the pebble and even i think
the motorola on they'll they'll show the
watch face for a much longer time and
for in the pebbles case it's they'll
just show it forever but yeah with with
watch OS to allow they actually have
improved some of the performance
concerns of of the Apple watch and it
should be better I haven't tried it out
yet it just came out yesterday so we'll
see if that's true alright so knowing
that architecture let's talk about the
differences between designing for Apple
watch vs. iPhone or other other devices
so well the very most obvious one of
course is space and that's a concern
that we always have to worry about when
we designed for phone versus browser
desktop right but in in the case of the
watch oops it's it's even more
pronounced you know you got an ipad
that's probably like a mini and then
there's a 6 plus the iphone 6 and the
real estate that you have on the watch
is so much smaller and by the way there
are differences between the thirty eight
millimeter and the 42 millimeter
original as well that could result in
interesting bugs and then we'll walk you
through a use case later on
so that debt by itself is an issue so
remember how I talked about having to
pass data back and forth through through
bluetooth well this is a problem that we
faced while we were developing this app
so on this app there's this button over
here that basically allows the user to
select a different station so remember
it always shows you the closest one but
if you have by the way in a strategy of
finding the best seat you don't only
want to look at this one you want to see
what is the one that trains are
departing in civic center or sixteen or
twenty fourth right so you use this to
select a different station now there are
actually about fifty BART stations out
there in the bay area and this table
actually loads all of them so you can
actually scroll down and loads all of
them but when we try to load all that in
it took like I don't know how long it
took more than five seconds to just load
that list so that was a problem so what
we did is we loaded the first four rows
first and then did a dispatch to load
the rest afterwards now by the way at
this point actually i want to invite
jeremy our developer for who worked on
this portion of the watch to kind of
talk more about the details how he
solved it
can't go does he yeah just coming up
alright so basically what so when
Christians say there's five seconds this
is more like a second or so but when
your or maybe a second and a half right
but when you when you when we first
tried it would click on that button over
there and then you it would bring up
that screen but then you just see this
thing saying waiting for like a second
and a half and then that you know that
seemed to make our you know everybody
think that our app was like very
unresponsive right took a lot took a
while to get it in there so that's why
we decided that just so you know we
decide to reload the first four rows and
then like you know you dispatch you can
set a time for dispatch so we dispatch
for maybe like you know tenth of a
second or twenty fifth of a second and
then told it to load the rest of the
rows and so in the meantime even though
in the meantime this it would still be
kind of unresponsive but at the same
time you're immediately displaying those
first four rows that's basically you
know so the user immediately get some
kind of response hey you know it's doing
something so even though you couldn't
scroll through for you know you would
basically be waiting the same amount of
time to be able to scroll through the
list but you know to the user it looks
more like you know you know or at all
right that's actually going you know I'm
not waiting too long you know things
like that so cool this just oh that's a
question yeah you would think but we
just found in our experience that when
we reduce list down to four it basically
got rid of the latency there's still
some overhead that need we need to pay
to get all the data through
yeah i'm not sure if i can add more to
that I mean yeah that's just basically
what we experienced I mean I don't know
if there's overhead from the watch and
the communication with the with the
phone I mean yeah I mean bluetooth you
know tape maybe there's some overhead
with the tables that are integrated with
the watch you know because we could only
use the tables that you know Apple was
I've been there
um I haven't really experienced the
Bluetooth connection cutting off at
least not not while using the app you
know maybe when you you know when you
when you go watch goes to sleep for a
little while or something like that
maybe it takes a little bit to kick in
you know I've noticed sometimes you know
I'll bring it up after it's been
sleeping and then you know you know apps
take a little while to load back up
information or whatever like that so
yeah okay any more questions for Jeremy
all right great thanks Jeremy okay so
that's the slow table load performance
yeah so maybe already covered this so
now let's talk about the thirty eight
millimeter first just a 42 millimeter
screens and what kind of issues we found
with that which is really interesting
you think you know that's only like four
millimeters difference right it should
not be a big deal but there's actually
there there are actually some
significant differences like number one
yes the 42 millimeter is bigger we can
see a little bit more likes you see here
power powell was truncated and you see
da da there it could actually have the
whole string over there you'll see a
little bit of the fourth row down there
here you only see three but the most the
most significant bug or problem that we
found over here was actually again with
this button like so when we initially
created this area over here it was just
an image i created in like adobe
illustrator and it was an image that
there was just this thing and guess what
we found that the button didn't really
work very well it's it was like this
like on the 38 millimeter the button
work maybe one one out of three times
and in the 42 millimeter one the button
work maybe one out of 10 times so that's
not good right we
we got this button has to work every
single time so we also talked to the
apple guy the Apple engineer we
brainstormed a little bit and we came to
the conclusion that the image area is
too small for for these two watches
right okay so let's make it bigger so we
made it bigger in fact on the 38
millimeter one what we did was we we
didn't change the size of the visible
part but we added invisible pixels
around it right so there's a larger area
to to tap so that seemed to work for at
least the thirty eight millimeter one so
we got it seemed to work maybe eight out
of eight to nine nine out of ten times
it seems to work okay all right great
now when we made that one bigger in the
same way it still wasn't as good it may
be worked half of the time so Wow what's
that so after a lot of trial and error
we came with a dimension that that
seemed to work see it's very interesting
how even between the two different
watches you you kind of have to work
around it and we have to make this area
even taller to make it work so that's
that's something you might want to
consider when you when you design for
Apple watch yes
well there are actually different assets
now you can you can use I see what
you're getting at the the aspect ratios
are in fact different between the two we
try to keep the same aspect ratio but it
just wasn't optimal for the 42
millimeter watch on top of my head I
let's see that one is 100 x 60 pixels
and this one is 80 x 48 this 80 x 8 80 x
48 100 x 60 so that they're not exactly
the same by the way any iOS developers
here that know whether you can use
factors Oh Ivan there's a I it will only
take PNG so even all those cool
animations that Apple does when they
have like the activity monitor all
they're doing is really going back to
like old-school web stuff and like
spinning a PNG and like changing all
that so it's pretty like low dev yep yes
as far as my experience in terms of
developing on iOS there isn't really
much of vectors it's all PNG pixel-based
image is it that you need to use all
right okay and the other questions on on
this interesting problem so remember
when when you develop an app or when you
design for for a nap this is a very
interesting problem you you really need
to have your team actually download it
on two different watches and make sure
it works on both because it might not
yep
so the question here is a about the
number of rows this one has three this
one has three and a little bit more
that's actually variable right because
in the storyboard depending on the how
how tall your rows are you can probably
have more stuff you just you know I
might not be able to show the number of
cars or you know I have to truncate the
name but you can certainly have more
more rows in the table optimally when I
look at the design for other apps
usually I see like three or four rows at
the most I don't see anything more than
that because then becomes a problem of
like what if you had to tap it right if
you had to tap the row if it becomes too
narrow then you get the problem that you
might miss miss tap the row right you
might have the wrong one
no because in fact the the swatch
version does not do anything when you
tap the row it that it's just read only
there's no functionality yeah you had a
question prototyping well the only tools
that i have used for for this app is
really just photoshop no no real i have
not seen any tool yet that that would
allow you to like envision or something
to do something like that yeah Morgan
okay well that's good to know well there
you have it may be an envision then will
in the next iteration will support it
okay any other comments or questions yes
what hap so how do you handle names that
are too long well in iOS there's
actually a way where you can specify the
width of a text field and it would
automatically truncate it if you can
specify what you want to do with it you
want to truncate it do you want to rep
we want to text wrap around or do you
just want to leave it as is and just go
off the screen and so like in this case
for this label for the station we chose
to just truncate it with the dot dot and
that's built in an iOS same thing if we
had the station name that would run long
we would probably also do the same thing
I've actually forgot what we did for
that
yeah I think what we chose to do here is
we could we would wrap it around for at
most two rows so that is that is
configurable and then a in the watch at
any other questions here okay by the way
actually I'm just curious who is now in
process of designing an Apple watch app
yes a few who was thinking of doing it
in the future in the near future a
couple of you all right great cool all
right so let's move on to the next bit
so I there are some of the differences
that that Jeremy and I ran into while
developing the life bar tap what I'm
going to do now is I'm going to
highlight a cup of other differences
that that are more common knowledge but
I'll just go through them anyway and so
when you develop an app and design an
app for a iphone or a wet that of course
when you do responsive design you
basically the signing for different
screen sizes but on the iPhone you
really just have one app that you need
to design for one more or less except if
you might support larger and smaller
iphone screens but still basically one
app when you create a Apple watch app
you're not really just designing for one
distinct app but you're designing for
three distinct apps you've got what you
call the traditional app you got a
glance and you got a notification and
they all have three different code bases
and there are different interactions
that you can do with them okay so
the watch app is what I've been showing
you already and kind of that kind of
behaves like an iPhone app just a lot
smaller so that that's pretty
straightforward the glance is an
interesting kind of app the glance is
very limited in the sense that you only
have this much of screen space to work
with you cannot have tables that go
below so there's no scrolling involved
you you cannot really tap and interact
with it if you tap this thing will
basically go to the app but the good
thing is the glance is something that
Apple has a special menu in the Apple
watch if you kind of like scroll up then
you'll see all the glances and you have
glances that show like your activity
level the time the weather and you can
really glance through them really
quickly without having to load a lot of
things so it's a very light weight app
but you know you could actually code it
separately there's a separate story
board there's separate code for it so
that that's what the glance is okay does
it does it make sense of for all right
and then you have a notification and
notification there are actually two
forms so that there's there's a short
form in a long form so like the iphone
app any notification by the way that you
push to the phone can also be pushed to
the to the watch but where it is
different is that if you push a
notification that is that you kind of
code specifically you can have what they
call a long form in the short form and
sorry I'd actually don't have any
screenshots for that because we didn't
develop that yet but the short form
notifications basically when you just
get a notification saying oh you've got
an appointment coming in the you know in
the next 10 minutes and that's it that's
a short form and a long form would be
you got a notification but then you get
buttons underneath it that where you can
do something like you can accept or
decline or
performance a certain action so that's a
long-form notification so for life part
back she didn't really get to do that we
only use the built-in iphone
notification so that's what this is no
fremont train departs union city station
in four minutes that's notification that
we use but it's not a short form or
long-form notification Oh another thing
to note also since we returned by design
Apple recommends to use dark backgrounds
a to preserve power because it's just
the less expensive to render I just like
those old Nintendo games yep well the
the glance actually starts up a lot
quicker wait and on the on the watch you
have like you can actually kind of tell
what glances you want and you can
quickly flick through them now it is
lightweight but you cannot do a whole
lot so the use case really would be if
you if you can somehow reflect your the
information that you want in a very
quick view and that's all you need then
you would have a glance now as an app
you are not restricted to just have a
glance or have an app you can have all
of them right you can in your bundle you
can have notifications glances and and
apps it's just that you would access
them differently this one you would
access to that big home menu with all
those icons and you would click
something and then you you'll get to the
app the glance you would get to by going
through the glances screen
why Apple did that I actually don't
really know maybe they came up with a
way to develop the glances first and
then the apps came later at at this
point it's just speculation yeah I'm by
the way Jeremy you worked on the glance
and the app do you have any anything
else to comment on that I think your
question with the difference between the
glance and a notification is that right
where was I
okay so well the glance is is you're
basically looking for the specific
information so you know you want it on
the screen you want it you want the
information really fast so you can go
right to your glance and look look at it
below so like here you know you see
fremont station the next two departures
are you know richmond daly city whereas
the notification is actually more of a
pushed from your your wat your phone
your phone says oh there you know i want
it you wanted to see you know when you
know this train is going to arrive and
I'm going so I will notify you that if
five minutes from now you know it's
going to happen you know I mean there's
going to depart so you're actually it's
not it's not a case where you can just
say oh I want to know what it is so for
notifications you can't really just pull
that from your on your on your watch
it's actually pushed from your phone
whereas the glance you can actually just
really quick say oh I you know it's
leaving in three minutes or something
like that okay oh thanks for the
clarification I I think imma started
your question earlier yeah yeah so even
if you don't have a specific watch app
for for like say an app it will still
push notifications from those apps on
your on your phone to your watch so even
if they don't have an output watch
developed for your app you'll still see
it on your you'll stay associating on
your watch
that's just coming from the mobile app
yes yeah right now we as I mentioned
there's what they call a short form and
long-form watch specific notification we
haven't developed those out yet but
those would be different from from these
that originated from the phone all right
there are no more questions I'll
continue oh well this is just a zoom in
of it all right so force touch let's
talk about that for a little bit now
when you have a watch app one thing that
you should notice there are no menus
right where are the menus like enough I
phone you could have like a hamburger on
the browser you'll have you know all
sorts of menus but really there's no
space here for menus so what Apple
actually has done is they have a new
gesture that is actually pretty novel
it's called the force touch and what
that means is that you could you could
tap a watch app and that would basically
be like a regular tap but if you were to
tab it harder more forcefully that's
that's called the force touch and what
if we do is in the UI you will basically
the fact that you will see is it will
push the screen back and then boom the
manual bounce back this is kind of neat
to see that so we actually have not
implemented in our life bar tap yet but
here's an example of an app that does it
and most of apple's native apps actually
the one that come in to watch they have
a force touch menu so this is a music
player app so you do a force touch and
then the menu comes out where you can do
other sort of things right so that
that's another thing that you can
consider while designing an Apple watch
so there's no menus I mean no
traditional menus but you got the the
menus that are
driven by divorce touch yep
the design for for the screen it comes
up with a force touch stairs I think
there's not that much flexibility
essentially what you can do is select
the number of icons so it's based one
two three or four and that's that's all
you can do and of course if it's one it
will be in the middle if it's too it
will be on the side three you got one
two and three in the middle here and for
is what this would look like but there's
at this point there's nothing much else
you can do with that that could change
in the future though yeah
well not having developed this quite yet
oh by the way prior to yesterday you can
even do this yet as a third-party
application developer starting yesterday
with the beta you can so I'm just
guessing here my guess is that you can
probably have your own icons and that
you can use over here and the API will
allow you to do more custom things but I
have yet to download yesterday's beta
and see what it can do yep
alright so that those are basically some
of the major differences between
developing on the iPhone and Apple watch
and is the kind of design concerns that
that you will have when you do this so
let's talk about watch OS to go though
and this is brand-new of the press this
just was released yesterday as a beta
and we haven't had the time to really
integrate that as I said but I want to
cover some of these things so I think
the most significant one is what they
call third-party complications and if
you don't know what is a complication
and worry I didn't know what it was
either until I read this but a
complication is basically a little bit
of information from a third party app by
the way I'm talking about third-party
complications because the watch already
has Apple complications right so this is
the third party notification you can see
her pheww emblem what this is is
actually the app that tells a electric
VW owner how I'll fold their car is
being charged okay so that's a
complication this here is not a
complication i think this one is for an
app that controls the light in your
house here's another complication this
complication basically shows you the
Parcher time for a flight going from san
francisco to whatever ORD is fine 88 @ 3
45 p.m. so those are complications are
little bits of information that you can
grab from another app and actually embed
it in the standard watch faces right so
um up to yesterday the only sort of
complications that you could put here
are like your activity app the weather
and just the ones that come with the
Apple watch itself so here's a few more
examples right this is a flight
information you got scores from 22
sports teams VW
and some home automation stuff okay so
that that's new into that oh and i think
that's can be very interesting to to
build it out let's see so the other kind
of things that are new with you though
are are these things so let me just
explain what they are and so the taptic
engine the taptic engine is a sensation
that as if somebody's tapping on your
wrist so if you have a watch and you can
actually set it up instead of like
ringing it could do the tapping thing
and then you'll actually feel it like
tap tap tap tap on your wrist is very
subtle you know very uninterested but
now as a third-party designer and
developer you can actually start to use
that the digital crown is this this
little dial so up to yesterday you could
only use it for scrolling through your
table basically but now you actually
have full control over what you want to
do with it you could maybe use it to
zoom in or zoom out or other sort of
things the accelerated accelerometer and
it basically kept records the speed in
which you move your arm so you can
actually have certain apps that make use
of that like if you want to do is
swinging you know count how fast you can
swing a bat or something you know that
sort of thing heart rate sensor that's
that's now available the speaker
microphone so with this new update we
can now start developing and designing
apps that make use of that
so let's see that basically concludes
what I wanted to share for for designing
for Apple watch I know it's not exactly
responsive but I hope that's through
this you can learn a bit more about the
design concerns that you would
experience if you were to develop an
Apple watch app also join it up Joe
consoling is a sponsor for this event
I'm the president of it Kevin and Jeremy
or part of it as well and you know if
you as a designer you have a terrific
idea of building an app will be more
than happy to help you come and talk to
me I got my business cards right here
also if you are looking for a job I
might actually have something for you we
have clients that need that need app
development even web responsive web
design lots of things that are that are
in our pipeline including business
analyst testing you name it you know we
have all of that and that basically is
it Kevin oh yeah questions questions and
answers yeah i know we covered some
already during the talk but if you have
any more now let me know
okay I think it's useful like right now
if I if I open my mail app in the on the
watch I see the subject heading I see a
few words of what's coming next is like
Oh what was happening I click on it and
nothing happens I actually want to be
able to see that and the to God Oh will
actually allow you to do more things
with the mail app then you can actually
reply on the phone on the on the watch
itself in my opinion would be useful
because otherwise i would have to take
out my phone again and look at it but
this is my opinion yeah
yes like there
yep it actually does a speech
recognition in fact I could reply to
text I can I can do various things with
this thing just using the speech to text
kind of interface let me see if it works
here like I'm going to I'm going to I'm
going to text Kevin hey Kevin this is a
great meet up and i'm sending it there
looks like a good work
there you go so it's actually pretty
good in terms of its speech to text
recognition so you can be driving you
could be doing something and I've itit
actually happen to me you can actually
receive calls on this thing as well when
the phone rings and you don't want to
pick it up you can actually speak to
your your watch like this so you'll see
like Star Trek and you know all kinds of
you usually basically you will see
people doing this more in the future
that's a great question yeah I I don't
know whether to watch or the phone doing
the speech to text conversion but it's
actually pretty quick yeah I I believe
it runs in the background because the
the vital statistics it just keeps on
going now because I can check now how
long I've been standing or walking or
sitting and that just keeps on going you
don't have to keep an app open for that
the I don't know about the accelerometer
how that works per se but my guess it's
not
how much more work at stake that's a
great question so how much more work
does it take to build an Apple watch app
if you already have a iphone app I think
actually getting the iphone app out is
probably doing a lot of the work already
because remember all the data that you
need to get from the api's is going
through the iphone app so in that sense
if you already have done that heavy
lifting of getting the data then it's a
matter of creating the extension and
getting it on the phone screen which of
course takes some work but it's just a
little bit more incremental you know for
us it took us two months or so to do but
it took me a lot longer to get the basic
phone app I'm out yeah it doesn't work
that way at this point right now one
watch can be paired to one phone only
it's a one-to-one connection yeah so if
you want to somehow communicate from one
watch app to another whatsapp as long as
they they both have their own paired
phones and there's a common app that
they run and then you could probably do
that you know I mean just that's just
our messaging and other things work
right yeah
yep
oh i know i said i used the objective-c
but you can also use Swift and both of
them would work on creating a map of
Apple watch app it's it's using the the
bridge you can actually pretty much
intermingle objective-c code and swift
code within the same app not right now
at least not automatically you just have
to code it out in in in the storyboard
oh yeah that is right so you need at
least some dummy iphone app that just
exists it might not do anything but at
least it's there to feed the data or
something yeah so you cannot have an
watch app without a native iphone app
for now action indications are that I
think that in the future we will have
native apps on on the watch I've been
reading some things yesterday on what's
to come and I think that's not too far
away for life word oh sure so for for
life part we are adding well we are
adding better notifications that's one
we're adding a map like uber kind of
thing where you can see moving trains
just because it's cool let's see what
else do we want to do we probably want
to have some planning functionality over
there and the lac courte app is really
just for fun that the Jeremy and I are
working on just to show what we can do
any other questions I think this is I
boots you probably give the floor to
whoever has any you know who's looking
for people to recruit right yeah well
thanks a lot Christian okay okay so i'll
do some lightning talks now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
