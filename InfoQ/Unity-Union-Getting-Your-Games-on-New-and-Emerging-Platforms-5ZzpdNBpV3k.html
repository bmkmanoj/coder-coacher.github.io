relations program at unity i am the
entire program how many unique
developers are out in the audience this
evening oh my god that's fantastic you
know isn't it great how easy game
development has been made because of our
cross-platform tool you are able to
literally let's see there we go author
once and deploy anywhere Windows PC Mac
iOS Android browsers consoles and as of
yesterday with our 3.5 engine release we
have made chrome native client
development included in our basic
offering and we've shipped a public
preview of the most powerful game
development tool for 3d games for flash
so we're pretty proud about what we're
doing but there's always the question of
is that enough are there more platforms
that you want to distribute your games
to are their devices on which you want
your games to be on that unity doesn't
support and unity has an answer for that
question it's called union union's an
inventive new program that unity has
started to help you guys reach platforms
that currently aren't supported with our
tool set it's just as though just like
unity is helping to democratize the
development of 3d gaming so Union is
helping to democratize the publishing
and distribution channels that are
available to you this is a really
powerful program and i want to show you
how it works i want to explain it to you
in simple terms how this works if you're
going to developer you come to us and
you tell us what you're making and we
evaluate it for you
for Union from a technical standpoint
when we work with games in Union we
bring it to an array of new and emerging
platforms including blackberry playbook
various Smart TVs and non iOS and
Android operating systems we do not
however work with iOS we don't publish
to any of the consoles nor do we publish
to any of the current handheld systems
so we're taking that off the screen more
specifically with the platforms that we
do work with right now there are five
rim's blackberry playbook nokia n9 which
is a Mego based mobile handset sony
ericsson xperia play handset which is
android-based roku which is a set-top
box that's designed for streaming video
content like Hulu and Netflix which is
now supporting games and then we've also
our latest partnership is with LG last
month during CES we showed games running
unity games running on 2012 LG Smart TV
hardware we were pretty proud of what we
were able to show we had madfinger games
a--'s 2011 iOS title ios and android
title shadowgun running at 30 frames per
second at 1080p on LG hardware so we're
able to do a lot with the engine on
these emerging platforms which i think
you know given the the early steps that
developers and and middleware platforms
are taking on these emerging devices
like smart TVs we're able to do some
powerful games some some some get some
really strong performance out of the
engine and that's great for you guys
because that means that you can build
sophisticated 3d games that we can help
you distribute to these new platforms we
operate on a competitive revenue share
basis Union has actually had no
immediate direct upfront cost to you as
a unity developer if your game is
accepted and passes that initial
technical evaluation that we perform we
are we will finance the porting process
and our own development team will
actually do the work
sporting the game to the platforms that
we agree to move forward on eighty
percent of the revenue that's derived
from sales flows back to you now just to
note that is after the OEM the hardware
manufacturer takes their share that
varies according the platforms most of
the hardware OEMs operate on very
similar to apple with a 70-30 revenue
split so the 8020 revenue share that
Union provides kicks in after that
amount that's still great because if you
have a game that you want to distribute
to these other platforms there's no risk
to you unions putting forward the
financing and doing the work to port the
game over so you can only make money as
a unity developer in Union and that's
what's so great about it and I wouldn't
just take my word for it ask the unity
developers that are currently enrolled
in the plot in the in Union there are
more than 40 developers including
alchemy labs which you guys may you know
know from snuggle truck game resort
madfinger as i mentioned phoenix fire
who's ios and android game Roboto has
been quite successful and dozens more
developers who have created fantastic 3d
content that we're helping to bring on a
range of new devices and that's really
what it's all about for me and everyone
at unity is helping you guys make games
and getting those games into the hands
of people everywhere regardless of what
the platform is these are the games that
we have in Union more will be added in
the coming months I hope to talk with
you the unity developers in the audience
and even if you're not unity using unity
now you know maybe this entices you can
kind of puts the the weight on the scale
for you to come and join join the the
unit icks as we like to call it over at
unity because we want to help make you
successful because at the end of the day
if you guys are a success than unity is
a success so you can send me an email at
Tracy at unity 3 d.com if you have any
specific questions about union or unity
in general or if you'd like to submit a
game for consideration for Union i will
use remaining my time to answer some
questions beginning with you sir sure so
when we make a decision to bring a unity
title
to Union we do a technical evaluation
that will first assess whether or not
you know the game is going to make sense
on a given platform so if you're doing a
shooter you know that might work really
well on a touchscreen device it might be
a little harder to pull off on a smart
TV where there's only a remote so we may
not necessarily be doing multiple
versions of a particular game and
hitting all five platforms we may only
be working with one rgr arc we have a QA
process that our own internal
development team uses we you know I'm
pretty keen on being on working closely
with our developer partners its your
game I want to make sure you're happy
with it you know so we are in constant
communication with our developers making
sure that they feel comfortable with the
releases because ultimately you know
we're doing it for you guys so um not
really because the games that we're
using or complete so it from from from
an initial development standpoint it's
already gone through the developers QA
process or if it's been published we're
porting and we have our own QA process
so if we can spend a lot of time going
back and forth making modifications
between two different development teams
on a ported version but we've prefer to
just have that QA process with our own
internal development team to streamline
the processing and actually get to a
release date the question is when can we
play facebook games and and kind of
extrapolating out from that when can we
play games on the web that don't require
Unity's plugin i would say first of all
unities plugin is actually a very robust
platform on which to distribute your
game to the web we have a hundred
million people have installed our plugin
so you know and I you know the gentleman
from big point who had talked earlier
about some of their great games you know
a lot of their games are running on our
plugin as well so there's a lot of
performance you can get out of that if
you're not happy with just reaching 100
million people we get that and that's
why yesterday we added support for
chrome Native Client will chill enable
users of Chrome which is about 300
million installs to be able to play
games natively in their browser we have
several games already about half a dozen
that have been really
east on the chrome web store that run a
Native Client but beyond that we're
actually adding where that were the only
3d game development engine that has
provided tools for flash development and
we've gone much further than just
talking about developing a tool for
flash we've actually shipped a public
preview and you can get that today in
our 3.5 version of our engine that has a
full suite of 3d development features
that will enable you to export unity
games into flash we haven't announced a
final release date for that tool but it
will be coming and you can make games
and tinker around with the tools today
the question is does unity support
window mobile platform at this time we
don't do not support windows phone the
reason is pretty straightforward
Microsoft has maintained windows phone
as a closed development ecosystem they
haven't granted any third-party
developer access to native access to the
operating system at the native level
they've pledged recently to make Windows
8 you know to grant companies like unity
developers native access to their code
you know we're looking into that you
know later this year we're waiting for
more details on Microsoft as to exactly
how Windows 8 desktop and tablet will
interact with the mobile device and how
unity could potentially be a partner in
shaping that ecosystem I'll go ahead and
take your question sir in the black so
the question to encapsulate what you're
asking is you know are what should i do
if i want to take advantage of social
networking features on facebook or
openfeint or the forthcoming gree global
platform or mobage how do i you know
basically when i'm developing a game and
i want to take advantage of all of these
social networks on these various
platforms that's a lot of work right did
you want to integrate with one to do
just facebook is a lot of work what's
great is that our engineering team is
currently working on a mass one central
social api that will essentially do you
will be able to write one master list of
achievements one set of you know
leaderboards that will then populate
each of those social networks literally
clicking a box now some of that has been
integrated
some of that i should say some of that
functionality has been introduced in 3.5
as of yesterday we've started with Apple
Game Center and there are some API
targets for Xbox 360 achievements the
full rollout the full suite of social
API features won't be rolled out until
later this year but we're working on it
I had two minutes anybody else have any
other questions yes over here
PlayStation Vita is the topic that was
raised we haven't made any announcements
about playstation vita I think as
everyone in this room we are watching
very with great anticipation for the
launch that will be happening next week
here in North America and also Europe
and you know right now we don't have
anything to announce but I would
definitely keep watch on that space
great thank you so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
