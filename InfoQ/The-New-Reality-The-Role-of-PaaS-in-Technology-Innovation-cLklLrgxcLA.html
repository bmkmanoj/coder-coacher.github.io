afternoon my name is Franklin nervous I
work for essay p part of the plataforma
strategy group I considered a privilege
to give a talk to a development
community I mean after all when you
think about it you are the ones that
actually build control those basic
information that I actually change in
our lives depending on the conference
that you will participate you will hear
that today we are you know in a way in
the midst of a number of revolutions if
you were to go into one of the one of
the conference's you will hear a
revolution on gaming a real time
revolution Big Data mobile social media
revolution on a mon all of that movement
that is quite significant for the
development community certainly you are
in the middle of it developers more than
ever right now are the main focus of for
many companies and in a way just like we
have seen it may be and it's another
time in during the dot-com are they the
kings of this new era now what I would
like to do in the next 45 minutes it's
actually drilled down a little bit more
on this topic I would also like to
discuss how developers once linked or
once these developers have started
leveraging the right platform can
actually address some of the most
challenging business challenges that
industries are experiencing today
developing applications that we have
never seen before I would like to tell
you and touch on some point some
suggestions when you are evaluating
platforms as a service what are the
areas that you should pay close
attention when you are exploring
platform-as-a-service some of the most
innovative technologies like such as
like in memory technology being a
all to handle big data on a high
performing way for you to address some
of the business challenges of industries
today so with that in mind let me first
step back and give you an introduction
of back on 2003 an article came up by
the Harvard Business Review Nicholas
Carr an article titled that it doesn't
it doesn't matter yep you have to look
back and see what really happened during
this time on 2003-2004 innovation
technology was fundamental for companies
this is the time where companies they
start investing or only in hardware bar
in software in order for them to have a
competitive advantage very often wear
during his son if you were to ask chief
operating officers there were clearly a
state and publicly real estate that
information technology is fundamental
for them to increase their value that IT
was fundamental for them to have a
competitive edge during this time is
where I t was in a way put us in an
analogy and link to some of the
activities that happen on during the
railroad times or when engines with
electric engines the generators as our
first came in innovations that change
how industry and reshape in industries
for the last two centuries and even
until now i will say that at its that it
stays true because I T is bringing that
differentiating value for many for many
companies so during this time you have
all of all of this movement from
companies saying we want a competitive
edge we want to differentiate
differentiate ourselves and therefore
investing on it and paying close
attention to information technology now
when this article comes what happens on
the other states is that this increase
availability of technology actually made
they made the IT costs decrease
and bring it on the point of nicholas
Nicholas Carr was that many of these
technology became a commodity so
therefore because of cross came down
this a strategic stamp approach was did
not matter anymore and therefore the
title of his of his article that I T
does not matter anymore there are
references on this article where where
he he calls us where he mentions and
says that IT management will be in a way
boring that activity that they should
pay close attention to the operating
risks are very little to the to the
increase to the increase of new
opportunities right so so you have that
perception that is taking place backup
2003-2004 and then not long ago mark
analyst when I believe an arm on a wire
interview but why magazine interview
here stays that software will lead the
world in that interview some of the
reference that he makes is because we do
have the mobile devices in our hands
knowing that the bad new capabilities
are increasing it is suspected that
development of the future applications
will be done on the cloud taking
advantage of the computational power and
the high performing memory storage that
cloud offerings offer today he made key
points in regards of how digital
companies are actually changing the
shape of how industries behave he made
references of how craiglist actually
change the news the newspaper industry
how for every million dollars that
craiglist of craigslist revenue a
billion dollar was taking from the from
the from the newspaper industry he may
references of how Amazon highly effects
on borders for example so what really
happened between these two times what
are four for the perceptual to change so
radically moving beats to Adams has been
the model for the Internet age right it
was first it was brought up but I
believe
his name was montenegro Nicholas
Montenegro I believe anyway what he
accomplished in a publication back of
1995 it basically in 1995 I think the
book was called being an anneal
analytical what he is stress is that we
are the future innovation and future
fortunes where I T is leading will be
made by innovating on these bits of
information on that computing power
right moving from physical like let's
say books to digitally or by leveraging
those that bit of information companies
will become quite successful and would
make big fortune this is a 1995
certainly that estates hold on to to
actually today that statement is more
true than ever because we have seen how
companies some of the most precious
assets of companies are actually that
does those beasts of information we have
seen how companies have taken
mathematical intelligence algorithms and
have tuning into beats I make those
precious assets the fundamental driving
force of those companies so we see that
activity we also see and by the way this
differentiation between fixed assets or
atoms as it calls and a beat is becoming
more or less of one or the other but
rather of a marriage well we are seeing
right now on cloud computing we see
software Taino for a hardware same thing
we see a mobile being able to add build
software control software that is
tailored to the specific hardware so
that is becoming less apparent that you
have either atoms or base but rather a
marriage of both and certainly display
under there is one of the most
fundamental changes that takes place
during this time is explosion there were
high volumes of of data I mean we have
what we being experiences we've been
experiencing in in sa p is you have
these companies with vast amounts
of information that I believe some of
them are dealing with terabytes of
information X of ice I believe it is
expected that on 2014 will be dealing
with three profiles Sita bytes of global
data unprecedented numbers right but at
the end we are facing companies we are
dealing with companies that do not know
how to manage these vast amounts of
information that are a composition of
transactional data raw data social data
right being able not only to build
analytics on top of it by being able
just to manage that information being
able to slice and dice it to provide the
answers that the operation departments
need or the decision-makers demand
certainly we those two movement a Steven
upgraded Nelson right on the head on
2012 I believe an analyst from red monk
when he stays that developers are the
new key makers and that certainly holds
true on that on that book you will find
references of how developers play in a
strategic strategic role in the success
of a company that the most fundamental
and essential piece of a company I is a
development strategy you find reference
without a those statistics and a number
of other they painted the picture that
the ones that actually make or break a
company are actually the developers that
node managers but rather developers are
they are the breakers of a company are
they key fundamental piece for a company
to be successful something that is
actually backed up by companies that are
going out in the statement that says it
there is no company that I've seen the
same as from a number of companies where
that pretty much make a reference of no
one expense or pays more attention than
asked in regards of getting the best
people on board so without in mind I
would like to talk of two different
innovations that really take place
during this time back up 2005 with
amazon web server
you can see from the and all of this
from the developer perspective obviously
you can see from from from this
innovation from from the cloud offering
you see you see the available for for
developers now to be able to have in
their hands a runtime is scalable
solution with enough elasticity to build
solutions that before we couldn't
couldn't be done right being able to
approach business problems that demand
very complex programming models without
movement you see a number of a number of
activity I mean you're talking about not
only leveraging the computational power
but also their own border of
developments to the onboarding of
development into the cloud offering what
does that mean I've worked in a number
of companies we're friends of mine after
we were done development and I'm sure
you you're you're still dealing with
this their whole role was to be able to
take these this development code that we
have done to integrate it tested and
deployed before the next development
cycle will actually start meaning before
we actually come back in the morning
I've work in a company where the
assembly team does does what the label
of this theme was to columbus on time at
five o'clock in the afternoon we are
leaving the company being able to take
all the code that we have done it start
the batch process to not only redeploy
for it to be usable again for when we
will come in the morning I've seen this
in a company in a couple of companies
now i am not saying that sign of the
testing techniques on of the integration
offerings that we have on the wearable
art changes sign of that circle is still
continuous however the cloud offerings
are certainly making it easier for
developers to avoid some of those
nuances it is clear now that developers
can conceive building an application and
concentrated how I can actually do the
data management of these big data
suppose of worrying about how the batch
process and you know that will work
being able to
uska do for some of the data set results
they don't worry less about being able
to put a data graph a massive data graph
into an HTTP session because they do
know of the cloud offering and the power
computing the dark cloud offering has so
certain certainly cloud from that point
on own is getting better and better
making the life of developers easier and
allowing companies to solve issues that
they have never explored before now
mobility it is nothing new you're aware
of how mobility has changed the way of
how we see applications especially from
a development perspective for the first
time your developers are looking of how
we can accomplish things that could
include in that before for a number of
years we have trained many of our
customers that the only way for them to
get their analytical data that is based
on sometimes and terabytes is for them
to wait for a batch to end at the end of
the day or or weekly customers now are
very much aware of what is taking place
and technology and are demanding for us
technology providers and for you to
build solutions mobile solutions that I
actually show that their data in real
time I'm experiencing and I be managing
number of projects where one of the key
requirements is build a solution where
real-time insight into the big data must
be done and must be done at my
fingertips it might be displayed and
mobile device so the challenge here for
developers is how do I actually
correlate these bad smells of
information and is streamlined to a
mobile device I'll touch much more in
detail in a couple of slides so what
developers are today more important than
ever if you think about it you are the
ones that are actually taking like an
example I just game taking mathematical
intelligence algorithms and algorithms
and turn those into bits into software
you are the ones that are taking code is
building code is
a snippet or you're actually building
the code of behavior by taking all the
click through all the sites that we are
visiting all the search that we are
doing taking all that behavior all of
our interactivity with the software and
tune in that behavior in tabriz you are
actually building social graphs based on
my interaction with social media sites
like Facebook or Twitter or by my
interaction with my mobile device right
you are the ones that are actually
taking making making this possible so
and that leads to big data if you think
just to bring this into perspective some
of our customers just just to give you
some examples I am aware of some of the
consumer product goods companies we are
experiencing in a particular one project
5,000 data sets this is for a product
care company that does product for
product for proper care this company has
5,000 data sets per millisecond every 33
milliseconds that means 150,000 data
sets per second 15 billion per day
another company one of our
telecommunications companies is
generating 12 terabytes per week of the
landline phone calls 12 terabytes per
week we have also in a CPG one company
that has a hundred and fifty and 125,000
orders transaction ordered people buying
100 125 thousand orders coming in from
Las 155,000 they employ 400 people
because from those 125,000 1400 all
those orders have discrepancies so they
employ
14 400 people just to solve the order
discrepancies when I talk about bass
amounts of information certainly we are
facing us as SI p dealing with big large
companies certainly we do know of the
challenges that our that our companies
are facing right but the IDC reports
that the course that I just gave you it
is especially that the global data to go
into twenty thirty five point two
gigabytes of seta bytes I mean that is
one plus 21 zeros of global data now
when you look at sensor networks right
for quite some time companies such as
like utilities mining oil and gas have
been deploying sensors across the grades
occurs at telecommunication services
wherever these sensors I have the
opportunity to manage a number of these
these sensors are reading sometimes ten
sometimes hundreds of readings of
temperature readings per second now if
you if you look at these sensor networks
you're looking at a number of thousands
of sensors deploying into a grid now in
a central location where all this
information is going terabytes of
information on a weekly basis going into
these central locations for them to make
sense out of these raw data right very
often this raw data eventually becomes
garbage right that is the reality it is
just too much amount but they're already
coming up knocking the doors in
technology provided like I saying we we
need to make sense we need to establish
patterns we need to identify patterns
from download data because our decision
makers needed in order to avoid block
outs in order to wear depending on
depending on the scenario this is this
is the reality today so that censored
while at the beginning these sensor
networks were here I take a sensor
starts take taking temperature readings
and they put their moving to a central
location for that central location to a
slice and dice and build analogies from
that point on while that
was was through where is moving right
now is that you have pieces of code
close with nodes to those sensors
intelligent pieces of code close to
those to those nodes that actually know
where what each sensor what kind of data
each sensor is monitoring in other words
those in certain areas are becoming
intelligent right that there's no the
concept of a central place where i will
move all my data and build on the links
for an appoint on that is possible only
because developers are pushing the
boundaries of what sensor net which
should mean in the future pushing the
boundaries not only that these sensors
will let's say monitor sensor activity
but maybe even connect to appliances and
send us notifications now one of the
most desired skills for a number of
projects that i am aware of is being for
developers such as like you to be able
to understand the api's from twitter or
facebook to bring that and a structural
content from from from those sources and
give them a business meeting let me give
you an example and that is the part of
social let me give you an example I am a
I have the opportunity to work in a
project where in order to provide
sentiment analysis based on on social
media you demand for developers to be
able to understand the APS from these
networking sites be able to monitor and
use that data and map it to transactions
that in order to give a business meeting
for what reason in sentiment analysis
you have a company that wants to monitor
their brand or they just release a new
product and they want to make sure that
that product is successful as they
expected the first place where a company
has issues of a brand or probably a Rico
product it is actually on the web I have
I became aware of some of the scenarios
of the companies that we are deal with
they do know that the first places were
the first place where
our consumers actually their customers
are complaining about their brand or a
particular product it's actually face
was actually Twitter so they have a
particular interest to do sentiment
analysis on those and monitor for a
specific patterns right so from the
developers perspective here's a unique
skill set a combination of the
enterprise and social media being able
to deal with the api's of of social
media and at the same time link that to
transactional data in order to give a
business meaning in this case a
real-time scenario now in another area
in another area it is suspected from you
that you will develop applications that
are always on more than other ever there
is a requirement that developers that
are going to build the next generation
of applications will be applications
that are always connected and they will
run in a number of devices now desired
expectations from your customers and
other as petitions from my customers
that we were actually deliver
applications that are always connected
so here you're dealing to be able to
identify the right platform for you to
deploy those applications that will will
give your customers the connectivity
that they expect meaning always
connected and also the flexibility of
leveraging whatever device they need so
let me share with you a number of
concrete examples in this case in the in
the area of new ways of connected
consumers and the topic of real time
what we have implemented for our for one
of our customers is a is a possibility
and this is a solution from sa p based
based on our own on our on our platform
as a Service Cloud offering where you
could do trade personalized three
promotions to individuals meaning that
you go into a retail store and what you
will receive on your phone is / it's a
promotion personalized for you that it
will be different promotion for the
person next to you for example
what does that mean how is that possible
from the development perspective it
means that companies already have as a
lawyer company or maybe already
registered with them but they already
know we already know all the purchases
that you're doing through them they
already know the purchaser you've done
to them because you're loyal customer
they might already have your some other
consumer information so you have here in
one area all the personal information
needed your purchase our channel for a
company to actually launch a promotion
based on what you purchase a specific
for you and different from the one that
is next to you they're pushing the
limits on on this and they're basically
looking into will discipline all
customers why not we look on our
enterprise data into the inventory
levels of our of the particular server
you're walking in and find out it really
this product is having problems being
sold because we might not even have to
do a promotion being able to in real
time turn the switch and decide if a
trade promotion campaign shull applied
should be lunch to any specific user go
beyond just given a the three promotion
to a user but actually make make the
software intelligent enough to make the
decision if the promotion should be
given it should be given to you I have
seen these not only retail I have the
opportunity to work on a utility
scenario where the plant managers in
charge of a grid Network before what
they used to have over the user
experience responsible of outages these
are these are decision-makers that need
to know at any point in time if there is
a potential audition on on a grid this
is a company in South Africa where these
plant managers are working around the
plan with with the smart devices and
through their smart devices they were
when we were approached them and the
reason why they approached us is through
the smart devices this person regarding
savills weekend or holidays every hour
had to press the sync button or refresh
button to figure out if the grid was
behaving as inspect
so the requirement was I want to
leverage the sensory information that I
already exists in the grid monitoring
the temperature readings and analogous
and so forth and I want to be alerted
when when some of the readings are going
on a walk the son of the Rings are just
not normal looking for some anomalies
right this is affecting the day-to-day
life of any specific consumer similar to
the retailer but you have here in see
similar to retail but here you having
utilities what it implies for the
development respective and just to share
some insight with you it implies that
these utilities have a scatter
assistance with raw data with maximal
vast amounts of information on raw data
they have the social aspect they have
I'm aware of one oil and gas company
that has 3,000 backing systems 3,000
back and sisters with business
information right when you deal without
that type of information it means that
it is it is all about big data but from
a development perspective it means that
i should be able know first to connect
to those data sources a platform that
will allow you to connect to those data
sources once you connect to those phases
or replicate those data sources into a
high-performing database where you can
actually build the right analytics to
build up the applications that you need
in our scenario was actually connect to
those as care assistants or to the skela
sister dialogue because as if you're
committing our utility companies or deal
with SCADA systems if you see some ants
if you have dealt with them you know
that the SCADA systems are the Bible's
of utilities you don't touch his current
system so you have they have these
intermediate intermediary systems where
you connect so what it imply developers
our developers have to connect to those
systems correlate get the hands on that
information on to into an in-memory
high-performing storage database being
able to correlate all that information
and and show it in analytical way to the
health of the decision maker in this in
this case a mobile device now from the
consumer perspective from the enterprise
level you can think of some of the
advances that we are doing on supply
chain that
tied to real time in here we have what
is taking place in india and the Kirana
stores i see some people shaking their
hand they hear what you were we are
built a point of sale system that it
will allow these stores that are doing
everything manual and maybe with a
laptop behind the counter we are we have
give them the possibility to have a
point of sale system on a mobile device
where they can actually connect your
suppliers for them to have the items
that they need right a very fundamental
just an app on a mobile device for them
to run their business more successful
and have a chance to the conglomerate
such as like warmer going and moving
into into in india right this is this is
a kind of like David goggle-eyed kind of
kind of kind of kind of thing but at
least you have the chance for these for
this Quranic stores to have that it's
more competitively h22 still keep their
customers now these might be on on on a
CPG type of scenario on a on a retail
scenario one of the projects that i am
aware of is how we have monitored also
in the suit and supply chain how we are
monitored the footprint of people
walking into a store because you're
aware of all the sensors all the little
beeping right when you go into one of
those hard brand stores right they do
know what they call footprint they do
know how many people are in the store at
any point in time right they call they
call this footprint they also know the
transactions the purchase orders per day
or per minute they are where the systems
have that information they might have if
you're registered with this company they
might have your personal information to
buy say certainly know all the
transactions Gordon through the register
so they have what they call the
conversion rate they want to unknown
what is the conversion rate from the
people going in the store and the trash
is being entered in the cash register at
any point in time during the afternoon
here in the morning this
bration rating retail is used to
emphasize the promotion campaigns for in
a specific gender right because we can
identify if it's a female or male we can
identify how many people are in the
store what are the best times in order
for people to to embrace so the project
in this scenario was also related to
bringing they bring the enterprise
enough information correlate the
information coming from resources and
make sense out of it so now all of the
challenges are fascinating I can drill
down very much in detail for many of any
of this but I'm going to highlight in a
little bit faster way a couple of weeks
ago there was a conference where Ford
went on the stage and said that they
were actually going to leverage your
smart devices the applications that you
already have on your smart devices and
they have these called the sync
technology or uplink I believe they call
it where they were actually linked the
applications are this and the mobile
device that you already have with their
me there with a media interface to
interact with a dou to do what I don't
know exactly what but they announced it
right the what it captured my attention
the most on this talk was that the they
said it force is becoming a developer
centric company here you have another
mobile company putting an emphasis on a
developing sentry type of company
because they will actually open or maybe
make available to developers an
interface for you to be able to create
applications that attracted to the am
once again bringing the developer are
they putting the glue together in order
to make this possible giving the
developer all the api's this is sorry
for them to expand and build
applications that they would never seen
before on the automobile industry I mean
data gave it the revolution during
gaming is mind blowing 80 billion
dollars in two thousand twelve eighty
billion dollars expected or globally in
2012 for video games twenty billion
dollars for computer games two billion
for social gaming right
it is an industry bigger than the music
industry globally and tied with the film
industry and who are the ones making
this possible severe a development
community on the gaming on the gaming
industry the challenges of gaming teaser
are fascinating and because now they are
bringing big data analytics because they
do have a lot of big data they bring in
big data analytics to the behavior and
the patterns of the players right the
efforts the projects going on and these
are quite challenging supply chains
already touched in how we could actually
do early warning and supply chain being
able to identify your product and the
supply chain because all the invitation
all the information is there and we can
actually correlate it and get access to
it is already 60 years from the
discovery of the structure of the DNA I
mean to this year is also at the
University of the 10-year anniversary of
the genome project i believe and
personalized healthcare in me is a
personal scale is everything about being
able to do treatment or some type of
treatment for patients in order to by
leveraging their information their
genetic information there general
information the biological information
that hospitals and doctors have been
able to for develop to give to
developers on for for developers to come
up with the necessary tools for new
analytic treatment prevention of
illnesses and so forth from the SP
perspective an hour in-memory computing
we have invested quite a bit on the
health care as my grades already told
you number case we also we should think
that its market does not only tied to
utilities in telecommunication you have
the smart meters in in smart meters and
telecommunications you also have a smart
building being able to build your
depending on how much users you have
this is something that the scenario that
I've seen in asia-pacific but much more
than that right if you think about big
data big data analysis finally gives you
the best answers but actually creates
more problems for you regards because
you have to analyze the data when you
link big data to semantics and
artificial intelligence similar to what
i say IBM has done with Watson right you
could actually potentially have sent a
question to that vast amounts of data
and for the software to give you the
right answer depending on the scenario
this is what we are seeing in in public
safety being able to handle all from the
time that incident occurs being able to
correlate information and alert a
command control center or emergency
respondents right in a number of areas
developers are in the middle of it now
what how do we become how do we actually
take advantage of and of being
developers and become the key makers
that as I code referred I will to
conclude on my presentation I would like
to highlight three different areas being
able to have the right plataform the
right computer platform and this is
where here I suggest to you areas where
you should play close attention being
able to have the riper for the right
platform a solution on the cloud a
high-performing solution of the cloud
that will give you the the features and
capabilities needed in order to handle
build data and the real-time aspect it
is clear that the user expectations and
technology capabilities must be met your
customers our customers are asking for
it they're telling us that issue we
always be connected if you run in all
devices you should take advantage of
social net or so the social experience
it should be in real time I want to
slice and dice I want to analytics from
that point on right and the technology
capabilities must match to it but when
you think of what are the expectations
when you think that okay available all
the time and in all devices that's what
mobility and cloud gives me real time in
memory computing and the more that
companies are thinking of what really
entails in order to suffice the user
expectations the bigger the challenge
comes and the taller is just too big
it is to an economical to have it in one
health so what do we do right this is
where platform-as-a-service it is
address as many of these issues in a
subscription basis you can actually have
a platform that has all the services
needed in order to build the
applications that deal with these vast
amounts of information a plataforma that
by you using it will take advantage not
only of the service the portal services
that he might have take advantages of
the dashboard analytics all the analytic
models that are already part of it being
able to leverage the collaboration being
able to have all the governance such as
like compliance and so forth but it is
clear that those solutions those
services alone do not solve the problem
of real time and big data especially
knowing that you have all types of
information variety of data the secret
sauce in here is in memory computing and
it is no secret especially viewing in
India AP world that ASAP hannah is our
in memory cloud solution in-memory
computing solution now from day one we
have built a solution based on the
technology that relies on distribution
completely distributed computing being
able to do to leverage the multi-core
CPUs many CPUs running one cheap been
able for processors to talk to talk to
each other genes in such a fast way by
leveraging terabytes of information some
of the scenarios that we're dealing with
it's like an in-memory solution we four
terabytes everything on in memory when
you think of our of an in-memory
database such as I the ones ASAP has
ASAP hana from the first point that you
interact with the database everything is
loaded in columns and rows depending how
you develop the application but
everything is in memory we take
advantage of parallel processing because
of the column storage column column and
storage facilities for us to do use a
number of compression techniques
that were not possible or relational
databases being able to take advantage
of the multi-core multi-core CPUs being
able to allocate coral processors two
columns in parallel hundreds of
processors are located to different
parts of the application in order for
four to have the high-performing
expectation that customers want not only
being able to allocate high-performing
CPUs two columns but in an in-memory
database you can actually have one
column and an assigned processor power
to different sections of that column the
first place where we actually were big
data actually knock the door in ASAP was
actually certainly our data warehousing
right this is where companies will
actually store everything on a data
warehouse solution that's a mass of
information and we were actually have to
sort of slice and dice and sometimes
give them batch queries or 30 minute
process would take for you to actually
have the final report sometimes days
depending on how much those data were
health solutions have but well so what
we did we actually start using
materialized hydrogen's right in order
to aggregate the information buffering
techniques in the city needs it gave us
a tenfold in millisec we could actually
have access to scan data gigabytes of
information of information in
millisecond but when you are dealing
with the amounts of information that I
just may reference of coming from a
number of industry that is just not
enough and in-memory computing because
everything is an in-memory actually
addresses and solves that actually with
our in the memory solution you don't
have the need even to use materialized
aggregates you don't have the need to
agree aggregate all that information
that happens on the fly because of the
parallel processing because of the
colonists storage because of the
compression algorithms and so forth so
but certainly the in-memory computing
solution tied to a high computing
distribution system environment is not
enough right when you are building the
next generation of business solutions in
the future you must have the
data services on the I'm sorry the
services that come with it meaning that
you need to you need a place where to
display them you need a portal you need
the services for analytical viewing the
governor's hospital bed for in order for
you to manage that information so when
you look into platform-as-a-service what
you need to play close attention and
this is a suggested that I give to you
is it must handle big data because it
doesn't matter how many fancy you I
services has or how much govern and it
has without handling the big data you
will you you you will come up with
problems fine finally an ecosystem I'm
sorry an end to end user experience it
is expected from the developers
perspective that we will actually use
some of the design principles right
there's no way of thinking of being able
to incorporate into the tooling design
the same thinking this is a way of
looking of how to build applications
that are more related to X to the human
experience you use your own tools we are
now logging into a language being able
to use the programming tools that you
understand that you are familiar with
without being logged in into any
specific language that's what you should
look into a platform being able to end
this whole traditional way of from batch
processing be enabled this way of being
able to before you actually see the
early sort of what you've developed do
you have to batch it and test it and
rebuild it management certainly quite
important being able to have IT
governance not only for the developer
but for the enterprise that that pays
close attention to security security and
security this is a big one especially in
the enterprise as well as being
compliant to a standards now one of the
things that we online might not be
familiar I certainly was not familiar
when my times of developer is that that
possibility though you having the power
of whatever you do gaming social
networking
real-time whatever Dulcinea is you're
dealing with right now having the power
of leveraging an ecosystem for you to
collaborate on the code for you to
making those applications available for
mass adoption for that matter and for
those applications to always be
connected finally the the marketplace
aspect and to finalize I would like to
say is that when you look into a product
from you should pay close attention that
whatever you deploy out there you should
have it should be viewed by many if you
have the potential of mass adoption
right being able to collaborate not only
as in a community of developers by being
able to expose the applications that you
build to everyone be able to monetize
that code depending their platforms are
you looking you should be able to see
does it actually allow me to monetize on
the library's coded snippets or or
packages that I'm building and I'm on a
test on this word that I am doing can I
monetize on them and can I actually
address Big Data solutions and so forth
over applications can actually embrace
and hence these dis platter from that
and dealing with by providing additional
services maybe build an application that
is integrated with another other cloud
applications being able even to sell
content we have big industry we have
developers a community that is actually
providing data mappings for industries
that is actually providing analytical
models and making those availables also
for monetization so as Ian I would like
to highlight that from the ACP
perspective we have the ACP HANA cloud
platform a place where developers can
actually not only innovate built but
also extend the applications that
address all the challenges that we that
companies are currently facing today in
real time being data and so forth these
is possible through the innovation that
we have done on in-memory computing
leveraging highly distributed computing
systems the services that we are putting
on top in order for that data to be
visible analytical mobile poor role and
so forth I'm making
at the end you know that they allowing
the developer to to show their work and
to a community that we did a collaborate
or a community that we actually will
consume these applications so I'll
invite all of you to go to SLP hannover
com that will kind of like open the
doors for you to settle the concepts
that I have explained in this
presentation to settle the technology
that I've explained in this presentation
and I know I'm running out of time so
without I thank you for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
