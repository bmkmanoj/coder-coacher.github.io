foursquare and I'm talking about a an
alternative build tool that we've been
working on called pants and the goal of
pants is to improve what we call code
hygiene okay so to start off this is
probably somewhat unusual for this this
conference but this is not really a talk
about Scotland what this is is to talk
about solving the problems that we came
across in using Scala in our system so
you know what's happened to us is Scala
gives us a lot of really great stuff you
know parametric types with variants
implicit type classes all of that
wonderful stuff but as Dan noted in the
keynote this morning that stuff has a
real implication in build time and we
need to control that cost in order to in
order to be able to successfully build a
system so the background at Foursquare
our entire server is implemented in
Scala and I you know I can't tell you
exactly how big our code bases but it's
well over a hundred thousand lines of
code it's over 2,000 source files and
they're split up around five hundred or
so packages when we started this we used
SBT for builds and our clean bill times
in other words building fresh code was
averaging between 40 minutes and an hour
and this was on a massive machine I mean
the highest end laptops that we could
get 16 gigabytes of memory SSD disks
four cores with hyper-threading and
still we were talking about you know 40
to 60 minute build times and to make it
worse almost any time that we changed
any source file in the system we'd have
to recompile over a thousand Pat over a
thousand different source files just you
know just to get that incremental build
and so our incremental builds were over
half an hour and you know it's very hard
for engineers to be productive
every time they want to compile the code
they have to sit and watch their
computer thrash for 30 minutes why this
happened this is just a very small
excerpt of the dependency graph from our
system I can't fit the whole graph on
our on this screen and this is so small
if you kind of look in the upper right
corner there's a little text box that's
the name of one of the components so you
know so in what what caused this this
epic disaster it's not a particularly
large code base 100,000 lines 150,000
lines that's not small but that's not
huge and if you did this in Java you'd
have a five-minute compile and you're
probably complain about it taking five
whole minutes so you know what happened
here and in a part of it is just the
fact that type analysis in Scala is very
complex and you know when we
instrumented things trying to figure out
where the time was going almost all of
that bill time is type analysis but the
second problem which was which was a
major factor was that that build graph
as you saw that that crazy hair ball it
was basically a giant click so that if
you changed anything you had to
recompile absolutely everything in the
system and you know when when type
analysis time is exponential on the size
of the type graph having a dependency
graph like that means that you have a
pretty darn big thing that's good and
you know that you have to analyze an
exponential time speed so you know the
term for what's going on inside of there
is is poor build hygiene so what do we
mean by build hiding this is not a term
I invented this is kind of used a lot
among people who build build tools but
the basic idea is in your build tool you
have to declare what you use so every
buildable and entity which we call
targets in our system have to be
declared and they have to be typed
every target has to declare ahead of
time exactly what it's going to depend
on and then using that information the
build system is going to verify
correctness it's going to check that
everything every dependency is actually
declared and the compilations will fail
if they're not it will check that the
dependency graph is a cichlid and we'll
verify that things depend on the right
kinds of things so you can't declare a
dependency from Scala on C++ code you
could declare it on a J&amp;amp;I library but
you can't declare it directly on C++
code because that wouldn't mean anything
that would be an invalid thick a quick
explanation of you know why is this
build hygiene stuff so important I like
to compare it to what we do in our
programming languages in our programming
languages we enforce code hygiene we say
that you have especially in you know
Scala types like us you have to declare
the types of things and then the
compiler is going to tell you if you do
it wrong you have to declare everything
that you import and the compiler is
going to tell you if you didn't import
something so build hygiene is very much
the same kind of thing but apply to
build time instead of applied to the pro
to the actual code of the system so
declare your pack of dependencies
enforce rules and make sure that they
cause errors if you get them wrong so
that you know you got it wrong so to
explain the build tool that we're using
a little bit of background there are two
fundamental approaches to how you can
build things they're called top-down and
bottom-up top-down is basically what
you're used to in in most build systems
so you have a project which is some
hierarchy of directories and files on a
disk it's got one thing off to the side
that says how to build the project so
inside of there you have the single
centralized set of instructions for how
to build and inside of there in some
form it says essentially here's a
project that I want to build here's
where you can find all the pieces you
know there's the source code there's
you know there's the tests they're all
over the and here the external things it
thinks not in my source code that I
depend on now please build it for me and
this is what SBT may then builder lots
of things like that do the bottom up
built is very different in a bottom-up
build you don't really have a top level
build file there is no single place that
has instructions for how to build your
system what you have instead is in each
package you have instructions for how to
build that component and then when you
try and do a build all of those
instructions are assembled by the build
tool so the basic idea of the bottom-up
build is the bill description is
distributed around the code each unit of
code each component each package in
whatever you choose to use it has a bill
descriptor just describing how to build
that component the bill descriptor
specify the other packages in in the
code that they depend on and the bill
tool uses that to assemble a complete
graph of everything in order to run the
built because you have this
componentized build instructions where
each component declares us dependencies
it becomes very easy for the bill tool
to say you're you're using something
that you shouldn't write it's much
easier for it to enforce your hygiene
rules then it would be with a
centralized so in a bottom-up build what
happens when you want to run actually
build a system the user has to specify a
list of the compilation targets they're
interested in the system generates a
transitive dependency graph for those
targets so it looks at the build file
for the target you wanted and anything
that it declares as a dependency it
loads those build descriptions and it
combines that into a dag a graph of the
build things that need to be built it
topologically sorts it to get a build
order once the graph has been built and
sordid it
for validity to make sure that you know
you're following the hygiene rules
properly and then it reverses the top
sort of graft one piece at a time
building the components so the build
tool that we use is called pants and
this was originally implement
implemented at Twitter and we have an ex
Twitter engineer who knew about this
which is how we got into it it is
unfortunately implemented in Python
which is painful but the fact is it
works and it was easier to build on
something that existed then to start
from scratch it's based on blaze you
know we can't really take credit for any
of the ideas in this because an X Google
person went to Twitter and missed blaze
started this and then you know it came
out in the interest of disclosure i was
at Google at one point and I did work on
blaze so I'm strongly biased in favor of
the style of build but basically pants
is a very nice little tool it gives a
very clean declarative build language
and it makes it really easy to do this
kind of hygiene stuff which was just
incredibly important for us so this is
this is basically what a build file
looks like in pants this is a very
simple example but basically you put
this in a file named build in a
directory with the code and this says I
want to build a skala library I want it
to be referred to by the target name lib
to it depends on this other package
that's that explicit dependencies and
the source files are everything that's
in this directory the syntax is a little
weird like that globs line because this
is actual executable Python in in the
build file for a slightly more
interesting example you can declare
lists of source files and then again
here's here's a scholar library it
declares dependencies it declares the
sources or the indenting is off there
there are two different scala libraries
here
sorry you can see right down here can
you see the pointer up there this is the
second one this should have been back
dented and finally one more example this
is from pants own build file or building
itself and it's just a short excerpt but
you can kind of get a sense of how it
works so you have different kinds of
targets its target has its own set of
components inside a pants for building
so so you know in terms of of using
pants you know there were a bunch of
problems that we had to solve in order
to make this work and you know the most
interesting ones obviously our technical
one of the first things was that
incremental Scala compilation the main
thing that does that is SBT we were
trying to get away from SBT because you
know SBT uses this monolithic build
approach and we want enforceable
dependencies wednesday checking and the
way that pants compile once to compile
things in the way that scala c or zinc
actually wants to compile things can be
different at times so we really had to
struggle with that there were a bunch of
things we have to do to get the
performance of pants to a point where we
could use it but the biggest thing is
there are cycles in our dependency graph
in the code and these were perfectly
acceptable in SBT but when we won't
build hygiene that doesn't work because
the hygienic build graph hygienic
dependency graph is a cyclic so we had
to figure out how to rearrange our code
in order to get rid of cyclic
dependencies and this is generally
doable but it can be a bit of work but
as as I'll mention in a little while it
really does pay off but so you know a
quick example of what I mean by a
necessary cycle you know we have some
basic data types that we work with for
our application you know in Foursquare
users check in to say where they've been
and then we save information about where
they've been so that we can make
recommendations to them for where they
should go later
so a user has the method to retrieve a
list of that users check-ins a check-in
is an object that associates a user with
a venue a location where they were when
they checked in and a venue is able to
say you're able to ask a venue who's
checked in here so you know this is a
cycle there's you know the way that we
had to get around this was by separating
data from behavior and this is a very
classic hygienic technique to break
these dependencies you have to split the
behavior and the data into distinct
traits so what we did was we split user
into multiple substrates there is a user
trait which just defines the data fields
of a user object there's a behavior
object which is the actual
implementation or the actual declaration
of the operations that we want to be
able to do on user and we have a
concrete user info object which actually
has all the implementation of the
behaviors and accesses the data fields
what this gives us is you know the user
model it doesn't depend on check-ins or
venues at all I'm sorry that should be
just used or not user model the user
implementation depends on the check-in
model but it doesn't I'm sorry on the
check-in trait the interface sorry this
is based on an older version of the code
than the current but it doesn't have to
depend on the behavior of venue or the
behavior of check-in so the user itself
doesn't have to depend on much of
anything the user behavior has to depend
on just the data types for the venues
and check-ins that it needs to be able
to access and the actual behavior
implementation kind of depends on
everything but nothing depends on it so
we've broken the dependency cycle so you
can kind of just see the structure that
I'm talking about here we took user and
turned it into a pure interface that
only declares data fields we created a
behavioral interface which actually can
reference other types and then we have
the actual implementations of it
okay the other really big thing that we
had to deal with was was a social factor
this is a very different approach to how
you build systems then people are
normally familiar with excuse me and you
know for example right now you know in
in SBT when we were doing that you
typically say SBT compile and that was
it it would build everything it's a
guess BTW test it would run your tests
with a bottom-up build you don't have
that you have to say what targets you
want to use and that's a big change
because now there's this piece of
knowledge about the way that the build
tool is going to work which becomes
essential knowledge for everyone working
on the system and you know that that
took some some effort to get people to
accept the other really big thing was
our code could not build in a hygienic
build system because it had all of these
cycles so we had to do an absolutely
massive refactoring effort just to clean
that dependency graph in order to get it
to the point where it could be built
hygienic Lee so the point of all this
was try and speed everything up we got
an average bill Justin that just
immediately after starting to use pants
as soon as we got the coat cleaned up
enough that we could do a hygienic build
in it we managed to drop our build time
by more than half the dependency graph
click now this is this is up to date as
of this past week the dependency graph
click used to be hundreds and hundreds
of files it's now down to 38 which is
just mind-boggling improvement and we've
got the typical incremental build so if
you change something and run a bill an
average it takes about six minutes to do
the build and say that was about 30
minutes before we
this so this was a huge huge result and
all of that performance gain really is
coming from the fact that the size of
the graph the size of the type graph
that the Scala compiler has to look at
is drastically drastically smaller so
what we get out of doing this crazy
thing you know we got bill times down
and they're still getting better but a
side benefit is with SBT the way that we
were using it essentially we had one
build you would say SBT compile and that
was it but now we have a system where
people can say I want to compile just my
component and they can actually do that
now very easily it's a very natural
thing to do and we're kind of trying to
turn our system into many smaller
components this just makes it easier to
do that as we move along the big
question was it worth doing and to be
honest for bill tons maybe not i'm not
sure but the fact is what really changed
the bill times was the refactoring what
pants gave us was a way of checking that
we were getting that refactoring right
you know in SBT if we were trying to
change it to reduce dependencies and we
accidentally you know didn't didn't
change the code in the right way to get
rid of one that would have been very
hard to detect because it just isn't
built to be able to check things like
that so you know it made it easier to do
what we had to do but it wasn't really
the thing that produced the results but
in terms of the maintainability of our
code I think this was absolutely a huge
benefit we have much more macho Lawrence
code now and we can enforce that kind of
modularity and that is a huge thing it
would be very hard you know we have 50
or 60 server engineers to enforce rules
about how you can use dependency
is among 50 or 60 people using a
strictly informal approach is it just is
intractable this tool makes it possible
for us to do that come on the obvious
question that you know sure people were
going to ask was couldn't we just have
done this with SBT and the answer is
well yeah we could but it would be
harder you know just just because SBT
wasn't really designed to solve this
problem you know obviously from my bias
I prefer the pants approach to building
but I'm not saying that SBT is a stupid
tool that no one should use but if if
the thing that you really want to do is
enforce build hygiene it's much harder
to do that in SVT because it wasn't
designed to do it pants was and that
makes it much easier in particular the
big reason that it's easier to do this
in pants is just that basic difference
between a top-down build and a bottom-up
build hygiene is a local property it's a
property of a specific package in the
source tree it's not a package it's not
a property of the entire system so
unless you have some way of talking
about properties of small components
it's very hard to do this and when
you're talking about the property of a
small component it's best to do that
local to the component the bottom-up
build makes that really easy to do
because the bill descriptor is with the
code the other big question this was a
question that many of our engineers
asked us many times couldn't we just do
this automatically and again yeah you
know if you look at the set of imports
in the source code you can build up a
dependency graph from that and then use
that to generate the dependencies and
and have the same information that we're
getting but my and we do actually now
have a tool that will generate at least
a good approximation of a build file for
a new component
but to me this comes back to this to the
comparison I made before about typing
right most of the things that we do with
type declarations you don't need type
declarations to do that I mean people
who write closure people who write
Python they they write code pretty well
without it but we like the hygiene we
like the rules that it enforces and the
properties that it gives our code so
when it comes to build I believe the
same thing humans should be involved
because these are real decisions about a
system and we want the decisions to be
made intelligently by people sorry
family so so if you are interested in
seeing pants this is where you can get
it it's on github the primary maintainer
is Twitter but our the senior ND sorry
the the the chief engineer chief of
engineering for foursquare san francisco
is also one of the two tech leads of
this on commons and last of course i'm
not lucky there to mention this we are
hiring at Foursquare and like I said we
do everything in Scala and we're a
really fun place to work so questions
okay so that the question was in a
top-down build system you could declare
the system as a bunch of little jars and
did we look at that the answer is yes we
did it's much harder to enforce rules
that way well so I mean there's there's
a couple of different ways that you can
approach that the bill rules end up
getting very very complicated if you
want to do it so that you have you know
one large source hierarchy and then you
want to have separate bills for several
parts of it it's hard to do that right
and it's also just harder to get
additional rules into the system to say
if you see this kind of depend
see that's bad get rid of it so it
definitely you definitely could do this
but it's a bit harder yes right yeah so
yes if you split it the other approach
is split it into many separate trees but
that's harder for engineers to deal with
because you know when you're working on
the system suddenly instead of just
knowing you know what package the thing
you need to change is in you need to
know which compilation unit it's in in
this bottom-up approach you don't need
to do that you can have one unified
source tree and that makes it a whole
lot easier for the engineers yes so Neil
one of the other Foursquare people here
just just mentioned if you're doing that
approach with separate tea trees if you
decide that you want to split a single
compilation unit into two compilation
targets you would need to split the
trees and that really would be thankful
in in this build system you can even
have multiple files in the same
directory that belong to two different
bill targets within that directory so
the question was you know I mentioned
that we did some profiling of the
compiler and I did gave some timing
figures for things so the data came from
two different places one of our
engineers knows a lot of people at
typesafe he got an instrumented version
of the compiler which gave us profile
determination so you know if you write
to type safe I'm sure they'll share the
same thing with you but you know it
wasn't stock compiler for the other data
it came from a bunch of different
sources but in particular our build tool
we instrumented it so that we record the
build time of every bill that anyone
does in a MongoDB table so we have this
this data about how long things take it
on average oh the grass that that the
original version of that the one that
went up there was just generated by
parsing import statements and then
manually from that but not manual
writing a program that from that
generated a graph is data file and
plotting it so the dependency grasped
between targets has to be acyclic but
within a single target everything can
depend on everything so what we did
basically to switch to pants was create
one huge target that we called the hair
ball and everything was in it and then
we kept trying to prune things out of
there so right now that hairball target
is about 38 directories sorry the
question was did we try to to do a build
in SB key after the refactoring after
the dependency reduction to see if it
would have been reduced and again the
answer to that is known but the scowl
build component that we use so zinc I'm
sorry so pants does its comp scholar
compilation with the tool called zinc
zinc is essentially a front end to this
to the SBT incremental scholar compile
so basically we believe that the compile
time under SBT would now be the same the
benefit that we get from hands as I said
isn't really the compile time it's the
enforceability of the rules that helped
us reduce that compile time so the
question was does pants in blaze have
anything in common with the go build
system the answer is no nothing at all
when I was at Google we talked to two
Rob Pike who's the lead on the go
project he hates blaze
so you know blaze was optimized for a
particular build system at Google and he
hates the entire infrastructure so he
didn't want to have anything to do with
it so pants incorporates IV so if you
know if there are dependencies that you
need external dependencies that you need
to get for things that are outside you
can declare them in a pants build file
there is a carga type jar dependency
which takes you know the standard
strings for the the maven IV package
descriptors and it will download them
into your local IV cash and assemble the
classpath needed by both the compiler
and to execute it so you know setting up
external dependencies is as easy as you
know SBT may then whatever it's just
standard ID any other questions ok thank
you very much
