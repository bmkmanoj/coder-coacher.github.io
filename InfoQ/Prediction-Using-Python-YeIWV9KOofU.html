Alex raise your hand yes Alex likes San
Francisco and Python so much that he
actually flew down here from Seattle so
I asked real treat so this is gonna be
an introduction to prediction in five
minutes so prediction in general is you
know there are things that are more
predictable than others in this case
there's a shark biting an undersea cable
probably not predictable but perhaps we
can figure out how many of these things
are happening in a given year but we
can't predict any single individual
event I'm going to talk about predicting
numerical things that are predictable
you know there are things that have
different levels of predictability so
the assumption here is that what you're
trying to predict is actually
predictable and the you know there's a
wide range of applications for this one
of which is things like CPU data which
is something that that I actually work
on is making predictions for server
parameters and in this case being people
we can spot patterns and and we can see
several patterns in this particular this
is a real CPU graph we can see that
there are kind of these cyclical
increasing trends and then we see a few
spikes so we can see that there are
patterns here or we can assume that
there are as patterns here so the
question is how do we how do we do this
you know algorithmically how does a
computer figure out if there's a pattern
here and generally the easiest way is to
do linear regression right so I have a
bunch of data points I'm going to draw a
line through those data points I have a
slope in this case beta I have a
y-intercept alpha and and we just kind
of extrapolate out so I'm gonna have
notebook here so we have some data
points here we can see that we have a
little bit of an outlier and but in
general they're kind of they're you know
they're slipping upwards so so this
might be a good candidate for linear
regression right so you know we we
generate a slope of the line that
minimizes the error between the data
points and the line and we can kind of
you know the red is historical data and
green is things that we're predicting
you know and assuming that this pattern
continues then this is gonna be all nice
and good and then you can you know
hopefully have a have a good prediction
moving forward but now what happens if
this data is cyclical let's try this oh
that's that's not so good so this is
that same pattern repeated twice and we
do a linear regression for the
historical data and then you can see
that the predicted data doesn't actually
correspond to the actual data so the
pattern is cyclical so we can try to do
something a little more sophisticated we
can try to do an exponential moving
average so basically we weigh the more
recent data higher than the historical
data so basically the the wait for the
data decreases exponentially according
to the spectra alpha so that we assume
that what we're predicting is going to
be closer to the more recent data point
than it is going to be to a historical
data point and then this is what what
the equation for that looks like and
let's see what happens when we do an
exponential moving average on our
cyclical data so so we can see linear
regression didn't really do a good job
with this let's try to do and the slides
and the ipython notebook are going to be
available for download in case you want
to play with this data yourself so let's
see what happens when we do an
exponential moving average so it
actually it it actually does a pretty
good job here there's a lot of there's
other parameters involved with this
exponential moving average so so besides
alpha so we can kind of you know we can
kind of tweak it a little bit and we can
see like well what happens if we change
the window size for the data that we're
looking at for
this exponential moving average and
again green here is predicted and red is
actual and if we do a different window
size a window size that matches the
actual the period of the of the the data
we see that the the predicted data
points are actually a lot closer to the
the real data points and again again its
it it's hard to tell whether this is
going to translate well to other other
graphs but but we can see here that it
actually does there's a pretty good job
with predicting this the cyclical data
and the the actual computation involved
for this is actually not that intense
and there's there's a library available
for both exponential moving average and
linear regression and again you can see
that in the ipython notebook there's
other approaches we can do higher
dimensional polynomial fits Fourier
transforms machine learning Bayesian
classifiers there are things that people
try to do in finance that you can
actually use as well for any sort of
numerical data it doesn't have to be
pricing so this is these are the links
for the data we can see the slides and
the the ipython notebook that I had up
earlier and that is all thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
