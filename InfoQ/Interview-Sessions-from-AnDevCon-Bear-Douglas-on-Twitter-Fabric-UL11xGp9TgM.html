Francisco and I'm sitting with bear
Douglas developer advocate at Twitter
how are you doing bear I'm doing great
how are you doing doing very good so
tell us a little bit about yourself what
you do and what you're passionate about
sure so I'm a developer advocate at
Twitter and what developer advocates do
is we create all of the developer
content that makes it simple for people
who are interested in adding Twitter
inside their app to do it so that's
everything from tutorials and
screencasts like you guys are making to
documentation to sample code and making
sure that people have everything they
need to get started quickly and easily
so I'm particularly passionate about
Android and so that's why we're here
today at and DEF CON we recently
released a set of modular SDKs we call
fabric which makes it really simple to
add crash reporting beta distribution
analytics Twitter integration and if
you're interested adding adds to your
app we have a great ad exchange platform
built inside fabric as well Oh excellent
so this actually got a lot of buzz last
night really surprising buzz we had a
developer panel of experts from all over
the industry some people working at
square Eventbrite etc we were asking
them really what platform they're
starting to add to their applications
and libraries and a number of people
really mentioned Twitter fabric so can
you tell us a little bit more about what
it means to be using Twitter fabric and
what's involved and what value it will
add to customers and first of all does
it cost any money so it doesn't and one
of the greatest things about fabric is
that it's designed to fit your needs and
give you as much functionality or as
little as you want depending on what you
need for your app so for a big app if
you're growing into markets where maybe
less familiar with the kinds of devices
that people will have or their network
connections fragmentation is a huge
problem and you can only test so much
from inside your office with the devices
you have somebody who's testing on who's
using your app on a gingerbread phone
coming from India is going to have a
very different experience than you will
sitting in your office using a nexus 5
so for people like that crashlytics is a
fantastic tool for monitoring how your
app is performing across many devices
across many platforms and different
geographies you shouldn't not release an
app for fear that it's going to crash we
to give you the confidence that your app
is performing well in the market so you
can see how things are doing and fix
crashes for people who are experiencing
them without needing to hold yourself
back thinking well we're not sure this
is going to work so maybe we should hold
back okay so if I'm a developer and I've
got a nap and I want to add crashlytics
it's just like a matter of including a
jar file and a few items in my android
manifest more or less so we have a
really cool onboarding plugin that works
right in your ID so we have one for
Android studio and for IntelliJ and also
for eclipse so you can download it and
it actually is just a matter of a few
clicks the plug-in makes all the changes
you need to to your manifest your Gradle
file adds imports and you just need to
build and crashlytics and fabric are
already inside your app oh now what kind
of data am I going to start getting if i
add crashlytics to my app you'll get
information on the particular file name
and line that caused a crash inside the
app you'll get the trace for it you'll
even get stats on the device like the
orientation of the phone at the time
that it crashed how much battery it had
what the network conditions were like
there's there's a good amount of
reporting you get in there and we also
make it simple for you to add
breadcrumbs for yourself so if you know
for example that making it to level 5 in
your game is often problematic for users
you can just log information to
crashlytics alongside the report and
when it gets sent up you'll be able to
drill down into each individual issue
and see well this user first killed the
troll and then when they picked up the
sword that was when they hit the crash
so you can you can figure out custom
custom events that you might want to
track to make sure that you're getting
to the root of the problem ooh excellent
and now does this add any kind of
invasive permissions like do I end up
having a grant log access or really
powerful dangerous permissions about my
device network state really and internet
access are important that's about it
that's it yeah Wow and now should this
is crashlytics what are the other pieces
of the Twitter fabric platform well
there's Twitter itself so we make it
easy for you to sign in with twitter
make calls to to twitter's api and also
embed tweets inside your app so for
example if you're if you're a news app
and you want to have converse
that's happening around a particular
story or reporting it's super simple to
add in an individual tweet or a stream
of tweets depending on your needs and
you can also customize them in color and
Infante so that they look and feel like
the rest of your app and alongside all
the Twitter functionality we also have a
new product called digits that makes it
simple to do phone number sign in for
your app so if you're expanding to
markets where you expect that people
might not have an email address to sign
in with or if you just know that people
prefer to sign into your app with their
phone or there's a great reason to have
their phone number we make it super easy
digits is live in 216 countries and it's
localized to 28 languages so if you want
to be reaching everybody on the planet
digits is a great sign an option ooh
excellent so this is like really
valuable say in third world countries or
Asia and and even here in the States a
lot of teenagers for example that if you
think about apps like snapchat they have
phone number sign in because its
immediate and it's how people identify
who they are online it's all based
through the phone it's not just in in
global markets though that is very
important it's here in the US as well
now how does Twitter fabric really
helped me when I start going global so
let's say I am Twitter or company and
I've got an application and I want it
I've got users that are running on
different devices in different countries
and what does Twitter fabric ad for me
they can really make my life easier well
a couple of things there is phone number
sign in with digits which will expand
your reach everywhere you don't have to
go through and make those carrier
relationships we take care of making
sure that your SMS is gets delivered
when you're doing phone verification so
that's taken care of and then like you
said when devices are fragmented and
you're trying to keep track of how
different people all around the world
are coming to your app then crashlytics
can give you amazing amounts of insight
into types of devices people are using
when they're signing into your app the
kinds of crashes that they're
encountering and you can make notes for
yourself where in the world they're
happening so
if there is a pattern geographically you
can you can try to track those well
excellent and how do you guys make your
money then so if this is free where does
Twitter making its money well for
Twitter it's important that people
starts thinking of us as a platform
company we really are here to support
developers from the ground up and so we
help you when you're first building your
app with crashlytics then as you want to
get growth you can add Twitter whether
it's through sign in or just through
showing tweets and that of course is
important for us as a company and then
once you're ready to monetize if you're
interested in putting ads inside your
app we have a powerful exchange called
mopub that aggregates add stock from
around multiple networks and make sure
that you the developer get the best
price for ad space inside your app so we
call fabric free and free plus so
crashlytics is free Twitter innovation
is free mopub is free plus because you
it's free to use and you may actually
make money off your app so that's that's
our model very cool and now looking
beyond where do you see the Android
platform going and really the good
growth opportunities out there the great
growth opportunities are of course
global it's very exciting to see
wearables taking off but I think really
the main thing that's going to make a
huge difference for developers is
getting better traction with a later and
later versions of the API so people can
build really awesome apps against all
the great stuff that Google has given us
in later versions of Android so that
people around the world can have awesome
experiences on their phone so that's
incrementally improving device quality
it's it's making sure that people have
the latest and greatest Android and then
it's doing things like really working to
make sure that your app operates under
poor network conditions under you know
if a phone that has limited memory as
developers the onus is on us to to make
sure that our app works and works for
everyone so the exciting thing about the
Android ecosystem is how accessible it
is and it's on us to make sure that it
truly is accessible by building our apps
against that very cool now for those of
our audience are out there and saying
okay I'm looking for new opportunities
in the Android space is Twitter hiring
right now we are we are we're hiring
and I know for sure in New York Boston
and here in San Francisco we're looking
for Android engineers for fabric for
sure for vine and for Twitter itself
Android products so what's the the
profile of a candidate that's a great
question um I think different positions
are looking for different levels of
seniority if you're coming fresh out of
college but you have a couple of Android
projects under your belt I think we
would definitely be interested in
talking to you and there are openings
really all the way up through senior and
staff positions so we're interested in
talking to you if you've got some and
Rebecca fair enough now tell us a little
bit more about what you do and how
somebody might actually get into being a
developer advocate absolutely and we are
looking on my team too so what I do is I
work closely with the product teams and
also with the marketing teams to make
sure that we have a pulse on
understanding what our developers need
from us so that's everything from
teaching them how to use our product and
then listening to how they would prefer
it to work if they don't if they don't
like how it does work what's going wrong
for them what they need for their setups
just like when you build an app for an
audience that might be global you don't
know what kind of phones they're using
in the same way when you read a
framework you have some idea of how you
can best serve your community but you
can't possibly know everyone's different
setup and how their how their building
how they're operating as a team so we
listen and make sure that we are getting
a good pulse on everybody's needs and
taking that feedback back to product so
we can adjust as needed excellent thank
you very much I'm really glad you could
come and join us here yeah thanks enjoy
