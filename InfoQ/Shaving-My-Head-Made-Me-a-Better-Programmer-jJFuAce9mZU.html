is shaving my head made me a better
programmer and it's a little bit
misleading so this is a two-part talk in
the first part tells the story of how I
became passionate about building diverse
and inclusive environments in tech and
then the second part teaches you how to
do just that
and so I know this is an international
crowd so I apologize for some of my
american nerd pop culture references
it's okay if you don't laugh at my jokes
so hi I'm action I'm a software engineer
and an educator and I care a lot about
access to computer science education and
about leveraging technology to create
social change and I'm going to tell you
about how that happened and some of the
stuff that I learned along the way so
I'm originally from Paris France
Portugal any French people in the
audience okay I started programming in
college that's why I went to the United
States and I live in Brooklyn now and I
wanted to be an astronaut at the time so
I joined the engineering program on my
school and one of the requirements was
introduction to programming and I fell
in love with programming immediately I
it was like nothing I'd ever experienced
I felt like I could be creative and
analytical all at the same time I felt
like I finally found an art form with
which I could express myself so I was
really excited and I started programming
and immediately decided to major in
computer science and that was an easy
decision because I loved it but staying
in computer science was not so easy and
it wasn't because learning to code is
hard which it is you're essentially you
know working with a machine that's
telling you over and over that you're
failing
y'all know but that wasn't the hard part
the hard part the main obstacles that I
had to overcome were other people's
perceptions and my own perceptions about
my abilities as a programmer and so at
the time I was one of maybe five women
in my computer science classes and there
were some classes where I was the only
woman I hadn't been programming since I
was 10 most of the people in my class
parents were programmers and so it was
really lonely and even though I did
really well in all of my classes no one
wanted to work with me people didn't
want to interact with me on an
intellectual level it felt like being
hyper visible and invisible at the same
time didn't believe I was a programmer
really the other people in my program
they'd asked me are you really improving
do you know what a terminal is and I
didn't believe in myself like until
senior year of college when people asked
me if I was a programmer I'd say you
know not really but I'm trying to become
one which is silly because the act of
programming is what makes you a
programmer and so there were two things
at play there there was people
discriminating against me because I
didn't look like what they thought a
programmer should look like in my own
impostor syndrome and for those of us
who aren't familiar impostor syndrome is
when someone feels like a fraud because
they think that they've convinced the
people around them that they've
accomplished stuff and they're skilled
and worthy but they actually aren't and
that's how I felt so anyway I was really
stubborn and I decided I was going to
become a really good programmer in a way
that was unquestionable to the world so
I joined the programming team and
started running our computer club and
took all the hardest classes on my
school and finally became accepted by my
peers and it's ridiculous that I had to
do all of this stuff for that to happen
and other people could just show up and
look nerdy to be accepted but I didn't
care because I made it so then I
graduated from college and I got my
first full-time job as a software
engineer at a startup in New York it was
a really great job I felt super
accomplished I learned about front-end
engineering there
I made really great friends I got to be
a part of a tiny team and have a huge
impact on the whole product and on a
company as a whole and it was awesome
but one thing wasn't so awesome whenever
I stepped out of my great job bubble and
entered the tech world like went to
programming conferences like this one
went to meetups and events and as our
company grew and we hired more people
the same stuff that used to have in
commune college started having to me
again like all the time everywhere I
went and some of it was small stuff like
microaggression which I'll cover later
like people asking me over and over if I
was sure that I was a programmer even
though I was like out of programming
conference like wearing a badge and also
some bigger scarier more serious stuff
and it got so prevalent at some point
that I became really discouraged and I
asked myself why do I love programming
so much if programming doesn't love me
back and I was just trying to do my job
just trying to write code and the
environment wasn't really allowing me to
do that and I seriously considered
quitting like quitting programming and
becoming one of the over 40% of women
who leave software on some point in
their career which would have been
really sad because I loved it and I'm
good at it
so as I said before I'm really stubborn
so I decided you know again I'm going to
try and find a solution so I sought out
my friends for advice and I actually
realized that I only had male programmer
friends at the time which you know is
Wow looking back now because I have a
lot of friends from all different
backgrounds in programming now so I
decided I'm going to meet as many female
software engineers as possible so I got
friends to introduce me to female
software engineers that the companies
where they worked and I just went on
blind coffee dates for the ton of women
and some of them became really great
friends and I was really looking for
advice on how to deal with you know
feeling invisible and hyper visible and
looking to create a support network and
so I asked them what do I do
how do I deal with the way people are
treating me in my profession just
because of the way I look I got a lot of
different advice some was helpful some
was
helpful like everyone really sympathized
with me and knew what I was going
through and this one lady who had been a
software engineer for about ten years
and who was now like CTO she told me
when she cut her hair men stopped
harassing her at TED conferences so I
was like okay that's not super
applicable to me like I'm not going to
do that and then this one the male
friend of mine who was really just
trying to help me and give me good
advice he said why don't you become a
really badass programmer like this one
lady programmer Sara Chipps she's pretty
famous in JavaScript in New York like
become really badass like her become
known for your expertise and people will
have to take you seriously they won't
have a choice but to give you respect
and so I thought okay I can try that so
I started giving talks at to meetups
about something I'm really passionate
about which is accessibility on the web
which is the concept of making the web
more accessible to folks with
disabilities to like blind people people
who can't use a mouse old people it's a
really important subject and it went
really well
and after a few local meetups I even got
invited he got a really big programming
conference a big JavaScript conference
and people were flying from all around
the country and like different countries
to attend and tickets cost hundreds of
dollars kind of like this conference and
I got to share the stage with people I
really respect people whose tools I used
every day and I was certainly the
youngest person giving a talk there so I
was really excited and I felt super
accomplished it was a really big deal
like I was finally badass so I gave my
talk and and went really well and people
learned about the important stuff that I
had to say about accessibility and I
felt really good about it but then the
first thing that I got asked after I
gave my talk was this guy he asked me
how do I talk to women at bars and I was
floored I couldn't believe it
because even after all the work that I'd
done to get there even in a moment when
my expertise was undeniable like I was
literally on stage teaching him things
that he paid money to learn about even
in that moment I wasn't seeing
a programmer so being a badass didn't
help me I still didn't get any respect
and at this point I was really fed up I
was so sick of being treated that way
because of my appearance but I'm a
hacker so I decided I'm going to hack my
appearance so I shaved my head and this
was before stranger things so it wasn't
as cool back then and then I was like
every other you know woman in Brooklyn
is like shaving her head so anyway I
shaved my head and the weirdest thing
happened like overnight I became a
really good programmer I stopped getting
hit on at tech conferences and people
listened to me and respected me and stop
doubting me I stopped being this mix of
hyper sexualized and under skilled
programmer and I'd walk into a room
filled with other programmers and they'd
look to my face they'd look to me for
expertise and they'd say like oh you're
technical what do you think of this and
I couldn't believe it because that was
the first time that that had happened
and I tried to think about it
scientifically like is there something
in here that makes me worse at being a
programmer like maybe my hair was
weighing me down like dragging my
programming skills down but no
because this guy Richard Stallman is a
really good programmer and this is max
Ogden he is also really good programmer
and he has a ton of hair and this
is cereal from the movie hackers and he
has long hair - great movie by the way
so it has nothing to do with my hair
obviously but now I was suddenly
consider to be a good programmer and
what had changed then it wasn't my
actual abilities they hadn't changed
overnight it was the way that I was
being perceived by my peers I was no
longer this hyper feminine lady who
didn't belong
I didn't look very feminine I dressed
androgynous Lee at the time as well to
match my look and people even mistook me
and my boyfriend for a gay couple months
and so I didn't present as feminine
anymore so it was okay for me to be a
programmer and even it was acceptable
for me to be a good programmer and this
was like a mind-blowing discovery for me
because even though I knew that I was a
good programmer and I knew about sexism
in tech now I have proof of this on a
really personal level so I did a lot
more thinking about this like I knew
there's a problem in my environment that
doesn't allow capable passionate people
like me to succeed regardless of their
abilities and I thought what can I do
about it so I decided I can teach and
mentor other people who don't fit the
status quo who don't look like what a
programmer looks like so that at a
certain point we can change the status
quo and then you won't be able to say
this person doesn't look like a coder
and so I started teaching on the side as
a volunteer I taught at high school for
kids who were recent immigrants in the
Bronx and I taught a lot of workshops
for women and specifically women of
color and I really found a passion for
education and so I decided to stop
writing code full-time and join this
programming school as a curriculum
director coalition for Queens the free
intensive programming boot camp for
adults from underrepresented backgrounds
with no programming experience
and I was hired to help launch the
program it was really ambitious we had a
really successful pilot on you know 50%
of the classes women 50% we're
immigrants 50% had no college degrees
30% were black and Latino and the
average income of the class when it
started was around $25,000 a year and
after the program the graduates went on
to work at Pinterest Spotify BuzzFeed
and some of them make like upwards of
one hundred and twenty thousand dollars
a year now so that's like a really
life-changing thing and throughout this
process I learned the most important
lesson about teaching and about
programming I learned that we need to
stop thinking that there's only one kind
of person who can be excellent at
programming greatness and programming
can come from anywhere and anyone can
achieve excellence if you give them
support if you give them a safe space to
learn and if you trust that they can do
it and since the pilot ended I've
decided to broaden my impact on
education which is why I joined the
Skillshare engineering team Skillshare
is a continuing education platform and
there I lead our innovation engineering
team and as a teacher I've strongly
believed that there's a way to create
diverse and inclusive environment in
which people from all backgrounds can
succeed and a skill sure I've seen it in
practice the force culture that I've
only ever been the only woman on an
engineering team and I'm really excited
to say that at Skillshare our
engineering team it's 45 percent women
and our engineering leadership is
actually sixty percent women which is
amazing and like almost unheard of and
it takes serious commitment to create an
environment like that where everyone can
succeed and that's what I'll talk about
more in the second part of my talk and
then outside of work I continue to teach
children and adults to code through
various organizations but most recently
I started my own educational program
called the code cooperative in which
former inmates learn to code as a means
to creating social change and so most of
them have been imprisoned for a long
time they've all been released from
prison recently
and they've all received laptops donated
from New York tech companies and they're
all working on projects that have to do
with criminal justice reform which is
really exciting and so that's kind of my
background other than that I give a lot
of talks about why I think text should
be more diverse and inclusive and that's
what I'm going to talk about now I'll
share how you can build inclusive
environments on your teams so throughout
this talk I'm going to talk about
building diverse and inclusive
environments and so let's do a quick
check on the vocab a diverse environment
is one where people from all backgrounds
have equal representation and an
inclusive environment is one where
people from all backgrounds receive
equal treatment and equal opportunity by
design and then I'm going to allude to
different underrepresented groups in
text to draw examples from those groups
differ from country to country so in the
u.s. groups that are typically
underrepresented in text are women
people of color and by that I generally
mean black and brown folks folks who
identify as LGBTQ immigrants older folks
disabled folks parents and then all the
proofs of people encounter different
kinds of challenges and those who will
onto multiple groups have compounded
challenges that they deal with and so in
your environment people who are
underrepresented in software might
belong to different groups for example
in the u.s. people who are from
Southeast Asia are very underrepresented
in text however if you're from the
Philippines that doesn't make sense so
instead of being specific I'll try to
talk to use like a kind of blanket terms
to refer to underrepresented groups in
tech and so none of these terms are
really perfect but I'll use them
interchangeably anyways so I'll use the
words like under represented groups and
minorities women are generally
underrepresented in tech in most
countries so I'll use that group as an
example of a lot does anyone hear from a
cut from like work in an environment
where women are generally have equal
representation of men okay all right
so good for y'all so now we have a
shared vocabulary and I'll talk more
about how we can build diverse and
inclusive environments so the first and
most important part of building a
diverse and inclusive work environment
is just caring and that seems easy but
it's not that simple you have to
genuinely care about this issue and
really commit to what that means real
measurable results will only happen if
your organization is externally and
internally committed to making a
positive change you need to care and
everyone in your organization needs to
care your CEO middle-management
individual contributors otherwise when
it comes to making difficult decisions
like who to hire between two candidates
or whether or not you should fire the
high performer who's harassing people on
the team you're going to make a
counterproductive decision if you're not
100% committed and if that's the case
your efforts will ultimately be
ineffective for example Google just
released their latest diversity report
and after two years and a quarter of a
billion dollars they admitted that they
didn't make any significant progress in
terms of racial diversity only 2% of
their workforce is black compared to 13%
in the United States and that number
didn't change after two years and a
quarter of a billion dollars which seems
almost impossible or take uber who has
recently come under fire for allegations
of sexual harassment from one of their
senior software engineers Susanne Fowler
this is a huge scandal and it's having
disastrous impact on uber brand and anse
ability to do business hundreds of uber
employees have quit some Cooper
investors have come forward writing
about how disappointed they are in uber
and the hashtag delete uber movement has
picked up speed again and has had a
significant impact on app usage and app
downloads and I encourage you all to
read Susan Fowler story so what I'm
saying is you really need to care and
commit in order to make changes changes
that won't just help women and other
minorities in your environment but will
benefit your entire team and your
company as a result but why should you
care
I hope that after hearing my story and
about how hard it was for me to succeed
even though I was
I loved coding and I was really good at
it and worked really hard I hope that
after hearing that story you would care
a little bit more but this isn't about
me so you need to find your own reason
to care about text lack of equality and
I'm going to start with like giving some
bad reasons why you should care like
these reasons they're not the best like
because you have to know because of PR
randon because it's charitable know like
these aren't grades because when it
comes down to it these won't matter as
much as like your bottom line right so
these aren't really easy to rally people
around but there are some better reasons
to care about this if you want to make a
lot of money studies have shown that
diverse teams drive more innovation
they're more successful and ultimately
make more money they consistently
outperform non diverse teams if you want
to have the best team when you build
your culture for inclusion you will
attract the best and most talented
people top candidates want to Jorian
diverse companies and we can build
better teams if we hire from diverse
pools because they're untapped teams
should reflect the population that they
aim to serve which in the case of many
tech companies is the whole world
otherwise you end up with severe blind
spots like when Apple max launched
without public transportation or when
Apple health launched without the
ability to attract a menstrual cycle or
when Google photos washed with image
recognition that labeled pictures of
black people as gorillas this happened
this could have been really easily
avoided or in a more curious case the
first airbags weren't tested with
women's frames in mind so they ended up
killing a bunch of women and this could
have all been avoided if the team had
had folks from different backgrounds and
perspectives so the last and maybe the
most important reason to care is that
you care about equality and hopefully
this is true about all of us here in
this room
outside of just being a product and
business necessity we need to
acknowledge that the lack of diversity
in tech is a symptom of systemic
discrimination and if we care about
equality we must do our best to
counteract it so it doesn't really
matter what your reason is for caring
about fixing text lack of diversity but
hopefully one of those reasons resonated
with you so ok once you care once you're
committed what should you do the second
step to building a diverse and inclusive
team is not to take action yet it's to
listen learn and probably make a bunch
of mistakes and by listen learn and make
mistakes I mean specifically listen to
those with less privileged than you
learn about their experiences and make
mistakes and learn from them and if you
were at on once talk earlier today then
you know a little bit more about
privilege so as engineers we love to
figure out and fix things ourselves in
the case of diversity and inclusion it's
super important to listen to those with
less privilege before we take action
don't make assumptions about someone's
experience and resist the urge to speak
for an underrepresented group that you
don't belong to because when those with
more privilege Center our own voices
even when we have good intentions even
when we're trying to protect people with
less privilege we're perpetuating the
system that we're trying to dismantle so
instead of taking center stage highlight
and amplify the voices of those with
less privilege around you how do you
find these voices to listen to so if
your Twitter feed looks more like this
follow women women of color disabled
folks queer trans gender non-conforming
folks on Twitter seriously and remember
that a big part of listening to someone
is understanding the personal impact of
speaking up and a whistle blowing before
you discredit someone's personal story
one of the most important rules of
building software which we forget like
90% of the time is that you need to
understand a problem in order to fix it
so learn about the experiences of
underrepresented groups before you
tackle the problem learn about the
challenges they face as I mentioned
earlier different minority groups
encounter
different challenges and people who
belong to multiple groups encounter
compounded challenges but we can still
talk about a few common challenges that
underrepresented groups face so the
first one I want to talk about is
imposter syndrome
I mentioned imposter syndrome earlier in
my talk and I want to spend a little bit
more time talking about it
so this pie chart nicely represents how
someone with imposter syndrome might
feel imposter syndrome is a collection
of feelings of inadequacy that persist
despite evidence success
it's an incorrect assessment of one's
abilities compared to your peers for
example you think you're a 3 at
programming when actually you're 7 you
feel like you're constantly at risk of
being found out and although everyone
can suffer from impostor syndrome it's
much more prevalent in members of
minority groups so why does this matter
it matters because imposter syndrome can
have really serious effects on someone's
career for example it might lead someone
to not apply for a job or for a
promotion or not submit papers to
conferences or journals not
underestimate their experience or skills
it can lead to higher stress it can lead
to attributing successes to chance or
luck instead of your own work can lead
to over preparing for tasks and it can
make you nervous about talking to others
in your field if you think that their
higher skilled than you and all of these
things combined you can see how they
would have a disastrous impact on
someone's career so why does imposter
syndrome occur it's not simply because
some people just lack confidence which
is often what it's attributed to a lot
of the time imposter syndrome is a
reaction to being consistently told that
you're not good enough for example even
though I was almost always first in my
class in college when my peers and
teachers kept telling me that I wouldn't
become a software engineer I started to
believe it and I was a really confident
person before that so we must not blame
people who have impostor syndrome and
simply tell them to gain confidence
because that's not going to work it's
hard to build confidence when you're
consistently given signals that you
shouldn't be confident and we'll talk
more about this how to address this
later
unconscious bias is really at the root
of why a lot of discrimination happens
in our lives maybe some of you have
heard this brain teaser a man and his
son get into a car accident and they are
rushed to surgery to the hospital the
son is taken to surgery and the surgeon
looks at the boy sawsan says I can't
operate on this boy he's my son how is
it possible the surgeon is his mother
yes
points for you in this case the idea of
the joke is that we would think the
surgeon is a man that's an example of
unconscious bias so unconscious bias
these are stereotypes about certain
groups of people that form outside of
conscious awareness it's more prevalent
than conscious bias which is like when
you're directly saying like you know
women are bad at math right which is not
true and generally unconscious bias is
doesn reflect our conscious values so
for example I don't think that men are
better surgeons than women or that there
are only men surgeons but when I'm asked
to picture a surgeon I might just
immediately think of a man and
unconscious biases form from messages
that we've received throughout life and
they don't necessarily reflect our
belief system and almost everyone has
measurable biases but almost no one
thinks that they do and that's the
problem you can think of unconscious
bias as mental shortcuts for the
situations we experience every day and
most of the time we actively work
against those biases so that were not
like terrible people so when we're tired
hungry or multitasking it's harder for
us to work against our unconscious bias
and we can have unconscious biases
against groups that we even belong to
for example early in my career when I
saw another woman at a programming
conference I would immediately just
assume that she was not a programmer
like I would think she was working for
the conference or like in marketing or
something which is ridiculous because I
didn't think that when I saw a man at
the conference and that happened to me
all the time
so we can suffer from unconscious biases
against groups that we even belong to
another example a study was conducted
where science faculty were
to evaluate job applications for lab
managers where the only variance was the
gender in the name so the exact same
resume literally the same just changed
the name from like you know Kenny to
like Alec Alexandra and both male and
female faculty that were reviewing the
resumes rated male applicants more
highly and give them higher salaries
than their female counterparts by $3,000
which is really significant so the first
step in addressing our biases is being
aware of them and there are some tests
that you can take on the Internet - like
elucidate your unconscious biases and
they're really illuminating once we know
about our biases we can work to counter
them another common challenge that
minority groups face in tech is
stereotype threats so stereotype threat
refers to the risk of confirming a
negative stereotype threats a stereotype
about about ones group we have multiple
identities so I'm a woman I'm trying to
use I'm Filipino and French and you
respond to the identity under threat so
it's the idea that I will perform in
accordance to a negative stereotype
about a group I belong to in a situation
where I'm reminded of it and this can
happen even when a stereotype isn't
explicitly mentioned so in the u.s. you
may not notice but there's a stereotype
that women are not as good at math as
men which is weird to me because I grew
up in France and that wasn't the case in
France but so and in the u.s. there is
also a stereotype that people of Asian
descent don't speak very good English so
the study was conducted where a group of
Asian women a similar math and English
aptitude took a math and English test
when they were asked to disclose their
race before the test the women did worse
on the English portion and when they
were asked to disclose their gender they
did worse on the math portion and no one
even reminded them of this stereotype
and they didn't even you know tell them
like you're woman you're about at math
they were just reminded of it by having
to fill out that question and so
stereotype threat can have a serious
impact on one's ability to perform in
school during an interview and even on
the job
so microaggressions are small subtle
often subconscious actions that
marginalize people and oppress groups
while a few microaggressions like
someone asking me like where are you
really from or are you really a
programmer like that might not seem like
a big deal the steady stream of them
that people in minority groups
experience all the time
forms a really strong feeling of
uttering and of being marginalized they
send a distinct message that you're not
normal that you're less than that you're
other that you don't belong the
experience of microaggressions as a
woman in tech has been referred to by
Julie Pagano as guest by a thousand
paper cuts and so the idea is that one
paper cut isn't so bad at all but a
thousand might kill you so when someone
comes to you and complains about a
microaggression on like a shitty comment
in a PR review it's easy to sweep it
under the rug and say it doesn't matter
but it's important to understand the
impact of the aggregate of
microaggressions and the effect that all
them combined can have on an individual
in their work another common challenge
that folks from underrepresented groups
experiences erasure or being forgotten
about not being credited for their work
for example although software is a
male-dominated field as I can clearly
see in this room and most people
identify programming with men women
actually invented programming Ada
Lovelace was the first person to
describe how computing machines could
solve math problems in 1800 so erasure
happens because the people with most
privilege are those who have the power
to write history and to give credit to
the contributions of minorities and when
we don't make it a point to do that we
erased voices in history and this is the
whole concept of the smash film hidden
figures which is a really often film you
should all see it and it's the
highest-grossing film by the way of this
opera season it's the unknown story of
three african-american women who were
NASA engineers who played a huge role in
one of the most important space missions
in American history
and it's already inspired thousands of
young girls to pursue science and
literally I did not know that this
happened at all no one I know knew about
this story so the last chance I want to
talk about is lack of representation in
leadership one thing that often gets
neglected is when talking about
diversity and tech is the percentage of
minorities in leadership positions yeah
it's great if your team is 45% women but
if there are no women in leadership
positions are you really providing equal
opportunities people in leadership have
the power to create opportunities and
mentor people on their team and having a
mentor within your company is one of the
most powerful tools for your career
growth but you're much less likely to
find support from leadership if no one
in leadership looks like you or have the
same background as you so companies
without diverse leadership are much less
likely to provide the same amount of
opportunities for mentorship for
minorities on their teams and this suite
pretty much summarizes what lack of
representation feels like so these are
the common challenges that I've talked
about and we can begin to address them
on our teams so a key part of making
positive change is being okay with
making mistakes and learning from them
as programmers it's really hard to admit
that we've made mistakes I think but if
you think about it the whole concept of
building tech is about making mistakes
and learning from them that's why we
conduct to user research that's why we
write tests that's why the QA that's why
we iterate so let's approach inclusion
work with the same attitude it's okay
and even encouraged to make mistakes as
long as you acknowledge them and learn
from them and don't make the exact same
mistake again
and building inclusive environments
requires a lot of trust and openness
because it's sometimes an uncomfortable
process so creating a safe space for
people to make mistakes is really
important and in the spirit of making
mistakes and learning from them I will
share some of the mistakes that I've
made some of the statements that I've
made about diversity in tech and kind of
explain why they were wrong and what I
learned so there's there's this common
thing known as a pipeline problem which
is like saying
you know I'd love to have more women on
my team but there just aren't that many
who are interested in it that's the
pipeline problem and many people will
talk about this problem when talking
about the lack of people from
underrepresented groups in tech and it
refers to the notion that diversity in
tech doesn't exist because there's a
lack of qualified candidates because
those people weren't interested in the
first place this is completely false and
it's been debunked like by everyone
right so the truth is in 1986 women held
37% of Cs degrees and that has dropped
to 18% today women have always been
interested in computer science they even
invented computer science but they've
been pushed out and now over 40% of
women leave software at some point in
their career similarly in the u.s. 50%
of CS graduates are black and Latino and
yet only 4% of the programming workforce
is black and Latina some have used this
pipeline metaphor to describe how women
and other minorities get pushed out of
stem and it's referred to as the leaky
pipeline and this drawing kind of
describes that like you see how there's
like women that go through the pipeline
but then the pipeline is leaky so at the
end it's mostly men another thing that I
said is you know coder is gender and
race lines like I used to believe this
that's what I thought I loved about
programming right like programs they
don't have a gender and race and when
you're writing code were just evaluated
by the compiler
but code doesn't run in a vacuum mmm
this is a gif
all right code doesn't run in a vacuum
and we have to take into account the
cultural context in which we write and
evaluate code we write code on teams and
it's evaluated by other humans who live
in the world and have biases I learned
this the hard way and eventually change
my name from Alexandra to Alex to be
more gender neutral so that I would stop
getting her ass on code forms and I go
by Alex chin this is another thing that
I've said you know I'd love to hire more
women or more immigrants or more older
folks but I don't want to have to lower
the
for my team and a lot of really
well-meaning folks say this and this
statement is actually super insulting
because it presupposes that whatever
group you're talking about is less good
at programming than the majority group
which is simply not true there's no like
inherent programming gene and the truth
is when you hire minorities you're able
to raise the bar of your team because
you're hiring from a larger pool of
people right that makes sense and then
also ask yourself who sets the bar what
group do they belong to and how could
their biases have come into play when
judging who meets the bar so a young
woman once said to me like oh my male
peers always say that I'm taking away
their job offers because I'm a woman and
tech companies are trying to hire more
women right now and firstly that's not
true it's harder for a woman to get a
job in software engineer as shown by the
study I cited before but the problems
that people have with that is they don't
like the idea of affirmative action they
think it's discriminatory or sexist or
racist to favor an underrepresented
group over the majority group but that's
wrong the idea behind affirmative action
is to give a boost to those who have
been pushed down by the system so that
it ends up being actually fair like if
you think of two candidates that seem to
have the same skill level but one of
them has had to work like two times
harder to get the same opportunities and
overcome the challenges that we
discussed earlier to end up in what
seems to be the same place do they
really have the same skill level and
another way to think about affirmative
action is that people in the majority
group have been receiving boosts because
of their majority group belonging their
whole life like in school when applying
for internships for jobs and receiving
mentorship so the boost of affirmative
action simply aims to correct this big
imbalance and that's why it's important
and this goes back to the popular
concept that African Americans have to
be for example twice as good as white
Americans in order to receive the same
opportunities this is something that
I've also said you know this women only
have two fathers excluding men that's
not fair
women should learn to code with men
since they have to work with men
workplace this is doing them a
disservice there's a lot of safe spaces
in tech for minority groups like
lesbians who tech or Transpac they're
both awesome but the criticism of safe
spaces comes up a lot and it's generally
that they're discriminating against the
majority group you know why do people
even need youth groups and they make
minority groups like overly sensitive
and doesn't prepare them for real life
but safe spaces for minority groups are
important because everyone deserves a
safe place in which to do your work and
in which to work on what you're
passionate about and if you think about
it most environments are safe spaces for
one group of people or another whether
they intend to be or not like a
programming conference or a hackathon is
a really safe space for white nation men
even though it's not strictly a men's
hackathon because they're vastly
over-represented and they're expected to
do well and most things are geared
towards them and this is from the TV
show Silicon Valley other groups need
safe spaces too which is why all women's
events all black events all career
events are important and it might feel
kind of unfair and uncool to not be
invited to a conference or a party but
that's fine like that's okay just learn
to live with the feeling of discomfort
and understand the best health folks
from underrepresented backgrounds feel
when they go to an event where they're
sparsely represented and so as I've said
I've made a ton of mistakes and that's
fine and the reason it's fine is because
I'm committed to always listening to
people who have less privileged than me
and learning about their experiences and
making more mistakes and learning from
them and that's really the most that
anyone can do so once you're committed
to making a positive change and you've
learned from other folks who have less
privilege you can start to make
meaningful and measurable change and I
use the words meaningful and measurable
here because they're important when
starting something new it's really easy
to get excited and want to make a ton of
changes but as we learn from Google's
failures it's important to be strategic
and make changes that are meaningful
that will actually move the needle and
changes that we can measure and so this
part the top will deal with specific and
actual advice on how to build a diverse
and inclusive team so we've talked about
the falsehood
the pipeline problem so we're going to
assume that there's enough qualified
people from underrepresented backgrounds
in tech and that we're going to focus
more on how to attract them hire them
and retain them and mention them and why
our team's homogenous to begin with it's
not really anyone's fault you're not
trying to exclude people you're not
saying like no women don't apply but we
hire we tend to hire our friends and we
hire people that we went to school with
and our friends friends and people who
fit our culture and people who have
things in common with us and so lack of
diversity on a team in a lot of cases
happens not on purpose but on accident
however diverse and inclusive
environments happen on purpose they
happen because that's the intention and
so that's we're going to talk about
doing now and the common thread along
all these recommendations is really like
how can I rethink my company's culture
and hiring and management processes in a
way that provides equal opportunity for
all and the way to do that is to
challenge your assumptions recognize
your biases and when they occur and to
change the system to make sure that it's
more fair and will apply this line of
thinking throughout different parts of
the employee lifecycle so the most
important part of starting diversity
iversity and inclusion work is to
measure progress we're scientists we
love data we pride ourselves on being
data-driven so let's be drats
data-driven about diversity and the
first step to making measurable change
within your company is measuring where
you are so how will you know if you're
successful if you can't measure how far
you've come
so that means actually gas during the
diversity data on your team and once you
have that you can set meaningful goals
you know by how much you want X
percentage to grow so a Skillshare we
recently started collecting diversity
data and we made the choice to collect
gender and race data only to start and
we tried to be as inclusive as possible
so we let people kind of fill in their
own identity instead of providing a
checklist and we also gathered gadabout
what team they're on whether or not
their manager whether or not they're in
leadership that way we can identify if
there's a glass ceiling if people are
being promoted equally if we have
minorities in leadership positions and
this data informs the goals that you set
just like any metric revenue da um a you
you should be setting diversity goals
same way you set those goals and you
should be ambitious about them just the
same way that you're ambitious about
your product goals so another important
place to measure data is your hiring
process if you find that you're unable
to hire minorities do an audit of your
hiring process and find out where
they're dropping off like how many do
you reach out to how many resumes you
read how many make it through that and
the phone screen and the technical
interview in the culture interview and
how many in the end get a job like find
out where the people are dropping off
and then fix that piece of your
interview process and there's a lot of
other data that you can gather to make
better decisions and project includes a
really great resource for how to do that
so creating an inclusive culture is a
crucial part of building a diverse team
and as Erica joy says you should follow
on Twitter immediately inclusion is
recognizing that there are systems to
disfavor underrepresented groups at play
in the workplace and working to
counteract them and these pieces of
advice will help you create a more
inclusive culture so define and share
clear compensation bands currently
female software engineers make 30
percent less than their male
counterparts which is very exciting to
me personally if you define and share
compensation bands with your team it'll
help ensure that a group of employees
isn't pages proportionately less than
another you should encourage and support
employee resource groups support safe
spaces for underrepresented groups to
get together and mentor each other you
should promote a healthy work-life
balance to embrace all types of
employees like maybe cranking code late
into the night is not great for parents
and you should use diversity benefits to
attract and retain employees so for
example do you provide health services
that cover all people like disabled
people and women and parents if so make
that clear and then most importantly you
should hire an HR person and this is
super important HR usually doesn't seem
like a big priority for startups but
having one full-time person working on
culture employee happiness and inclusion
goes a really long way so the only way
to make divert diversity and inclusion
happen is to make it a real priority so
how to attract folks from
underrepresented groups this is one of
the main issues tech companies voice in
failing to build diverse team
they just can't find the people but they
are there trust me
and having an inclusive culture is a big
piece of attracting them sponsoring
diverse events is a really good way to
send positive signals that you care
about this stuff explicitly stating your
job descriptions that you value
diversity will also send a really strong
signal and once you reach critical mass
ie enough minorities on your team that
other folks will see it as a space and
supportive environment they'll gravitate
towards your organization um
interviewing is a really big part of the
process of building a diverse team and I
think most interview processes are
broken it's subject to a lot of bias and
it can be really stressful for the
interviewing but there are ways we can
mitigate all of this are you
interviewing enough minorities a study
has shown that women are three times
more likely to get hired if the
company's interviewing another woman for
the role diverse representation
throughout the interview process is also
important this sends a really strong
signal to your interviewee that you have
a diverse team and it can minimize for
stereotype threat account for different
communication styles and cultural
backgrounds a lot of interviews require
that the interview we brag about
themselves but that's considered
impolite in a lot of cultures and
minorities are more likely to experience
imposter syndrome so asking people to
rate their skills might not be the best
way to get an accurate reflection of
their abilities and we can mitigate
stereotype threat during technical
interviews by asking candidates about a
project that they've worked on that
they're proud of this way they're
reminded that they're skilled and
capable before they start your technical
question at school sure we always say
that our job during an interview is not
to spot weaknesses but to find strengths
so looking through that lens forces us
to work against our media biases and we
make sure to determine after the fact
whether or not any weaknesses we flagged
are coachable so using a rubric is one
of the most important things in my eyes
if you have a rubric that includes all
the skills that you're evaluating for
with a scale from poor to excellent for
each and examples it'll really help
ensure that you're actually evaluating
candidates on a predetermined set of
skills and not like on culture fit or on
a gut feeling and along with this
interviewers should be trained properly
and last hip you should really eat
before you interview someone
as I mentioned earlier it's really hard
to work against your unconscious biases
when you're hungry so seriously like eat
every time you're going to interview
someone and last but not least how do we
support everyone's career growth equally
we should acknowledge and embrace
differences we don't all have the same
cultural backgrounds communication
styles and personality types and we need
to make sure that managers acknowledge
these differences and celebrate them
team members should be presented with
the same opportunities to grow in
advance whether or not they're confident
enough to ask for them whether or not
they're introverted or extroverted and
at school sure we talk a lot about the
importance of understanding your
manatees motivations and their strengths
and weaknesses in order to continue to
present them with opportunities you
should build confidence and trust it's a
big part of managing someone similarly
you need to build trust with your team
so Ison issue arises they will feel
comfortable coming to you explicit
mentorship sponsorship and training
opportunities should be available to
everyone whether or not they ask for it
and this can be as simple as asking the
person you manage hey would you like a
mentor do you know this training is
available do you know this role is open
and this goes without saying but fair
and equal pay should be available to all
you can't expect to retain people if
you're not prepared to pay them fairly
and so the most important takeaway from
this part of the talk is in order to
make change we need to understand that
the system is biased towards the
majority group so we need to constantly
be challenging our own assumptions about
how our workplace operates recognize our
biases and when they occur and change
the system when we identify that so as I
mentioned the weight of those and
diverse and inclusive environment is to
care and commit listen learn make
mistakes and then make meaningful and
measurable changes and it sounds like a
lot of work but it shouldn't be harder
to hire diverse people than to build
self-driving cars
and it really isn't and hopefully you've
gotten some national advice from this
talk and you can start to put it into
practice in your own workplaces and on
your team and I encourage you to check
out these resources for much more
information they're really fantastic and
as I stated earlier all this advice is
about actively counteracting the
systemic discrimination in the tech
industry and I want to close this top
with a quote by Beverly Daniel Tatum and
it's specifically about racism but it
applies to other forms of systemic
oppression
I sometimes visualize the ongoing cycle
of racism as a moving walkway at the
airport active racist behavior is
equivalent to walking fast on the
conveyor belt
passive racist behavior is equivalent to
standing still on the walkway no overt
effort is being made but the conveyor
belt moves the bystanders along to the
same destination as those who are
actively walking but unless they are
walking actively in the opposite
direction at a speed faster than the
conveyor belt unless they are actively
anti-racist they will find themselves
carried along with the others our job
now is to actively walk in the opposite
direction at a high speed thank you I'm

organizers organizations I'm involved
