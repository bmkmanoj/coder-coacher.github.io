coming to the robots panel will just go
around do some introductions first then
we'll have a couple of quick demos and
then we'll start the discussion so my
name is Brian Hughes I'm about to start
a new job so I won't talk about work
stuff that's kind of boring but so I am
the lead organizer of the node BOTS SF
meetup group so we meet here in San
Francisco thank you and so once a month
we have a meetup where everyone can come
in and we have like a theme tak around
doing robots with JavaScript so it's
really awesome to check us out on meetup
com i'm also the responsible for
maintaining the Raspberry Pi support for
the Johnny Five library which you know
Cass talked about this morning in her
keno so Johnny Five is a nodejs library
for doing all kinds of hardware stuff so
I do Raspberry Pi work there and yeah I
also do a lot of a node.js stuff there
too i'm involved in the hardware working
group the inclusivity working group and
probably some more stuff coming up in
the future it's here so yeah that's me
I'm Cassandra you're probably sick of
seeing me on stage at this point I did
the keynote this morning I I work at all
zero user management and identity
management I am a node BOTS author I had
a book come out in December called
learning JavaScript robotics from packt
publishing I do wearables and yeah so
hey my name is tomo mimura I'm actually
I wasn't originally to be here I'm a
substitute so I'm totally unprepared
yeah and yeah so um you might know me as
a girly Mac on social media I think
people know that my handle better than
my real name so I'm actual front-end
engineer I'm not really a hardware
person up until like last year sometimes
and I started hacking around with
raspberry pi or three know and I find
it's really fun then I read you know
discovered in Johnny Five it was like
wow to me because I don't like it you
know writing scene stuff and you know
I'm a JavaScript person so I really
loved it I totally hooked on it so on
yeah and I had a workshop yesterday and
I
going to have another workshop two more
about raspberry pi so it actually
doesn't use you know Johnny Five or
anything no Jay yes but well I'm gonna
mention about it anyways hey I'm Alex
club and the hacker advocate hackster
deo which is a site for people to teach
and learn electronics by sharing their
hardware projects i'm into EG robotics
music languages and things like that and
the intersections thereof I've been on
the board of a couple hacker spaces
including noisebridge which is where I
used to run these bike lights workshops
and that's also how I first got involved
in node but i think we co-led Brian and
I a note but smart bike lights awesome
custom rdb workshop that's fantastic it
was awesome my name is Nadine I'm an
engineer and I do community outreach at
punch through design and essentially
what we do is we make the beam which is
a bluetooth low energy products and I'm
more interested in inter connecting
bluetooth low energy devices or
Bluetooth devices with mobile for
example iOS or Android and so a lot of
my projects focus around there awesome
so we all have some projects to show off
I'll go and do my demo first so there's
a thing that we like to do a lot of
meetups if we ever have like a long
hackathon and this is called a sumo bot
competition and this is where people can
build little robots that are on wheels
and we get two of them we put them in a
circle and try and push each other out
it's just like sumo wrestling you know
it's a lot of fun and they're also
pretty easy to build I have one that's a
little more advanced than the average
one so I have a controller this right
here I can't see very well but this is
actually an old Atari controller I had
this Atari controller and the plug had
completely corroded away so I could use
it you know in an actual Atari but I cut
the end off and got this wired up to an
Arduino so i can now read off of and
atari controller which is pretty awesome
and then the sumo bot itself is this
thing right here so i just have this
little wooden container inside of this
is a raspberry pi that
connected to Wi-Fi so i have a node
server running on my laptop here no
client and then a node server running on
the resume of pie so i can send commands
back and forth and so whenever I take
the controller i can then have it drive
around which I probably just turn this
thing off helps when you actually run
the program by the way and there we go
so I can now try this all around
remotely it's all battery-powered and
yeah I don't say if you seem about
competitions before and yeah this is a
kind of the stuff that we will often
create at our node bus hackathons also
that brings up node BOTS day oh yes so
we have an event at once a year called
node BOTS day and this is where all of
the node BOTS groups around the country
are actually around the world even I
should say on the exact same day we have
a day-long hack event and at this event
what you know we have people that build
all sorts of fun things so there's stuff
like this building somewhere sumo BOTS
if you're really new to it there's
usually people who will do like an
introduction to programming which is
awesome as well and yeah so it's a lot
of fun it's usually in the middle of
summer and keep an eye out for those of
you in San Francisco just follow us on
node wats SF and we'll talk about the SF
event I don't know about everybody else
but Australia has decided july twenty
seventh I don't let anybody else but
Australia AJR decided that least
Australia is doing july 27 but like you
said it's around the world so even if
you're not from san francisco your city
probably has a chapter I manage the
Austin chapter and the New York Chapter
finally got around to joining us last
year so yeah if you even if you're not
from san francisco check it out and
there's probably a new ad BOTS day event
near you so my demos in case you missed
the keynote this morning are you ready
for the hope oh sorry you finish
obviously got ok my demo is my clothes
my belt is connected to the website
forward jas
botanist and so is my jacket and also my
belt is connected to Twitter so if you
tweet at the hashtag know the sash with
any CSS parsable color including named
colors hsl RGB any of those hex even it
will add the color to the queue and so
each of these eight rings represents the
color in the queue the jacket it has
several modes the one right now it shows
colors that were added by users from the
website however if I take my little
controller here I can set it to this
mode which is based on an accelerometer
on the shield and so the pitch and the
role of the controller sets the color of
the hood and the sleeves respectively so
I can change that then i have what i
call rainbow happy fun mode because
rainbows are awesome and in the bottom
here i have a mode oh it's not deciding
to work today is it might be
disconnected how what it is is an RGB
color sensor and if i can get it to
actually show up today nope all right
usually apparently i have a bug in my
code the RGB color sensor feeds color
into the photon and the photon then
turns all of the lights to the color
detected by the RGB color sensor after
using a gamut able to convert it back to
human visible color so that's the jacket
and then let me set that back to online
mode or reset it that works too i guess
and then yeah so those are my demos
alright have my car panel reflex so yeah
I don't have my demo is me because
actually my demo required real cats so I
can't really show it here hahaha the
real reason is because I wasn't planning
to but anyway so recently I have created
something called kita cam if you look it
up i have a some short youtube videos
and stuff too and actually have an open
source so it's a negative report to so
basically what it does it's a and it has
the motion sensor attached to this my
raspberry pi and you know since the
motion right and i set it up by my cat's
dish so when my cats approach into the
dish
it sends the motion then take the photo
then i'm using this open source facial
detection called the kitty door so when
the photo has a cat person is send it in
a cloud so i can watch my cats eating
while i was in on the office so that's
really silly but yeah but to check it
out yeah I haven't in my github so if
you look at our Paquita cam so today I
learned that there is cat facial
recognition software why did quite
nicely I did not know that exists it is
so right now and we actually tune in and
see your cat live streaming can we tune
in and see your cat live streaming
actually no because I took it off oh
yeah the thing is I use a duct tape not
duct tape like a mailing tape to just
put my pie in a wall and you know it's
been cold so i'll be using the heater so
they it gets so it's right off so it
just fell down so it's no longer
attached it also yeah but yeah actually
it is available i forgot the URL so i'm
gonna get have gh-pages actually mmm oh
yeah sweet i totally want to see
someone's because i've discovered that i
can't even keep a plant alive so if i
can have any kind of interaction
remotely with cats that'd be fantastic
meanwhile i'm freaking probably sofia we
have a laptop so hypothetically we can
actually get this up and running
potentially while they're doing that why
don't you yeah totally so i tend to make
a sort of more wearable type things in
the past I've made like EG responsive
wings and stuff my big one right now is
I've got a bike helmet that works on the
same principles of the the smart bike
lights but this time they won't be
favorable because I'll just take the
helmet with me so it's like robot cat
ears that read your brainwaves and do
swivel e things that's best based on the
neck Oh me me you might have heard of
and then they've also got LEDs that use
a light blue beam and it's accelerometer
to like do brake lights or turn signals
if I rotate my head but I've also got
this one-handed binary chorded keyboard
that's ideally going to help me
not get carpal tunnel super early but
probably won't stop me it's gonna be a
superpower I don't know and then I also
bought a little blinky LED soldering
thing and that's less less
computationally interesting it's
literally just the default blink sketch
but made into a little leaf pattern with
the LEDs soldered together she got there
so what I have here is the Death Star
and essentially i use the beam and its
program it has a PS OBO desire inside
and whenever you move the the chip
essentially cuz there's an accelerometer
built n it will play the sound from Star
Wars hopefully you guys can hear this
can you guys hear it it is indeed
playing the imperial march we talked
about if you're interested come find me
and then you guys can kind of play with
this oh yeah I know yeah here I'll toss
this in and send it back you could say
you're awaiting the return of the Death
Star hosh meant to say return of the
jedi i don't know why I'm ysleta it's it
so if you want to talk about oh yeah
this so that's a still photos my cat one
in the center baby finger coordinated
he's just like stop like just like
you're really doing I see right filming
me right now I actually really wanted to
use a like RFID or something to you know
detect which cat but i thought i'm going
to have only one cat cuz you know that
was actually Brian's idea you know yeah
cuz that scan the cab microchips right
you i do i put the rfid chips on my
sisters dogs so if they got near the
bowl like it should play like some noise
or something to turn them from the cat
food because right now my solution is
put it where the dogs can't get it but
if i can get a solution where it would
like buzz at them or something and scare
them off when they got near the capital
maybe there's dog facial recognition
software Adam
yeah we can all hope everybody for a
bank for breeds anyway yeah yeah RFID
would be definitely be a way to do that
yeah definitely identified have a tag
for Batman and a tag for bone and tag
for ace and if it wasn't a sit with was
like just not like zap them like make a
noise not talking about definitely and
then of course you know we can come over
and visit and you know kind of like take
over the network it really started
that's horman team so that's a funny
story so I had to change my Wi-Fi a
society because it used to be no
botanist until someone figured out where
I live do knocked on my door because
wife Isis do so fondest so like well
that's changing right now so ya know
I've had my share of the network
intrusion yeah don't name your your
Wi-Fi network your Twitter handle if you
don't want to be found that's what I
learned come on good advice good advice
it's actually really interesting in the
light of the recent articles that have
come out regarding the US government's
approach to the Internet of Things as a
potential surveillance vector so do you
guys build in anything to protect people
against being able to connect to your
beans is or do you have that plan for
the future um so with bluetooth low
energy once you have in a connection
type of event other you know essentially
like what you call central devices can't
see the type of data that's being passed
in but obviously there needs to be more
security I think that's something that
hopefully we should definitely focus on
in the near future I know that the
particle which is also a popular
platform to use with node but or with a
nodejs is it has an access token that
you can change in case it gets
compromised in case you're doing a
tutorial in your share your screen and
everyone on the internet skis your
access token you can protect yourself
that way yeah it's really interesting
especially interesting that the particle
specifically whenever they have the
first one came out that the spark or
this is their first device they made the
security restriction was actually really
tight like as a developer whenever you
would go to program for the first time
you had to go through
it's like registration process for the
device and you would claim it and once
you had claimed it no one else could
program that until you let it go which
yeah it makes sense i think but at the
same time what happened at like a lot of
conferences and things like this is
young people would use it and then they
would leave it would have these devices
sonals claimant we can do anything about
it so then I you know this is where like
security and usability you know can
really like contradict each other and so
for the next one they actually set up so
that just anyone could then go in and
reclaim it which makes a lot easier to
use but then it's like you know what are
the possibilities for you know security
flaws with that someone can hijack my
jacket or my belt pretty easily at that
point which I've put my own
countermeasures around that so I
basically have a JWT there like any time
it asks the photon to do anything
including like reflashing it because if
you don't have a JWT bye-bye I'm not
talking you yeah I have a friend who
uses LOL ifx bulbs in his house and
whenever I go by there I like stand
outside and connect to the Wi-Fi network
and like mess with his lighting patterns
just because I can it's like it's not
and if you don't if you have an
unsecured Wi-Fi network and you've got
lights I mean that's the pretty much
easiest hack that you can do mmhmm yeah
um I've had friends to roll each other
with chromecast I'll get on their
friends unsecured Wi-Fi network in the
like play like though rick roll each
other on chromecast i know with one
thing with devices you can set a pin
code which is something you can do with
the peen and it's a six digit pin code
so unless someone wants a connect your
device they have to enter that pin code
and if they don't have the right digits
well obviously they can't connect so I
mean that's one you know type of
security that can probably implemented
by developers I think that's gonna be
really important having the optional
measures because if you have it you know
you want to be able to saturate the
market and whatever and so people want
to have convenience and it's always
going to be a selling point people like
usually that's how security fails is
people go for convenience over security
and so if you give them the option at
least then you know both parties who
care more about convenience and who care
more about unlock ability will be able
to be satisfied especially cuz leak it's
starting to affect kids like the whole
vtec hack put like millions of kids in
games out there in public knowledge like
I just made it an extra level of like
terrifying is like the idea of like
being a parent and buying a toy for your
kid and then like oh look your kids full
name is on the Internet where you wanted
it to be oh yeah oh yeah and so often
it's like not even obvious that these
devices are doing it by default so you
know there's like an education aspect to
this but there's also a bit of a
disclosure aspect to this I think as
well you know knowing what these you
know consumer electronics that we buy
are actually doing with our information
as well so moving on a little bit from
this let's actually kind of move to talk
about community and things like this is
something that's been touched on you a
number of times throughout the day I
think I you know you talked about of
course in your keynote this morning you
know very well miles had a talk just
before this about some interesting
community things with the nodejs
community and say yeah I kind of want to
talk about that a little bit more what
are some things you think that we're
doing right and what are some things
that you think we could do better so the
things I think we're doing right again
it's we're out we're reaching out to
communities and we we practice active
inclusion we don't just wait for people
who don't look like us to show up to our
events because that's not going to get
us anywhere we go out and we find people
that might even have the smallest
inkling of interest and we say come join
us come be part of this if you're
interested I think another thing we do
right is I kind of touched on this
everyone enforces the code of conduct
and node Botts every single one of us
recognizes that it is our job to make
sure that this is in the forest there is
no magic leader of node bots that that
will boot people from get er it's
everyone's respective collective you
know responsibility to keep our
community in a good state and I think
that's one thing node bots in particular
is doing really really well at and yeah
I don't really organized any events but
I do host some events so I work at a
company called popping up and we're
located on folsom a third in soma it's
right by moscone right so it's really
great location boy you know people who's
visited in town for the conference's
what's
many many people many of us are working
in the area too so it's actually the
place they have a lot of events
including not both states so we did have
an oat boats day itself last year in our
office and it's pretty cool and my own
approach you know besides host an event
it's a so again I told you initially I'm
a front-end engineer and I really don't
have any background in electrical
engineering such and I haven't really
why you're Danny and I don't I Billy
Sutter I basically don't even know how
so I'm basically telling everybody look
you know even I could do this you can do
to kind of approach though yeah a quick
informal poll raise your hand if you
have formal electrical engineering
training on this panel raise your hand
if you've been doing electronics for
more than four years see and even I'll
say so I have I do have a background in
this but like doing like the JavaScript
using javascript to program robotics I'm
like I think two two and a half years in
that so yeah I'm still new to a number
of aspects of this one thing that really
impressed me about j/s confi you a few
years ago is that they were using this
process for selecting speakers where it
was a blind selection process so no one
who was deciding who would be a speaker
knew the names or pretty much any
demographic information about them and
they were trying to judge them using
that method solely on the method the
merit of their proposals and what they
were talking about I know that merit is
a sort of hot button word right now but
I think that this method works really
well and at the same time they put out a
lot of announcements in communities that
usually don't have much representation
at the conference and so by combining
those two techniques like reaching out
to people who don't usually hear about
these things and having a blind
selection process they managed to get a
really good ratio of cool people it was
close to fifty fifty generalized wasn't
it I had as far as I understand i wasn't
able to go but it sounded really really
affected i think i remember how they
were they were split along gender lines
and they had a very good
makes of non white folks there and that
that was like that especially with
something that just kind of stuck out in
my mind as progress as something that
we're moving forward it's a great way
well it's a great way to avoid any of
those usual complaints of like oh you're
just letting people in who aren't as
good because you need tokenism or
whatever you know it avoids all of that
how that double standard is always fun
to deal with yeah and so with that you
just can't claim it but it like that out
Reese it's like those two things
together what's necessary you can't do
one without the other you know if you do
just a blind selection but then you
don't do any outreach you know you're
still just going to get the usual
candidates so you kind of need to get
out there and get speaking and get
talking with people get people to apply
you on a much smaller scale with know
about to set for example so we don't do
like a blind selection anything like
that I just go ask people to speak
because you know we're niche enough but
yeah I pay a lot of attention to like
the diversity speakers coming in and you
ask you very very heavily towards you
know not this white straight males
effectively in fact is I've been doing
this for about I think two years now and
we've had three sis white male speakers
the whole time and because one thing I
just kind of go piqua tension to see the
effect that this has had on attendees as
well like you know we've seen the
diversity stats of the attendees go up
as well so it's really important to have
that you know representation for young
people on stage I think I think for me
personally I try to do a lot of outreach
with either students or at different
workshops and you know try to cater
projects to you know beginners and make
them more aware how did you saw during
and how a circuit works and then from
there build on the complexity of
projects so for example I like working
with high school students I probably
will have a little workshop with hack
right for people who want to come in on
Sunday afternoons I minutes the whole
point is just to make it super friendly
and have them be inspired to make their
own projects or their their own IOT
products as well so that actually segues
pretty well to the next thing I want to
talk you talk about yeah we've heard
this mentioned a few times though today
as well and that's kind of the role that
education and documentation play in the
success of projects as well I you know
there's this sort of like myth in
program
that it's all about the code you know
whoever writes the best code is who wins
but that's not really the reality of the
situation this is something that I think
miles mentioned in the previous socket
I'd also heard is if we look at the
jQuery library you know I think we all
know jquery so here here is used jquery
before you know yeah pretty much
everyone in the room right well if you
ask why that project succeeded in fact
John Resig that the guy who created
jquery he talked about this he said
jquery succeeded because of the
documentation and not the kid so yeah I
think you know we see the same coming up
and you know how is this playing out and
the hardware world is kind of my
question of the panel the platforms you
see succeeding are the ones that are
well documented I mean be that software
or hardware I mean punch through and
particle have done amazing jobs
documenting their platforms and that's
why they're doing well the fact is you
can't get anywhere with node BOTS with
somebody if they think they can't do it
if you if you just give someone a board
and and tell them go build something
ninety-five percent of the time they're
just going to put that board down and
never touch it again because they think
they can't documentation and education
are the only reason node bots have seen
any growth because we have to break that
barrier especially with folks who suffer
from any confidence issues whatsoever
breaking down that wall and saying yes
you can do this you are capable of this
in fact you'd be kick ass at it like
breaking down that wall is something
that documentation and education are
pivotal in in helping yeah it's it's key
to our success as a community and as
platforms yeah so it personally
documents everything cuz you know
sometimes well maybe I can say that's
how that's the way I learn you know I in
a recording maybe software hardware it
doesn't matter i just you know create
something and write it down then i
rewrite to make sure that everybody
understand how I you know how I worked
on so I did document everything about
this particular project you know the
Killa cam too so I haven't github
and I have my own blog in girl mac com
at the same time I really love hex tile
and yeah that's the way of people can
contribute stuff in law and I have long
a lot by looking at it actually so we
try we sort of involved people on both
sides of the spectrum or all along the
spectrum from people who are very much
beginners to people who are actually
they have their own hardware platforms
and we try to create that interface
because when you're creating a hardware
platform the community that you build is
at least as important as the hardware
that you do because that's all
everything that goes into the ease of
use of the platform and whether people
will choose it doesn't matter if you
have better features like slightly than
another platform if they have a much
better community like particle or like
leaping then they're going to do better
it's amazing and also there's this focus
on auto didacticism so like teaching
yourself we have people also who are on
the sort of transition from just doing
DIY projects up to creating their own
platforms for the first time and a lot
of them are self-taught a lot of us are
self-taught and I think that once you
are ready to join an in-person community
that can be a great way to for people to
learn you learn from each other in
person but there's also this kind of
gatekeeper culture among nerds which is
that you know in order to enter a space
like that sometimes you prefer to have
some prior experience or else you show
up and you don't really know what to do
we don't really know how to talk to
anyone and there's occasionally going to
be that person who's like making fun of
you because you don't know anything
basically about the subject even if
you're curious which is arguably your
most valuable asset you know if you
don't already have some experience it
can be really tough to get in there so
having those resources available online
is so important and it's so exciting
that it's becoming so prevalent I have
so late December I actually worked with
a couple of hardware I work with no
Dempsey you bluetooth Adafruit i think
it's called easy link and with when I
while I was working with on those
projects I was looking through the
documentation so I was building you know
some I was building you know a prototype
and a good way to know how to do
documentation
is by going through other sites and
seeing how their documentation is and
seeing how you can make yours better or
what you wish they had so that you knew
that so that you knew what the bug was
or what you could have done better and
then you know you can try to put that in
your own documentation and so that was
kind of the inspiration of us like
creating good documentation because for
some of those it was really hard to find
certain things to get it going to get
the hardware going and if you didn't
know this thing that you found in some
thread in some form that you'll help you
happen to stumble across you know wasn't
an easy thing to find you know so for
that you know for our documentation we
try to make it really clear about
specific things that you know beginners
would need to know and as a moderator on
the beam talk forum for people who are
like making fun of other people or who
are saying they're newbies I try to
encourage you know that's a great
question or that's you know let me point
you to hear and reach out if you have
any more questions like definitely keep
the language you know very encouraging
very inspiring and for people who are
kind of trolls on the forums you know
try to talk to them privately to see if
you know that environment Kate you know
kids essentially be up right happy it's
interesting to to see the different
types of documentation that work for
different people so some people learn
very much by pictures and texts and like
including note could have code
schematics and bills of materials and
things like that and some people like to
watch a video of someone going through
it some people really can't do it unless
they've got the thing in their hands and
so finding creative ways to incorporate
all of those and support all of those
media in your documentation is very
important I think that node bus does a
fantastic job of that yeah and also just
understand that there's different types
of users you know says you know learning
to have empathy for people at all kinds
of different experience levels and that
it's also I think are important to keep
in mind that like people who write the
code people are really really close to
the code often usually aren't the best
people to write a lot of the
documentation you could be great for
doing API Docs but you know api docs
aren't the only thing in good
documentation you also need tutorials
and examples and a lot of other things
and you're having that sort of diversity
of documentation that talks to different
people at different experience levels is
really really important as well naija
mentioned documentation helps you find
bugs writing a tutorial is the easiest
way to find a bug with a library you
write the tutorial app and all of a
sudden wait a minute that doesn't do
that I thought it would so documentation
can make your code better it's a
symbiotic relationship so I think we've
got five minutes left do we want to take
questions from the audience yeah let's
do anybody where's your hand anybody or
we can just keep out way there you go
well help to have any of us programmed a
drone I have done a little work with
node copters so yes a little sore here a
little bit uh-oh also a little note
copter does have the ability to do some
like you can you can code slightly
autonomous drone mine wasn't smart but
it was autonomous like it knew to launch
go four meters forward and then land
again like it no by no means complex
autonomy but you know some sort of
autonomy I did a fun little project with
AEG where I hooked up a nearest guy
mindflex to some Pinocchio wireless RF
mesh networked controllers and basically
you would focus really hard or you would
chill out really hard the focusing works
better for me anyway and uh and then the
copter would like fly up and like hit
the ceiling and stuff because I had no
speed control at that point and so
definitely easier to do with the
focusing than relaxing but um so that
was technically a drone because you know
it wasn't human-piloted and it was
responding to the stimulus but all I
could really do is go up and down really
fun though can imagine like a carry
moment where you're like frustrated you
look at the drone and it just flies up
hits the ceiling and combustion oh it's
flying my house and hit my cat back up
hold rating I've got scars quadcopters
it's not good my cats always run away
from the drones so I got lucky with that
what yeah oh so you an out of control
I haven't worked at this myself but the
3d robotics smart drone has a pin out so
that you can connect an Arduino and I'm
excited to explore that anything else
all sorts of stuff so um how about this
what's just in a really briefly what's
the favorite your most favorite project
that you've worked on Hoodie so mine is
I had an aquarium at home with day and
nighttime lighting systems and it's
controlled by a raspberry pi how would
you say yeah the one I'm showing yeah
but um yeah I have to think about a new
project I'm yeah this is really tough
can you go well one of my current
projects that I'm enjoying right now is
I'm making basically like a card
matching app and that's connected to the
beam so whenever you shake the beam
because it has an accelerometer built in
it actually will reshuffle the deck and
i hope to kind of build on that in the
future and that would also be a tutorial
i will be posting for people who want to
learn iOS and integrating hardware with
their iOS app I think my next node BOTS
project actually is going to be built
these Delta bots a long time ago based
on Jason Huggins tapster a blueprint the
tip and source and they play these style
of phones which are like little
electronic keyboards but I never
finished programming them and I think
it'd be the perfect chance to hook them
up to node BOTS and have them be
dynamically programmable it'd be
fantastic and have them do terrible
sounding music imagine my next
hypothetical project I want to make a
small quadcopter that travels the earth
and when people say well actually it
just like takes a little solenoid and
bops them on the shin like not enough to
hurt just enough to be like whoa what
was that maybe people will start with
will actually after that you know
there's like a little bot to the point
like just knock you in the shin just
enough to make you think we need to say
well actually can it push the glasses up
their nose what can it push the glasses
up their nose I would emphasize their
point i think that would encourage
behavior and I want to like tone it down
however if someone says not cool in
response maybe then they'll push the
glasses up to all the work on that
speech speech recognition being what it
is yeah I think we need like fleets of
these is going around like every
conference out there yes and then the
German government catches it with an
eagle because they're doing that now yea
though eventually they would all end up
in San Francisco so metal it was
probably true I'm kidding I love San
Francisco all right um I think we're
right out of time yeah I think we'll
call it thank you everyone for coming
out yeah y'all rock</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
