and that I've been doing Android
development since way before we actually
had real phones my one of my big
concerns and that is I want to have a
device that's my communications got my
data on it that I trust implicitly and
that's going to require people you and
being able to the vet what's going on
what's going on inside these devices
that's way easier when it's an open
source operating system where you can
take a look at a lot of the source code
maybe not all and that but we can get a
lot closer than we can with your
traditional proprietary mobile operating
systems and so that's why I've been
getting into Angela I don't have the
technical skills to make that device but
if I can help you'll raise Android in
general one hopes that you know other
people and that will be able to come in
and solve that particular problem and
give us the devices that we can trust
yeah well I mean particularly here in
2013 and that we're starting to see you
know a veritable explosion in these open
source mobile operating systems used to
be was it with Android and you know
there'd be some interest in mammo or
Moblin or things like that but now you
know we've got Firefox OS going to be
you know available shortly there's going
to be you know sailfish there's going to
be ties in and that's and and and ubuntu
mobile and so these give us more
opportunities they're basically more
shots of being able to create devices
that are both mass-market friendly yet
give us that sort of a device that we
can trust and that then we know what's
going on under the covers will any of
those be the success that androids been
maybe maybe not um and that but the more
basically mindshare there is on open
source mobile and that is generally
better overall for trying to you know
Chief some of these privacy and security
objectives now you get to the questions
of well are we there yet I mean do we
have android devices that we can trust
him
politically certainly compared to some
of the alternatives you know we're in
reasonable shape and that a lot of
people have taken a look at the android
open source code security experts have
been poring over at finding you know
various holes that eventually get fixed
on the other hand you know there's still
limits it's not all that easy
necessarily for somebody else to come up
with their own remix or distro of
Android that's maybe security focused
and that then you can easily put on an
ordinary consumer grade device some
devices support that sort of replacement
a lot of devices unfortunately don't
well there's been progress in that area
there's a lot more that needs to be done
so that you know even though maybe the
device from the manufacturer is more you
know aimed at ordinary people and that
you can dial in how much security you
want and need and that without
necessarily voiding the warranty and
that or you know winding up with a phone
that's more of a paperweight when you're
done Android is of course you know
powering lots of things nowadays I just
heard a figure from from Pandora and
that where they think that their device
database of the available devices that
they've seen the Pandora for android is
running on is like 10,000 and and of
course that runs the gamut it's a lot of
phones it's a lot of tablets but it's
also other stuff it's you know airplane
seat back entertainment systems it is
new appliances it's televisions a game
consoles and so on and so some people
may be concerned that oh no we're going
to wind up with another monoculture the
way we wound up with windows being your
overly dominant I don't think androids
going to get there and that but androids
not going away anytime real soon and
that be and it's open source nature
gives us the ability to get its out into
a lot of different areas that you know
other operating systems just aren't
going to be able to do one of the things
a lot of people and that comment on is
how much i do on stack overflow that's
like over 9000 answers that I've
delivered out there
and that and you know it you know
there's a reasonable amount of time
involved in typing all those things in
and as people wonder why my bothering I
am I just you know keyed on getting that
stack overflow you know reputation
rating up real high I don't particularly
care about that v but is that overflow
and similar sorts of things are my
primary way of marketing you aren't
going to see ad banners for my books
you're not going to see abdul boards on
highway 101 and that saying i mean that
you want to go you'll get some
consulting or training or whatever and
that that i'm providing and that my way
of marketing is very sorts of things
that i'm trying to sell its delivering
knowledge and i was trying to help
people get over these technical hurdles
figuring that okay well if i give away
some of this for free and that they may
realize hey maybe there's other things
that this commons where guy and that's
going to be able to do to help me solve
all their technical problems and that in
one form or another android is very much
reminiscent you know in contrast with
say like iOS and that from the way say
you know windows was to OS 10 windows
tended to give you a lot more capability
in terms of tailoring the environment
changing things up in that which is a
double-edged sword android is much the
same way and that users seem to have
some challenges in in figuring out all
the possible things that their android
device can do because you know it's it's
like you having the swiss army knife and
then trying to figure out okay which one
of these blade things is what i'm
supposed to use to solve this problem
you run into the same sorts of issues in
that if it's if it's got too many bells
and whistles and that how do i get any
particular thing done iOS has done in
general a better job of trying to help
people stay on task at any one point in
time with downsides of being able you
know rapidly switch between things and
do multiple things at one time which is
where android strengths are and so it
really is going to kind of depend on the
user i mean which honey which sort of
model and that do they are they more
comfortable with in terms of how
they want to interact with their device
what they want out of it in terms of
what developers run into an Android
that's a problem that kind of comes in
waves and that the there is kind of the
the panic attack du jour and that when
it comes to really any platform
development that's a rapidly evolving
platform and Android certainly is one of
those and so you know it used to be you
know how threading and that making sure
how are we handling our you know
configuration changes like when the user
rotates the screen or drops their tablet
into a keyboard dock how we handling
those things that used to be a huge
concern it's still somewhat of a concern
and that but it is a bit a little bit as
the earlier concern we've gotten more
knowledge out there people understand
more okay here are some tried and
trusted patterns now if you follow these
steps and that it'll generally going to
work nowadays I think it's you know you
run into things like the new mapping
subsystem they've replaced the original
maps that we were able to add to our
android application with a new more
powerful one and that but they changed
all the api's around and that there's
new challenges in terms of how do you
determine what devices are going to be
able to use these maps be able to arm
you know and how do you translate
constructs from the old mapping to the
new one and so there's tons of people
from you know not being able to get the
basic hello world of a map sample from
the documentation to run all the way up
to you I pull off this particular trick
now that I have a totally different way
of interacting with the maps if I had
been you on the Android team way back
when and that end was working on trying
to set things up the the number one
thing that seems to be a constant
undercurrent among all the questions and
that is this context and we're
constantly passing context objects
around to various methods in that and
what context do you use and that because
there is a handful of them and it's not
necessarily all that clear what's the
right one to use in any given
circumstance and yet we're constantly
having to provide these in for
from being able to get a translated
version of a strange being able to you
know render a user interface and so the
that feels like one of those things that
started fairly simple and then kept
getting stuff glommed more and more and
more and more on it and now we've got
this big ball of wax that we're all
trying to deal with if there were a way
of trying to simplify that so that we're
not dealing with quite so many of those
questions and that that would have been
useful thing to do in terms of what
Android here in 2013 Android is you know
we're certainly going to see an android
5.0 possibly you know in the time frame
of the google i/o conference we're going
to continue to see a steady march in new
devices probably some new form factors
boob project glass is going to start
rolling out at least a developer's this
year in all likelihood maybe we'll see
more movement say in the SmartWatch
category arm and that the and so from in
terms of official Android and what
Google's doing in that it's going to be
just be a steady progression more of the
same we're going to be seeing you know
more manufacturers get into Android and
that particularly in areas that aren't
your typical handsets you aren't your
typical tablets were there playing
Android and all sorts of different areas
and that I'm just going to continue see
more and more developers get on board
with Android particularly for things
that aren't necessarily stuff you're
gonna be distributing on the Play Store
enterprise apps small businesses
government schools and that apps for
niche audiences and that where some of
the traditional concerns about what's
suitable for the Play Store how do you
distribute these things get changed and
that giving us new and exciting
challenges to deal with
