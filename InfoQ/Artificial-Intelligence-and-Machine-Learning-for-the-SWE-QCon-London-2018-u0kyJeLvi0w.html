for software engineers I also want to
talk about AI but rather than keep
saying AI or ml I'm just gonna say ml
just to simplify things AI is just a
sub-branch of machine learning so it's
kind of irrelevant which we which we get
into as well said in a past life I was
the co-founder of SpringSource
so Java is really my background I was
once you know generic Java developer as
Laura said but I've made that journey
away from Java towards using machine
learning daily I tried this first when I
started Bumby loans I had this crazy
idea to leave Java and become a consumer
finance person which was a big mistake I
don't know anything about consumer
finance and I also failed quite
miserably to embrace and roll out
machine learning while I was there yet
for some reason I ended up joining a
machine learning startup where we use AI
n ml to try and solve the problem of
performance optimization and what I want
to do is talk about what I did wrong at
bamboo why I have to write a skipjack
she's gotta give you all a sense of how
a software engineer we should all care
about machine learning and how we can
actually do something meaningful with it
let's start with the story
my best friend is moving house and he
knows I'm a bit of a smart home geek so
he asked me hey mate I want to I want to
be able to speak to a thing to make it
do things this is his whole
specification and he's an apple nerd so
he's really optimistic about the Apple
home pod so I went to try it out and the
speaker is incredible if you've not
heard it yet you should definitely try
it out but in my house I've got a ton of
these Sano's Wan speakers which have
alexa built in and i've not really used
siri all that much but I'm a big Alexa
fun I'm trying to make sure everything
in my house can be controlled by Alexa
most of the time it doesn't work so we
ended up taking a lot longer it would to
use the normal controller my wife's in
the front row and he's no doubt nodding
her head but Alexa you know it does work
and wait doesn't work he has a really
good diagnostic just
why it doesn't work I was quite sudden
when I tried serious it's not the same I
use an app called todoist todoist but to
make Siri understand that you have to
collect our dearest and this is such a
known thing it's actually in the FAQ on
the Siderius website about my kind of
point here is good quality machine
learning is a competitive advantage my
friend who is an apple nerd he's gonna
go and spend a whole bunch of money with
son offs and get into the Amazon Alexa
space because his use cases
voice recognition he wants to be able to
use his voice to control his new house
and obviously Amazon as we know have
invested a ton of time that sort of
money and a ton of engineering resource
a ton of expertise in getting that
problem solved just right they've done a
really good job but I think we need to
think further than that yes it's great
to say that machine learning is a
competitive advantage but it's also
becoming competitive necessity I'm sure
you've all heard the term
democratization of AI democratization of
ml I think it's a complete misuse of the
word democratization but in essence it's
saying everybody in this room and
everybody in the world at large has
access to all the building blocks all
the algorithms all the tools or the
compute needed to do good quality of
machine learning the investment you need
to make now to do an ml solution is tiny
and this could be something as simple as
hey I can download tensorflow online I
don't pay for that I get a really high
quality your network toolkit or it can
be hey I could go to Google Cloud I can
go to AWS and I can buy a bunch of
compute for a couple of hours a couple
of days train some models great or if
you really want to go far into it you
can pay amazon $4 send them 1000 sound
files and they will run them through the
Alexa engine so there's no there's no
barrier to being able to get access to
the raw materials needed to do good
quality machine learning and because of
this I think it's fair to say that
machine learning is what's next for
software
you know we've spent a ton of time
getting into micro-services in
containers and devops and all these cool
things that discuss like how to build
software better how to deliver that
software better but none of those
technologies really focus on the what
that we're building they're solutions
that we're delivering yes they talk
about how the shape if you will but not
not what it is machine learning is
different
it focuses on changing our mindset and
giving us new tools to build solutions
we couldn't even imagine my favorite one
at the moment is neural style transfer
if you've not seen this you have like an
image maybe it's supposed to graph of
you and maybe you've got a photograph of
a mountain and you can transfer the
style from the mountain image onto your
photograph and make it look like you've
got this nice sunset on your head
incredible which I can't even conceive
how I would write an algorithm like that
without machine learning and this is
probably the point I want to highlight
the most and it's something to permeate
the entire presentation and I will say
this is the most pretentious slide in
the depth it's like I'm trying to be
some kind of thought leader but I'm not
as an important idea here when we write
software today we write the algorithm we
write the series of steps that you need
to follow to solve a problem maybe that
is the series of steps to crop an image
and put some text on it and make a meal
you know we write that those steps with
machine learning and with AI
it's not like that we write the
algorithm to finally algorithm we
describe how to find out how to solve
the problem so we're one step removed
from the actual details of one step
removed from the actual set of steps
from the actual algorithm that does what
we're trying to do and that level of
indirection that how of the how ends up
permeating everything you do in a
project and I want to touch on that
quite a bit as we as we go through this
one of the frustrating things being in
the ml space is the number of people who
just seem to discount it out of hand as
the latest hype
and I used I hear the word magic used a
lot this assumption that there's like
some magic and it doesn't really work
and we're best off just sticking to
traditional software engineering
practices and what I often hear people
say is oh yeah I'll just get a ton of
data and throw it and your own Network
and a problem gets solved and that
perception I think is dangerous because
it's not really how machine learning
works and it certainly is a misleads
people into believing that there's some
kind of special source that only works
in certain cases the reality is quite
far from that I like to say this good
models don't happen by accident the
reality is having done this for a fair
few years now building a machine
learning solution building a good
machine learning model is just as much
software engineering practice if not
more actually than traditional software
engineering you still have to iterate
towards a solution you still have to
have good testing practices good version
control practices you still have to have
good data practices everything you do as
a software engineer today you need to do
just as much if not more to make machine
learning work it isn't a case of take
data taking your network smash them
together and get a solution it really
does require good quality engineering so
if we if we want to build a good
solution if we want to engineer a good
solution how do we do that and I think
one of the first things we all need to
do is avoid making the mistakes of the
past we all I'm sure know what DevOps is
if you don't know what DevOps is is
probably only plenty of talks about that
at the conference but in essence it's
this idea that keeping the people who
build software separated from the people
who deploy that software and support
that software is a bad idea those are
not two separate things they're one part
of the same whole they're one part of
delivering value to end-users it's it's
silly to assume that there's a world in
which one set people can build the
software throw it over the wall and
notice that people support it it doesn't
work that way
so we've worked
that munging that together creating this
kind of code practice of DevOps of build
tests deploy feedback and iterate is the
best way to build software and in
tomorrow's Kino law was going to talk a
little bit about more about how security
fits into this world you know in the
recent times you've all seen the
increase in crazy security exploits that
seem to be occurring ever faster and one
of the the logical steps you might take
is to think well maybe it makes sense
for people who are building the software
and supporting the software have more
security expertise have more security
support at the time they're doing it we
are very much in danger of making the
same mistake we've made in the past and
assuming that well I'm gonna have a team
over here who's building the software
they're doing the DevOps stuff for this
piece of software but the actual
algorithm that we use to deliver value
is some way over here and data science
team and those two are not going to meet
at all they're not look that's not going
to happen at all and of course this has
all the problems from the past in fact
when I first joined skipjack this was
the first thing I encountered I was it
was day one and I remember very vividly
that the team who were working on the
machine learning model it was not the
team who were actually wrapping that
model up in software and delivering it
to our users but moreover the team who
were building the model had no domain
experts in there and we were building
performance optimization software and
the team building the model didn't
understand performance optimization so
obviously that was already a recipe for
disaster
really simple move just co-locate those
people together get them pulling in the
same direction and all of a sudden a
whole buncha problems we had just
disappeared
there was no longer this incredibly long
and arduous feedback cycle from here's a
model let's try it in production with
real data get some results and feedback
but also we were able to figure out and
I'll switch on this a little bit later
there was quite a lot of bias in our
model we were using the wrong metrics
and that only became apparent when we
got everybody working in the same room
on the same problem at the
same time and I think babe Reeve said
he'd bet Babe Ruth Mabry Beirut said it
best the way a team plays as the whole
determines its success a bunch of
individuals all pulling in different
directions is never going to be as
strong as a team with a singular focus
they all have to play together to be
successful when you start thinking of
this though the first issue you'll come
across is this tension between
generalization and specialization and
I've seen this more starkly when trying
to build machine learning teams I'm sure
we've all heard that to do machine
learning you have to have a PhD and then
they learn that's not really true but it
does help to have people who've got deep
theoretical expertise around when you're
trying to build deep machine learning
models so you definitely want
specialists and if you're doing
something some domain problem you want a
domain specialist and we wanted somebody
who was a performance specialist and you
probably want somebody who's the user
experience specialist and probably
somebody who you know really understands
deployment and testing so you do want
specialists but somehow you want
generalization is what you want all that
to mesh together in a way that creates a
really side solution and I've seen I've
seen various different approaches to
this one is to just assume that
everybody can learn everything and that
may be possible for simpler software
solutions if you're building a very
simple website or basically a chord
application it may be possible for
everyone to learn JavaScript and
everyone to learn Java and everyone to
learn docker but it's not possible for
everyone to understand all those things
and all of the machine learning stuff at
the same time so instead I like to think
about it this way a successful team a
successful project has individuals who
specialize and then the teams of those
individuals were to generalize they were
to bring all those different strands of
expertise together and create a general
solution a solution that's fit for human
consumption because at the end of day
that's opportunity we're not building a
machine learning model for the sake of
it we're trying to deliver actual human
value voice recognition self-driving
cars mural style transversal
that people care about using all the
different skills we have in our teams
now of course if someone's going to
specialize or if you're going to work
within your team to integrate some of
those specializations into a Java
solution a c-sharp solution a a python
solution there's lots of skills to be
gained you have to upskill now no but it
would be in this room if they were
afraid of learning new things everyone's
here to learn something I'm sure or
maybe just to have a few days off work I
don't know or maybe both but we're all
here to learn and the nice thing about
machine learning is there's loads to
learn but the other nice thing is you
can be really effective really early you
don't have to learn everything you'll
have to be come you have to get a PhD to
be effective it's one of the most
rewarding aspects actually of trying to
get into machine learning is how fast
you can be productive that's not to say
though that you can't get it wrong
because when I first tried to learn
machine learning and become somebody who
could you know build machine learning
solutions
I made an absolute hash of it I got so
disheartened I gave up and it wasn't for
another three months and so I built up
the courage again to revisit the problem
and think you know maybe there's a
better way I can't be the only person
who can't can't learn this stuff I need
certainty to figure it out so I'm
putting this up here as a kind of
summary of the things that you might
need to learn but also to say you don't
need to learn ice at once
this is maybe where you're heading this
is the journey this is the destination
but the journey is completely different
you can learn little bits less as you as
you move through as you build a perfe
Milley arity and eventually at the end
comes somebody who's an expert what I
also want to dive into though is what's
the most important thing to learn some
people will say go learn the theory in
fact I was just browsing Twitter
yesterday trying to see what the latest
sentiment is about machine learning and
there's lots of use of the word magic
but also there seems to be a real
sentiment if you don't have deep
theoretical knowledge then you can't
possibly get involving machine learning
which is crazy to me it's kind of like
saying if you don't understand the
precise details of how a CPU is made you
can't be a job developer
I'll get you it's nonsense yes the
theory is helpful yes the theory is
important but you don't need to
understand it a very big level to be
productive what about practice what
about practical skills well of course
they're super is Boston there's another
practical skill would you ever to build
anything if you can't code in Python and
you can't use numpy and you can't use
tensorflow you're never going to be
productive but what order should you
learn them in what what things matter
Doug answer but then this last column
intuition typically the people would
leave this out but what I found and
where my mistake was learning the
intuition and actually learning it going
out specifically with this idea in mind
that you would learn all the intuition
behind machine learning is what helps
the most
it's what helps you stitch together
these kind of disparate ideas about your
domain knowledge your software knowledge
your users problems and how you might
solve that with machine learning model
it's the intuition that matters the most
a desperately desperately wanted this to
be a path I wanted to be able to have a
slide this a ballooning path learn this
theory learn this intuition in this
practice or something like that but
doesn't really work that way instead
you're constantly iterating towards
deeper and deeper knowledge I like to
imagine it I got stuck on a plain
obvious because of the snow last week I
was hovering around Heathrow 37,000 feet
8,000 feet 12,000 feet you know you've
had a circling around being an expert
the runway and eventually you get there
but as you circle you're getting you're
getting value you're learning more and
more about the problem space and as I
say you can be productive very very
really I want to dive into this idea of
intuition a little bit more I can't I
can't understate the importance of it my
big mistake when I started out was I
went straight for the theory I got all
the textbooks that everyone gets and
just start reading them by Rick through
the exercises but I never really
understood from those textbooks that why
the essence of it so when I started
again I I set out specifically to try
just to figure out like what is it
Network trying to do is this whole idea
that's really mulling the human brain
and accurate model I can think about or
is there a better model what am I trying
to be when I'm doing classification what
am I trying to be what I'm doing
regression just trying to understand
like really what those things mean and
it's a great line fine quote where he
says intuition does not come to it in
prepared mind and to me this means you
have to be open to intuition you have to
go out and seek it it's not just like a
flash of inspiration it's something you
actively learn and I encourage everybody
here if you're going to try and learn
machine learning and try to learn
artificial intelligence that you you
start to build those intuitions but of
course at some point comes learning the
practice and everybody in this room
already has a head start when learning
the practices of machine learning of a
sudden who has never been a programmer
before because much of what you do when
you're building a machine learning model
is write code test that code rewrite it
retest it rewrites it retest it again
and again and again and again
in fact you will probably iterate more
on the same 200 lines of code
when building a model than you ever
would do when building a normal piece of
software every Java or whatever it's a
very small amount of code you spend an
immense amount of time on and I want to
give you a little bit of insight into
how you might take this learning journey
what work for me and what you're going
to see the first question the most
important question is do you learn R or
do you learn Python and now if anyone's
seen any of my presentations on data
science in the past I'm a huge R snob I
learned our first that because of that
I've got this unnatural attachment to it
but the reality is if you're reading
papers in the space you're trying to
hire people in the space if you're
looking at most of the learning
resources in the space Python is the
language of choice it's rare to find
online tutorials and lectures in our
most of them are in Python that said
there's no harm in learning both you can
definitely find different tutorials in
the our space on your own the pie
and space if you're starting Python make
sense if you're setting up a team in
particular Python makes sense now I'm
obviously hiring people in this space
very very rarely did you come across
somebody who's got our experience it's
much more common sees along with Python
experience and obviously as Java
developers as PHP developers as c-sharp
developers Python is much more familiar
to our mental model than Aris R is a
different beast altogether
so Python is the way the next probably
going to face when you come to do some
kind of deep in your networks or
something in the eye space is which
framework do you use I've only got four
logos on here if you're a JavaScript
developer you gonna be very familiar in
this space because there are hundreds of
these things and there's like a new one
every day now of course tensorflow is
the popular one it's the react of the
deep learning space and the natural
inclination I think for everyone would
be to go to tensorflow well that's what
Google did so it's got to be tensorflow
at some point you will learn tensorflow
at some point you will build a solution
either with tensorflow
or with some framework that is backed by
ten support but when you're starting the
absolute best framework to start with is
bhai torch for a very very simple reason
when you're debugging it when you're
running through the code and stepping
through it it works exactly like code
you write today you can step through it
with the debugger you can use print line
you can apply all of your normal
debugging practices that is not true of
carrots that is not true attempt to flow
that's not true of MX net at all pi
torch is a completely different beast
and it works in a much more familiar
mental model that we would all be used
to us as developers now I put the theory
last not because I think it's the least
important even though I actually do
think it's at least important but
because I think it's the thing you
should attack last you will find
learning the theory after doing some
practice after laying some intuition
much easier because some of the
textbooks and some of 30 torts are just
impenetrable anybody
do computer science or maths or
statistics or anything like that at
school and you read the textbook and
then there's a faithful sentence and it
follows that and you've gone from simple
example simple example to example then
takes you like 15 hours to unpack in one
sentence and that's very much the
machine learning literature completely
so you need to I think have all that
intuitive knowledge have all that
practical knowledge before you start but
what I did find valuable about the
theory is it helped me think about the
world in a completely different way I
was once told that learning Lisp would
make me a better programmer even if I
never use Lisp this seems to be the
pervading Lisp myth I've never really
meshed to actually get any practical
experience with Lisp but I did learn
Haskell when I learn Haskell this
happened to me I had this sort of like
moment have seen The Matrix and
immediately I could I could write better
Java code for some reason that was
inexplicable but it was just a different
mental model it was different
connections in my brain and this the
only other time that's happened to me in
my entire life is when I really got deep
into the machine learning literature and
tried to learn some of the theory but it
wasn't the neural network theory it
wasn't all the deep learning theory what
actually had the biggest impact on me
was really getting us or them something
of Statistics because it's developers we
work in a very deterministic world
everything's very clear-cut and laid out
or at least we like to pretend that it
is learning statistics and learning
probability and really suffer to think
in those terms really changed the way I
think about the world now the hardest
the the absolute hardest part of
learning machine learning and AI is
finding the right resources this reminds
me a little bit of what it was like
trying to learn Java in the old days
anyone remember those sums learn Java in
24 hours books yeah how is that ever
gonna be the case it's nothing like that
exists anymore it's like there's no
learn yourself deep neural networks in
24 hours but there are still a great
many bad quality learning resources out
there
and lucky for you I've spent money and
all these things and wasted in euro
amounts of hours on all these things and
my sir Whittle it down to ones that work
if you only buy one book if you only
read one book on data science and
machine learning it should be this one
by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel short doing
data science there's no other book I've
read that has that perfect mix of theory
practice and intuition it's very clear
that this is from people who are in the
trenches building real solutions yes
they understand the theory they also in
asunder' practice but they also
understand like intuitively what they're
doing I just waited a long long long
long time for a really good tensorflow
book a really good kind of like deep
learning hands-on practical book I
recently got this one hands on machine
learning with scikit-learn intensive
flow can't recommend it enough it's one
of those books that just flows you know
when you're reading in step two step two
step you don't wanna put it down it's a
really really good book suddenly I
haven't much to find a good book on pi
torch yet what I have found is that all
the examples in this book port really
easily into pi torch and when you're
trying to expand upon them when you're
trying to you know build your models
that's a really good step forward
traditionally I've always been a bit of
a book learner I really just didn't like
watching lectures online just seemed a
bit too much of a time waste but I bit
the bullet and got into data science
through this course on Coursera data
science specialization its opening hour
which is what kind of sparked my look
through it Brian and what's your work at
Johns Hopkins it's got the real biology
biotech sends to it great datasets great
practical experience definitely
worthwhile doing without fail without a
doubt though that my favorite is the
deep learning specialization from Andrew
Inc so this is I don't know how to
describe it other than to say once you
start you will not stop it's really hard
to to say yeah I'll just stick to doing
one course at a time in one week rather
than jumping your head four weeks five
weeks six weeks he's a great teacher
there's some great datasets it's great
practical experience and really quickly
you're building things you just got
house how is it even possible anything
like week four you build a neural style
transversus
it's amazing if you're trying to dive
into the theory these have got some
theory we should try and dive deeper
then you absolutely cannot go wrong with
Gilbert strung MIT linear algebra course
if you haven't already watched this Wow
Gilbert Strang is amazing lecturer if
you don't well linear algebra you will
do after this somehow you might just to
make it interesting and exciting and
then Jim Fowler calculus there's a bit
more calculus in deep learning they're
noticing most programming definitely
worth doing Jim is this kind of hyper
active super enthusiastic human being
I've never met anyone that enthusiastic
so sometimes I just watch the video I
think of it down a bit of chain rule now
and again it's great that those four
those four courses those four series of
lectures will absolutely be enough to
get you started but where machine
learning really excels as a learning
journey where it's one of those you just
don't get this with with normal stuff
for engineering is in the availability
of problems and data sets there's just a
massive library of great data sets and
problems to solve in the world and
they're all collected by and large on
cargo does anyone use Kaggle I like 2%
Wow try try coggle so essentially people
are just putting challenges online hey
here's a data set here's a problem about
to solve try it out and you can try them
out fun or you can try them out in 20
min ten thousand dollars which is always
good but essentially you're getting real
problems and real data to try and learn
machine learning this is much better
than continually using the same data set
over and over again continually trying
to create fake data sets and if you're
early in your journey you don't have
enough data to actually do something
meaningful this is the place to go I'd
say that if you if you if you follow
those courses if you read those books if
you do some cargo you can actually be
pretty productive I was building models
for work not long after doing that ones
that ones are actually worked I really
strongly
percent disagree with the comments of
people saying you have to know the
theory it's too dangerous to build a
model if you don't know the theory
because that assumes the building a
model isn't just software engineering
practices you're still building a model
you're still testing it in yourself you
know is it fit for purpose you're so
iterating on it all the things you do
when you're building your algorithms
yourself you still do so those kind of
mechanistic bits are easier I think then
what happens when you get deep into it
when you start dealing with the nuances
of the model and I want to talk about
two particular things when you really
start putting miles out in the wild and
when you really start seeing them be
used the two problems you're going to
face are not technical ones really
they're more like sociological problems
a bias an explained ability transparency
bias is everywhere and the first place
you'll see it and almost certainly the
first place you'll encounter is human
bias the bias that you introduce the
bias that your teams introduced so
you'll remember early on I said when I
started a skipjack we had a data science
team and we had a software engineering
team and that was leading to bad
solutions but one of the things it led
to was the complete bias in the results
and has anyone ever heard of good hearts
law we've probably all seen it when the
measure becomes a target it ceases to be
a good measure it's for this reason that
we don't target software developers on
the number of lines of code written
otherwise every valid whitespace break
would be a new line machine learning is
really susceptible to abuse of
measurements when they become targets if
you're trying to regress some problem or
classify some problem or you're trying
to use a in our case an optimization
problem you're you're measuring
something you're you have some kind of
target in mind and in our case it was
performance improvement we wanted things
to go faster and in that little phrase
performance improvement is the danger
what do you mean by performance
improvement we had contracts with
customers where we were promising
performance of lift and they were
promising money
so of course it becomes really key that
you get the best performance uplift and
the CEO at the time we're saying
performance uplift in this he was saying
this the stopper engineers they're going
okay cool performance uplift and they
were saying that to the data scientist
and they were going okay cool
performance uplift don't really know
that means what it is a target for us so
they found that algorithm that basically
calculated the maximum improvement
between any two measured points of the
system before the system after it could
be how fast was the system when there
was one user on it beforehand and how
fast was it when those 100 users
afterwards it could be anything
no real-world applicability for this
measurements whatsoever it was just the
biggest measurable distance in our data
set and of course this introduced huge
amount of bias and when you roll this up
into the real world you didn't see those
improvements because they weren't
measuring the real world so as humans as
engineers you've really got to know what
you're doing you've really got to be
like clear and focus that the measure
your optimizing to the measure you're
regressing for the measure you're
classifying around is what you're trying
to achieve
lest you introduce this kind of bias but
thankfully you can you can typically
spot that bias quite easy all it takes
is someone who knows what they're doing
to go hang on doesn't make any sense
bit more pervasive a bit more than
considers is data bias now anybody here
care a little bit about GDP our if
you're not in the EU or trading with the
EU GDP are is the general data
protection regulation whole new set of
laws mostly very welcomed that govern
how organizations deal with public data
with your individuals data and I'm not
going to read all this out but the
essence of article 9 section 1 is it's
now no longer legal or won't be as of
May June legal for organizations like
mine to make decisions based on data
that discriminate against individuals
because of their religious background or
philosophical beliefs or sexuality this
is now prescribing more so obviously
this is somewhat easier if you're
writing the algorithms
yourself if you're if you're writing an
algorithm to make it a Socratic decision
on somebody in your rights in the steps
yourself you can check that you're not
using any religious preference data or
genetic data or biometric day so you can
check that it's definitely work and it's
definitely something we all have to put
some effort into but it's something we
can do with machinery links a little bit
harder step one is to avoid all data
bias by stripping that data out of your
algorithms and you know you may be
feeding in some of this information into
a neural network and it may be alertly
may be figuring out okay well for some
reason I don't know trade union
membership has some relevance on the
outcome that's the data bias but even
that's quite easy to solve even removing
that's quite easy the real danger is
learned bias what happens if we remove
all that data remove all that
potentially discriminatory data but
somehow the bias creeps back in because
the machine learning model learns to be
biased anybody heard of Microsoft ten
yeah that was a shame wasn't it I mean
we laughing but it's not really funny
because it is something that machinery
animals are very susceptible to you can
based on input of data or based on kind
of the tendency of the networks and
based on what's going on in some of
those deep neural networks these models
can be learning to be biased I mean in
this case it learned to be a
horrendously racist in genocide all but
it could be a lot less apparent than
that but not less not any less important
let me give you an example when I when I
tried to get into the credit space I
thought I don't know think about credit
I got to talk to people who know about
credit so I spoke to an old school
credit underwriter just pearls of
knowledge and he was telling me that one
of the things you can do to detect some
of these ethnicity is look at string
strings of consonants and vowels in
their second name so maybe you've
removed the data about ethnicity from
your data set well you're still putting
surname in your data set and maybe and
if you've ever seen like edge detection
and face detection working in your
network you'll see that
patterns can be spotted maybe the neural
network learns hey there's 15 continents
here in this one name that must be I
don't know from Manchester learned by us
is really pervasive and I pressed upon
there's not a great deal of research in
this space there is some but it's not I
don't I don't think this is really gonna
be something we're gonna solve the
research on with new algorithms or
fundamental changes in the next few
years this is where engineering comes in
if you go to the security track probably
going to hear quite a lot about like
adversarial practices insecurity things
like penetration testing and so forth
the same is gonna be happening here
we're gonna win end up having
adversarial techniques to try and detect
by it in algorithms can you find some
way like the people on Twitter who
completely screwed up Teddy can you find
up some way to feed data in to and your
network to a machine learning model to
make him exhibit this bias the only way
I think to spot bias is to actively make
engineering for it and testing for it a
part of your process it's not going to
be as easy as hey the Python code says
there's bias in this model you're gonna
have to engineer towards a solution that
doesn't have bias in it now bias is
really important and I put it first
because I think of all the kind of
sociological issues around machine
learning is probably the most important
one and Tim Kadlec is doing a talk on
data bias and similar bias aspects on
Wednesday so if you're you're more
interested in that you should go and see
that obviously this the AMA afterwards
but a more personal one and frustrating
one for all of us is transparency or as
I like to call it computer sees know so
I went to the Apple store about 12
months ago to buy a new iPhone and the
person they're convinced me hey you
should get on the iPhone upgrade program
I thought this is a great deal new
iPhone every 11 months great
so we through the whole process couldn't
get the credit no you can't have a new
iPhone okay any idea why no no
explanation whatsoever as to why I was
not eligible for the iPhone upgrade
program the computer just simply said no
so now I have to pay for new iPhone
every 11 months like a Neanderthal but
it's fully bliss frustrating we've all
been we've all been victims of this
we've all had a scenario where you've
tried to do something with a computer
and just inexplicably know you can't do
it tried to cancel my TV licence
yesterday no don't know why couldn't do
it this is even more likely in the world
of machine learning simply because you
don't know the steps the algorithm is
taking to explain the decision if you've
written the steps that says why someone
from Manchester can't have an iPhone
upgrade then you'll know it's because
you're from Manchester but if the
machine learning model has learned this
you don't know why that is you've got no
idea so thankfully the future is a
little bit more rosier here there's
always some great research in this space
around explainable networks explainable
algorithms there's a big project of
DARPA but actually we also have again
traditional engineering practices
traditional and organizational practices
that we can use to to work around this
anyone who's ever worked in a regulatory
business or anything that's kind of got
like a regulatory constrain will know
the idea of compensating controls this
is where your system can't do something
so you have to put like a human element
in the way are some more the backup
system in the way and all I would have
needed from Apple whistles to say well
we don't know why let's have a human
look at it and this is I think just
enough to say that whatever solution
you're building it isn't magic it might
solve the 80% case the 90% case the 95%
case but at some point it's going to do
something that you're not quite clear
about and someone's going to have to get
involved I don't have a boy thing from
Google like Google Enterprise or even
like that and you've realised it's just
impossible to get support from them
don't let your organisation get into
that space be ready to explain or at
least override why your models are doing
what they're doing
I just want to summarize really quickly
so I'm getting a stop sign if you
already ignoring software you were
ignoring machine learning if you were
ignoring AI and thinking hey this
just some kind of overhyped magic don't
do that you look around you can already
see there are some great solutions in
this space there more solutions coming
all the time
and at some point it's going to become a
competitive necessity to you and your
organization to really understand how to
deploy ml in your space but don't be
disheartened because most of what you do
machine learning is mostly software
engineering there's only about five to
at a time do we really do any fancy
maths or anything that work it's mostly
just oh let's just try this in a model
and test it and roll it out and iterate
on it exactly the same as we've done
everything else you've ever built
probably the most important thing I want
to say on two most important things I
want to say it don't make the mistake of
old don't try and have a data science
team the software team co-locate those
things together make sure that everybody
has an understanding of what lb else is
doing and I know it's trend to say it
but I see in my day job so I'm not
saying it for trendy reasons now more
than ever
ethics does matter you're really one
step removed from any kind of ethical
violation or ethical issues so you have
to actively integrate testing for
checking for ethical violations in your
in your software my final point is why
I'm heading this talk there's a lot to
learn but it's a great month for and
it's all very very valuable and even if
right now you're not using ml or AI at
work you will find these technique to
these technologies these theories so
valuable and so immensely stimulating I
just recommend get diving into it thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
