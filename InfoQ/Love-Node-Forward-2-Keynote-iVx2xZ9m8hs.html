I'm sequester EP on twitter if you want
to write nice things about me if you
want to write not nice things about me
that's totally not me um I'm I'm a
designer and an artist i like to make
work with tech and about tech and i was
really excited when they have asked me
to give the keynote actually because um
i like to talk about big topics like I
totally like start doing presentations
or like this I'm like it's about node
and then I just talk about art and
society and all those important things
but uh since it's a keynote that's what
I'm supposed to be doing today so I'm
really excited about that um so
basically I'm talking about love and
node and how the two of them are sort of
wrapped up in like how and why we engage
with hardware and what we've sort of
agreed to call the Internet of Things
and we can use them to make prototypes
of like lovable relatable objects as I
said before I say things like node and
then I just talked to you about feelings
and art but I was totally going to do
something different this time and really
talk about tech and sort of more
detailed work and then Dave asked me to
come do this so I'll be talking about
those in my talk which is in the Garden
Room which doesn't actually look like
that it's the room that you're in but at
32 kaka I'm be talking a little bit more
about the work that I've made that I'll
show you some examples of and I'll have
little like prototype robots we can play
with and it'll be really fun so that's
coming up but for now Big Ideas art so
when I was thinking about what I wanted
to talk about i came across this really
great feature on digital art in seattle
which you should all totally read later
i have a big web page with links to
everything i'm talking about so you
don't have to try to remember anything
at all um and so it was a really great
talk and it had these two really apt
quotes that I felt summed up my whole
interest in doing internet art in
digital art at all the first one right
is that if researchers figure out what
technology can do artists reveal how and
ask what it's for and I think that's a
really big sort of secondary part of
what we're doing right and I say art and
basically art gets recognized as art by
people making things and saying as many
times as they have
too right I made this and it matters and
that's what makes it art and the awesome
thing is that we all have this power to
make something and stand up and say I
made this and it matters and to keep
saying it until people start listening
and really recognizing that and I think
it's a really important choice to make
in what we make because you know we
really have the opportunity to determine
which of two possible futures we're
going to be focusing our energies
towards these are two gifts that I
always like to show people but I think
it makes a really big difference you
know we're sort of looking for the
difference between that's killbot in
beach pot right for some reason my
slides aren't the gifts aren't playing
so you have to imagine him dancing it's
very excellent um let's say he's gonna
dance now there you go um right and so
if we make good choices I think we can
really start working towards a world of
beach BOTS and not killbots um and one
of the artists who was profiled in that
piece I talked to you about Robert to me
um he focuses on sort of the
imperfections in systems and his he
explains it you know what's the messy
humanity left over on the edges what
does Google know about me and what will
it never know what can be what cannot be
captured by these systems and I think
what can't be captured there's sort of
the most important things that we choose
to express and one of those things that
I think it's so hard to express and so
were they to investigate is our
relationship with objects how we can
relate to them as buddies and friends
how we can love them and be loved in
return and by doing this I hope we might
also be able to sort of help allay this
very site guys set of anxieties there
have been a ton of articles about right
the anxieties about the relationships
that were going to have with machines in
the coming decade and so I sort of
became interested in this whole question
space at the school for poetic
computation and it's a program in New
York it's focused 10 weeks focused on
the intersection of art and tech and
students spend you know their time
creating new works and considering the
effects of the pieces that they're
making one of the founders calls art the
RNG lab for Humanity and that's really
sort of like enlivening spirit of the
place and as you can imagine in such a
place we spend a lot of time talking
about big questions things like utopia
it's favorite little disk sister
dystopia and particularly the dystopia
that is the Internet of Things and you
know the argument here goes something
like if as of sep tember 2014 there is
1.4 billion in venture capital funding
being directed just it wearables and
biosensing if by 2018 there's going to
be 60 million fitness trackers in use
worldwide if the future of connected
objects basically looks like a long list
of way to spy on ourselves our homes our
children you know are we in fact giving
away all of our privacy willingly unless
o in a headlong rush into this dystopia
where governments and corporations
attempt to control our very selves you
know and it's not just social theorist
and foofy artists who are asking these
questions um a recent report from Pew
Research which canvassed experts in
computing and machine intelligence you
know highlighted a number of the same
things you know the Internet of Things
and wearable computing are going to
progress significantly in the next ten
years the realities of the Stata
drenched world raised substantial
concerns about privacy and people's
abilities to change their own lives you
know the level of profiling and
targeting will grow and amplify social
economic and political struggles and
somewhat of a corollary right
individuals and organizations responses
to the Internet of Things will recast
the relationships people have with each
other and groups of all kinds and so if
one in six are inevitable if we're
rushing headlong towards this and it's
going to change the way that we relate
what can we do about number two to not
just sort of reify what's going on right
now and I have a theory about this
because of course I do um my theory is
that the problem in this realm is that
our abilities have almost come to out
stretch our imaginations you know we can
create sensors and we can connect them
to the internet and to each other and
then we can do what right or like oh my
god I can do all this stuff but what am
i doing it for and I sometimes suspect
that we take what can be monitored
because that's what we can see so what
if we could start imagining something
different and fortunately at SF peace
I was introduced to two other sources of
ideas a real woman and a fictional in a
fictional one Sarah Hendron and halvah
so Sarah hendren is an artist who's
amazing and does a lot of work on
assistive technologies and on
prosthetics and part of her work and
part of what she presented to us at SF
PC was about questioning what assistive
technology actually means I mean all
tech is assistive my glasses are
assistive our phones are assistive we
make objects to satisfy desires and we
make objects that allow people to affect
and be affected by the world as they
want that's what we make and that's what
we do and I wondered you know about
creating assistive technology for these
objects alone what if we could let them
speak for themselves and so an
mccaffrey's ship who sang which is where
helva comes from sort of has one type of
answer it's a series of stories that
features a human who is turned into the
brain for a spaceship sometimes in the
future people born with physical
disabilities are bound up in two
titanium shells physically augmented and
then taught to be a sort of machine
human hybrid with reduced emotions but
still human flexibility and subtlety and
I mean that is definitely a little bit
dystopic in and of itself binding people
into these titanium shells and the
stories tell about her journeys through
the universe and most important and most
interesting to me her relationships with
the various humans who serve as her
partners on the ship and it made me sort
of wonder you know what if the most
pertinent image is of an intelligent
object that's also almost human what if
something like this was our goal you
know what if objects could be loyal that
might help with the cluster that's
current security practice right like
maybe it's less about passwords and more
about asking about creating loyalty what
if we could understand the life cycles
of things that we own you know what if
the internet of things could be more
than a monitoring network and be an
assistive technology for those objects
what if we investigated how we relate to
them could this in its own way counter
some of the fears and anxieties by
letting us imagine something better
something better that we are capable of
making and fortunately I was reading
this other
super intelligence by Nick Bostrom and
he basically argues that unless we teach
machine intelligence to have values
there's going to be eventual doomsday AI
take over so you know by asking these
questions we might actually be saving
the world and so with that big thing
here's my little answer to saving the
world relatable so when I say relatable
is what I'm talking about are objects
that right let us explore these
relationships with machines or allow
objects to speak and a secondary
correlation to that is I would define
them as objects that move away from
using information to either report on
our activities or to motivate us to
change our behaviors which is most of
what we have right now um so moving away
from information that should be acted on
can be really hard to conceive of even
when you start planning it out so take
the idea of the canonical connected milk
carton right right now the idea is your
fridge is going to tell you when it's
empty or too old and the fridge would
order the milk carton might replenish
itself you know and this is like very
much what people seem to be working
towards but what if instead of making it
about the data we asked our milk carton
to tell us about the cows to tell us
about where it came from to tell us its
story and turn it into a means of
communication that's a really fertile
field to start looking in and yet at the
same time it's so easy right to turn
that into oh well then we'll tell them
if the cows are happy cows are sad cows
and make sure people are only buying
milk from like good happy cows and so
instantly you're trying to turn it into
people's behavior um but I think it's
really worth it to keep it pure and
start finding out what happens and we
talked about the objects themselves and
some work about objects speaking for
themselves have already been done this
is blendy from 2004 which is a blender
that is operated if you speak to the
blenders the blender expects to be
spoken to and I have no sound so now you
can't hear her growling oh there you go
so you know these are the kinds of
things we do and we start asking what
objects might want for months um and
that's super awesome but now we're going
to talk about worry again and anxiety
terrible sad things um when we look at
all these anxiety driven articles I
start to wonder if we're engaging in
this doomsday thinking as a reflex
rather than as a response and french
philosopher bruno latour recently
suggested that the myth of Frankenstein
has led us all astray in the way that we
deal with technological change um his
sin was not his hubris to create life
but rather his fright that led him to
abandon rather than care for his
creation was where you know Frankenstein
failed so with we create relatable zyme
hoping we can create a situation where
instead of running away from our
monsters we can love them we can feel
responsible for them and perhaps even
address the deep anxieties that we might
be provoking so the anxieties that I
like to talk about um can be categorized
into three big groups the first one was
what we'd call sort of technophobia or
lack of understanding for a lot of
people the issue of relying on technical
structures they don't understand is a
really deep concern and you wind up with
articles like where this image is from
we're Ian bogos just calling you know
tech a new theology where algorithms are
embedded everywhere and
indistinguishable from God and this very
much comes out of things feeling
unapproachable unapprehended because
neuroscience is shown right that similar
brain regions are involved we think
about the behavior of humans and sort of
non-human entities that we've
anthropomorphize which is to say that by
encouraging people to see machines is
human-like is something we can converse
with like blendy we might actually be
encouraging them to start trying to
understand and think about those objects
in a familiar way and this sounds
awesome but there's always criticism and
in this case the criticism of the
approach comes from people like sherry
turkle who has actually been researching
AI and human-computer interaction since
the 70s and she was originally a robo
optimist I would call her but she's come
to object to some of the promises of
anthropomorphism outlining what I
classifies the second anxiety
and that's the worry of sort of
undeliverable promises of this
illusionistic humanity you know she says
soon we'll be looking for robot looking
at robots designed to care for children
and the elderly to serve as companions
for all types of people but she worries
that robots who want to be buddies are
sort of implicitly promising an
emotional connection they can never
deliver and she illustrates this with a
story from the MIT Media Lab they're
working on robots and they had children
interacting with these robots as part of
a study and the robot malfunctioned and
the child that was working with the
robot at the time was convinced that the
robot like hated this child right she
like wouldn't talk to anyone anymore and
just went and ate snacks and was pouting
because she's like well the robot works
for everyone else and not me so it
doesn't like me and that's somewhat of
the dark side of a really
straightforward anthropomorphism um
where you know we're give people too
much illusion and it doesn't work the
way that we hoped however this sort of
contrasts with other movements we're
seeing now with companies like lively
and glow where they're sort of using
promises of connecting you to other
people almost as a way to smooth over
some of the creepy data mining they're
doing you know lively basically
convinces your grandparents to let your
parents spy on them and it does this by
sending by like curating these nice
little packages of like pictures and
notes from their grandchildren's and
make it seem like really great you
totally want to use this because your
grandchildren will write you letters but
you know it's sort of using this sense
of loneliness to convince people to give
you their data and to some extent I then
wonder are relatable robots worse than
letting people's loneliness and fear
fester until they accept being
surveilled and that's sort of the third
ultimate anxiety it flowed in these
discussions right and that is sort of
the fear of corporate over each or
willingly delivering ourselves into
wickedness I think is the way somebody
put it and in AI weiwei is living in our
future the great article by hansda sort
does Vaart i think hes dutch catalogues
how quickly products move from
surveillance into control you know of
our pets of our children there's this
app apparently that if you ignore your
parents phone calls they can lock your
phone
lead to me until you call him back and
you know because we don't want kids to
have all the fun we can also surveil
ourselves this awesome wristband you can
set it up to shock you when you're doing
things you don't like you know but
obviously in all of these products were
like using data as a proxy method for
relating to ourselves our homes our
babies are worlds and so again why not
focus on trying to understand these
relationships themselves why not work on
prototypes that maybe have liveliness
but less humaneness and maybe we can let
objects speak like objects and in doing
so create the imaginative course we need
we could make the world is described by
the cyber feminists of the 90s where the
question is not one of dominance and
control or submission and surrender to
machines and instead make it one of
exploring alliances affinities and
co-evolutionary possibilities and that
might sound kind of nuts right we
already know exactly what it's like to
live with like these enchanted objects
that were desperately in love with um
one author Derek Meade in a peon to his
phone right we've all seen the regular
stream of surveys finding that say most
Americans would rather go a day without
coffee or liquor than their phones or
that old standby that some thirty three
percent of Americans would rather have
their phones than sex and you know I'm
not judging i think it is amazing that
we are capable of so much tenderness and
feeling for glass in silicon and
aluminum like that's amazing like humans
are awesome you know and so what
if we started with something basic and
worked up to allowing objects to be as
well spoken as blendy and as well loved
is our phones so i just have a couple
more slides for you guys examples I
really like examples so I've brought a
couple little weirdo robots to show at
my talk um and they're prototypes and I
think it's really important to
underscore thinking in terms of
prototypes because these are objects of
questions and not of answers you know we
don't know what kinds of relationships
are going to be the best or the most
compelling we don't know which ones are
going to benefit us the most so just
testing out little things and seeing
happens i think is really key and really
fun so this is one of the guys I've
brought he's don't touch the friend
bought and his key mode of interaction
is response when you're too far away he
tries to get your attention when you get
too close who freaks out a little bit um
so it's a question of just playing with
response to people um the next is the
neo neglect which is based on a previous
work I did the timeline of neglect which
is a web-based visualization all about
ignoring my books I decided to bring it
into real life and so what it does is it
sort of amplifies the voices of books
that I've bought and then ignored you
close a little copper switch when you
get them and the lights change color and
eventually die off when the book itself
isn't removed from the shelf and there's
also spiny which is an assistive device
for cranky folks um sometimes you go to
work you really don't want anybody to
talk to you but how are they gonna know
right that you're having a grouchy
morning so instead from the web you can
set cranky to let people know how you're
feeling and put it up on the desk and it
can express its own feelings to write in
this case it's driven by a human
clicking on something but you could hook
it up to some other object that wants to
express its feelings and then just
recently I did a piece called deluge
which is sort of hard to take a picture
of so I showed you guys some wires in
case you were wondering what those
looked like and tell you uses a
Bluetooth sensor to see how many people
are around and somewhat similar to
friend bought to respond to being
overwhelmed this was a piece for art
hack day that was in new york last
friday where people did things based on
the concept of deluge so this is my
little jouge buddy anyway so obviously i
think this is like been a sort of
whirlwind tour but like across a really
fun and exciting place and i think we
can come up with so many crazy
interactions and prototypes that are so
much better than mine and i hope all of
you guys like think about things you
might want to work on and if creating
some weird object maybe seems two steps
too far you know one of the things i
will be talking about in my session is
sort of how you can use your current
javascript knowledge to leverage making
sort of little objects like this so if
you don't know what you want to make but
there's always lots of library
is you know there's Johnny Five there's
the tussle libraries there's a lot of
people doing great JavaScript work that
you could even think about contributing
to is you work up your courage to make
you know a weird prototype like I did so
if you guys remember 310 here in the
garden room come see me and we'll talk
about more robots in detail and it'll be
great so thank you guys so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
