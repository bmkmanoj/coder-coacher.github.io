in the grand ballroom with this channel
is I would have expected people to dress
up a bit more nicely but we're geeks so
I guess that didn't work out so today I
was asked to give an inspiring speech
about things and stuff and I think
that's a very good start for a day I
wanted to give something very very
technical but then it's a keynote so you
don't do that so don't expect that from
me but we can talk technical in any way
you want to so I want to talk about how
the web used to be this massive
disrupter to a terrible market and how
it changed over the years and how in the
last few years especially last year here
a lot of people started scaring us into
thinking the web is not there anymore
and it's a new thing that we have to do
right now and we're all gonna lose our
job and be homeless in like two months
because we don't support the newest
coolest iPad so it's like this
children's book that you can buy there
which is called you can't be an
astronaut it's just no realistic this is
really cool to give to your kids like
there you go so back in the days when I
started on the web it was like this we
have acquired connections and we all
have keyboards to surf on and we all had
to keep the mouse up otherwise we would
fall off the keyboard and this is what
the web was about it was just beautiful
and a nice colors and aggregated the
things sideways it was just this
wonderfully cool thing but in reality it
was a really cool thing I worked as a
radio journalist back then and I saw the
Internet is there for everybody to start
publishing and for everybody to be found
worldwide and to communicate with people
worldwide and to me this was a totally
new thing you know before that we had
these like BBS's where you had to know
the telephone number to call to connect
and get data from another server
worldwide and then with the internet we
connected them with modems that sounded
a bit like Skrillex but really wasn't
and it's just the connectivity and you
stood there like this almost looks like
an image just give it another five
minutes and they'll be fine and you had
like connections where you're loaded
something and then you're disconnected
because you paid per minute and then you
went through the cash to find all the
images that you've been downloading
because while you were loading it was
too slow all these really cool things
but it was a geek thing and the main
market basically saw us like that is
what
the Abunda launch party there that
basically these are the geek guys that
do that and it's never gonna catch on
and nobody cares and old-school
programmers like for a mainframe
programmers or like people that use Java
and things like that people who have
beards and suspenders and a real men
told us that the web will never be
anything that's just a toy like you used
to angle bracket stuff that's never
coding nowadays it's a bit different you
know the web is mainstream and we're all
these cool hipsters and we everybody
uses the web for something most of time
horrible things but like you know like
following Justin Bieber on Twitter and
things like that but everybody uses it
and we're seen as these like magical
creatures that can build websites and
everyone nobody knows what we're doing
and the reason why that blossomed so
much in those few years is that it's
built on a principle that anybody can be
on the web just put an HTTP connection
and something that shows HTML doesn't
matter where you are doesn't matter what
your ability is what your language is
what your connectivity is everybody is
invited that was the Olympic Games the
opening and that's when Tim berners-lee
type this in and set like that the web
that he invented or with other people is
for everyone and we keep forgetting that
just how powerful the web is for people
who don't have a voice in mainstream
media who don't know cannot get a school
education but they can go to an internet
cafe and look at Udacity course or look
at a Khan Academy course if they wanted
to they can look at Wikipedia I mean
like I went to uni I went to the library
to do my homework I didn't have
Wikipedia and I know teachers that
actually put wrong things in Wikipedia
articles to see how many students will
actually bring that and mirror in their
essays which is a really cool way of
using the web as well except everybody
on the web is a consumer and the creator
and we keep forgetting that because
we're getting into that that consumption
thing and people got like sign it off oh
I can watch Game of Thrones streaming on
my internet and you're like how is that
better than TV it's just you can start
and stop it that's like a VCR and a
streaming video a streaming TV channel
would allow me the allow the audience to
remix it and to do things with it and to
do
vote on different endings and make him
different and this is what we do in
Mozilla with the web maker project where
we invite kids and journalists and and
and people who are just afraid of
computers and not use the web for
anything to start playing with it and
start creating and seeing how empowered
they feel when they start creating it's
just gorgeous because for a lot of
people it's a totally new job that they
couldn't have had before
so good times were had we had these
browsers that got better and better and
better we had a few browsers that
finally died and we had a few browsers
that actually agreed on everything html5
means first and foremost that all
browsers render HTML the same way and
that was a big big thing we citizen as a
given now but actually that whitespace
and Internet Explorer between li items
means you couldn't style them that was
just a very very annoying thing and you
had to delete like all kind of things in
there and the browser's got better and
better and we're like yes we got it made
we got these cool html5 a api's we could
do something and then change happened I
mean what's the main difference between
Bill Clinton's inauguration and Obama's
inauguration except for the size of the
flag and a call of the president if
everybody has this phone and takes
pictures really blurry ones really bad
ones but everybody wants to take a
picture and put it up online and be like
the first one to put it online because
the 600 other people in that room don't
do the same thing they don't have the
same idea I love it at the committed
concerts and people hold their iPads up
and film the band and you're like yeah
that sound quality is gonna be amazing
I had it the other day at Dropkick
Murphys and I'm like last time you
wouldn't have survived and your iPod
wouldn't have but when it fair enough so
the web came around and the mobile
phones came around the smartphone came
around and all hail the hypno phone
everybody has one everybody needs one
it's a great thing you can talk to your
friends who are on the other side of the
planet so you don't have to talk to
people next to you because they're
smelly and like they did they spit and
stuff you have you brought your friends
who don't need to do actually real
connection with other people but you can
complain online that you don't have any
friends so it's a very on-the-go market
and sometimes to even have connectivity
maybe Evanier what AT&amp;amp;T it started well
this is Steve Jobs the visionary the
really really good man really really
interesting guy and he released flown
today iPhone well he had a few people
helping him but he released a smartphone
and iPhone and the first thing he said
to be really disruptive and reinvent the
phone we have to actually have no SDK
it's the web it's a web-based phone you
have Safari of the power of safari and
html5 in your hand you can build
everything on the web with the phone you
can build great applications that can
talk to the telephone can talk to say to
the map application that's what he said
and then the big backlash came from
developers and internally and why did
that happen well first of all the mobile
web was this mix thing that nobody knew
what's going on there we had this thing
in the middle and we had web developers
on one side and native developers on the
other and both of them wanted to do it
and the native app developer is
different to a web developer on in many
many ways they're actually used to a
different environment as a web developer
I've got no SDK I use VI I use sublime
text I use that and we argue for month
who's got the better text editor and we
don't wait for actually downloading an
SDK for it as well so the mobile space
is a competitive and very closed market
the success of companies is very much
based of how many patents they have and
what they can actually protect from
another like oh you can't touch the
screen of my phone because that's my
right and developers coming from that
environment for them the web seems like
scary like oh but everything is free and
I have to you can look at my code how
can I protect my JavaScript code is a
question I get every single time
put it on memory stick leave it in your
desk fragmentation is the next big
horror oh my god people have different
phones and basically different sizes and
like I have to support all of them if
only we had one government-issued phone
for everybody that has a fixed static
thing and for web developers always like
yeah so this is cool I can write things
for different platforms for
fragmentation is being this horror word
for everybody so shouldn't we cherish
flexibility much more should we say like
hey if everybody cannot afford the
newest iPhone they have an old one why
not give them something for an iPhone 4
I mean these are just people with so
much hardship in their life they only
have an iPhone 4 so we should give them
something and if you think about it
these tablets and and smartphones are
actually very flexible because you see
as soon as you tilt them they get longer
because nothing of an angle could be as
high as the other one as long as as long
as it's longer so every display of those
I guess if you have two phone and you
hold it it just automatically happens
slowly so you don't realize it but so
tilting the phone makes it longer and
this is something to care about your
designs as well so I wondered what the
whole backlash was about why do
developers get so riled up about not
having an SDK and actually bringing the
web on the phone and I did some research
and I found this wonderful website
called the story of stuff which explains
about consumption and how America was 1%
of the world population creates 20% of
the waste and all these kind of
interesting things so it's a great thing
to learn on the web it's international
so it's really nice
and I learned about an old old idea from
Victor libo in the Journal of reading
nineteen of retailing 1955 and actually
what they said and he was one of the
advisors of President Eisenhower back
then as well to make American companies
be successful and make sure that we have
money and jobs for the next few years
our enormous ly productive economy
demands that we make consumption are a
way of life that we convert the buying
and use of goods into rituals that we
seek our spiritual satisfaction our ego
satisfaction in consumption we need
things consumed burned up replaced and
discarded annex ever accelerating rate
and that was in 1955 it's called the
principle of obsolescence and I'm happy
I manage to pronounce that word now as
evil minds think alike there's this
person that a year before even took that
further so the if the built in
obsolescence means that products are
built to break after a year or two so
you buy a new one and you realize that
with every brand out there I remember
when I could kick a car door and there
wasn't a dent
except my foot nowadays you have to
replace everything and the 15 sensors in
there that actually realized you hey
parking sensor was an all kind of things
so Clifford Brook Stevens actually took
that further and you can see there is a
very content and happy person because he
came up with the idea of the plant and
built-in obsolescence so you don't even
need to make things break you just have
to make them look old and look outdated
so you have to instill in the buyer the
desire to own something a little newer a
little better a little sooner than is
necessary and every advertising is about
this everything we see on telly is like
this now has rounded corners like okay
how many people really say like oh I was
at Mobile World Conference and they
showed all these hardware providers went
there and I went to every stand like
what do you have we got a new phone what
does it do
it's bigger okay is it faster - oh yeah
yeah it's faster - what else does it do
it's bigger and nicer and like it's just
no change it's just like got something
in there that actually has to happen so
perceived obsolescence is the next way
of doing that so planned style
obsolescence occurs when marketers
change - styling of products
consumers will purchase products more
frequently the style changes are
designed to make the owners of the old
model feel out-of-date you feel
embarrassed
putting your first generation high phone
having a coffee shop in San Francisco
and this is because of this we've been
trained to think that things have to be
outdated quickly and we gotta get new
new new new new
these shoes are twelve years old Doc
Martens in England now Doc Martens has
been sold to a company somewhere in the
East Doc Martens break within a year now
as well these ones don't yet so I will
be very unhappy when they when they
break but it's just amazing how we got
into that and other people saw that
already as well this was two 50s and
everybody go like oh my god we've got to
do this and then in the 60s some cynical
mind basically said the systematic
attempt of business to make us wasteful
debt written permanently discontented
individuals and to a degree that's right
people really really rack up their
credit card bills to get a new
smartphone that they don't need because
they actually have a good smartphone
already but they want to be the new cool
ones to have the swag and be like
awesome about it so in essence this is
not our struggle this is apples and
Google's struggle and Samsung's struggle
and hardware makers struggle we cannot
compete with that
we cannot go and say like look websites
you can edit it you can change it you
can change the interface of a website it
will be maintainable for five years in
the future no no no no no this thing has
to break tomorrow what can you give me
that makes people buy a new phone
because they want to have the next
version of that game and this happens so
web development and native development
cannot be compared one-to-one we always
do these like html5 showcases where we
show that html5 could be like native
apps and then we make it a crack across
all the browsers and across all the
platforms like we should in html5 and it
turns out not to be as performant and as
good as the native app if you really
want to prove it and it's the same do it
on one platform one browser and one for
configuration but this is not html5 this
is just making a native app in some
environment that should not be native so
fragmentation
Thanks fragmentation two ounces are
given I never knew what browser you use
hopefully Firefox otherwise you have a
bad time I didn't know what connection
you have I don't know what resolution
you have I don't know if you're drunk I
don't know if you can't read English I
don't know if you're sober but you can't
read English I don't know anything about
you and I love that I love to write
defensive code that actually says can
you do this yeah okay do this add
supports was put in Firefox nightly
yesterday so basically you can have
moderniser
in CSS itself and in JavaScript and
that's the kind of stuff we need all of
these things should get something they
should not get the same they should get
something that people can stomach so to
me it's this golden playground it's a
bit like Temple Run you know you got
this street full of gold and there's all
kind of stumbling blocks and stuff and
we actually have to fix these stumbling
blocks it's a bit like the 101 like you
go down to Silicon Valley you see how
many millions of dollars are spent on
different companies and you got all
these potholes at the same time so the
mobile web is there for us to make a
good living with and to make a great
living with but we just try to go for
that big gold gem in the sky all the
time you want to be that thirty million
dollar seventeen year old kid that got
bought by some company because this is
the future and this is the same I don't
want to say a strong word this is the
same have lie that we have with dis
building obsolescence like yes there
will be one guy who's actually starting
to Facebook there will be one guy who
gets 1 billion for his company but this
is not maintainable not all of you can
be that guy and not all of you probably
want to be that guy because they don't
have a free time in their life anymore
and a lot of pressure on them it's like
who here plays an instrument or things
in a band why you can never be as good
and is as successful and fast and rich
as Justin Bieber you don't need to play
your instrument you need a producer you
need a nice dance move you need some
swag and that's about it why do you
bother with this you cannot be Justin
Bieber he's much younger than you is
much faster than you is much better than
you why do you do it because you like it
it's fun to do a musician is a person
that takes thousands of dollars of gear
100 miles away to play $100 gig because
we love it because we want to do things
and we don't want that mainstream media
Kruti that means that like if you do
they just a Bieber thing and you're
successful for half a year you're gonna
be in rehab two years later so let's
play the long game a bit and think about
what we're gonna do in ten years with
that rather than like Oh money money
money make more and more bigger bigger
bigger so we need lateral thinking
so which line of this one is longer the
upper downer are they the same no
they're not
so why did all of you think that this is
the same length because you've seen that
thing before it's the old trick it's an
old trap and it's a clever trap it's
like it's obvious that they should be
different lengths but it actually isn't
so you like hey I've seen that you're
not gonna get me again with this and
this is how we build things right now we
learn hacks in browsers and then we just
internalize them and say like oh the web
will always be at that so I cannot
do that in the future I will just do it
like this for the next 15 years and the
web trust can't do it I'm sorry and
let's think about it let's measure
things don't get too excited about
measuring like there's lots of people
who get like J's perf and these kind of
things which it's just like you can
measure things but you have to measure
them in context but don't fall into
their to clever trap don't see the thing
for the first time and you remember it
it didn't work last time and say it's
not gonna learn again so what do we do
now instead of instead of thinking about
where we can't take the web we build
many many many many awesome solutions we
build so many awesome solutions it's
incredible we've got this like bootstrap
you don't need to learn any HTML just
use bootstrap and start from that if you
want to know a professional grunt ember
backbone jQuery Center how much sm8
compass a step two blah blah blah blah
all these cool things that are coming
out all of these things are great
they're really are good there are tools
for power users that need to actually
make their day-to-day job easier and
they're perfect they're great and we
just make new ones every month that's
the problem with it but we actually just
want to be professional about it so we
tell people these are the things you
have to use otherwise you're not really
you're not really a web developer when I
hear people say you need to know the
command line to be a web developer I'm
like no sorry this is not the thing that
command line is not on the web it's like
you build things that are visual you
build interfaces you build things that
people need we've got many many many
awesome demos like this was going around
a few months ago a few weeks ago a very
very rememberable URL F F F dot CM is
MCM comm which showed all kind of like
plays and html5 canvas demos and stuff
all of the things we've done in flash
four years ago
and we now use an html5 we say like this
is awesome I think what we're having
right now is an overflow of Awesome I'm
getting tired of seeing awsom awsom
awsom awsom what I want to see is like
we have this really terrible content
management system we have a room booking
system here's how we fixed it with HTML
here's how we made people happy across
55 different platforms we don't have to
impress each other we have to impress
the mainstream so stop building tools
for each other and making the P other
tools one thing less than the other one
does they're all open-source fork them
do things with them don't build your own
again so I get excited about people
building things that just been a post
con in South Carolina and all the
developers you meet there are actually
in small companies or freelancers and
you show them something I did a css3
talk and two weeks later you get an
email like well thanks for your talk
here's how I implemented it in my
product and I'm like yes that's this is
exactly what I want to do please build
these things give it out to the main
market don't be excited that everybody
is clever on stage and then be depressed
at you're on stage and you build your
own system so you get on stage that's a
bit of a loop we do at the moment so the
other day I had a guy in my gym in
London asked me like hey you've got a
computer so you know about the internet
and I'm like that's obviously an
interesting fallacy but so he's like oh
I want to get a new job I want to learn
about the internet stuff and people say
it's really good to be a web developer
and it's a really good job to know that
so I found this old piece this old
laptop in my in my house that I cleaned
up and I just put it put Ubuntu on it
and a text editor and an html5 book and
that's what I gave him I didn't tell him
use grunt use ember start with bootstrap
that's how I learned it that's how I got
incredibly excited realizing that if I
put a different color in there it looks
different Wow and we can do that
nowadays the web needs no massive tools
for production for power users tools are
great for starters don't overload them
with things that they can't rely on in
the future all of these things are not
building the browser so they will
actually might they might get outdated
they might get replaced
so don't teach people things that are
just for the next two months
so how do we disrupt how do we change
that whole market how do we get back to
that idea that from the very beginning
we said like software is on the web and
content is on the web and it's
distributed worldwide without having to
send floppy disks and CDs to each other
how do we go back to that well the first
thing is to stop being scared I mean
last year we had a fuse interesting
things on stage here where people said
like well maybe the web is is not there
maybe the web is going away we got to
keep the lights going we got to keep the
lights going I mean who are you as a web
developer has problems paying their
electricity bill I didn't know it was
that high in San Francisco my brother's
a fireman he can't find a job at the
moment or a better job he hates his job
but yeah when he doesn't do his job
people burn we don't do our jobs things
are five pixels off so don't be worried
about the future of the web the web
survive flash the web survive java the
web survive JavaServer faces the web
survived any kind of things out there
because it's a distribution model it's
not technology it's not a certain stack
of technology will the web be the same
in seven years hell no it will not be
the same next month that's the power of
the web it keeps mutating it keeps
getting better you cannot compare it
with systems that are actually this is
version one of the web this is version
two of the web no this is worldwide
changing constantly every second and
that's the cool thing of it so chill out
breathe you're gonna have a job in five
years ten years time easily if you bet
on the web right now will not be the
same job you have to be up on your feet
and learn new things but that's what
makes it interesting I always hated a
job that I got a pamphlet and liked it
this is what you're gonna do in the next
12 years
no change don't worry about it okay on
the web different story new challenges
every single day so I think we should
stop copying a lot of people like oh
there's a native app that everybody uses
right now so let's copy that in html5
let's copy that in our technologies no
it's a different idea first of all you
got the obsolescence thing not every
native app has everything in there in
the beginning because they want to roll
it out if your app has all features at
the beginning you're not gonna have a
time you want to roll out month by month
by month by month so trying to keep up
with that it's not possible so try to
actually see the power of the web and
the benefits of the web of web
technologies over native technologies
and the biggest one is flexibility and
if your app is not flexible you're doing
it wrong the thing should actually tell
the user ok this works this works this
works I have a problem with that so I
don't give you that functionality or
just don't show the functionality don't
promise things that you can't fulfill
and it's an if statement it's not that
hard to do so if you copy then kick ass
Center did this fast book and showed
that the that the whole html5 is that
from face book was actually a misnomer
and actually based on wrong assumption
so they did a good thing there and they
show basically that you can do a fast
app on an iPhone in html5 whose would
have known like like like the ex CEO of
the company wanted it to be so that's
great if you do these kind of things
then we should also stop them from
saying like yeah but it only works in
iOS and it only works in that yeah
that's what we cared about in this
moment so we're fixing it together with
them right now and flexbox is now in
Firefox
partly because Center fast book wanted
to have it and we actually had a real
real good reason and demo to actually
show what the problem was so the other
way to disrupt is go where others don't
go and this is the problem as well they
were like if you want to make money now
only go for the iPhone market in America
that's where people spent money this
this earth is this round blue thing and
there's these people people everywhere
and they want to do things on the web as
well and why not tap into a market that
is not there for others why not tap into
a market where we're the people that are
actually driven by obsolescence cannot
go because the market can't afford it
because the market can't do it so that
is what we're doing with Firefox OS I'm
not here to make a pitch I just say what
it is right now because it's 90% of my
life at the moment and I get incredibly
excited about it
and we went to the Mobile World
Conference which is the most evil sales
show on this planet I spent like two
days just reporting incidents of booth
babes - like - like blogs in America
that talk about inequality at
conferences and we rocked that thing we
were in every headline like everybody
released new phones everybody released
new things and Firefox as an open-source
company as a non-for-profit organization
giving out a free operating system was
the main headline why because we got 18
mobile partners to actually partner with
us and 4 hardware partners to bring out
phones that are internet connected that
are web connected with smart phone
functionality to markets that cannot get
iPhones and that cannot get Android
phones and can't afford them so emerging
markets like South America like Eastern
Europe we have a lot of partners that
actually go out with them and these are
our partners that sell the thing with us
these are partners that actually code
the thing with us so instead of just
having sales people around them we're
just like okay you want to be part of
this show us your engineers and this is
what we're doing with this so what
Firefox OS does is replace old feature
phones we don't replace the androids we
don't replace the iOS because we cannot
compete on that market we don't have the
marketing budget we don't have actually
the hardware we don't have the people
that want to actually partner with us
because they're like let us the stinky
free/open hippies that's like not right
to work with so the one the main
differentiators for us here in Firefox
OS is first of all that everything is
html5 in that phone like nothing in here
is ceased as Java or cocoa or visual
virtual C this is all html5 and it's on
github you can actually play with it of
course for the mainstream market this
means who cares but what people care
about is actually making it easier for
them to find apps and to actually play
with apps and what is easy finding
things on the internet maybe a search
functionality may be something like
playing with it so if you go in Firefox
4s and hopefully my connectivity working
here and I have
somewhere there you go this is the
emulator that is just put into your into
Firefox as an as an add-on and once you
put it in there and it starts why does
it do that to me when I'm going stage
there you go
you can start the emulator this is what
it looks like you got your era console
you can play with it and this is the
operating system itself now if I go to a
market right now and I want to know what
I want to have an apple I want to have
an app above my favorite band I want to
know something about a band what do I do
I go to like I click through like okay
music apps and then they got 6,000 of
them all of them reviewed but I probably
paid reviewers and I don't know the name
of those things I don't know what to do
so that's why we have to pay posters
that's why we have to pay advertising to
get our name of our app into people's
heads this is software
this is indexable software why do we
need this so in Firefox OS if you go
here you search for example Nine Inch
Nails let's do a good band you get the
background already changing to Nine Inch
Nails and you get obvious we have nine
here wonderful there's a space in there
that was the problem so let's use u2 is
to name normal demo so you - I've got my
background here a bank changed into u2
and I've got YouTube for videos I've got
Grooveshark for music I've got
SoundCloud for music Wikipedia for
information I can buy tickets on
Songkick it realized that I was entering
a band and gave me your applications
anybody's applications that are
submitted in the market or are on the
web these are not the apps that are in
my phone these are apps on the web so I
can now click on this one for example
grooveshark and start listening to an -
a u2 song if I really don't like my life
once I had a good experience with that
app I can go back and actually do a long
click on the app and install it so a
long click would then install it on the
operating system and it will not operate
it like a bookmark like it doesn't I Oh
s it actually will install it with app
cache with everything going offline and
giving you access to your hardware in
ways that iOS doesn't give you so we
made Aptus cover e and app try before
you buy as simple as actually surfing
the web so if you have a mobile website
and you want to sell an app your mobile
website is your advertisement for the
app because you can index that for you
and you can actually show up in these
search results and this is bringing
search technology to the to the app
world which is very interesting to me
and I think it's just for you a good
idea to spruce up your mobile HTML
versions that you have right now of your
pages so you can play with that yourself
and somewhere I've got my presentation
again there you go and I found that hard
to explain to people at times but once
they started playing with it they ended
the movie title and then they realized
hey there's movie apps dust as flicks
turd as I can watch these movies so you
go from the use case to the app and not
from the app to the use case which is
what we do with close to markets right
now the other thing we do is we enable
Hardware access so you've got all these
api's to actually access to the access
the hardware directly from JavaScript
the vibration API which was called
vibrator API and made too many stupid
jokes and geolocation was one of the
first things we did years and years ago
and then it went out to all the browsers
so all of these api's are not inside an
SDK these are standardized API proposals
that other browsers can implement as
well so geo locations across all
browsers the battery API is across all
browsers network information speed
connectivity api's are being used by
others as well indexeddb has been used
by others so you get full access to the
hardware and that was always the problem
in the iPhone you basically you got
promised to access the hardware but you
couldn't get to it
you just had to build a native app going
through PhoneGap or something like that
the other thing we did is like of course
we cannot allow any app to access every
piece of the hardware because you could
a puzzle game that calls one 900 numbers
in the background and racks up lots and
lots of money so we actually have to
review some apps in terms of security
where how much access to the hardware
you want but we also came up with a
system called web activities which was
much like web intents in chrome but it's
actually active and what it does it
actually tells you to tell Stu user to
do something on your behalf so if you
want to do a telephone call you have to
have an app that's listed in the
marketplace and reviewed by it by
Firefox or by Mozilla if you want to
just do a telephone call from a web app
that you host on your own server you can
do the most telephony pick API here so
you got the pick action and the pick
action would know okay again you need a
photo if you want to have a photo you
just call a pick action you don't care
where the photo comes from you don't
want to know if it's from the gallery if
it's from the wallpapers or if it's from
the camera so that's what you do you do
a pick action the user then chooses
which one's he wants to actually use
give you a photo you get the photo back
same with a telephone call a telephone
call you give the telephone actually a
call telephone number it switches to the
dialer app the user has to initiate the
call so you don't do it on their behalf
it's up to them to actually make that
call
once they hang up you go back to your
app automatically and you get the
duration of the call and telephone
number that was called so the difference
2d tell pseudo protocols and things that
we had on iOS is then you get a feedback
loop you bring something to it to a
native app and then you get the data
back and that is cool because I want I
don't want to use your phone app all the
time I have a phone app that works fine
on my phone why can't I just use that so
the web activities allow your xt to any
website and any any web app to actually
tie into other native apps of the
operating system and that works across
Android and it works across Firefox OS
as well and I love that because I don't
want to be in control for that I don't
want to have your your Flickr or Twitter
or whatever credentials these are yours
don't give me them it's yours it's your
way to share it on Twitter it's it's
yours to actually take away I don't want
my app to be responsible for things
happening on your Twitter stream and
that is right now happening because we
ID
if I on behalf of the user the whole
time so web activities allow any html5
app to go into native apps and do that
do their thing and get the data back and
it's much more important to me than
actually accessing it myself and getting
that information it works well with
others if you put Firefox on your
Android all of these things well not all
of the api's but the web activities for
example work as well so you can do that
and Firefox for Android supports down to
Froyo so you don't need the newest
coolest Android to actually get html5
support sensible html5 support crow
opera does the same thing now so opera
is also a browser you can stall on
Android to go back to an older older
version of Android
rather than having chrome only on the
newest one another big thing that we
just released is that you shouldn't make
people think about the web but just come
halfway at-at the game conference that
was just here in San Francisco we're
announced a SMGs which is also there's a
meet-up at 6 o'clock in our office today
there's only vent brad i think and what
that one is it actually allows you to
convert c++ games or C++ code into
JavaScript code so if you're a C++
company and you want to do something on
the web but you really don't want to
re-educate all of your developers onto
JavaScript or C++ guys looking at
JavaScript makes them come out in hives
and stuff you can use that
so one thing we announced is the Unreal
3d engine now running in JavaScript and
canvas and WebGL in the browser so you
don't need flash to run 3d games
Electronic Arts was one of our partners
to actually bring out the 3d gaming onto
the web and just convert their apps
convert their games not write them from
scratch because that's not gonna happen
so we want to have the fidelity of 3d
gaming on the web but we don't want want
people to have to write from scratch so
we wrote a converter same base to PDF
displaying in the browser is also done
through the same engine so instead of
having a plug-in that gets hacked every
two month we just ran the PDF in
JavaScript and the original thing was a
C++ library so if you got cool C++ stuff
right now you can convert it to
JavaScript rather than learning
JavaScript which to me is a handshake
back to the 1980s or is like we can work
together we don't really
you to replay the web will not replace
you we want your stuff that's what we do
so what can you do how can you be part
of that so the first thing is that I
haven't seen yet and I want to see much
more is context-aware applications
everybody has like ok this is an this is
a responsive design it's smaller on the
phone and shows 5 buttons and it's
bigger on the other one but it doesn't
change the context it doesn't give you a
way to actually work with it imagine a
company that actually has a guy walking
around going to meetings the interface
on the phone could just be started there
find my location stop the meeting there
when he goes back onto into his office
and he starts the desktop he opens the
same app the same HTML app and it
actually shows him like okay here's what
you did today please put the notes in
there please put the photos in there
upload the other stuff we do different
things that we do want on a phone that
we do on a desktop and we shouldn't just
make everything dumber because the
mobile phone is the clever thing but we
just give you a context aware app what
do you want to do on a desktop what do
you want to do on a mobile what do you
want to do on a tablet give you the best
experience on all of these and html5 is
the only technology allows you to do
that because a native app cannot do this
you have to install three different apps
on three different platforms and that's
just not clever to me that just doesn't
make any sense that that I have
temple-run on my tablet and my PA and my
mobile phone and they are out of sync
and I have to do the same challenges on
both of them that's just terrible
first of all problem it's just not nice
go small go offline if you can cut out a
few KS
cut out a few cakes if you can make the
thing work offline that people can enter
things while they're actually while
they're actually waiting for it to load
great that's what we want we want this
experience to be as smooth as possible
because we're impatient when we're on
the phone we don't really care that
about reloading a page three times in
our desktop but on the phone it's like
this is broken this is broken I love it
with maps when people like it can't find
the map what's going to space for you
be a bit more grateful but yeah when I'm
here one pound fifty per megabyte
Internet roaming so if you have this 220
Meg animated gifs a landing page I hate
you fix the first generation mobile web
this was the the login system at the
airport in Barcelona how it looked on my
Android well that's fun and especially
as when you go through the second step
it asks you for your passport number to
get 15 minutes of internet access so I'm
not sure I found somebody else's
passport so it's all good but that
should not happen anymore this is just
silly you know this is just a viewport
meta tag should be enough to fix that
kind of crap and make it sure make sure
that you realize if we've got wonderful
things like V W and V H now in CSS as
well but you can make typography resize
according to the size of the screen so
we can make the flexibility that flash
had years ago in web technologies easily
nowadays trust and help the platforms
you want to be you're complaining that
something doesn't work in Firefox
cotopaxi 'no complain be annoying put
screenshots there put put like test
cases there tell people what is wrong
don't go on Twitter and say like oh
Firefox does this wrong I hope somebody
from Firefox reads this and does my work
for you same with Chrome same with opera
same with Internet Explorer all of these
things are available to you to complain
where people are working on them not
where we where we get like applause from
other people when we complain about them
help us make the web better by using
what browsers put in I told you about at
supports look at that tonight don't
animate anything in JavaScript we cannot
Hardware accelerate your JavaScript
animations we can Hardware accelerate
anything in CSS because that's our
engine but when you simulate what the
browser does natively we cannot help you
make the web faster and then it's not--
there is no help complaining that
browsers are slow you made that you took
over the browser's job so you make it
fast if you let us do what we need to do
use translate instead of top and left
you see us as animations you CSS
transitions instead of CSS animate in
JavaScript animate and we can make the
thing better and every six weeks does a
new browser out and these things change
constantly so please use that stuff and
give us feedback what is necessary what
is unnecessary what you like what you
don't like so jump right in
it's fun yeah it's messy but hey this is
fun
so nothing stops you from actually
helping the web of the future by helping
the people who build the platform for
the web you can be massively successful
tomorrow with a great native app good
luck have fun with it and in half a
year's time it's gonna be obsolete
because the next one has to come if you
want to go that fair enough if you don't
if you want to play on the web play by
it's wonderful open rules and be
successful by sharing and by actually
playing with things that come in there
every week I find something new in
browsers and it gets me terribly excited
it's a sad life but it's just what if I
had some of the things that I had in the
past that I didn't know in the past I
would be on a beach now or something
cause I wouldn't have to work anymore
every browser to develop a platform
every browser is a conversion tool
reader mode in browsers allows you to
actually fix a lot of sides and actually
read them nicely rather than having to
click through to 2000s so with that I'm
out of time so I thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
