weird before I start the next speaker my
friend miles who saw doing interpretive
dance up here he's the organizer of
jQuery SF which took place like five
weeks ago here and I spoke in the same
spot and so it's kind of weird being
like here again yeah so I'm here to talk
to you about future so in a community
like ours which moves extremely fast and
you've heard a lot about that today it's
hard to say where things will be in just
a few years I think this is mostly
because people focus on making
predictions but if we take a tour
through history and look through some of
the most famous predictions people have
made we start to notice a pattern from
scientific American's saying the
automobile will be finished in 1909 to
New York Times saying that we will never
launched a rocket out of Earth's
atmosphere to my personal favorite Steve
Ballmer betting against the iphone the
predictions almost never go well
predictions focus on making very
specific assertions about the future and
in non-scientific context they border
beyond being almost universally wrong
but predictions are also very easy to
make I can say X amazing tool will be
popular in the future with very little
consequence if i'm wrong but if I'm
right I'm a genius and I don't want to
list off a bunch of tools I think are
cool and say the future will be it like
this is the future because that would be
the service to you so I'm going to avoid
making predictions in this talk instead
I'm going to celebrate good ideas that
people have today and we really hope
that those good ideas went out in the
future so I'm James Kyle I'm an engineer
at cloudflare I work on open source
projects such as Babel you can follow me
on the twitters at the James Kyle so I
want to tell you a story my friend April
recently watched my cat was away in
London after she saw my apartment she
said to me James you are living in
livable conditions I looked at her funny
and said what do you
April my apartment is nice she said no
it's not your mattress is on the floor
you have laundry just sitting out your
garbage disposals broken and James you
have three air conditioners in your 400
square foot San Francisco apartment none
of which are being used it's true I
stared at her for a long moment and said
Mike garbage disposals broken and she
said it's a problem that you don't know
that let me help you she did the most
amazing thing possible and offer to get
my apartment in livable conditions so I
felt inspired by April to show she
showed me how terrible I apartment was
and then she showed me how to fix it so
that is my lofty goal here I want to
show you how bad things are now and show
you how good things can be so let's talk
about tools the first thing you know
need to know about most of today's tools
is that they suck when I say tools I
mean a lot of different things from
linters to code coverage implementers
syntax highlighters and scaffolders
there's a lot of tools that you use
every day that you might not notice
until you really think about it these
tools all have amazing people who spend
tens if not hundreds of hours of their
time working on them and they all do
great work but many of these tools are
built up on hacks everything from
regular expressions that directly
manipulate strings of code to
specifically decide the vine that define
syntax that if you do not follow exactly
it will completely break your code and
finally everyone is implementing the
same thing over and over and over again
and every time we do we create a new set
of bugs and end up solving the same
issues in multiple places the good news
is that we're starting to see our tools
change for the better we're starting to
see them get smarter
and to explain how I need to explain
this thing called static analysis the
simple definition of static analysis is
to examine code without execution now
that's a bit abstract so let me explain
further here's a small piece of
JavaScript code as JavaScript developers
we can start to recognize some of the
things here the variable declaration a
string there's a function declaration
and inside the function there is an
assignment expression a computer can
tell all of this to just by looking at
the code it doesn't need to execute Baz
to know that there's an assignment
expression in it and through parsing it
can generate this giant nested object
called an AST and it's just a giant
object with a bunch of properties that
describe the syntax of code and if you
look closely you'll see that it has all
of the same syntax that we know as
developers so once you have this AST you
can work with it much easier than like
regex that matches directs like strings
of code it's just a giant object that
you can traverse to look for things or
manipulate code or do whatever you want
I can easily go through the ast and find
all the variables or find all the
functions in my code but all this
revolves around syntax syntax to find
certain things but if you want to drill
down deeper you start to lose the
ability to do so say you want to write a
tool that does something special with
all of your classes in es5 we expressed
classes as just functions these
functions didn't mean anything in
particular and without executing the
code it's difficult to tell what its
purpose is we could attempt to tell how
this particular function gets used by
manually checking the rest of the
program to see how it's called but then
you run into problems because it might
be called in different ways because
nothing says it can't it gets even worse
when you start to pass references around
here I'm passing our function into bar
but now who knows how bar is going to
call it that could be entirely separate
file and it could be called condition
and there's a ton of work we would need
to do in order to figure out if it's a
class so this sucks in es6 this has been
release for pet replaced with an actual
syntax for expressing classes now this
is a bit controversial especially with
some of the people in this very audience
but it means that within static analysis
we can immediately find all of our
classes effectively syntax and the
semantics they define are enforcing new
rules and we can start to operate on
these new rules in es5 we had common j/s
modules it was always a temporary
solution that worked inside of an
existing syntax tools like browser
firework by running static analysis and
the code looking for required calls but
this is easy to break just by putting a
string elsewhere it no longer works so
this also sells any is six we now have a
syntax for defining modules and we
enforce the rule that it can't have
dynamic strings for imports this means
that tools that use that static analysis
can operate safely on these rules well
this also means is that we can have
smarter linting to reuse my modules
example say we have module one that
imports module to it but only calls the
my method method a really smart linter
will be able to look at module to notice
that can just import the my method
directly because it doesn't care what
the context is so linter alerts you and
say hey you can just import the my
method method so you fix your imports
and you clean it up a bit the reason I
use that example is because it leads to
smarter bundling any is five we have
common js2 Express modules like this and
if you've ever seen a browser five
bundle you'll notice that the use of
this arbitrary syntax can cause or
causes bundles to look like this all of
our modules are in one file in a giant
array of anonymous functions that wrap
in math our dependencies but this is so
much extra code why can't it be smarter
well the new import export syntax we can
if you look at these two modules next to
each other we can easily see that
there's even more code than we really
need without the import &amp;amp; exports it
almost reads like a single file so why
not just do just that here we can see
the only only the code that we need to
execute the program properly now this
example can lead even further to smarter
minifying we can take a look at our
bundled module and since everything is
in one place we can track values to see
how to minify it better first we'll
notice that the my method always returns
the same value so we can turn it into a
constant and update all the references
and since it's a string we don't have to
worry at all about reference equality
but then will notice the reference is
only used in one place so why don't we
just in line it but then holy crap
special method is never getting called
so let's just remove that and
congratulations you've created the
fastest possible program now this isn't
the most practical example but it
demonstrates what I mean getting to
build stuff with static analysis is
really awesome so since I'm heavily
involved in Babel I want to talk to you
a little bit about it so quick poll how
many of you have heard of Babel a lot
how many of you have used it that's also
a lot so for those that don't know Babel
is a general-purpose JavaScript compiler
that you can hook into and do just about
anything its primary purpose today is to
compile future JavaScript syntax into a
version that works everywhere today it
can compile constants classes modules
arrow functions generator generators and
even cool language extensions like jsx
and flow so that's pretty cool but
what's even cooler is that while
building all of these cool 8h es2015
transforms babel became awesome at
building any kind of transform so we
open this up to the world via plugins
with plugins you have the full if you
have access to the full power of battle
let me give an example imagine you have
this code this is the es2015 you can
instructing sin track syntax for arrays
we are creating a new X in Y variables
and assigning them to the first and
second values in the array that
calculate coordinates returns now if we
want to compile this down to a version
that works today we create a temporary
variable named ref assign it to the
results of calculate coordinates and we
create two new variables at the first
and second values of breath now this is
a pretty cool transformer and I might
just walk away without realizing that
the syntax is more complex than that
because this type of assignment can also
be within expressions so if you run the
same transformer on this code you'll
discover that it creates invalid syntax
you can't have a statement inside of
expression like that as developers we
can immediately recognize that and we
know where to go from here but Babel
will look at this transfer made tea AST
realize it's incorrect understand what
you're attempting to do and fix the code
for you by turning the statement into an
expression and this is all made possible
by the fact that Babel fundamentally
understands JavaScript it is aware of
every single part of that language and
in being designed as a compiler it
understands how to transform JavaScript
really well Babel also recently
introduced type inference so if you
listen to Steve collab Nets talk about
rust and node you talked a little bit
about how r us doesn't require you to
type right types in many places just
because it confer them so bad well can
do many of the same things they won't
type check for you but it can but it can
provide tools built on top of Babel with
a lots of type information and people
have already gone and built type systems
on top of Babel so let's take a look at
that that one can take a piece of code
like this with a couple variables are
being set and manipulated and can add
type information to it and this is what
it looks like when printed back out with
slow type annotations but as a vela /
you don't need to write any of this it
knows that strings are strings it knows
that numbers are numbers and it knows
that strings added two numbers or
strings but let's talk about that last
one vowel can take a
that string and a number see that they
are being added together and know that
the result will be a string it's not
executing the code but has the same
knowledge is that we do as developers to
say that no matter what that's going to
be a strength so that's great that Babel
can statically evaluate these
expressions but if we look at the whole
code we can see that towards the bottom
that doesn't carry through with
statements at the end of that code
snippet Babel isn't sure if it's a
boolean a number a string a function or
an array but Babel gets even smarter
than that take this piece of code we
have one variable str that gets
reassigned to different values as the
code executes well Babel can start
traversing this code and be able tell
what that value will be over time it is
statically evaluating all of this code
adding tons of type information that
plugins to take advantage up to be
smarter so babbles a platform it's meant
to be built upon and many already have I
mentioned some of the someone built a
type system on it but other people have
built like entire new languages on have
a Babel that's like more than one so I'm
not going to go into somehow that crazy
stuff is built but instead some of the
more common use cases amber was actually
one of the first major communities to
adopt Babel and today they use it in
some interesting ways amber has a bunch
of extra code that exists to make the
development experience nicer but they
will use Babel to find this extra code
and remove it leaving only the necessary
code in this case it's feature flags
that you have enabled or disabled reacts
has been another major adopter about two
three month ish ago it deprecated all of
their tools in favor of Babel so react
has a syntax called jsx which is also
built on babble babble can look through
all these jsx elements and find the ones
that are immutable if it finds any it
will hoist them to the highest possible
scope and they will only be created once
which makes the rendering of react much
much faster
I bring up ember and reacts because I
think they're really the communities to
be watching right now ember and react
are both highly influential in the
direction of the JavaScript community in
terms of its tooling frameworks and etc
unsurprisingly it's also where you can
see some of the bigger problems being
solved and existing problems being
solved in new ways ember in react have
very different approaches and ideals
ember is focused on making developers as
productive as possible they also follow
this principle of stability without
stagnation which I'll get to in a second
if you worked around the Java sir
community to the last few years you'll
know that react has really came out of
left field but the community it has
built up in the last two or so years is
really focused on experimenting with new
ideas it's really challenging the
assumptions people have about what best
practices really are to try and
summarize ember ecosystem is very much
innovation without rewrites they have a
very good low level set of abstractions
that allow them to dramatically change
major pieces of the framework without
breaking anything from users they also
have this thing called ember CLI which
standardizes all the ways that ember
apps are built out of the box it comes
with all the tools you need to build a
massive application they're also able to
do some interesting things like turn on
CSP and s RI by default if you aren't
aware of CSP RS rye there are two newer
web standards that are designed to make
the web more secure these aren't sexy
features they get overlooked by many
people but they are incredibly important
so amber pushing this forward is a
really big deal and we should all
applaud them for it react on the other
hand is very much in flux that pun was
horrible I apologize for that one but
it's true the react community has not
figured everything up and they are
trying to find new and innovative ways
of solving problems and this is changing
the way the JavaScript community as a
whole works you're seeing ember angular
and others trying to steal some of the
ideas here when are the ember core team
members once told me that react is
members playground they are happy to
watch to react community to work out the
best solutions and then steal them for
their own can take that how you ever
however you want and this is awesome for
everyone the react community is creating
and popularizing new and better ideas
for everywhere in the JavaScript
community so I need to wrap up my talk
but I want to leave you with something
hold onto your butts because I'm about
to thought leader all of you this is a
bit inspired by my friend and personal
hero Jason Laster who has given a few
talks with a similar message are you
ready um I'm borrowing from emily's Rose
talks right now with the dramatic pause
thing so yeah when something frustrates
you it's probably frustrated others and
it will continue to frustrate people so
fix it for everyone tools can make your
life easier and we can all work on them
I don't want to turn this into a huge
battle plug but I think Babel might be a
cool place to start the plugins I
mentioned earlier are really easy to
write here are some examples of the
officially maintain ones in the Babel
plugins org here's one that turns object
consigned to the Babel extends helper
here's one that turns a string properly
literals and to identify our property
literals here's one that removes
debugger statements here's one that
turns evals into normal code and another
one will turn undefined into void 0 and
my personal favorite a plug-in that
turns all of your identifier Xin to
emojis this plug-in is mostly emojis but
if we scroll down we can see it works
just the same as all the other plugins
the point is even when you run into the
smallest can inconveniences fix them
yourself say you create a class you
override a constructor and you forget to
call super then you spend 20 minutes
trying to figure out what it is you've
probably done that a bunch of times too
but once you figure it out right a tool
that will correct you at compile time
and be done fixing that problem forever
that tool would be like 10 lines of code
you can easily do it that's my talk and
you can follow me on Twitter
