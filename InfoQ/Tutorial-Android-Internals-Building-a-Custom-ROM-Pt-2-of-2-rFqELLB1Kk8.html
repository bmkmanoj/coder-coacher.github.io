an application right we added an
application into into this let me show
you on since you get some some of you
asking about media framework right so I
did that with the team in Korea we did
the media framework right so let me just
show you the same thing in my packages
where's my not packages I added also
something called audio demo right so
just it's a very simple application
starts playing place of music right so
you know is I if I go here let me go let
me show you
look it's magically installed so there's
audio demo right then
and you can start playing here this
toppling that's it games very very
simple but we were by doing this we were
illustrating how it we modified the the
framework to simply do log okay
so hold on one second see if I do start
so hold on son too much too much
information going on here this is the
same need to share it it could be it'll
be a shell log cat so yeah we have a lot
of sub gunner but that's that's what we
put on there there it is media player
right so that that stuff is all being
printed from our own code so we modify
the framework to be able to log what's
going on for instance right so we'll see
that later on okay when we get to that
point we're just doing this like simple
thing first and then we're making the
harder and harder okay so so far you saw
how to add an application right pretty
straightforward on next thing that we're
going to look at this couple config
files so Padre if you want to add a
native at a library like for example if
you wanted to include something in
system led folder right that's it and
simpler because you you actually don't
you just need to put it in it's not
packaged it's external it just in slash
external right and then you don't even
need and create a make file but you
don't even need to make a add it to the
make file in this case it's actually
going to traverse all the make files so
this is not necessary but it's
recommended and you run a mmm to make it
so we're not going to do that but that's
how you would add a native library okay
that's even simpler than what we did so
what if you you are asking about system
services and changing what
running and how its running and all that
all that stuff is in a file coordinator
see right and this that in it RC file
when it's all done
where's my self control see when it's
all done that in it our RC file is right
here so it's on the file system right
here it that is stalled on the file
system I'm now logged into the device so
notice that there are two unit RCS
there's the goldfish and then there's
the unit RC regular right so what do you
remember what goldfish is emulator right
yeah and this is regular so this is
basically the main one then this goes on
top of it right now this is where it's
installed let's see where we install it
from so we install it from let me close
this
we close some of this build was built
out a little open actually let me close
out so we install it from system right
this system for Sol system corridor
right that's where it's all this stuff
so root directory and that's our unit RC
file right here so I'm going to open it
and this is what it looks like so
basically let me go to the beginning
this file so basically this is our in it
our sefa it basically you know specifies
couple of like log level things like
that these are the system variables
right remember how I said only I'll do
you library only a system Lib is in the
LD library path this is what that's
specified is just a simple expert right
if you want to configure the environment
this way we do it this is creating now
some symbolic links we're actually
making the mount point so in Android um
it's slightly different than a normal
flavor of Linux because we don't get FS
tab file right like you know in Linux
you have that you guys familiar with how
that works have a file that specifies
all the mount points
that right and regular legs it's not
like that so we actually make a
directory then we mount something onto
that directory right so we're making C
this is where we are making our slush
system but then setting the permissions
for that directory right making a secure
storage for apps on SD card right we are
writing some information here we're
changing the privileges for various
directories okay
we're mounting file systems okay
so there's where we are mounting user
data system cache right yet another file
system right the file system system this
is what we're montengro file system
read-only okay changing ownership of
system so we're making the structure for
file system okay we're doing all that
this is where we're setting the
properties you guys were asking about
properties right so these are the
various properties that we're that we're
adjusting like such as how much memory
for example foreground applications have
right how visible memory space you know
home application memory hidden
application memory and so on and so on
so those settings are here these are
various system servers in daemons
permissions right so this is for radio
so this we're starting various radio
related things wakelocks
okay
these are various did disappea buffers
food for Wi-Fi edge GPRS rate so don't
the various settings okay so those are
settings this is where we now start
starting services right this way it's
actually starting services remember when
we were talking about this yesterday we
had this map right and I said this is
what happens right so that everything
starts here that's what we're looking at
okay so enough so this is another way of
looking at it so line you know this line
here to 270 now we are at the beginning
we are now starting these guys okay so
that's what we're doing we're starting
these guys so basically there's a
document that explains what which one of
these means okay so then the document is
this document that I specified here
alone system core in it read me okay so
that explains what is what okay so let
me show you
so system core system coronet resume
trimming so it's right here so in this
document it tells you what it means to
start so these are various active
services right name so name pad argument
and then options options can be one of
these right it's critical it's disabled
set environment properties right sockets
if it's if a service requires a socket
right user which user it's going to run
on like in other words is a specific
service gonna run is Radia right or is
it going to run as shell or is it going
to run as a DB that sort of stuff right
group permissions one shot means just
try it once if it doesn't work it
doesn't work right
you know and so on so these are various
triggers and cetera right so this is a
useful file that we can do this this is
basically everything that is possible is
the amount right to read Oni read/write
remount and so on so on right so so that
that's what there are various things
mean and how to set them okay this is
some examples and so right so let's look
at the real file so we are now starting
demonstrate so we're starting the
console that's the shell so it's a
causal it's disabled user shell group
log right so you want to have root
permissions route change this right BAM
so now the shell is owned by the root
right although our shell is already a
super user so we don't need to worry
about it right so adb by default it's
disabled right but we can enable it by
changing the setting so there's
basically layers or in it that grow on
top of each other
should we start should we start
ADB right well depends on the property
great is it is it a qmu which means
emulator right emulator running on you
know II guess on what Kenya is so Q mu
is is the virtualization engine that
angular 2 runs on top oh so I don't know
if it's going to open but that's the
page it's an open source engine for
virtualization that's what virtualizes
the hardware makes it be arm right it
will open right so that's that's what
that is
so it's an open source processor
emulator so emulates a process that's
what we are using for MU for this okay
so
our starting a DB we're stopping it if
enabled this force okay so at this point
a DB started now we're starting the
service manager okay right now we're
starting a service manager
do you remember service manager let's
take a look at at PS again so if I do PS
remember service system server there was
a assistance service manager right right
so that's our service manager it's
critical right so that's that's
basically that one now notice that on
it's going to restart zygote and media
if it goes down so let me try something
let me try just for fun so service
manager is 28 right good 28 0 it is paid
33 right so let's kill - 928 BAM okay
I can't I killed it let's see 28 doesn't
exist anymore right but service manager
got restarted it's got a totally
different process ID and it caused
zygote to restart as well as in zygote
is no longer 33 in medius
so basically these restarted this
restarted this restart so you can set
sort of the dependencies right between
these okay so that's basically the
service manager important one right so
it's critical so now we're starting
Volvo thief great we are starting netd
debugger this is your radio some of you
some of you care about the radios this
is the radio Deema radio demon runs is a
native service and then Android connects
to it while a socket so it's actually
like the works of our socket
it doesn't work over a IDL so a radio is
sort of different it's not very typical
for Android right so so that's radio
zygote so we're we're starting zygote so
these are parameters for zygote and it's
basically it's devilish it's going to on
restart on any of these so it when power
restarts and so on and so on when media
or net theory start media server so this
is forms audio camera graphics etc so
that's basically our media server starts
there put bootable and so on so these
are some some other processes let's
start key store and that's that so this
is one of our innate our C's right on
top of this we had the other in it RC
which is the one that starts for warm
this is low memory one to the settings
appropriate properties for a low memory
and so on but you can have multiple init
our C's in for different purposes okay
so does that make sense a little bit now
how it how to configure what starts and
what the ordinary starts and importance
in all that stuff right so read this
file is useful right the init language
so it's got its own unique language
right yeah
questions of that permissions how do you
change it change the permissions how do
we configure what is allowed users on
Android right how do we configure some
of these if this is a rooted phone or
not right how do we configure the afraid
your runs is a radio user or answers
nobody right how do you configure that
stuff there is no password file there's
no et Cie password file okay it's sort
of kidding
like in Android this is where the this
stuff is so it's actually in it's not in
it it's not in good there but it's in
the private so it's right here so system
system core include and then private
does this file dot H so basically this
stuff gets compiled into the operating
system right so this is where we are
configuring various permissions let me
start at the beginning so these are the
various user group numbers right you are
you IDs G IDs right so radio Bluetooth
graphics audio camera log compass and so
on so they all have their own you IDs
right yeah there's our shell right shell
user ADB debug shell users right
you have to remake the operating system
yeah so you would if you make a change
in here you would then do a make of two
words and then rebuild them in assisting
the time G right yeah so this these are
your IDs now this is where we're
defining who can do which which user
runs what right so for example the root
is UID such-and-such system is UID
such-and-such radio is UID such-and-such
that's what we are mapping them okay
so next we are configuring the path
we're saying which path is owned by what
okay so you know how I said normally you
cannot change your seer data data
permission a system because it's owned
by system system right like what if I
wanted to make this be readable by
anyone like you probably do not want to
do this but what if I did this or it's
probably going to be seven seven six
right but we don't want to do that right
so as the card is owned by root right I
can change the permission that nobody
conveyed to us because right I can
change that here okay right
so that's basically that but rules are
rules for file so this is where
basically this is for directories this
is for files okay who can change what
file right so that's the who owns what
right file system configuration this is
basically what's configuring our file
system and we are assigning those you
IDs for various file systems right so
that's that's what that's configured
okay in terms of in terms of permissions
does that make sense that file well
there's one more file that I wanted to
show you and it's called
let me see so there's one more file in
the file system if you go and see the
into system system etc' permissions
okay so platform dot XML file so cat
platform dot XML file this is where we
are mapping on permissions to you IDs so
remember how we had to specify as for a
permission from a user right so remember
for example Bluetooth internet camera
right external storage okay
so add an app that has a high level
Android permission right external
storage that maps to a Linux partition
permission called cm SD card readwrite
which is defined then in this file here
you know that's where somewhere there is
going to be that permission right as the
card read write or it's going to be at
least the user right so it's right here
right like sense so that maps to that
UID etc setter so that's for example
that we also looked at the other ones
that we can all access fine location and
access for location so doesn't just show
you I these right
remember how we asked in our application
so that's that's what that means right
okay so so that's that's a little bit
about permissions so does that make
sense on how permissions work
a little bit I mean this is from a
lawyer this is not from an Android level
I have a whole other presentation on
just security and Android but this is
just so you know how to change a decimal
letting of you know ROM write the actual
system build so so that's that's that so
any questions on this or on good okay so
modifying frameworks this is probably
one of those hardest things to do right
because now we're looking at okay so we
have this entire platform you want to
modify a player framework from top to
bottom right from an application all the
way down to the drivers again so how do
we do that it really depends on a
framework right it really depends on
which framework you keep you you worry
about so let me first show you also
let's see so typically this is just an
example for sensor framework we can look
at the sensor sensor framework later on
but we have basically the Java manager
is here okay
the j'ni code is here the actual C
implementation of that code or the
Cather file is at least here okay but
you guys were more interested in audio
write or multimedia right so multimedia
multimedia basically is audio and then
video right those two things surface
right so by the way you get the details
of this is so the details of this is at
you can find it here
multimedia so there's your audio right
does your video on camera right so it
this will tell you also a little more
details how to configure it what those
things are what libraries they are and
so on so it's this document here under
multimedia audio inside yeah
so let's take a look so this is what
happens when you want to play a song
right so this is our application
remember we have our application called
audio demo okay let's look at that
application first and then we're going
to look down to all the parts right
Audio demo second audio demo we close
all this don't worry it fails to make
that's because we kept the built
automatically turned off right so that's
fine on so this is our audio bomber
right so what we have here is we have
the media player okay so you can sync
all media player and we simply say media
player create right and we point to a
file that you want to play and that file
is right here in resources so there it
is just an mp3 file and before okay so
we're saying media player play this song
right that's it and then we say start
playing and stop playing those are just
taught those two buttons you press start
it calls this you press stop it calls
that okay pretty straightforward make
sense
so that is that let me show you the big
picture that is goes the that is this
right so our media play audio demo cause
media player okay
where is mediaplayer where's this file
hmm
right so they so on the far so this is
beer it's part of the media server but
on the on the file system it is eight on
the file system all this stuff is
typically in frameworks base
okay so there's framers base media yeah
now you notice that there's typically
going to do these two directories so
kind of like regardless of which
framework you're chasing you're going to
notice that there's Java and did this
Jane I folder then that's very typical
so in this case let's take a look at
Java so in Java we have Android media by
the way notice this files I audio
service I media scanner on and so on
what do you think they are they're a IDL
falls right right just like we talked
about earlier today but in this case I'm
interested in media player okay let's
all poops
that's my me can we close this and close
this again
okay so this is our Media Player so what
I did is I simply added this line I
found the start so this is like when I
call media player start because it this
is my line of code yeah you sure so when
we we go here we say media player start
so that is going to call this line of
code this function this method right and
what we're doing here is we're saying
stay away to grab a wakelock
and then we're calling a start okay but
what we start
so this is a j-type all right okay
so remember how I said this why it's
important to know Jane I because this is
normally will be like that right and
you're stuck here you don't know how to
go any further how to cross that line
into sea right so now we know so so
that's basically what that file is okay
if you look at it like this so that's
where we are now crossing from blue to
green right so this is our world of Java
and the world of C right draw a line
here okay make sense so now we got a
look at where is this Jane I file well
it's like I said it's most likely going
to be right here somewhere right so
there's Jane I and then in here we have
something called media player cpp hmm
maybe that's the one let's see
so this is basically this is the so how
do you know this is the name how do I
know this is the file that you're
looking at because remember it's the
naming convention so it's going to be
and so it's going to be the package so
remember this is in I shouldn't have
done it this way
what good wine am I looking at about 300
something okay I can so that we are in
package called Android media and then
media player dot Java right so that
means that this is going to be cold and
drill it media media player and then
start so that's why it's in this thing
so what I did here is first of all I
added a level I'll add this line to to
log to the log file so that we know that
that's what we're starting at right and
by the way on logging as I said is
supported both in C and in Java so it's
the same log cat right so locket you can
do from boy so that's why it's doing
this so what we have here is we are
creating something called media player
okay get media player passing the
environment so we get this thing called
media player which I don't know what it
is yet and then we are saying media
player's process the media player
alright so post media player poll and we
say media player start yeah so now we
would need to figure out what what is
media player and how do we find that
media player right so you cannot search
inside of this file and it could be like
okay where is the media player
okay so this is returning the media
player right
so it's returning the justice thing
media player I'll get in field so we're
basically finding it from there right in
this processing the media player call so
on what I did is I documented these
steps in in a file so me we show you
what I did
so I have a file called media player txt
what I'm going to do is I'm also going
to put it in the sea if you guys want to
download this right so you can I can put
it in my into this folder downloads so
you can copy it from here
but basically these are this is sort of
what's calling what so again if you want
to copy this file it's in here so just
refresh this directory right so 10-4
10-4 5-1 6-1 and then downloads and so
there's your media player dot txt okay
so it's basically I'm saying what is
calling what so our application in
packaged apps or the Adamo is calling
media player start the media player in
framework based on and so on it's
calling start then that is calling the
native method underscore start then that
is calling the frameworks base the J&amp;amp;I
method called
Android media media player start then
that is calling media player start which
is now calling a library web media which
is Android based media lab media right
so there's a something called here hole
start and you can kind of drill down all
the way to the drivers and all that
stuff right but you kind of see how
we're looking now in this case we don't
have any ideal per se yet right but you
can see how we're looking for all this
stuff right make sense
so let me do let me just that one we did
not open so let me minimize this so
mediate so this was Java this was Jane I
and there was also LED media here which
get media player media player cpp write
media player cpp right so that's where
this is the C++ file that's implementing
that right okay so now that is using
another media player and a local media
player class of variable setting it up
starting it and all and although I just
added this to kind of note that that's
that's what's going on okay so far so
good
so uh so this is this is how media one
part of media works right so this is the
example of audio because it's simplest
but it's very similar thing for video
it's very similar thing for you know
recording and so on so this sort of
gives you the map of that right so this
was this was a recording would work like
that now if you care about video it is
again it would it's not it's a different
picture but very similar so there's a
there's a picture for video right so
again same stuff there's your line here
Java C right oh look now we have a
binder call in C but it's the same
binder call right so it's connecting via
binder to C and so on right
okay so that's documented here so um so
any does that make sense how you would
go about finding this so audio video
camera that stuff is documented censors
are not kind of documented and telephony
is kind of dog is kind of documented
right telephone is actually using a
socket so I'm not going to that's sort
of different than anything else so let's
take a look at our location
remember our location doesn't work
because it doesn't know the location
doesn't have the last known location so
what if I wanted to fix that I want to
modify my location framework to actually
give me some location on the emulator
maybe just hard coded so let's see where
that comes from and just like we did in
this media player at txt what I'm going
to do is I'm going to start a I'm going
to do this I'm going to create a new
file I'm going to save it for I'm going
to call it the location manager dot txt
okay so we're going to track we're going
to try to find where this stuff is so
I'm going to do open and I'm going to
open my gingerbread so we're modifying
the framework or we're modifying a
frame-up so which is direct directory
should they start its my search
how about framework more specifically
how about framework base even more
specifically maybe country how about
family Famer based location okay so I'm
going to open that so there's my
frameworks based location so now we are
looking for the last known location so
I'm just going to see where that stuff
I'm not even going to think too much so
I'm going to start do a finding fighting
project okay I'm going to look for get
lost on location actually already did it
right get last known location
damn search so that's where it comes
from we have a location manager okay and
we have the a IDL file surprise surprise
right so location manager that's what we
call right in our code we now put our
location activity course location
manager get lost on location
okay so let me let me document this so
I'm going to say like this so so that
you kind of suck me documented so
packages apps is the packages apps with
the directory packages apps that
location manager a location demo right
so that's what we desire produce as SRC
right palm example location activity
okay both Java okay because location
manager get lost on location right at
line what line number is that its line
28 928 okay so that's why we call
another sake Paul
I'll say to that okay so that's where we
call location manager get lost on
location sounds good okay so that's step
one that's the first thing
step two we look at location manager
okay
so location manager is open right here
location manager damn get last-known
location
okay get lost on location
okay so here it is so get lost on
location it is line 10:15 right and
location manager is located in frame of
space location are to say location
manager premise-based location Java
ended location is okay so frame works
base location Java Android location
location manager Java right line 10:15
right and that's what we call look we
fall no it's not for that but we call
the service get last-known location
now what is this service what do you
think the service is I mean I can look
around but we what's your what's your
guess okay notice that we are catching
remote exception does that look familiar
right so there's probably in the IDL
file right
okay so that is calling the IDL file
which is saying here there's something
called location get last known location
okay so now the question is what is
implementing this a IDL file right
so I locationmanager the ideal so let me
just specify that as well
i location manager dot a I DL and that
and that is on line 63 right
63 and that is now calling or is being
implemented by something so now the
question is where is this file right
what if we put implementing this file so
let's say what's the naming convention
if you couldn't figure out well what
simple and useful a lot to be the naming
convention for this for a look location
manager I ought to be implementing this
fall how do we find that like what's
that it's a service somewhere right so
it's not media but it's probably under
services right Java calm Android server
location manager service okay that
that's where it is so let me let me
document that so we're now in frameworks
based services that's calling location
so they stay on so frail frame
frameworks base services okay and then
um and then it's in Java notice that
again yeah hopefully you guys kind of
notice certain things repeat themselves
so notice that we kept Java in Jay and I
again 1x to each other right okay so
this makes it easy now inside of Java
notice that we have Chrome Android
server so that's the difference between
Android dot location and comm dot
Android dot and then stuff
why some why are certain things in
common droid other things are in Android
dot what's the difference so things that
are in Android dot are exposed as a
public API that is basically means that
it's available to developers kondeh
tender it is private stuff right so it's
not exposed nobody should be using it
directly so this stuff here nobody
should be do using directly so we can
freely make changes and it shouldn't
affect anyone's application right in
terms of linking to it quote-unquote
linking code right so calm Android
server right so do they write it on
services so Java Chrome Android server
and then location manager is its
location manager server location managed
service so does that job and we have
that file open again so that's line 1677
1677 so what are we doing in this line
let's see
so we're logging slog right then we are
running get last known location locked
yeah that's we're calling what do you
think this is underscore yeah that
usually means it's a private right so
it's it's a it's basically provided
right here that last normal people okay
so let me document that provider
okay so that's calling this guy which is
them calling em provider and providers
by name by the way this is what we are
enforcing permissions so if you did not
have access location access permission
this is where we would get the exception
okay that's what's enforcing the
permission in this case so provider
provider by name get provider gets the
provider provider interface if the
provider does not exist but it turns
this amla's known last known location so
we are now looking for what this is M
last known location and that's basically
probably some kind of hash table yeah it
is
let's see there's a cache table that
says last known location put name now or
name provider so this is basically
what's making creating that and last
known location set entries so it's
basically a map of vocations right so we
can now keep looking for this further
down in the code where this this comes
see it's a cache map okay
the subjects lost on location for a
provider
so this is adding test providers if we
want to cannot multi-location rather
right so this is putting a provider and
son
so if I modified for example something
here
so I could basically return a fake
location here the problem is that so I
could do return a new location right and
then I could I could set some properties
of that location the problem there's no
problem so now what what is the location
look like how do I create location what
do you think location class will do just
for fun
any guesses this is the mark these are
the providers right various terms would
that be under services it wouldn't
location probably would be probably
under here Java is it public or private
which directory go out go down this very
tip so it's public right so it could be
under Android not under cone right this
would be private so calm Android
internal would be private Android
location would be public right so this
is where I would expect to find location
there it is right yeah so so these are
our private properties dump
let's see locations to provide their
location location set location reset
convert so
right so I could just probably created a
dummy location for example here it's a
new location for location manager dot G
GPS location GPS provider right
something like that and then I could
probably set some properties on the
location as well certification I can
reset
set times that provide they're set the
latitude said latitude so I could do at
reducing like this take location dot set
something right
fake location dot what's the other one
not set yet but set right and then set
latitude so we can put some numbers here
I don't know - 99 and minus 99 or
something like that right or Plasma oh
my god just something fake and then I'm
going to say return fake location and
I'm going to comment this one out so
this is our lower code that we we
entered so you know online 1705 presence
in our document that
so basically 1705 employment implemented
fake location yeah so how do you build
this now
I mean I would in this case we change
some substantially a lot of stuff right
so I would actually need to do a make
from a four on
so this should actually pick it up right
the make file and we make everything but
this is going to take a long time not oh
I mean it's going to take like 15 20
minutes 15 minutes maybe or something I
may have to do making actual frame
exactly I'm not sure and then but or
delete my system image because it
doesn't know that that it needs it okay
but that would eventually change all
that in you know tell us that give us a
fake location so is that kind of making
sense hard to look around this to get
you guys able to follow at least in the
source to look around the source yeah
you are okay anybody else so that's why
I said I mean you you may not be able to
to do a seeds to under compile right so
now it's compiling okay so yes we didn't
have to change them so that's going to
go build um so we did so basically we
the that's how you would modify a
framework right now because you don't
have all the tools and everything but at
least you know where to look for stuff
right
you
so I'm going to let that compile the
meantime so just become so this is
basically audio framework this is the
camera framework that we talked about
right it's a very similar sort of idea
that we do you guess all those pictures
creating an audio driver if you were to
create your own Audio Driver this is
what you would do so you would create
your own you have to implement but you
know the audio hardware interface right
you need to create ultimately the new
web audio file right and then you will
need to specify that you have it and you
would put it in a specific place so it
gets built with that
this this is a sample make file what it
could look like if you're building Audio
Driver for instance camera library
building a camera library same idea
right that's a sample driver for a
camera like so so that's basically um
that's basically that so did you guys
does this does this make sense how to
modify framework how to build the entire
source code to get it all you know
