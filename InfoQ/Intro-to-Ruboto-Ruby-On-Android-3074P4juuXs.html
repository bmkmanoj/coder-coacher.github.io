about about the Roboto project but first
I want to I want to cover some of the
basics and then talk a little bit about
Android just for the folks who aren't
used to it because I'm gonna be using
some of the terms and it will make any
sense if I don't to tell you upfront
there is a wiki pate page on our github
that has all of the code and has all of
the points that are in the demo tonight
so just go to github Roboto and you'll
find it
so there's actually three ways to do
Ruby on Android the first one is through
real mobile they have a a Rhodes project
which is basically a cross-platform
project you can develop using Ruby and
then deploy to different different
platforms and like most of the
cross-platform programs they're using
HTML for their UI and so that's one of
the projects the other ones the
scripting language for Android that was
a Google Labs project that uses many
different scripting language that it
communicates to the main process and
gives them a special API so it's got a
common API for the different scripting
languages we're actually in charge of
the JRuby interpreter for that and it
probably needs a little bit of a refresh
but the main thing is that it's not the
full Android it doesn't give you full
access to the UI and all the objects it
just gives you it their own API and then
communicates between the two processes
and I know that they're probably working
on developing that although I don't know
how the loss of Google Labs affects that
project and then the last ones Roboto
the Roboto project was JRuby just
converted right over to dalvik and then
creating whatever we needed to create to
make the two interface so our goal on
the project was to make JRuby a
first-class language so that you could
if you could develop it in Java you
could develop it and
Android so Android Linux kernel which
isn't that important but the dalvik VM
is dalvik VM has a different bytecode
it's you know just set up differently so
Java code is compiled and then it's
converted to fit the dalvik format and
so that's a little different when it
comes to the actual applications there's
a couple things you need to know the
main thing is there's an activity and
activities pretty much a screen screens
worth of information it's the visual
component the service which is more the
background component and there's other
things like a broadcast receiver and
content providers but they're the main
two ones are really the activity in the
service and just think of as the visual
in the background the intent is the
thing that you say I want to do
something and it's a little bit of an
abstraction layer to say instead of you
can say I want to launch this activity
but then the system is responsible for
coming back with that activity for you
you don't just say new for example the
other thing is you can say I want to do
something I want to views something on
the browser and you don't necessarily
care if it's the native browser or if
the users picked a different browser
you're just using whatever whatever the
user is chosen as their browser or their
camera or their whatever okay and then
the last thing is the manifest the
Android manifest is the application sort
of specification that tells the
operating system here's what I can do
the activities that I respond to the
services the permissions that I need so
that's a static piece of information
that goes to the application and allows
the the launcher and other act
applications to know what what it can do
the challenge is when it comes to
bringing JRuby over into Android is
there are limitations on mobile hardware
JRuby wasn't specifically designed to
operate in a low memory environment a
slow processor environment clearly the
mobile hardware is getting better but
people are trying to push the the
Android operating system into many
different devices
there's watches coming out with it
running in it so clearly there's going
to be lower end devices and higher end
devices the dalvik VM differences are
fairly significant and there's some
limitations specifically on the amount
of stack space that they're going to
give you that we can very easily bump
into as we're developing the main thing
is because there's a difference between
the dalvik bytecode in the JRuby or in
the normal JVM bytecode you can't just
use the just-in-time compiler and JRuby
or generate classes and things like that
on the fly that you can in the normal
JVM because the bytecode it's generating
isn't compatible with the dalvik VM ok
so until we figure out a way to either
generate the dalvik bytecode or convert
the JVM bytecode on the phone you just
can't take advantage of that so that
means we we have to figure out how do we
transfer control when Android wants to
do something like you click a button and
you want to say I want my Ruby process
my Ruby script to get access to that so
that was one of the challenges that we
were addressing JRuby also has a lot of
components to it that we're just not
using so those components make the
application larger and they're they
really have no no value to the person
you're delivering them to and then the
Android resource framework and by that I
mean in Android you generate a resource
to specify your visual components to
localize it between different languages
to different screen sizes and all of
that is taken care of at compile time
you can still do that and I'll show you
a little bit but you can do it but you
have to recompile applications so you
lose a lot of the dynamics of a dynamic
language okay so really when it comes to
Roboto there's two components to it two
main components first one we came out
with was the IRB which is just an
opportunity to to interact a little bit
with Ruby as it's on the device to put
some scripts on there
and to run those scripts and then the
second piece that actually Daniel worked
on last year is a Summer of Code project
was to start to make something that we
could generate a package take that
script package it up and actually ship
it on the market okay and so that's come
a long way but those are the two main
components they share a lot of pieces
under it they share JRuby that's the the
most common piece of it they share some
scripts that run on the phone side that
manage the interface between the Java
and the Ruby side and then they share
these generated objects on the Java side
that are knowledgeable enough to pass
control over to the Ruby side at the
right time okay so what I'm going to do
in the demonstration is start an IRB and
show you a little bit about about it so
we can interact with a little bit more
and then the second part of it will move
into taking some of the stuff we've done
compile it into an application and if
the forces are with us we'll just stuff
it out under the Android Market and
anybody who wants to you can download it
okay so first thing I'm going to do is
is run rubato IRB it was already running
so sorry I didn't kill it and so
basically just a simple little
environment that we can interact with
and then get values back over here is
the scripts you can add it the scripts
but I have to say editing scripts on a
tablet is better than editing scripts on
a phone but it's not that much better
the keyboards just don't get it for you
they just don't they don't provide you
quick enough access to some of the
things you need you can do it but I
wouldn't do it for I wouldn't write your
program on here first thing I want to do
is I actually want to run a not delete I
want to run a new demo that this the
this version of Roboto IRB was shipped
last night the motivation of having a
demo today so it gets everything up
there so what I did is I just ran and
I'm gonna show you the code in a minute
a web brick server on the device so that
I can get access to it over here okay so
all I did with it all I did was was pull
up this this eval and I can actually
just go ahead and evaluate things on the
device but I'm sending it over to the
web server and then I can look at the
same files that are on the web brick
server or on the device and I can run
those so the first thing I want to do is
I actually want to mount the demo so I
have a another little bit of code and
then that's now available to me okay so
basically here's the code that we're
running not that we want to go through
it but if anybody's ever used web brick
it just you give it a little bit of code
you say you want to mount this procedure
on a particular thing so I'm mounting
something on the route and I'm mounting
something on scripts and then I'm giving
the capability to say I want to run that
script and it just sends it back over
and it loads that script in and runs it
the only things here that are actually
Android components are I'm importing
some stuff that I'm going to use I'm
going to use to send this notification
down here so I sent a notification to
to say here's the port that I'm
registered on and then at the very end
at the very end of
at the very end of my web brick server
I'm launching this in another thread and
I'm starting a service around it so that
it's running that it's running in the
background so that if this thing shuts
down it won't it won't stop on me what I
want to do though is I want to go into
the demos and I wanted to show you a
little bit of these demos okay so first
thing is just to say when you're talking
about a an intent so the first thing you
need to do is you need to fire off
intents and a lot of intents you can
fire off to get other applications to do
your work force so in this particular
case I'm I'm basically saying I want to
do an action image capture and when I
evaluate that code that runs the camera
on me
it takes applause me to take a picture
and then can return control and I'm not
going to do it right now that you can
get that picture get access to that
picture so if you have an application
that you want to you want to take a
picture on you don't have to write a
camera application you just tell the
camera app application take me a picture
and let it do that work for you so the
same way we do that we can launch a
browser great because this is a brand
new computer we can launch a browser or
we can map a location
okay it's actually when it tries to
figure out where it is gonna try to go
to Engine Yard but I'm not gonna not
gonna wait for it okay so that's just
firing off an intent it's not that
interesting ultimately what we want to
do though is we want to come up with our
own activity so now we're actually
getting into rubato doing this so normal
JRuby you get to import your objects the
require rubato activity just says I want
the robot oh the activity components of
Roboto and then and normally in Java
what you would do is you just say start
activity here you say start Roboto
activity and then this is the sort of
the next component of it the oncreate is
part of the life cycle of addict
activity when I fire up my activity I
don't actually say new activity and have
the object right in front of me I say I
want this activity and I have to wait
till it comes back so what Roboto does
is it just takes that block that you
called waits for the object to come back
and say okay I'm back and I'm here and
then it evaluates that block on the new
activity so now that new activity has an
on create which is just one of its
callbacks so during the the creation
process it says on create on start on
resume and I'm saying I want to do
something when this activity comes back
and creates itself and the only thing I
want to do is I want to throw up a
textview and put some code in it and so
when I evaluate that it throws up a text
view says domo arigato that's because
that's what when charlie did his first
blog post about Roboto he said domo
arigato mr. Roboto so and then I touched
it so I get a click event which is
interpreted right here in a procedure
and it just says change the text okay so
all I'm using there is the activity
framework slightly more complexed is the
second one which says it's not really
that fun to write that code
where I take a view and I have to
continually call back into it so part of
the widget framework for Roboto is to
take a whole bunch of pieces of
information and pass them into that new
text view that I want to create so in
this particular case on my on create I'm
doing something a little bit more
complex I'm I'm creating a bunch of
different visual objects and I want to
just lay them out on the screen I want
that to have them flow correctly on the
screen and then I want to create a bunch
of those those text views so when I
evaluate that it comes back up with the
four of them evenly spaced and then
again interprets the the click events
okay it's not that complex it's just
showing you that the the widget process
is trying to streamline it a little bit
for you
okay so you call the layout you call let
you stick a layout inside it you I
created a separate method call because
I'm going to create the same textview
over and over again so I just do that in
a single place and that text using the
most complex I have to tell it how to
layout I have to tell it what size the
text is I have to change the text back
and forth and so I'm doing that all here
in the onclicklistener and it's really
the the magic of JRuby that is taking
that procedure and just turning it into
an interface okay
so here's a slightly more complex one in
this particular case the thing that we
have to do here differently is JRuby can
handle an interface that has a single
method on it but as soon as you have an
interface that has three or four methods
on it you can't just handle that with a
procedure so this is what we one of the
things we had to do with the rubato
project was we had to in every case
where we wanted to use an Android object
that needed to call that we wanted to
pass control back into JRuby we needed
to subclass it and then we needed to
allow the Ruby side to register a
particular procedure that it wanted to
run when a particular thing happened so
in this case it's actually gone off the
screen there a little bit so let me in
this case it's importing a surfaceview
for the camera it's an object that
that's going to display the camera
information for us and it has a couple
of different callbacks and one of those
callbacks is right here on surface view
created on surface surface for you
destroyed and those are going to set up
the camera activities for us but they're
gonna pass control back to us so when
the activity is created it does an on
create block so it can set up its
interface and its interface it sets up
that surface view it sets up this click
listener what do I want to do when the
person touches this surface and
configures it a little bit and then down
here as soon as the surface is created
it calls in and it opens up the camera
gets control the camera so if I again
evaluate that code
okay it brings up my camera again it's
not showing that is it okay well then
you're gonna have to look at it this way
and it allows me to touch the screen it
takes the picture stuffs it back into
the into the system but now that's
something I've controlled so it doesn't
have all the extra controls around the
camera like auto focusing and things
like that but if you wanted to build
your own camera application you could do
it another one of those that needs some
additional work to it is the surface
view for the opengl process so again we
tell it we tell the application I need
you to create a surface view for me it's
subclasses that or creates an instance
or class that implements that interface
and now we can interact with it so
Roboto does all that for you what we had
to do though to do this is we had to
look at the entire Android API and map
it so it's basically through Roboto it's
stuffed into an XML file and when you
say I want to create a subclass of this
particular object or an instance of this
particular object it has to go out there
and figure out what are all the possible
methods that you might want to subclass
and be able to call on and then you can
control which ones you actually
implement this is a little bit more
complex but to do this all I did was
went to the standard Android demos and
said I want to see something spinning
around on the screen I found one of
their demos that did this and I just
converted it over to fit in our format
but it's pretty much their code and so
when you evaluate I'm hoping this will
show on the screen yeah okay so that's
calling back over I haven't done any
timing on it but it's calling back over
into the JRuby process into the script
every time and the JRuby script is
updating it so it's still pretty pretty
snappy it's getting a decent you know
framerate response here and just
spinning those around so clearly you can
do a decent amount
the biggest limitation is really more on
startup and not necessarily on the
ongoing spending I'm not saying you want
to write a third person shooter and in
Ruby but you can do a significant amount
of graphics in it okay and then
switching off of that for a minute
a couple of things that you get on a
mobile device right you get the the
hyper connectivity of having you know
broadband Wi-Fi NFC Bluetooth all kinds
of different ways that you can
communicate around you into the outside
world and then you get a whole array of
sensors you get your GPS as you get your
your accelerometers there's a reason
that they're taking these devices and
strapping them to Rockets and sending
them up into space because normally
you'd have to spend millions of dollars
designing the equipment that is now in
your phone and you just tap all those
sensors so in this particular case all I
was going to do is evaluate evaluate the
last known location and I don't know
because this tablet's brand new whether
it actually has a last known location
but I think it just took us to third
street hopefully and took us to engine
yard headquarters so I took the location
that I could get from the sensors and
passed those sent the same tag that I
sent before but said bring me to this
longitude and latitude okay and then
finally and do a little voice
recognition this again fires up an
intent the intent sets up the the speech
recognition says what it wants to do and
then fires off that speech recognition
intent and then gets the call back so
when the person's done speaking and the
processing is done on that language
sends it back in on this on activity
result callback engine yard San
Francisco okay so again tells me it's
searching for Engine Yard in San
Francisco displays that information and
you can actually see it's a little bit
small on the screen here but it comes
back with actually an array of options
for you the first one I just take the
first one so it comes back and says
Engine Yard San Francisco it also says
an Union San Francisco engineer San
Francisco Engine Yard San Francisco and
you New York San Francisco so these are
the different possibilities but the
first possibility is the strongest
possibility so I just took that and
punched it in and said to the to the
mapping program take me there
wherever whatever it got okay so this is
just showing you you can access all of
these things all right so I'm just
trying to run through a little bit of
the demo to show how a little bit of
script can access the different
components of Android and then what
happens so a little bit more complex
activity is this JRuby meetup demo
activity what this is going to do for me
is it's actually going to load up a list
display a list of options in this case
list of possible demos when I click on
it it's then going to pull up that demo
and when I evaluate it it's going to run
that demo so this is an application
that's pretty much got sort of those
three layers so when I when I run this
activity okay it comes up with my list
this is just the same list of demos that
I was running before but it went out
found them in the file system and built
a list and stuffed it in there and so
now if I click on any one of these just
because I like seeing cubes spinning I
can click on that it pulls up a textview
or an edit text view with that
information in it you could make a
change to it and then you can evaluate
and it runs it so it's running it inside
of the context of the application that I
just put up there okay so before from
here I was just saying there's this
there's a script out there run it in
this case I'm running a script that's
loading a list of scripts that's showing
you that script and then evaluating that
it's checking to see if you changed
anything and just going ahead and
evaluating it it's doing that all all
inside of JRuby okay so that's
interesting you can run these little
scripts but ultimately IRB is going to
be limiting to you if you want to ship
an application out to the market you
need something more so let me show you
how you do that so I'm going to close
out of the IRB server and I'm gonna
switch over to this computer for a
minute so the first thing you need is
you need to set up your environment and
let me just show you what that entails
so if you want to run what's now we're
into getting into Roberta or about oak
or you need a couple of things in your
environment you need to you need Java
you need the JDK you need ant you need
Ruby of some kind at this point it
doesn't care if it's JRuby because it's
gonna get it JRuby from somewhere else
Ruby gems and rake then you need to load
down the Android SDK and all the
different platforms so through the
Android SDK gives you some development
tools but then it also allows you to
pick all of the different platform
levels from well they probably have them
all out there anymore but down from 1.5
up to 3.2 and so you load those down and
then ultimately where you're going to be
telling Roboto is what platforms do I
want to deploy on you never deploy on a
single platform you want to deploy a
cross platform so you have to tell robot
oh I want to deploy from Android level 7
up to Android level 12 and Roboto has to
figure out what's available to you and
if there's a conflict you have to tell
it then do I want to include this
particular callback or not
on our on our website you can get the
full walkthrough of how you do the
installation but that's pretty much a
script right there
that would take you from a fresh ubuntu
install to being able to compile it your
Roboto code so it's just downloading all
those different components okay so
that's pretty much what I've got here is
I've got a virtual machine here running
with with Roo bunshu in the background
here so I got 4 gigs dedicated to that
and the first thing to do is switch back
over to the demo wiki because that's got
all the code that you would need to run
so it's got the setup information there
but this code right here is the code
that you would run let me zoom in on
that bit is the code that you would run
to generate the Roboto app so at the
command line you say Roboto app generate
you get a package name it can assume the
name of your of your application from
the package name you tell it the target
API levels or it'll just assume them and
you tell it the target one and you tell
it the minimum one and so it can look at
that whole that whole range so I'm just
going to run that
okay so it's generated your application
now all right
it loaded everything it needed in there
including the Roboto RB scripts it
generated on click listeners have
generated your Roboto activity which is
a subclass of activity a subclass of
service a subclass of broadcast receiver
subclass of view these are all things
that are now available to you if you
want to use them in your application
okay so I can switch into this new
application and and rake debug it now
something actually brand-new just within
the last couple of weeks before what it
did when we did that build is it
actually took J relief from the JRuby
jars gem and put a version of JRuby in
in your path here and then it had to
compile that in and it ended up
generating about a 10 megabyte
application even if it was a small
script it was a 10 megabyte application
and that was pretty much JRuby and a
standard line so now what we've done in
the last couple of weeks is we've been
able to separate that out so now the
application that's generated is just
your stuff and then it can pull from the
market the core the core which has JRuby
in it and has the standard library in it
so that's the bulk of the package but it
can then be reused by different
applications so if I copy this newly
generated app and I just put it over in
my Dropbox
okay then I can come over to Dropbox
over here the reason I'm not hooked up
to this is so I can so I can hook the
the tablet up to the screen there I
can't also hook into it
but normally you could just transfer it
over directly so here's the JRuby meetup
demo debug and it was generated 10
seconds ago I can install that and in
and of itself it's so installs it it
acts asked me to go to the market and
install the core piece it finds it come
on
okay takes a second
okay so it's detected it and the
application that I put down there which
is just the default application that we
generate just comes up with a button
allows you to click on that button so
that's just the default application
doesn't really give us anything but it
just shows that it's working so the next
thing we need to do is I go back to the
wiki and look at what's there it says I
need to copy my my demo scripts over so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take that last application I showed you
that took the list of demos and ran them
and I'm going to compile that into our
application so I need all those demo
scripts into my applications so if I
sorry I'm not a typist
that's not going to do this for me I
need to make
so I make an assets directory which is
where it's going to hold things and I
copy copy the demos in there the next
thing I need to do since it generated a
base activity but I can show you here if
I open the
the source directory it generated a
JRuby meetup demo activity and that's
just the default activity that's of
course not what I really want so I'm
gonna just copy the script it's gonna be
the same script that we ran on the on
the device JRuby meetup demo and I'm
gonna stick that into source okay so
that's getting my scripts inline the
next thing I need to do well I've
already got this in there I have one
other script which is just gonna say
what this application is cuz otherwise
it wouldn't really speak for itself and
then two of those demos that we ran
actually needed additional objects
generated IRB had those objects already
generated inside them but here's those
two activities so I need that surface
holder Android View surface holder and
I'm going to make a new Roboto object
called Roboto surface holder and I've
got the same thing for the GL surface
view so if I take those and generate
them it loads up the Android API it
figures out what methods it needs to
implement since their interfaces there's
not a lot to decide it has to implement
all the all the methods in those
interfaces there's no differences if
there were problems like in a particular
version there was a new method added it
would probably have to flag that and say
do you want to well with an interface
that doesn't have a choice but if it was
a class so for example when we're
generating the subclasses of activity it
needs to decide do I add all the new
stuff that was added in in the last
version because that's going to crash it
on earlier versions so it makes some
assumptions on those but it gives you
that flexibility that's right to do that
for both objects and while it's doing
that the other thing that I need to open
up is my manifest so it generates the
default manifest for me
okay but I need some permissions right
the basic application in Android doesn't
give you any permissions I need
permission to the get to the camera I
need permission to get to the file
system I need permission to get to the
the network and a Wi-Fi state so I'm
again gonna just copy a new version of
that and I'm just gonna copy it right
here okay so if I open that again what
it's done is it's added the permission
to the inner Internet the location the
network the camera and I've done one
other thing there which is I've told it
to to allow the application to handle
the orientation change because the way
the Android was set up initially to me
is kind of stupid
if you reoriented the device it reloaded
the activity and so that would that can
cause us some problems but nowadays they
allow you to say hey I don't want that
pretty good behavior okay so we've got
our permissions we've changed the
orientation the next thing I need to do
if I'm actually going to put this thing
on the market is I need to generate a
key
so I need to sign the application
okay so generated the key for me so now
it's given me what I need to put it into
the market I'm gonna copy one more thing
which is a set of build properties which
are a lot which allows it to just sign
the application in the build process and
now I'm going to say
okay
okay so it's built the application I can
copy it again
okay seven seconds ago see if it allows
me to install it does the previous one
was a debug build application that stuff
okay
all my son's games loaded on here
automatically since
oops
right
okay so it doesn't have to reload Roboto
core cuz it finds it this is the startup
slowness but now that's our application
that we just generated it has the list
it's pulling it out of the assets and
again we can make cubes spin but this is
now a fully packaged apk that can be put
out on the market I don't want to take
your time necessarily doing that right
at the moment but I can put it up on the
market this evening and it can be
available for download from anyone all
you have to do to put something up on
the market is take that apk you have to
have a market account cost $25 you
upload the apk you give it a couple of
pictures a couple screenshots and and
then maybe it might take an hour or two
to clear through the market before
people will start seeing it on the
devices this would be available on
devices from from seven which is two
point I think that's 2.0 or two point
one and up okay so where are we in this
whole project there are some there are
some sort of things we haven't tackled
yet you saw the startup speed there took
a little while for it to go not huge but
five ten seconds and if you're loading
up a lot of objects it's gonna take even
longer
that's something Charley's looked into
hasn't had a chance to tackle although
he tweeted something about it the other
day that he he's working on this is the
same sort of JRuby start up speed but
when you put it on slower Hardware we
got some stack limitations that's
because Android limits the amount of
stack space that you have and in most
cases that's not a problem but JRuby is
a little bit more of a stack hog as it's
never had to worry about it before so
calling from one block into another
block or embedding blocks there you
could lose 20 frames in your stack and
so sooner or later you run out of stack
space the main place that you're going
to hit this is either in parsing your
your your Ruby code or in embedding
widgets if you're building a a UI
the the wonder when you're loading code
is really easy to solve because you can
wrap it in a thread and and just load it
in the background and you can specify
how much stack space you want the only
one that you don't have the only thread
that you don't have control over the
stack space is the UI thread and so
that's really where the problem comes in
app size is still pretty big if you want
to put it out there yourself if you want
to share the core with other
applications then the application is
really tiny
you have to ultimately would like to be
able to compile Ruby so that any of the
speed issues would go away we can
compile it but right now it's just a
little bit too big and we'd love to be
able to generate bytecode so that you
didn't have to do this whole negotiation
problem with where you could just
generate a subclass of a Java and you
know build it on the fly and build it in
your script but we can't do that yet and
then also we had to build an XML
specification for the whole Android API
so that we could figure out what those
callbacks were so that we could generate
subclasses of them there are other
libraries that somebody might want to
use other libraries they might want to
bring in other libraries like the Google
Maps library which is a separate library
or even the new compatibility library
just there just other libraries that
might also have callbacks that we want
to control so that's sort of where we
are and those are the things that we're
still tackling so if you're interested
in getting involved or using the project
provided out org points to everything
else the Google group is pretty much
where we talk about issues or where
we're going what's coming up and then
github has both the IRB and course that
you can download those play around with
them build them yourself tweak them add
things to them it's also where the
issues are and the wiki's are the one
other demo that I kind of wanted to do
for you but I just didn't get it under
control for today was there's a good
demo up there for if you want to bundle
use bundler to take some Ruby gems with
you into your applique
I was going to do it by taking Jason and
and the meetup gem bringing them in and
then I could hit the hit the meetup API
and pull in the information for example
about the people that said they were
going to be here this evening so you
could you can do that you can bundle
gems they've got a demonstration up
there about how to make active record
and run on there I don't necessarily
suggest you do that because active
record is a little bit of a memory hog
and on a device this size it probably
doesn't make sense so if people wanted
to get involved obviously just picking
it up and using it in any way shape or
form
pressing on different areas of the of
the APK tackling different features
bringing in different gems and seeing
what works obviously it's a the android
api is a huge api and there's a lot that
i haven't even gone in and explored in
most cases when I go in to explore
things you know I can figure out a way
to make it work not necessarily the way
you would do it in Java ultimately if
there are things that you can't do in
Ruby like you can't build the XML and
then compile it in you can still do
those things over in Java you can just
you can put an XML file to specify your
UI and then compile it you can you can
do half of your application and Java on
the other half and Ruby however you want
to do it my my goal has always been I'd
rather never have to after I compile the
application the first time I'd like to
do everything else you know we're just
updating scripts every once a while you
need to compile images or other things
in there other libraries okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
