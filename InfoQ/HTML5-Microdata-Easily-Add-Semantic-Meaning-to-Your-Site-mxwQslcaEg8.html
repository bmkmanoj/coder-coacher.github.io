GN entertainment and I want to thank cos
Inge and Marikana and everybody for
inviting me to put this on for you guys
so let's begin obviously my website is
Michael a tulip calm at Michael a tulip
is the twitter handle okay the hashtag
this evening is going to be html5 md ok
for microdata right now so why the
Semantic Web and you know why is it
important the Semantic Web is a term
coined by tim berners-lee and you know I
think we all know it's it's it's it's
the web of linked data and it it
potentially has the the possibility of
creating some pretty awesome
applications in the near future so
there's been a lot of debate around it
but the case is once we have the
Semantic Web in place it'll be a lot
easier for machines to understand the
web and the information on the web and
we can you know produce some pretty
awesome things from that sort of thing
here's a quote from tim berners-lee the
Semantic Web is not a separate web but
an extension of the current one in which
information is given well defined
meaning better enabling computers and
people to work in cooperation okay and
that is actually an image of Tim
berners-lee that i found that looked
really awesome so i thought i'd put that
up there so basically the Semantic Web
is a web of data it's going to be a
machine-readable web so computers will
actually be able to understand and work
with the information and how things are
related it's going to enable automated
agents and it's going to allow us to
find share and combine easier we have
already F ow Michael
formats which are all pretty
standardized at this point and arrives
Micro data with html5 spec and there's a
lot of reasons why they went with
microdata and rdf a has not made it into
the html5 spec and we'll go into that
later on so why do we want to use
microdata it's easy to implement it's
similar to dom or javascript object and
it feels native to HTML and it also has
a Dom API that browsers can actually
implement and very easily where is
something like rdfa is very hard to
parse in that way so I want to get
straight in the mark-up I know a lot of
these meetups you know it's kind of
review and it gets boring or whatever
let's get into the the mark-up right
away all right um first of all you have
the item scope and itemprop attributes i
want to say here you can the beauty of
html5 microdata is that the item scope
and the item prof attributes can be used
in basically every HTML element so you
don't need to worry about can it be in
this tag or can it be in that tag it can
be in all the tags each name value pairs
of property and properties generally
have values that are strings and they
consists of group name value pairs which
are called items and as you can see here
some basic code you start with the item
scope to basically enable the system to
know that hey this is something to look
at itemprop name tells you the name here
obviously I put it in the header tag
itemprop is you know relating as well to
the description
the nationality and the image in the
code properties can have dates and times
so it's very simple to mark up the date
and time of events or anything of that
sort and make it machine readable in
such a way that's so easy and native to
HTML that it really takes no code at all
to add in you can see here you start
with the item scope obviously at the
beginning then you have the name and the
time which you know itemprop there is
birthday and you can see there that's
basically how it's done we can have
multiple properties with the same name
so basically you for instance here we
have the item scope the available
strains and you will see that it says
itemprop stringing twice okay because
basically we can use it multiple times
you know and it wouldn't make a
difference whatsoever properties that
are not descendants of the element this
is interesting but there's a way to mark
up with micro data that things are not
related as well so you can see here the
item ref is used in that case where
basically you can you know kind of say
hey this is not related to this even
though it's in the same scope basically
and that's that's really good you know
it's it's pretty easy to implement
multiple properties can be included in a
single item so if we can include
multiple properties and you can see here
favorite color favorite fruit you can
include in the same item prop and that
would be orange or you know in obviously
there's different cases where that might
be important
now the really the important stuff here
is micro data in context and you know
the way we give context is by loading
vocabularies and the way we do that is
through the item type and as you can see
here we start we do the item scope then
it goes into item type then you link off
to the vocabulary okay and this would be
you can make your own vocabulary you can
link off to other vocabularies it
wouldn't make a difference basically
what vocabulary of use here but
obviously you want it to be related in
the same scope so you have the name the
description and the image here of as we
put here the strain og cush it's got all
the information that the search engines
or anyone or art is going to need you
know to to read this information and you
know produce some pretty awesome stuff
in the search at search results so we
have global identifier for items which
is basically Votto vocabs and we can
give something like for instance an ISBN
number you know a URL that links it in
so it it nose basically that hey this is
bien number is this because the item
type is you know basically a global URL
with a loaded vocabulary in it that
could be used so obviously everything in
the item scope has to relate to you know
each other of course unless you know you
you want to define your own vocabulary
and the reason you would define your own
vocabulary is because what's available
isn't good enough for instance I work
with the medical cannabis industry and
there's really not a vocabulary yet for
us to use to you know pull off of so
this is something that I'm working on
but basically you can also well you want
to reuse existing libraries as much as
possible so we we don't necessarily have
to invent everything but you want to
make sure that you match up with other
vocabs so you don't have to create the
same thing and here you can see I've
basically linked to the vocabulary at
the top which is strains and the og cush
type and I've listed for the machines if
you will the name the description and
also colors that are associated with it
and also an image that is associated
with it so it's it's basically possible
to define a whole new vocabulary around
the subject that might not be currently
available on them on the web and this is
one example where in the near future
hopefully there will be a vocabulary to
pull from for the medical cannabis
industry here's an example of exactly
what the vocabulary would look like if
you were to create it you would have a
property and you have a value obviously
you can see in certain instances there
are links there because I'm linking off
to global identifiers that have already
been created so I don't have to reinvent
them but in other cases that might not
be the case so really the vocab specs
for micro data are all in data dash
vocabulary org and really that is where
you will finally information you need to
create your web apps or anything along
those lines and it's got the event
organisation person product review
review aggregate breadcrumb offer and
offer aggregate so we're going to start
off with an event alright and I this is
a little small for everyone to see here
but basically the vocabulary that you
would link to is data vocabulary dot org
slash event and that's all you would
need to do and all of the properties
that you see off on the left hand side
are mark or you can mark them up with
the item prop attribute so let me give
an example here and this is this is
obviously not very easy to see but you
can see I've kind of tried to highlight
the data vocabulary / event being in the
section tag at the very top and that's
kind of stating hey in this section this
is going to be about an event and you'll
see there the photo itemprop photo is
highlighted also itemprop URL for the
event the start date the end date the
location the street address the
geolocation etc etc he's asking what
other what other aspects will Micro data
effect in the near future other than
search engines basically so and in that
way it's going to enable us to create
kind of our own search engines in a way
where basically we can scan the web and
however manner we want to scan the web
scan the data off the web seeing it
perhaps in the format we want to see it
as opposed to have
see some awfully designed website or
something along those lines basically it
enables us to take all the information
of the web and you know out put it in
any way we want to output it so if we
want to output it in graphs or images or
however we want to do it it's going to
be possible the only way we can do that
currently is by adding context and
adding the semantics to the pages you
know and the future that might be
different all right well you can see
here this is the page that's actually
being marked up currently all right and
currently the Green Cross is holding a
Japanese earthquake fundraiser on April
12 899 I'm sorry 730 it shouldn't say
you got 7 30 29 30 and basically if we
can see in the keynote here basically
you know everything here is listed you
have the start date the end time
everything so and it's not hard at all
to include in the page to basically make
that machine readable now how do you
test this data okay and that's kind of
where you know we come to a point where
html5 microdata is really not
implemented currently by anyone or any
major CMS or anything along those lines
so the only real support is Google and
obviously being a search marketing
person I do what Google does and
generally this tool is really where it's
at so if you'll see here the the data
that's being pulled if I put in the URL
you'll actually be able to see down
below that it says Japanese earthquake
fundraiser event the date the
organization it's
associated with and kind of stand out a
little bit in the search engines so
basically from a web usability
standpoint this is important you'll see
here is what the extracted data is on
the page that Google has actually pulled
and you'll see that immediately they
they say type and it's the event type it
pulled the photo it pulled the URL of
the event it pulled the summary the
start date the end date it in an
embedded location item I'm sorry a
nested and a description the event type
and then the nested data here is the
organization which is you know San
Francisco Americans for safe access and
there's two other nested items here
which is the address of the location
which you can see the data vocabulary
org slash address and then down here the
nested item three is the data vocabulary
org slash geo is the actual geo location
of the event and obviously this this
does something for the search engine
because you can see the data and how it
might look to someone pulling it up but
feasibly with an application you could
extract this kind of data and really
have a good idea of what is on the page
whereas before that wasn't really
possible next we're going to move on to
the organization which there's only five
properties named URL address telephone
and the geolocation and here we're going
to use you know basically an example
code from a website that I did where I'm
trying to list all of the dispensaries
in San Fran
cup and currently I think there's about
twenty four of them so you'll see that I
immediately create the scope of the
organization and I list the name the
address and the phone number and also
the geo location coordinates and the
URLs of that organization so if we
actually go to the site we can see kind
of what you know what exactly the data
is you know what the human see is here
ok so the human sees this fantastic web
application they don't even know what's
going on on the back end for the
machines and if we go over and we go to
the rich snippet currently unfortunately
Google does not support organizations
and Rich Snippets but we can still see
all the data that's being pulled from
the 23 dispensaries so for the first
time in history we have a complete list
marked up in microdata of all the
cannabis dispensaries in San Francisco
and you know I don't really know what
what Google can do with this information
this is more or less something that
would be good for an application maybe
somebody who wanted to pull the data
from the page to create a map or
whatever of all the dispensaries so
basically you can see I've marked up
every single one there's quite a bit so
there's a lot more dispensaries than
McDonald's or Burger King or anything
like that so if you'll notice you don't
see those around very much we're
basically in order to get this
recognized by Google you're supposed to
submit it to Google okay and there's
actually a URL for that
and you're supposed to let them know
basically because they don't they don't
go out searching for this kind of stuff
basically we have to submit this to them
and say hey take a look at what we did
here and obviously they give us feedback
if something wasn't wrong was wrong or
you know whatever whatever would happen
I think that's kind of how it works so
you do have to submit the site or the
URL that has the rich snippet data on it
there's you know that's easy to do and
but right now they don't support
organizations unfortunately and the Rich
Snippets but that will probably change
soon you'll see addresses or whatever
you see down at the bottom so um but
we'll move on to person and actually
Peter lovers who just asked the question
he's going to feature in this one
basically you know we have a bunch of
properties named nick name photo title
role URL affiliation friend contact
acquaintances and address now obviously
i'm not going to list Peter lubbers
address here but I I have basically
marked up a page and you can see I start
by announcing its a person the name of
the person he's into ultra running and I
got a photo I put his title as the
senior director of html5 documentation
and training at kazeem and I even wrote
a little description which you know
makes him look very very good I hope and
you know I've also even included a URL
here to his blog post now when we pull
up the page in the rich snippet tool
you'll see um they've pulled out the
data that he's the senior director of
html5 documentation and training from
cuisine corporation so that's basically
the extent of how Google's supporting it
but you can see that they've actually
pulled quite a bit of data from the
age and including the title description
his URL and so forth and also there's
some organization data at the bottom as
well but basically this is easy to do
everyone should have a marked up page
like this and Peter will have it shortly
so very good so we're going to move on
to product which is obviously important
for variety reasons of making money as
obviously why people get hired most of
the time so we have brand category
description name image review identifier
and I don't even know what that says
says offer details that's right so here
we have an example product and it's also
going to include a nested review and a
nested offer so it's kind of like the
full scope here but basically I announce
at the top its data vocabulary it's a
product the brand is going to be the
Green Cross and the name is going to be
purple urkle which I don't know who is
there any purple urkle fans here no yeah
all right that's good all right so I've
linked off to the image of that which is
of course you know very beautiful image
and I've listed a little description of
the strain as well and you know which
category it's in so I've said it's in
cannabis it's an indica and you know
basically let the machines know hey this
is this is pretty good because you'll
see here obviously I've put the product
number which is 420 conveniently and
then I've listed the review aggregate
here for this product which of course
I've listed as five stars with a hundred
reviews all right so you know that's
that's that and then below that you have
the next
did offer which I link to and then
you'll see I have the price listed when
the sale begins when the sale ends ok
who's the seller at the sale if the
condition of the item is new or used and
also if it's available so if we click
over here to the rich snippet tool we
can actually see what's going to be
produced by the gist that data there ok
you'll see it produced the five stars
which of course stands out it says it's
in stock and it's only thirty dollars so
you know that sounds like a pretty good
deal and if you'll see I basically down
below here you can all the data here and
the nested items and so forth so even
though it might not all show up in
Google there is a lot more data there
that can be pulled ok so you know
there's definitely the possibility to
make some awesome applications with that
we'll move on to the review all right
which is pretty simple this is kind of
like your Yelp situation or whatever
you're dealing with you're going to need
to mark that up alright so item reviewed
rating reviewer you know date review the
description and the summary those are
pretty much what you got to work with
here and you'll see I've marked it up
obviously I've linked off to the review
vocabulary and you know the item
reviewed and who the reviewer was and
all that stuff so let's go straight to
the rich snippet tool and see how Google
took it and you'll see this the green
cross here obviously is being reviewed
by the stoned prophet and the date is
april 2010 so all that data is right
there ok so and you can see down below
they even have a summary the description
all that kind of stuff so you know it's
there's a lot more data than what Google
is presenting here next we're going to
go on to the review aggregate which is
obviously more of a summary of all the
reviews as opposed to just a single
review by the stone profit so we have
item reviewed rating count votes summary
obviously linked off to that vocabulary
at the top the item reviewed is the
Green Cross they even let you put a
photo on this one so we linked off to
the photo for the logo the rating is the
vocabulary for the rating is there and
you can see it goes down to the votes
which is another part of the vocabulary
now let's put this in the rich snippet
tool all right so you'll see here
they've got a fantastic rating according
to this tool so 200 reviews 5 stars and
there's even an image there obviously it
should be you know it should be custom
for this system but nonetheless you can
see that a logo was actually pulled up
there on the search result page which
obviously is going to draw people's
attention to it and you know you can see
the data very simple the bows the count
you know what the average is I put 10
out of 10 you know because obviously I
have reasons for that next we're going
to move on to the breadcrumbs which I
don't know if you guys know about bread
crumbs but you know it's it's it's
pretty important it looks really good at
the bottom of your website on the search
results so you know there's only three
properties title URL and child and it's
very very simple to implement so
everyone should do it you can see I'm
basically breadcrumb in for this
japan fundraiser we're having and we'll
pull it up and the rich snippet tool
here and you'll actually see breadcrumbs
right here they could click on that they
can click on this or they can just go
right in an RSVP right away right out of
the search results no one had to go to
the website and wait for it to load or
any of that so you know it basically
makes it a lot more convenient for the
user for a variety of reasons and you
know I think it works so that's kind of
a breadcrumb seen all right the data
vocabulary offer we kind of already went
over it was in slide 27 which you know
all these slides are going to be posted
so you guys can review them and you know
basically you've got the price the
currency you know what how long the
price is valid until the seller the
condition the availability the offer URL
the identifier and you know the item
offered itself so next you have the
offer aggregate okay and this is
obviously aggregate of all your offers
it's not not just a single one and the
property's low price high price currency
offer count condition availability offer
URL identifier an item offered here i
have an example product offer aggregate
so it's basically got the best of both
worlds here alright so i start with the
product which this time we're going to
go with the green crosses blue dreams
which is great i'm going to link off to
an image of it and then I've got the
review right there aggregate basically
saying you know based on 5 reviews that
this place is such and such stars you
know it's it's pretty simple and then
the offer details below you can list you
know low price high price the currency
that kind of thing and then the magic
happens in the search results okay as
you'll see the five hundred five star
reviews are right here and also you see
the price range of the product which is
35 to 275 and you can see the the data
pulled the vocabularies that have been
called and how that all kind of mashes
up in google's mind anyway next we're
going to talk a little bit about SEO and
obviously we've gone over this a little
bit already but you know I want to
welcome you guys to the machine okay
because basically it's coming it's
becoming that right now so if you guys
don't jump on board you're going to be
left behind it's not going to be fun so
basically we want everything to be
machine readable for a variety of
reasons for SEO reasons it would mean
that the search engines can extract the
data and do stuff with it as you've been
seeing all evening we can show more data
we can show better data in the search
results and you know humans that benefit
also because we can actually access
these applications which is which pulls
that data so and also we were going over
some of the web usability benefits the
stuff is right there in the search
results they don't even have to go to
the website so and better search results
so you know that should be important I
don't know if you guys are you know
aware but people were complaining about
Google having a lot of spam in it but
you know hopefully they'll resolve that
with you know implementations like this
so a little bit about Google's algorithm
it's very hard to be ahead of them but
they're stupid if they don't include
machine readable data higher in the
results okay so basically if they're not
doing it yet they're going to do it soon
so you probably want to get on board
before the algorithm changes you know
that kind of thing it's going to be a
web of people places and things plus
relationships so it's very important we
all linked together with the global data
cloud and these vocabularies and so
forth I think you're going to have you
know them ranking you higher because
they know that they have the right data
and they know they have it in context so
basically if anyone from Google's here
or whatever you know basically you guys
need to make sure you put this in your
algorithm soon because you know it'll
help everyone out i have a feeling when
to and when not to use microdata all
right and I put two galaxies crashing
together because there's a little bit of
conflict around this whole situation not
everything works in microdata certain
things of RDF is still a better solution
so you know limitations include not
being able to use a blank note as an
object and you can't express RDF triples
using data types or XML literals okay
and that's that's pretty big so it's not
good for all use cases but for most of
the simple case cases it's it's very
much where we should go because its
native RDF triples can however be
expressed by using the about type to
give the subject of the name value pair
and I've basically put up a code from
the dev w3 where they have implemented
rdf inside of microdata and it's
obviously it's a looks a little bit more
complex than microdata does but like I
was saying in certain instances you
might need to use rdf so you know
there's a variety of ways you can work
around it i'm also there's an example
from philip Hagen stet down below of the
phone and
you might do foth inside of micro data
so it's not it's not out of the realm of
possibilities they have in the spec
given everything you need to convert
microdata into rdf algorithmically so
i'm going to refer you guys over to
section 5.2 on that link i didn't do it
but i assume it's easy to accomplish
because they have the whole thing
written out step by step on how to do it
so if there was ever a need or a want to
extract the Micro data from the page and
export it as RDF they have everything
already done so you can just follow it
step by step basically and it's not too
difficult you know we can also turn
microdata to json all right which is
javascript object notation and i put an
awesome little grafter i think that's
something to do with ruby as well but
basically we can extract microdata to
json form and it's a simple algorithm to
implement the result must be an empty
object we have to let items be an empty
array and when node a node you always
have to check for that top-level item
okay so and the benefit of microdata
this is one of the big benefits is that
it's so much easier to convert to json
than rdfa okay rdf a very difficult
apparently i haven't done it but that's
what I've heard so basically I've listed
here the whole algorithm it's just
literally like ten steps you implement
this I've linked off to the top and you
can extract all the data off the page
right into a JSON form so not difficult
at all to accomplish
microdata and rdfa has some controversy
around it basically rdfa didn't make it
into the html5 spec and I say yet
because it's not completed yet so we
don't know if it's going to make it in
but my assumption is it's not going to
make it in because there's too much
fighting going on so it's probably not
going to make it the argument is triples
can't be expressed in HTML okay and that
it's not feasible so you know there's a
good case to have it but there's also a
very good case against it and basically
a solution has been drawn up so kind of
similar in the way that XHTML was
handled where there's an rdf a implement
and an XHTML implement and how they work
together and a paper on that so what
might end up being the solution here is
html5 spec and then an RDF face back on
how to embed rdfa in html5 but I don't
think that it's going to actually make
the spec microdata was meant to be used
in place of our DFA because its native
so the RDF people were not happy at all
and that started happening I can
guarantee that and that's why they've
been fighting to put it in html5 because
they feel like they're going to be
defunct it's going to be like the nail
in the coffin for the RDF community or
rdfa the good thing about rdfa it's been
tested a hell of a lot more than
microdata has so and it also has real
working systems like drupal implementing
the technology right now so it's used
it's tested there's a variety of reasons
already fa is very good and this you
know these int this infighting that's
been going on is really been affecting
the adoption of semantic technologies
because people in the know are basically
taking a wait-and-see approach let's see
how they work this out
and they're really you know not
implementing it so especially microdata
so we're seeing very little
implementation of this because of that
and everyone's kind of waiting and
seeing okay what are they going to do
about rdfa and you know basically Google
is like the core of microdata and it
spreads from there all right so they're
like the big supporters of it you know
rdfa or microdata well it didn't make it
an html5 we're pretty much say that at
this point there's a quote from a guy at
opera there HTML is not a triple store
rdfa began in the now-defunct XHTML 2
point 0 which has been cancelled so you
know oh well for certain cases which
microdata will not solve your problem
such as those discussed earlier you
should implement rdfa instead because
you should use native html5 when you can
all right you shouldn't be having if
it's a simple thing like an event you
shouldn't have to go and use a different
technology should just use html5 to do
it and that's kind of its it's going to
be a lot faster and a variety of other
things so where do we go from here with
microdata and I put you know obviously
we had the nuclear explosion that was
you know pretty dramatic now we have the
opposite so basically we want peace we
want harmony we want the RDF and the
microdata people to come together and
everybody to be happy okay that that
would be the goal okay so let's relax a
little bit all right the html5 spec is
coming to a close very soon I don't know
if you guys get emails from them but I
do and it's I don't know if it's on the
verge of annoying but I get them like
late at night and at random times and if
you haven't turned off your you know
sound thing it can be really annoying so
you know we know microdata is in the
spec so we can start implementing it
rdfa might not make it but you know
basically we can assume that there's
going to be a paper written on how to
implement rdfa
in html5 after the spec has been read
I've linked off to the overview of the
whole spec which is great Ian Hickson
over at Google he's in control I listed
his email here if you guys have any
direct questions you want a ski and he's
probably I've emailed with him so he's
probably the guy you want to talk to
he's the true spec creator and you know
I also linked off to all the technical
reports on the document and of course
Yoda here enjoying himself here's some
of the resources i used which you know
obviously data vocabulary org is the
primary one I you know you feasibly see
how you could link off to a different
vocabulary it wouldn't be all that
difficult but you know Google supports
this one so i pretty much am with them
at this point for a variety of reasons
linked off to the testing tool and some
of the blogs about the controversy
between rdfa and microdata and the spec
and also about Rich Snippets and
introducing Rich Snippets and all these
links here at Google at the bottom are
going to take you to that page you need
to submit the data to Google with so
basically there you know it'll say do
you have something to submit you just
hit submit and they can then look at the
data and they might might they don't
always but they might put it in the
search results okay and you know that is
always a good thing that's that's the
presentation so if you guys have any
questions this is this is the time to do
it I suppose you were basically saying
what are the state of the options here
you know we've got microformats we've
got we've got already f we've got
microdata you know which is better well
microformats have a lot of problems okay
I think they utilize the class attribute
a lot which can become a problem when
you're trying to parse the data so
and it has like in I microformats can be
really good for certain use cases but
they're not good for seriously complex
situations at times because they have
too many classes and you know it can get
really confusing rdf is very complicated
you'd basically a lot of the people
working in the industry I know or like
ontology and brilliant phd's and so
forth so and when they all get together
and have a good time I mean they come up
with these super boring documents and
you know it's it's not fun um so rdf is
you know it's kind of i wouldn't call it
it's hard all right it's not easy and
it's not easily adoptable by the
majority of web developers whereas
something like microdata is easy okay
it's native to HTML there's nothing
really new you have to learn it but like
I said it's not good for certain use
cases if you need a blank note or you
know you need certain things that are DF
has you're going to have to use it but
in most cases like products and reviews
I mean we're talking about like ninety
percent of the web like you know you
don't need anything but microdata at
this point and that's kind of where I'm
saying its native yes he's asking what
elements can't it be used in it and I
basically have not found anything yet
that has given me an error thrown an
error to the Google rich snippet tool so
you know you can use in a tag any tag it
doesn't matter what tag it is so
basically I haven't found it yet but I'm
sure someone will eventually he's asking
he's basically saying hey you know in
the rich snippet data we see a lot of
you know flowery sentences and
especially in the descriptions so forth
and basically let's just say that you
can't we can't parse that easily yet you
know and make sense of it but at least
we know it's a description of this item
and you know so basically I don't know
you know how how that's a lot more in
depth but basically this is the start
where basically we at least know hey
this is
the items name this is the description
here's the reviews we can do a lot with
that data certainly if we could take all
the data in the descriptions and
everything and produce like whole new
documents and stuff that would be
awesome but I don't know if we're
capable yet of that we might have the
processing power but I don't know if we
have the software capability yet to do
that so um you know that's certainly a
possibility how long will it be until
microdata is really going to be
implemented I think we got to wait until
the spec is done of the html5 spec and I
think that's going to be done in like a
month or two I mean they're they're
saying last call on all the emails i'm
getting so they're going through the
last call right now so basically if you
guys have any problems with the spec
this is the time to complain okay
because it's about to be finished and
we're going to wait till HTML 6 which
you know I don't know when that's going
to be finished so you know basically if
you want in you got to start like
listening in now well it's been a
pleasure speaking to you guys great
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
