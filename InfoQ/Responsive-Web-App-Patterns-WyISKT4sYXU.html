couple things today
actually a few things tonight we're
gonna kind of combine a couple
presentations that I would usually give
with someone else but I am here so
you're gonna see me do some live code
and you're gonna see my fat fingers
which is gonna be fun for you and we're
first gonna start off by talking a
little bit about kind of responsive web
app patterns you know kind of the
hurdles and challenges we learned while
building this thing called foundation
for apps so I I'm from Missouri I'm
Brandon is anyone we know serve at all
at all in the room or a couple people
all right yeah Daniel does all right
cool what we like to tell people is were
a t-shaped
team app right designers who help grow
businesses but all but what you guys
know is we make these things we make
some products called foundation
foundation started I think like three
and a half years ago as a front-end
framework for building awesomely
responsive websites and from there has
grown into a few other things the thing
this little little adorable chubby guy
right here that I probably relate to
more to him than this guy that's okay is
his foundation for sites initiative
recites is a great framework for
building responsive websites it's it's
not very opinionated but just
opinionated enough to get the point
across and lets you style everything you
need on your own about last year about a
year and a half ago we branched out and
created this thing called ink which is
now being rebranded as a foundation for
email so you know not that ever built
responsive or just a an HTML email ever
and like how many of you just cried and
cried and cried because tables are the
absolute worst foundation for email
helps you kind of it's a framework for
building those emails more efficiently
so it has a particular man buttons and a
lot of crazy wacky things and we're
doing a lot of neat things in the next
month or so that we're gonna push out or
two months or so that's gonna have
templating language for it and it's
going to be a really fun you know extra
addition to that framework we also have
a thing we launched about four or five
months ago called foundation for apps
it's for building responsive web apps so
we we we had done websites we had looked
at email and then we were
the foundation reserved by itself is
mainly a studio so we do a lot of MVPs
for a lot of startups and clients and
you know enterprise that wants to act
more like a startup and all that good
stuff and we notice okay we're building
a lot of web apps on kind of this weird
little sites framework and there's lot
of patterns that don't necessarily
translate so we decided to give a shot
at creating a whole nother thing here so
yeah we really were building web apps on
a framework meant for sites we realize
that different projects needed different
types of solutions right so a website is
often kind of a fixed-width in the
middle there it has a navigation on the
top right there's probably if you look
at 90% of web sites right now there's
probably like a hero we manage that
takes up a big chunk of the top with
some really thin próxima Nova in the
middle or whatever but web apps have
these these other problems that we're
trying to solve we realized this is kind
of what we were doing we were taking
like foundation and then we were like
piling all their crap on top of it right
here like that doesn't look stable and
we were like maybe we do it this way and
we're like no it looks still kind of
like crap and there's like well what if
we got this thing like what if we what
if we built like a different type of
system something that was more
appropriate for handling I know these
these larger types of web sites you know
when you get foundation for apps kinda
looks like this and we eventually hope
you make it look something like this
which is really kick-ass so Web Apps
have different patterns and needs and so
these are kind of an example of probably
one of the first types of web app that
was ever around did anyone have hotmail
growing up at all yeah yeah a couple of
you all right you still have your
hotmail address did someone want to tell
us what their hotmail address was no one
it was like cutie patootie 9 to 2 I
can't if you like that no one wants to
share you're all I was all horrible I
was like Skeeter Bui but you know the
email apps have been like kind of the
the great like way to get into Web Apps
right because it's email I want that
everywhere don't say we want to have to
have something download on my machine
they're fairly simple but have some
level of complexity hotmail was I think
we were trying to trace it back a couple
months ago I think hotmail was like the
first web app ever created and so Mail
Epson kind of be like the pushing that
boundary so you know people want to
build things that kind of look like this
or
things that are dashboards or maybe
things that look like this Spotify has
an amazing web app they also have an
html5 built native app but Spotify his
web app is freaking awesome like I used
that over the native app most the time
that's fine I don't need to open an app
I just open a browser window so people
are experimenting and trying these
things again we kind of been like after
about you know 2011 everyone got these
little devices and they were like these
devices are different you need to
download things on them and we're just
like maybe you don't anymore
maybe they're good enough you don't need
to do that people might also want to
build stuff like this this is a sauna if
anyone uses it a lot of complex
interactions on there but an amazing
example of a web app so we looked at a
lot of web apps both you know native
apps and desktop and mobile and we were
like what are the patterns that are
common no one's doing these responsive
web apps yet people are building desktop
web apps or or or mobile web apps but
very few people out there building
things that can respond the same way
that websites do so can't here's what we
found we found out first and foremost we
needed a new way to layout apps right
there need to be a whole new way to lay
these out the the columns and grid
systems that we're using for websites
get you most of the way there but
there's still a lot of patterns that
aren't kind of covered in those
experiences so we realized one of the
things we needed was these independent
scrolling panels right that's something
that you're seeing most places in these
web apps and that requires you to take
up the whole width and height of a
screen and have independently scrolling
sections that do different tasks
iPhone apps it's usually just one giant
independent section in the middle and
then different windows that can kind of
slide in from the sides we noticed we
needed something like fixed vertical
sections is anyone in here like a web
dev of dollars every what their
designers or anyone yeah fix positioning
things on mobile phones is so sucky
right it's like the worst thing is like
you do it and I get lags and like
eventually it'll be down here as you're
scrolling fast I'll be a Catholic down
the page so what we're trying to try to
solve is how to better create a vertical
grid to kind of make these sections
happen collapsing panels was another one
of these patterns that we've we've
started exploring and playing with so on
websites if I have the I think I think
got a client the other day because I
we don't really understand this
responsive thing like here's what we
think it is we think like the thing on
the right like goes under the thing on
the left and I got really indignant for
a second I was like what way it emit no
that's like 80% of all honesty like the
thing on the right goes into the thing
on the left and and that's like 80% of
what responsive web design has become
but with with Web Apps it's not always a
viable option right if I have my my
email app for an example and I say my
left pane has mic like tight my
mailboxes my right pane has my messages
and my you know my actual message is on
the one on the right I can't just stack
all three of those things together or I
have like a scooby-doo scroll like I'll
just keep scrolling in the DaVinci
little catch and I'll scroll up and then
I'll scroll and I'll scooby-doo for a
while and I'll catch so it had to be
different ways to do that one of the
methods for that was figuring out how to
really easily for you guys in a
framework create things that are on
screen and on screen as siblings kind of
on a desktop experience that then get
pushed off screen and as to as to panels
that can come out and in when necessary
so these are kind of the main grid
things we discovered while building
foundation we also realized we needed to
kind of bridge the gap between mobile
and desktop components so mobile has has
had enough time I think and it's in its
short lifetime at least in the grand
scheme of the Internet to kind of
develop its own patterns so things like
action sheets and these you know like
all these things that you're seeing that
happened like all things slide over and
do all these things and so his desktop
desktop has its own kind of patterns
that we find within those trying to find
ways to merge those things that people
haven't really had to do a whole lot of
yet so action shoes is one of the main
ones we like to talk about a little I
think iPhone and iPad like Apple dealt
with this three years ago and the iPad
came out and they were like we want
people to have the same actions and
we're like what or what do you do with
this giant thing that slides in from the
side so you know what might be an action
sheet on mobile we can Auto
automatically convert to maybe adjust a
drop-down on desktop without any extra
work on your part just single components
that do multiple things there's several
of these within the framework but these
are some of the the main ones things
like in app notifications might be
things that where they're the top right
and I can dismiss them up here they kind
of slide in from the top and can kind of
come down and notify me those are things
that I don't want you to have to do
extra work when you're building these
responsive web apps those should be
built into a framework
that understands the differences and the
the relations between those two things
flexible nav and menu bars we're super
huge you have all this usually we're
seeing a pattern lately where there's
just like laughs nav menu with a lot of
these screens with these these these
we're kind of bringing back the the
vertical nav menu I remember in like
nineteen like 98 like that was like the
hot thing and where it's like everyone
had their nav on the left and then we're
like no now just go on the top and now
we're like we're back on the left it's
fine and then mobile tends to have this
thing where it's like fixed on the
bottom and they're these tab bars so
it's finding ways to make components
that are flexible enough to do both
those things swap positions change you
know orientation on different screen
sizes once again you don't have to
create multiple navs finding ways to
make that happen automatically for you
so I'm gonna just toggle I'm gonna show
you guys a couple little demos of some
stuff I am going to live code for like a
slightest bit of a moment so you guys
can watch the tears run down my face as
I do that but we're gonna first start
off with kind of a basic grid structure
so it's not gonna you know look super
impressive right away but we'll start
off with that when you download a
foundation for Apps project this is kind
of the basic template you get this this
empty this is this emptiness that is
filling your life right now so we have
kind of a title bar up there which is
pretty popular for a lot of apps and
then just nothingness kind of in the
middle I want to build maybe maybe a
chat app that has just for the
simplicity sake right now kind of one
panel on the left that would have maybe
a navigation or some content that's
independently scrolling one panel on the
right with a bunch of content that has
some fixed headers and footers as we
kind of go throughout through so I'm
gonna kind of just build that and kind
of talk a little bit about the grid
system we use something called flexbox
for this as anyone played a flexbox a
little if you haven't played with
flexbox check it out
it is ie 10 plus which is its only flaw
also it's not finalized yet which is a
in the spec which is another flaw but
flexbox is like if someone explained to
you how the how you like if you explain
to someone how you thought the internet
should be built
that's what flexbox is we use floats to
build the entirety of the internet right
now right floats were never meant to do
what we
doing with them floats we're supposed to
float an image to the left and have text
wrap around or float an image to the
ride enough text wrap around before that
we use tables that were never supposed
to be used for the way we abuse them
we've never had a thing that did the
thing we were supposed to do for layout
it's what we're hoping to get from flex
box flex box isn't perfect but it does a
lot of really neat stuff flex box is
main attribute if you guys have familiar
with it is that the more divs I put
inside a container that is set to flex
they'll just automatically space
themselves out based on as many as I put
in so if I put two divs in they get 50%
if I put three divs in they get 33.33%
it is the way the internet should work
so we're doing a lot of stuff with Flex
box you also get a horizontal and a
vertical axes to play with so we're
gonna kind of see some of that stuff
happening so let's go ahead and take a
look at some of these the syntax we're
going to be using so first we would
built finish perhaps on angular we're
not going to show a bunch of angular
stuff right now we're gonna show the
grid angular allows us to do things like
make SP ASO make you know state state
States instead of pages so things can
animate in and slide out and we can we
can bring new content in it also lets us
use some pretty sweet directives do some
fun stuff so we don't need to
necessarily use divs and classes for
everything shut this it's flashing weird
lights at me all right no you're fine so
the first thing you guys are going to
notice is rows and columns don't make a
whole lot of sense once we talk about
the ability to switch horizontal to
vertical and a grid because if I switch
a row to vertical I don't know what
that's called anymore if I switch like a
like a column to horizontal I don't know
what that's called so the foundation
perhaps grid has three main classes one
that's called the grid frame the grid
frame is just a thing we put once your
entire app on the outside and all that's
doing is setting the container of the
app to 100% width and 100 VH height
VH being the viewport height ya viewport
height and viewport height is an awesome
new thing we got to play around with now
so you can actually without JavaScript
detect the height of your viewport and
all we're doing with that is making sure
that we can play with the entire canvas
because height on the web is a very much
a second-class citizen is anyone ever
set something to like every every every
time you got new on the web you are like
height 100
and it stayed exactly how tall it was
and you were likewise you know not the
worst and then you were like you and you
then you solve that problem and then you
were like how do I center things and
then you cried more so that's the grid
frame we have two other things that are
called grid block and grid content these
are kind of analogous to rows and
columns and other grid systems so
Foundation for sites or any other grid
systems you guys might be using and
they're kind of nuggets like block it's
kind of analogous to a row and content
is kind of analogous to columns so let's
kind of just build some stuff real quick
so I have my grid frame and I'm gonna
tell this great frame to be vertical I
want to be vertical because I want the
things and I'm about to put in it to
stack on top of each other as opposed to
two next to each other so I'm going to
tell that to be vertical I have a grid
content here and then I just put like a
little title bar in it which is a
component and then I have another grid
content here and this has a UI view it
has some angular stuff in it but for now
I'm just gonna kind of ditch that and to
get rid of that there and I'm also going
to change this to a grid block because I
want to put more like buildings inside
of it so anytime you want to build
you're gonna use a grid block inside of
that I'm gonna create a grid content
because I want to put some content
inside like some text and I'm gonna just
put like a whole bunch of text inside
this just for the sake of a demo cool so
just go ahead and save that I'm also
going to next I'm going to create a grid
block
yes we give it terminology because it
flexbox was was had like four different
versions of it and so we're basically
just trying to make sure that flexbox is
is understood a little a little more to
an extent I'm gonna create a grid block
here and what I want to do is create two
sections but I'm for now I'm just gonna
kind of paste this in I'm gonna save
we're gonna see what that does by
default by default without sizing
anything without doing anything these
two pieces take up 50% of the width of
the screen floats wouldn't do that
floats would just kind of stack on top
of each other but because flexbox they
end up taking 50% of that screen I'm
gonna I'm gonna size some of these just
for the sake of having some some sizes
in here so on this grid content if
anyone uses a 12 column grid you guys
probably all do at this point or a 16
column grid from like that we're gonna
we're gonna add some sizes so on a large
screen I want this to be three and four
this one on a large screen I want this
to be nine so if we kind of save this
and go back to looking at it we can
still size this like any other grid we
want and refresh here and we have our
three and nine or independent scrolling
panels right cool and your app should
never have this much text in it this is
next I'm gonna build kind of the chat
portion of my app so I'll have kind of
the place where my name goes the place
where my actual chats take place and the
place where I would type in my chats I'm
gonna set this thing to vertical again
because I want to use a vertical grid
for this one and I'm going to div class
grid content cool and I'm gonna just put
some dummy text in here for right now
this that's nice cool and I'm gonna set
this thing to do what's called shrink so
by default flexbox wants to take up even
amounts of space right like we showed it
a second ago
what shrink does is say only be as tall
as you need to be only ever be as tall
as the content inside of you this is
gonna prevent us from having to use
things like fixed position elements or I
have to like give it a height and set it
somewhere and then pad the thing
underneath we can tell it just to be as
tall as it needs to be within this so we
don't have to worry about anything I'm
going to duplicate this three times two
more times here
and I am going to take shrink off that
middle one because I wanted to take up
the remainder of the space I'm gonna
take a whole bunch of content here just
gonna plop that in right here that did
not work the way it should have there we
go we're just gonna paste this in here
it's at save and really quickly we can
see within like just a minute or two we
can get a pretty nice looking system in
which we can get some independently
scrolling sections here that we can put
our chat window in we can have our title
up here and we can have our kind of
inbox up here our chat message up here
so we started looking like slack or
HipChat and this the layout of this in
normal code would take about an hour or
two maybe it can be done in about five
to ten minutes I'm gonna show you guys
some more some more stuff in just a
second on this but when we talked about
earlier if this was a nav menu and this
was a thing this was a kind of a chat
window
we can't just stack them on top of each
other we have to find another pattern to
do that we're gonna turn this one into a
panel that on small we can be that can
collapse off to the side and I can call
it in so let's take a look up here at
our grid content that we had I'm gonna
just give this a directive of ZF panel
ZF being ZURB foundation and panel being
a directive that turns it into a panel
on a certain screen and I'm just gonna
tell it to be medium grid content saying
on medium your grid content if you're
not you're a panel we can head back over
here we can shrink our browser down we
can see that it it is it has left us on
small screens what a bummer but this is
still working the same way that you
would expect like an iPhone app to kind
of scroll independently from things but
we're gonna want to call that panel so
we're gonna give this panel an ID and
we're just gonna say menu and we're
going to on this little link right here
give it a toggle clasp which is built
into foundation and we're just going to
tell it to toggle menu when we click on
it so if I shrink this down here and I
refresh and I can have that thing guide
us sliding off from the left side really
quickly so that's just in about 30
seconds you have that kind of built in
natively I'll show in a minute how you
can add different animations into this
you can you can have you know different
sliding different you know hinges and
things like that
so that's kind of the basics of how the
grid is built now this looks really
boring and dumb let's take a look at
maybe another piece that might have a
little more detail I'm just going to
bring up something right now and we're
just running NPM start so that we can
you know start our server here and it's
going to refresh here with a whole
nother look and feel so this is maybe
kind of a little little version a little
more styled than the last one we saw we
might have our rooms up here and our
people down here we have our main
content section here we might call this
things Lac if we didn't know any better
but who knows and we can see if we kind
of shrink up our browser that this is an
infinitely scrolling section we have a
button that stays fixed here and we can
through the wonders of angular call in
different chat windows so we can see
that kind of chat functionality we're
building with our grid earlier as well
as you know we have our our chat box
down here we have a way to create kind
of some new modal's to create new chats
and we're using these panels here to
kind of create some some nice account
things so I can get rid of this I can
call different pieces in if I want with
some different animations I'm gonna kind
of go through and just modify a couple
things just to see how easy and quick it
is to modify these things so anyone use
sass out there no in sass alright
alright everyone so shy pile using their
own I don't know pretty process
what about less so they're any lesser
people in the room alright now that's
fine
so we're gonna use some sass stuff and
we're just going to modify some things
so I have a you know a little version of
this that an employee or co-worker has
mocked up for me and they've left me
some comments and I'm just gonna kind of
go through and we're just gonna make
some of those adjustments on-the-fly
because we all know that when we design
in browser a lot of the time which is
nice sometimes sometimes things
drastically change so if we look here
and we see that they first and foremost
say like man I really hate that purple
in red it looks too much like slack
we're nothing like
lack so they might not they maybe they
don't want that so we're just gonna
change the whole color scheme of this
app using our using our sass variables
in settings that of CSS so I'm gonna
bring up another window here I'm going
to open up our settings a test CSS file
where we keep all the variables for
foundation for apps so every variable
everything that we've ever built any
variable ever used in foundation can be
traced back to all the variables that
are kept in here in that I'm gonna go
find our primary and secondary color I'm
gonna kind of just change those a little
to make them a little less like like the
the purple that we have so I'm just
gonna change this to let's say like a 5
8 b a b h and maybe this one too a 5 7 7
6 8
yeah alright and we can just wait for
that to refresh real quick nope not
there there we go nice so we can see
that we can change the color scheme of
that entire thing that that permeates
out through the other parts of the app
it permeates through some of these
sidebars it permeates through these
modal's over here so really quickly we
can already see like a big change this
might not be beautiful to be honest
those were not great color combinations
but that's fine
next we can go ahead and take a look at
some of the other feedback we might be
getting from people they like these
things they like these here for this
modal they might they said you know they
they like the animation of it just kind
of fading in but they wanted to be
cooler one of the big things we noticed
with all kind of apps out there and the
word in the real world right now is
animation plays a huge role in kind of
telling the story right so we created a
thing called motion UI which is a basic
set of CSS animation classes and we made
sure that we permeated them through the
entirety of every every directive every
component all the views that we see so
that really easily you can kind of
create and use these animations within
your application so let's go ahead and
take a look at how we would do some of
that stuff so I'm gonna find my index
over here where I keep my modal and we
have a couple of things that you're
gonna see if we have a CF modal which is
just the directive of how we call the
modal so instead of using a class or
anything like that we just automatically
these are these are directives in in
angular work a little bit slightly
similar to maybe web components if you
guys have been playing with those at all
lately they're just ways to
get some of those things and we're just
gonna change that animation so I'm gonna
say animation - in equals and I'm gonna
tell it to slide in down and I'm just
gonna save that and we can just now
really quickly see how that looks if we
I think I have two of these open there
we go if i refresh that page maybe that
won't work and I swear to gosh it will -
sorry guys live coding will be the death
of me we will really quickly sorry about
that
refresh that
apparently does not want to work are
nice where it works but well we'll move
on but right now there's other there's
other stuff we can take a look at so
let's move on from that and take a look
at some of these other notes people
might be leaving us we can take a look
at this little panel down here so we
kind of saw panels can actually come
from the top right bottom or left this
one's coming from the bottom and I think
that looks pretty weird they don't like
that down there at all so let's go ahead
and make sure that we can find that that
panel that's happening right now we have
a position bottom we can tell that to be
positioned right we can kind of refresh
that change our code here come back over
here and now that panel that was sliding
from the bottom now can slide in from
the right over there now we need a way
to close that panel I have a close
button that I've kind of commented out
here and that uses the same ZF toggle so
everything in everything in foundation
that that shows up or goes away all just
does to pretty much the same thing right
so from modal's to panels to alerts to
notifications those things are all just
showing things and hiding things so you
can use CF - open and an ID to open
anything CF - close and an ID to close
anything or ZF toggle to open and close
something with the same button so we'll
kind of save that and we'll kind of will
refresh this screen here and we can see
that now it slides out and I can I can
get rid of it here so that looks no they
might they might like that we might want
to try different animation dare I try
again after that after that monstrosity
there but let's try that we're gonna say
animation - in we're going to tell it to
hinge in from right and we're going to
save that and then we're going to
duplicate that we're going to change
that to out in out and we're going to
take a look at how that works
and now we can see that really quickly
we can create that hinging animation
which is a nice effect as opposed to
maybe that slide animation that's in
there each one of the motion classes has
where it comes from what it's actually
doing they also have something called
motion modifiers which I really don't
want you using these in production but
what you can do is if you're really
quickly just trying to try something out
each one has a fast and a slow function
built in so if you want that animation
to slow down you can tell to slow down
each one or if you want to go faster you
can have a really quick fast each one
has different ease functions that you
can use as classes so ease in out bounce
in out so you can you can experiment
with some of those so motion modifiers
are a nice way for prototyping the
please in production you can write your
own mix in yeah whatever these are all
CSS animations so they're they're pretty
performance we're seeing we're looking
at a lot of stuff right now we know that
some people have been doing some cool
stuff by like speeding up JavaScript
animations we still think that CSS is
probably faster than most other things
yeah everything is everything's done and
it's all actually done with transitions
as opposed to keyframe animation which
cuts down on the file size like Auton
which is the nice benefit of that suite
all right lastly I kinda want to just
talk a little bit about is anyone anyone
ever used like in written routes in
angular yeah for people who haven't done
that you have to it's all j/s based you
write your your routes which are
basically basically your technical pages
right now in angular
if angular has routes instead of pea
instead of URLs and it can be a pain if
you don't know how JavaScript works if
you're a designer or maybe a front-end
dad didn't use Jas it might be pretty
annoying so we built this thing called
front router that should be used in
prototyping when designers are
prototyping their apps so what front
router is is it is a uses frontmatter
which is those little a little dashes at
the top if anyone has ever used Jekyll
you've seen kind of things that work for
static prototyping at Jekyll first kind
of these these static site generators
but what this does is it lets us define
a name of our of our of our URL or sorry
our name of our route URL of our route
an animation in on that route and an
animation out on that route so without
writing a single line of JavaScript we
can create new routes
we can call those routes and and you
know have them appear in the view and we
can also change how they're coming in
and out so currently with the app right
now we're seeing a fade in and a fade
out which is which is okay but we're
just going to change that one more time
with some motion stuff and we're going
to tell it to slide in up all right and
then we're going to that's my problem
and then we're going to tell it to slide
out left and we're just going to save
that and as we save that we can also
maybe do some things where we we changed
the URL so my awesome you know chat my
awesome chat window maybe and that can
just change the URL so this is super
handy for designers who want to
prototype and then hinder over there
devs and their devs are like I don't
know what these states are supposed to
be I don't know what animation you want
when they come in I don't know what you
know and then they but they can take
this same code they can take the same
views they can take the same routes
right those add their own controllers to
them and then create a live dynamic data
within these things so if we go and just
save up this take a look and refresh our
page and we can maybe call that and we
can call maybe one of these
so really quickly we can see that it
becomes a lot more dynamic that's pretty
obnoxious because I have a bounce effect
on that but just for the sake of having
that screen come across so you know
fades are pretty popular these things
slides hinges rotates pretty much
anything that you guys see in any of
those popular CSS library think animate
dot CSS you know Daniel II didn't from
Dropbox amazing guy you know kind of
pioneered some of those CSS animations
most of those in some way recreated in
these types of things so and you know
just kind of lastly we can we can kind
of clean up some of the other stuff we
can take a look at maybe some of the
things in settings and maybe for our
modal we want to change the background
color of that overlay for four reasons
or you know there's there's all these
things that we can do really quickly
with all our with all our settings that
give us entirely different looks as we
go and we can take a look at what this
looks like on mobile we now have our
single pay arcing
pay an app that has our directives
built-in they can leave we can call in
our menu we can call in our people you
can close this baby we can also call in
our modal's down here and we can cancel
that and we can call in our little hinge
a guy right here so really quickly we
can develop these apps and they can be
responsive as opposed to something that
might be just just working on a phone so
that's what I that's what I have they're
gonna show you guys today if it no one
wants me after I can go in more detail I
can also explain to you what I did
horribly who I'll be wrong on that modal
animation and yeah what happened our
breakpoints oh man I could like I could
look at settings real quick so you can
change the breakpoints to whatever you
want
so in our SAS versions do two to six
forty one thousand fourteen forty in
nineteen twenty yeah no worries
depending on your by the way the
breakpoints we give you are completely
arbitrary as far as like device sizes
that work for maybe our thing keep track
of any device keep track of your
analytics if you have a current app keep
track of you know an ellipses that come
and adjust those because honestly
everyone based on what they do if you
worked in tech your mobile breakpoints
probably start a lot sooner than if you
work you know my grandparents phones
which are still like little old high
phone for something like that so just
make sure you're doing that yeah any
other questions at all have an answer
them yeah all right oh yeah
yeah okay so that's I didn't go over the
vertical grid as much that it wasn't
sure how much everyone cared about the
actual code that went into that so in
this case where we're seeing this right
in a normal situation fact I just had to
recreate something we had designed for a
foundation perhaps the other day in
found in like foundation for sites which
was a whole mess of fix positioning and
viewport height syndrome calc or calc
function everything but what this is
basically doing is I'm using flexbox and
I'm still I'm telling it to be vertical
so that means anything I put in here
would automatically get split out
one-third one-third one-third but what
I'm doing is I'm shrinking this one and
shrinking this one meaning they're only
as tall as they need to be and then the
rest of the one flexbox
automatically has take over the extra
space and then I'm making that scroll
because normally you'd have to fix
position this thing up here fix position
this thing down here and then tab this
container the height that you that you
knew that container would be but then if
the height changes for whatever reason
like some jerk opens inspector and then
just starts adding more content into it
there we go and just starts adding more
nope oh you can't do H do you know and
in that that's fine I'll just do this
and just adds more and more and more and
more and more horrible content and it's
all giant everything and this gets
bigger for whatever reason that gets
bigger and expands but the content in
the middle stays
so this isn't even position:fixed this
is just foreplay yeah yeah but you can I
I don't I don't like hate but there's an
fix we just knew that that was something
that we were struggling with internally
yeah
in fact the physician fix is what makes
those panels work - and those work
pretty well because you're not you're
not they're not following the screen as
you go so those end up working a little
better but yeah I mean on that mobile
phone position fix it's what's making
you know all of all of that possible
right there the the main goal behind
that was just how do I carve the screen
up in ways that we've noticed native
desktop apps without having to fix this
theer and then pad this thing here and
have an unknown value for anything else
so a lot of that stuff was things that
were pretty difficult to figure out but
it to be honest now one of my co-workers
kind of Jeff can pretty much code this
grid in about ten minutes now that we
know how it works so the code behind it
is it isn't isn't insane but it's pretty
nice any other questions at all sweet
all right well if you guys have any more
questions I'm up here Daniel also
where's Meserve he's one of our
marketing guys you can talk to him and
then also we have a whole bunch of
adorable Yeti stickers and a little inky
sticker in the back I am so there
they'll be here and I think Daniel threw
some in the back maybe and yeah thank
you guys so much thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
