about css3 3d graphics and animation
effects now as you can see on the right
side of the screen there are four div
elements and they have some gradient
effects applied to them and when we
relaunch this webpage we're also going
to see some animation effects so let's
start on the left side of the screen and
as you can see in line 7 the first step
is to create an HTML page with div
elements which you've already done in
this code sample and the second step is
to create a CSS stylesheet that we'll
look at in a minute and that style sheet
is going to contain selectors for the
linear div elements which are the div
elements here in lines 25 through 28 and
then we'll also create some key frame
rules that have animation effects and
then we're going to reference one
keyframe rural in each of the selectors
that match these developments below and
finally we need to reference the CSS
stylesheet on the web page and as you
can see in lines 19 and 20 we've already
done that now let's take a look at the
style sheet and what in particular we're
going to look at the selector for the
development in line 28 whose ID value is
linear for as you can see starting in
line 393 all the way down to 423 we've
got the definition of the linear for
selector and it's got a lot of
properties and values for those
properties specified if you look at the
right side of the screen on the lower
right corner the development over here
with the text for displayed is the
matching div element for this selector
the font size is 96 there's a stroke and
shadow for the text as you can see
there's there's a shadow effect here and
there's an absolute position width and
height and let's get to the interesting
part which is the background image now
in line 401 there's the
prefix definition for the background
image property and inline 409
essentially have the same thing where we
have the non prefixed properties so they
both have the same contents and so let's
take a look at line 401 where you see
the gradient specifies a linear value so
the other value is radial so in these
examples that they're all going to be
linear gradients now there are two sets
of percentages here and the first one is
the starting point the second one is the
end point and the pairs of the these
percentages represent the offset for the
horizontal and the vertical direction so
for example here we have zero percent
and one hundred percent that means we
start 0% offset from the corner over
here the upper left corner of this div
element so offset 0 wins we stay put for
the horizontal value one hundred percent
means we go the full height of this
development which means that this is our
start point similarly over here we have
a hundred percent and zero percent which
means starting from here we go
horizontally the full width over here
and then the second value is there a
percent so we don't move from here so
that's the end point so once again the
start point is the lower left vertex of
this development and the end point is
the upper right vertex now if you look
at the values of the colors here you can
see that it starts set to f00 which is
hexadecimal for blue and it ends at 00 f
which is hexadecimal for for blue and
ansari the start value is red the color
stops specify two values a percentage
offset and a color so these are actually
0.2 represents twenty percent followed
by forty sixty and eighty percent and
the colors are orange yellow green and
blue now if you'll notice over here we
have it's very difficult to discern this
but it's actually read turning kind of
an orange color followed by the yellow
green and blue
which is what we would expect over here
now down below we have the border radius
specified as four pixels and as you can
see it is a very very slight rounding
effect on each of the four vertices of
this div element and then we have a box
shadow effect which specifies the 30
pixels and a color of black and as you
can see have a corresponding shadow
effect and then finally we have the
animation a name and duration the name
of the animation actual key frame
element a rule rather is called lower
right and it's going to last for it for
90 seconds now each of these selectors
then your one through linear for has a
different key frame rail specified so
for example the one here in lines three
389 and 390 specifies the animation in
lower left and then a duration of 90
seconds so let's take a look at the
definition of this keyframe now as you
can see it starts on line five and it's
actually fairly long goes down to line
88 but the so we'll just take a look at
the first part essentially what you do
is in a keyframe you specify after the
name a set of values that are listed as
percentages now these percentages mean
the offset from the start time of the
animation effect so as you saw below we
had 90 seconds specified for the
duration so that means that the zero
percent is the start of the animation
and then at one percent this is the
animation effect that will take place
transitioning from the previous one now
one percent of 90 seconds is point nine
seconds so this here two percent would
be double that which is 1.8 seconds and
then at the 25-percent point so that
would be twenty-five percent of 90
seconds which is 22 and a half seconds
and so forth now
notice how we have a variety of
functions specified and in line seven
and eight we have the matrix function
which is fairly detailed terms of the
functionality it's actually the matrix
form of the other effects that you can
create and specify by names such as
translate rotate skew and scale so in
line 11 you can see we have a translate
3d effect followed by a rotate 3d askew
effect and a scale 3d and on these these
effects are actually represented by a
matrix and the product of those matrices
is calculated and that matrix is used to
actually render the effect and that
means then that these effects are not
rendered see earlier sequentially
they're actually rendered simultaneously
now when you load a webpage into a
browser and your reference to CSS style
sheet that has some animation effects
those functions are converted to
matrices and the final product is
computed before you actually render the
animation effect so don't have a whole
lot of time to go into the details but
it just gives you an idea of what the
definition of the keyframe is and
actually the other key frames are very
similar they have a kind of a
heterogeneous mix of functions specified
so let's load that reload this page so
you can get an idea momentarily and the
first thing that you see is you actually
only see div 1 which is has an ID value
of linear one and it contains the text
string text one now you notice that the
other animation effects started to
happen and those are effects that last
for
90 seconds rather than as opposed to
this one which lasts only 30 seconds so
it kind of creates almost like a delay
effect if you will that's one way to do
that now as you can see the animation
effect for the first div element is
finished so it's that that pretty much
at its final position now the other
effects are going to continue and since
they started the last for 90 seconds
they're going to be 60 seconds longer
than this div element animation effect
so essentially you can create some very
interesting effects by a combination of
css3 functions and another thing to keep
in mind is that some of these can be
very computationally heavy and so
fortunately there's hardware
acceleration so that the effects are
actually computed using a GPU another
point to keep in mind is that the
effects can be different on different
platforms so for example on a Windows
machine versus a Mac or on a Linux
machine the effects tend to be different
and sometimes what you will see in the
case of animation that is and what seems
to happen generally speaking is that the
effect on a Windows machine and a Linux
machine tend to be similar more similar
to each other and the macbook tends to
be the one that's a differs from the
other two but they aren't necessarily
always exactly the same in the case of
the windows and linux machine one thing
that tends to happen when there are
differences is there's a certain kind of
a flickering effect that you'll see in
actually that's part of the reason why
the stylesheet has the strength flicker
in the file name now the reason for this
it's not completely clear to me but it's
from what I understand from what I've
been told it's differences in drivers
and drivers do have bugs in them and
they've been some of them have been
around dormant for a long time and
perhaps css3 is bringing those to the
fore
front I'm not really exactly sure but
thing is that when you do create
graphics and animation effects specially
with 3d and css3 it's a good idea to
test if possible the effects on
different platforms and not only on
desktops and laptops but also on mobile
devices tablets so for example on an
iPad 3 this code tends to be similar in
terms of having a bit of an extra
flickering effect whereas on an asus
Prime with ice cream sandwich it tends
to be more rather less of the flickering
so that gives you an introduction and an
overview of some of the effects that you
can create using css3 3d graphics and
animation and that's all for this video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
