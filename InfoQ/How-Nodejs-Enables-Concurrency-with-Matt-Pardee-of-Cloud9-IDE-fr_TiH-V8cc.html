web-based and that means that you can
import your code from bit buck and get
up really easily and you can run and
debug your node.js applications you can
also deploy them too we have up to with
four partners now you can deploy your
code to and like I said we use noches
entirely on the back end no Jace is
great because oh well this is what it
looks like first of all so this is
entirely browser-based and o dem dose in
a second you can kind of see I'm
throwing up most my talk because this is
just utility thing you can walk away
with this if you have never tried note
before you can use this and just start
running and debugging or nodejs apps
right away and it's really cool so like
I said c9 is a is a completely web-based
ID and and what's what the reason why we
chose to nodejs is because we realized
that as a platform choice it can handle
concurrently thousands of users
potentially in one single server and
when you're building an application like
cloud nine where a lot of users are
connecting they want to run in debug
node.js applications they're cloning
repos they're deploying and things like
that you really want the ability to do
all of those operations at once but
never block any single user at the same
time you also want to be sending
messages bidirectionally with users and
have them being able to communicate the
server in a non-blocking way and for
nodejs that is a ever of this choice to
make once you start working on nodejs
you start to realize that nodejs enables
concurrency and Michael told me that he
hates this line but Michael also talked
to crap about my coworker Tim Caswell so
it's a to take that with a grain of salt
actually to be honest Michael wrote a
blog post on on his kind of thoughts on
Python and the history of this mental
model of trying to
do things concurrently and I mean
probably sorry probably explain it
better than I could but when you start
working in node.js you start to realize
that the things that you want to do to
interact with the user who's interacting
with your application becomes much
easier to understand when you have
things like callbacks so if you're
reading a file and you want to send that
to a user you only do that when the file
is done reading and in the meantime
while the operating system is taking
care of loading in the file and sending
the information in nodejs nodejs is
handling all that another user could be
doing a separate requests and their
request is non blocking so anyway 220
hammer on that point there's one thing
you walk away from today the reason why
you would use nodejs is if you want to
engage your users and allow them to use
all parts of your application
concurrently without blocking any one of
them it's not to say that there might be
pause and wait and load times and things
like that when you have a lot of load
but compared to other frameworks that
you're used to and a lot of people here
from java and PHP it makes a lot more
sense when you start working with it so
i'm going to go and show you a little
bit about what it's like to work with
cloud nine and if you guys want you guys
have Wi-Fi on you can participate in
this a little bit i'm going to show you
what it's like to just run an
application so i happen to clone this in
let me see if I can hopefully the Wi-Fi
behaves so on the Chrome Web Store we
actually have Oh did an hour oh because
I'm not signing to get out of this
didn't work here we go
I don't know here it is yeah so we have
an extension for Chrome that's an edit
and cloud nine button and it injects it
into every project page that you look at
on github and you can just click on it
it'll literally just import the entire
repository into your cloud nine account
and so that's what I did here and you
immediately get the project files
lifting on that stuff and serve it is is
the JavaScript entry point for this
application this is the no chat example
that Ryan doll wrote and if i click on
debug here it'll spit out some
information at the bottom like a URL
that i can use to access the running
process so if i click on that this is
the application so within a few seconds
I got this up and running and so you
guys can actually access this URL this
is a public project on cloud nine so for
running process anybody can access this
we seek a zoomin its node underscore
chat died MSP underscore dev dot c9 that
I oh and I'll show you in a second what
it's like to do Bo to debug on cloud
nine when some you used her to join okay
cool all right good deal so I talked
about concurrency earlier in this
application there's a console dot log
statement that's logging every request
and all the things all the resources
that are being loaded and it's spitting
it back out just in regular console dot
log statements if you're running this on
your home computer on your desktop your
laptop or whatever you would see this
output your terminal but what cloud nine
does is it has its watching the process
that's running and all the things that
are coming to the standard output get
sent back to your browser through socket
i/o and this is I'm sure that there's
about 250 people you know working on
cloud nine right now the same thing is
happening for them so it's managing all
those processes concurrently and it's
there's no lag so it's pretty incredible
so um okay cool so I'm going to go here
too
the join so this is sees that there's a
join request and this is what happens
when you enter your name and hit hit
enter and I'm going to put a breakpoint
right here and if one of you could just
refresh your browser or something like
that I don't know if it actually keeps
the active state there we go okay
somebody logged in so it hit the break
point on this node.js application and
whoever did that is currently paused in
the loading state you did so it'll say
this is loading on the page right okay
so we can actually look at the property
so it says that your nickname is Barry
hi Barry we can see all the variables
listed here we can see all this
information as it's coming in and we can
step through and then so this is used
the query string or whatever that module
is to parse out his Nick from the URL
that was sent in the join message and we
can hover over this and see that Nick is
said to very right as soon as they press
play here Barry will be joined in so on
your screen it should be popped up or if
not in my looks like a lot of you
refreshed your screen so it continues to
hit the break points but um yeah that's
just a brief introduction to how
debugging works on cloud nine and I'm
just going to step through here real
fast there's a lot of amazing stuff that
we do but I don't want to take up all
your guys's time you can do npm work
like michael was showing you earlier so
you can install NPM install request and
it'll take a second has to load up all
the resources and all that stuff but
it'll actually install it and if you
refresh here you can see that the node
module is actually there and then in
your code you can do you know require
request or whatever we also have we also
have code completion right so it's not
active like visual studio but
it's pretty quick and you just look for
assault space to get to it and so Matt
Harrington was earlier is talking about
deployment and oh I know why it's going
slow the screen recording you can deploy
to Windows Azure right from cloud nine
so it's effortless you just type in your
credentials create a new instance where
ever you want to deploy to you know your
data center and number of instances and
stuff like that create the deployment
it'll ask you how much RAM you want to
use things like that you can deploy it
really easily so we've had a lot of
experience developing cloud nine over
the past year and a half we debuted in
October of 2010 it's grown a lot since
then I have to say that since i joined
cloud nine last year coding in one
language on both the back end and the
front end is really incredible if you're
thinking about using nodejs for any
component and your architecture a lot of
developers already know javascript and
it's really just a nice thing to use it
the only caveat is that if you're
developing a sophisticated application
like cloud nine that uses a heavy
client-side rich library you really want
to do your research on the best one to
use because it's going to save you
boatloads of time down the road we use a
PF which is a client rich client library
that we developed back in two thousand
starting in 2005 and it never made it to
commercial release in fact the company
realized that it was going to go under
so we decided to build cloud nine
instead because you can't really sell a
client library so it was kind of
incomplete which is not to say that it's
a bad library it's great now that it's
the patches have been filled in but you
know people kind of hoo-ha about
backbone and all these other things that
are coming out you really want to do
research and I don't really know the
best one because i use a PF exclusively
for the bit for the past year but in
that process you want to ask a lot of
questions the JavaScript community is
amazing Michael's a good example of that
there's a lot of people in Oakland and
all the people who are working on doe je
s they Oakland
they are extremely generous with their
time very receptive very smart people
and you know Ryan doll basically didn't
necessarily invent this new paradigm of
thinking about this but he certainly saw
the light on it and this this new
communities is very self aware of what
it means to have a community of
developers that are helping each other
out that's one of the reasons why this
association with Microsoft is working
out really well this partnership with
Microsoft that they had added windows
and support to have knowed last year and
it's no coincidence to me because I've
been working in the node community
everybody's been amazing and the only
other thing I would say is that a hard
lesson that we learned at cloud nine was
we had this really high expectation that
nodejs was going to perform on every
level and we also kind of knew we were
going into uncharted territory but when
things started to not work we started to
get hundreds and thousands of users
using cloud nine concurrently and we
started to see that their memory issues
and no GS is like any other language
you've ever used and there's going to be
failure points along the way but it is a
fledgling community that's getting
stronger and learning a lot of lessons
and but yeah you have to be kind of
ready to to fail with javascript and
nodejs in particular because wrapping
your mind around this callback idea and
other things that you're doing is can be
a little difficult but like I said
everyone's always there to help and
nodejs especially and I was going to go
to the break you're up in a scalable
pieces thing but that's really more of
an architectural lesson that you learn
on the way it could be a whole nother
talk so yeah that's it check out cloud
nine at c9 that I oh and you can get
running with your no DJ no jeaious
applications right away and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
