forward for my fourth forward so I've
been here for all of them it's been
really fantastic couple quick things
you'll notice what's going on here on
the screen you see zero out of 350 that
is 0 out of 350 slides so we are going
to be here for about two and a half
hours or so hopefully that's not a
problem now but but what is this that
I'm giving you what is this presentation
and the best way for me to describe what
this is is we're going to discover this
presentation as we go because there are
no slides yet and I'm going to make the
slides as we go so we'll all see how
this plays out before i get into the
talk i do want to talk about privilege
awareness and some of you have probably
heard this at the beginning of
conference talks that i've done before i
want to talk about and very briefly this
problem in our industry that we do not
have enough progress on the topic of
inclusion you notice I'm not saying
diversity because actually I don't think
we should be striving for diversity I
think we should be striving for
empathetic inclusion and diversity falls
out as a natural consequence of striving
for empathetic inclusion and I don't
have any solutions to those problems
it's I think self evident when you look
around the industry that these exist but
I don't have a solution to them but what
I can say is that silence is not a
solution so I'm simply trying whenever
I'm given an opportunity to speak to
keep the conversation going what I'm
going to do very quickly is tell you
some of my privilege this is purely
introspective on myself it is not meant
to say that if you look like me you have
the same privilege your privilege is
your individual experience but I do
think that one of the ways that we can
develop more empathy for those around us
is to take stock regularly of our own
privileges the things that got us to the
places that we are where the person
sitting to the left or the right of us
maybe didn't have to work so hard to get
to that same part or maybe they had to
work a lot harder to get to that same
part so I think it's important for us to
be aware of those things so I just want
to briefly
declare for you a couple of things that
are probably self-evident but there are
things that I consider to be my own
privilege I've never had anybody
question me because of my skin color
question whether or not I was competent
I've never had anybody question whether
or not i did something whether I knew
what I was doing because of the gender
that I was born with and that is a
fortunate thing a privilege that not not
everybody has had on that same privilege
I have never been in a family that
couldn't afford to send me to school the
one of the privileges that I grew up in
is that I was going to get to go to
college and that was an assumed thing
not everybody has that same thing
thankfully this is becoming less and
less of a privilege but I grew up in an
area of the country where this wasn't an
issue I didn't have to be second-guessed
because of my sexual orientation for
example so these are all things that I
consider to be my own privileges and
again this is just simply to introspect
upon the things that are true about
myself and to challenge you to do that
as well I think if we can introspect and
we can challenge ourselves to talk more
about this maybe we can start moving
towards a better solution I want us to
be more aware of the privilege that is
holding some people back or not giving
some people the opportunities in this
industry that they ought to have so with
that let me jump into this talk I my
name is Kyle Simpson i'm known as get if
I online so if you have any thoughts or
feedback about what i'm about to share
with you tonight please feel free to
reach out i'd love to have that feedback
even if the feedback is you're
completely wrong because I probably am
so go ahead and tell me that I'd love
for you to reach out a couple of quick
things about myself I've written a
series of books some of you may have
heard of them they're called you don't
know Jas the entire six book 1100 page
series is complete it's all out in the
open for free on a github repo this URL
will redirect to that they've also been
published through a Rylan you can
purchase them so the first editions
complete and I should be working on the
second edition later this spring I'm
also the head of curriculum for maker
square which you heard from them earlier
they are a sponsor of today's conference
software an engineer developer training
school of boot camp
if you will if you have any questions
about that or have any feedback or
things I'd love for you to come and chat
so come find me and let's talk about
maker squirm and this talk is called the
economy of keystrokes and it's
deliberately a little bit unclear
exactly what exactly what I'm talking
about i deliberately left it a little
bit vague but we're gonna as I said
we're going to unfold this talk together
so to set this up I wanted to actually
start with a somewhat famous quote from
Shakespeare this is all the world's a
stage and all the men and women are
merely players they have their exits and
their entrances and this is true on
multiple levels there's like a meta
message here as a speaker up on a stage
and thinking about the ephemerality of
what I do for a living would is to talk
to people or to help people and it's
here for a moment and then it's gone but
there's something deeper than that sort
of that sort of question and that's what
I want us to focus on tonight so I'm
going to reformat what you're looking at
here so now what I've done is I've taken
away most of the non-critical vowels and
the punctuation and human psychology
tells us that virtually all people are
still going to be able to get pretty
good understanding of what this
statement is saying you can still get a
pretty good picture of the quote from
Shakespeare here even though I've
removed some of those vowels and the
punctuation so one perspective on this
might be that that the characters and
punctuation that I have now removed were
simply unnecessary they were unnecessary
noise they were getting in the way it
was less efficient for Shakespeare to
write that down and have to add all
those extra vowels and punctuation in so
maybe it would have been more efficient
for him had we chosen this as the means
of communication you can probably guess
where i'm going with that the question
really is even though we can understand
what this is saying is this the most
effective form of communication for
Shakespeare's quote and I'm going to
suggest through this talk that probably
not all right so what we're going to do
I'm going to briefly set out a couple of
metaphors for you metaphors in the space
of the economy and I'm not
economist so there's probably someone in
this room that knows the stuff a lot
better than me please come up and tell
me how I completely butcher these ideas
but I just want to talk about
metaphorically the economy and some of
the components that go into finance and
economy and those will be things that I
build on through the rest of the talk so
very briefly the first most important
thing when you start talking about an
economy might be for example the
currency that is true and that is traded
in that economy and I like the fact that
I can shorten it we all still pretty get
pretty much get the sense of what we're
talking about here we're talking about
currency or maybe another way to say it
is to talk about money the money is the
thing that we trade in this economy and
we trade the money that we've earned for
something that we want whether that's a
new iPad or it's some food at the store
we trade that money for something that
we want and that's the grease that keeps
the gears of the economy running you
always hear politicians say well the
solution or economic problems is we got
to get people more money and have them
spend more money spend more to keep the
economy going so we have money we have
currency we also know that the primary
thing that we do in an economy is that
we buy and we sell we're buying things
and we're selling things so that's kind
of the basic principle of keeping an
economy going those both those actions
have to be balanced and they both have
to be happening at an active rate for
the economy to keep going in addition to
buying and selling we also have saving
and investing now there's an interesting
take you know extra angle here saving
and investing well saving I want to hold
on to my money keep it in my bank
account investing I want to take my
money and put it in somebody else's bank
account hoping that I will make some
amount of interest on that or maybe some
I'm kind of you know hedging a bed or
some risk and the stock market to get
some more money back based upon the
actions of someone else so there's this
idea not just of buying and selling and
whether or not I keep some money because
I don't actually need to buy that third
iPad that I've bought this month but
then they're saving and investing and
choosing wisely to do something with my
money to save it or to invest it those
are all notions that we have to kind of
juggle to participate in this overall
economy another set of concepts in the
economy or
inflation deflation which changes the
value of the actual thing I'm holding on
to so over time I might be holding on to
that same dollar but that dollar changes
in value as inflation and deflation pass
through and lastly metaphorically we
have um I guess I'm kind of running out
of characters here so I wonder what's
going to happen when I run out of oh
I've run out of characters in my budget
I can't spend any more characters
actually I can just cheat like we all
can and change this to something like
1200 characters okay so but we have
budgets and budgets are a way for us to
restrain ourselves when we are spending
too much or we feel like we need to keep
hold on tomorrow more of our money we
set up a set of budgets that constrain
what we're spending so these are the
basic metaphors that I will sort of
build upon as we turn our attention not
to things like economics but as we turn
our attention more to the notion of
keystrokes so what I want to talk about
here is what I want to talk about here
is the idea that we are trading
keystrokes for something and that
something the most obvious thing that
we're trading our key strokes for is for
functionality we might want we might say
I am trading this particular keystroke I
am adding this keystroke to my program
because it buys me some feature that's
the most obvious thing that we're
getting out of the keystrokes that we
spend in our programs but there's
something deeper than functionality and
I think this is what most people will
probably resonate with is this notion of
readability we think that we are
spending a keystroke or rather saving a
keystroke to create more readability and
you've heard a lot of this lately even
heard a lot of it at the conference
today this notion that if I have a
shorter form to express my code if I
save some key strokes for example the
arrow function if I save some key
strokes with the arrow function I've
clearly and obviously made my code more
readable
so as an example of that sort of thing
as an example of the functions you know
we can write a function long-form or we
can write a function now using this new
syntax the arrow and the arrow syntax of
course is a way to reduce we don't need
to put the function key word there and
if you're in a particular case you won't
need a return statement so we're saving
keystrokes there and I think it's taken
almost universally that that's an
improvement in readability but I don't
necessarily agree that it's actually an
improvement in readability I want to
call into question whether or not that
is entirely true when we think about
something like an arrow function it's
almost always referenced in one of these
very happy path cases a single line
arrow function where the proportion of
characters that we saved is high we've
taken out the word function in the word
return and save 15 or 20 characters
compared to the overall length of the
function relatively speaking we've saved
quite a bit but you know readability is
not an objective thing or at least not
in the way that it's often cited it
turns out that readability is something
that can be studying and I did some
research about this a while back I was
trying to figure out whether or not
there was any well-known or established
research on the topic of readability
because I hear these claims all the time
this is more readable than that this is
more readable than that and and then I
feel like something's broken with me
because somebody will tell me this code
is more readable and to me it's less
readable so is there something wrong
with me is there a mime lacking some
understanding so it turns out that this
has been studied this notion of code
readability has been studied formally in
academic studies and I found it
fascinating as I was reading through
because they claimed at the beginning of
this paper that there was an objective
measure that could be automated they
could literally run a tool against a
piece of code and come up with an
objective metric an automated metric for
knowing how quote-unquote readable that
was and I thought that was a silly
notion to consider automated readability
I mean obviously a person could sort of
gauge that through talking to various
people but how could you automate some
metric on something that seems and feels
so clearly subjective well it turns out
in their study that what they found was
that when they showed a piece of code to
a developer if that code was using a set
of idioms or patterns that the developer
had already seen and was well
experienced with the developer would
immediately recognize those things and
therefore rate that code is more
readable but if they showed the exact
same code to someone who had not seen
that set of code patterns before not
that they didn't understand the language
they understood the syntax but there was
an additional set of idioms or patterns
that they were not familiar with and
they showed it to them and universally
those pieces of code were rated less
readable so it turns out that
familiarity is actually a really strong
component to this notion of readability
at least when it's studied from an
academic perspective so we can throw
around the word like my code is more
readable but actually it's more readable
because it might be more familiar in
familiarity leads me to this idea that I
want to talk about briefly and as a
person that teaches JavaScript for a
living this is near and dear to my heart
because I see developers often times
very early in their career and I'm
trying to help them get up to speed as
quickly as possible and get out and and
have great jobs and be very effective in
our in our industry and I see them
struggle with this question of what what
are those code what's this code that I'm
looking at if they haven't seen it
before the code can be very confusing
there's a an idea called cognitive load
theory which is if I throw too much at
you too much new stuff at you your brain
fills up and then it just starts to flow
out and stuff that you even had before
you just completely lose so I am keenly
aware of this idea that I can't throw
too much at you so the great news is if
the developer already has this
understanding of a particular idiom or a
particular syntax or particular approach
that doesn't count against the cognitive
load it's just it comes for free it's
this notion that we have tribal
knowledge as developers we have this
special set of knowledge that we know
and it makes us effective because we
know it and anybody else that's like us
and knows it can quickly and efficiently
read and
understand and modify our code but
someone without that tribal knowledge
often struggles significantly to
understand that code because they have
to first get up to speed on all the
tribal knowledge and we have huge
volumes of books dedicated to teaching
you the tribal knowledge that you need
to be part of our special group that's
called a developer and we don't often
ask the question could we be optimizing
for someone who doesn't already have
that tribal knowledge now back to this
notion of the economy for a moment what
are the things that we're buying and
selling in this economy of keystrokes
that I've come up with well I would
suggest that we're buying and selling
ideas we are buying and selling ideas
that we have expressed in our code and
to illustrate that let me give you two
assertions that i have found to be very
true the first assertion is that it can
be proven through computer science that
there are an infinite number of programs
that can be written within the space of
correct solutions to a particular
problem there's an infinite number of
programs to do it that's interesting
infinite that's a big number that how do
we pick from an infinite space of
programs how do we pick what's the right
program for us to write a second
observation that I would make is that
the especially on these higher-level
languages like with JavaScript the code
that we write is not as directly
connected to the code that runs as we
might like to feel this is uncomfortable
for me honestly because I'm a craftsman
I like to know I choose to write my for
loop in a very specific way and it's
uncomfortable but it's a fact that I
have to admit that when my code shows up
to the JavaScript engine with this
carefully constructed for loop the
JavaScript engine will say okay I see
what you're getting at you're trying to
repeat this a certain number of times
I'm not going to use a for loop at all
i'm going to do in an entirely different
way and what happens is we find out that
our code is merely just a suggestion to
the computer of what it ought to have as
an outcome it's not going to take our
code necessarily as a as a direct
prescription you must do it exactly this
way in exactly this order the good news
is that the convenor is usually much
better at figuring that stuff out than
we are it comes up with a much more
efficient way and I'm happy
about that but I do have to separate out
that when I I'm worrying about like I
plus plus or plus plus I are the kind of
nuanced details like that it turns out
it doesn't matter because the JavaScript
engine is going to figure out from my
suggestion it's going to figure out what
to do anyway so if there's an infinite
number of programs that can be written
and if whatever program we choose to
write is just a suggestion then what is
the purpose of code and this is not a
unique idea to me but I will suggest you
that the purpose of code is not first
and foremost to instruct the computer it
is to communicate it is that code is
first and foremost a means of
communication with other human beings
other members of our developer team and
maybe most importantly our future selves
we are communicating with other humans
with how we write our code not to say
that the control of the computer is
completely unimportant but it's a far
distant second to the communication and
this has been a transformative change to
my way of thinking from earlier in my
career when I was just down in the
trenches just trying to churn through
because I need to get the next promotion
and get this and I'd grab a plug-in off
a stack overflow and put it in and then
it worked and it's going to change a
deep profound change in my perspective
to think it doesn't matter so much one
choice or another to the computer but it
matters a whole lot one choice or
another to another human being now I'm
going to take a risk here and invoke a
person that probably most people in the
room aren't super in love with you
probably know him creator of Linux and I
don't want I'm going to use a quote from
him and I don't want that to suggest
that I'm endorsing the overall message
that he has because quite frankly he's a
giant asshole but mixed in with all of
that other stuff there are sometimes a
little bit of wisdom and I want to show
you a quote from Linnet from mr.
torvalds the code could easily have been
done with just a single and
understandable conditional and the
compiler would actually have generated
better code and the code would look
better and more understandable
this was a rant in response to some
commits that somebody had tried to put
into the linux code branch and they had
done something in some particular way
and just completely offended his very
nature as a human being he had to attack
this person but mixed in with all of
that other crap which was completely
ridiculous and unacceptable was this
little nugget of wisdom because there is
something of some truth here it is true
that we can actually create easily
understandable code code that looks
better not just because it has fewer
characters but but but because it's more
understandable more recognizable to
people it is possible to do I know we
don't often approach it that way and he
goes on to say I want to make it clear
to everybody that code like this is
completely unacceptable he's talking
about code that is hard to understand it
might be clever it might take a shortcut
but it is hard to understand it is hard
to understand for a person who has not
already immersed in the tribal knowledge
of that particular developers cleverness
and he said I want to make it clear that
this is completely unacceptable and if
there's lots of things that I disagree
with him on I completely agree with him
on this it is unacceptable for us to
continue to optimize for our creation of
code and completely ignore the
consumption of code because code is a
means of communication it's a very
important means of communication it is
the very lifeblood by which all learning
will happen throughout this industry and
if we cannot effectively communicate
through our code we cannot teach and if
we cannot teach our industry will die we
have to be able to teach we have to be
able to learn and I think it's important
the kind of code that we choose to do
that with now I'm going to invoke VOC
another quote often used Martin Fowler
says any fool can write code that a
computer can understand but good
programmers write code that humans can
understand and again I know it's often
quoted but I think there are nuggets a
very important wisdom there and that
I've taken as a personal challenge to
myself not just can I get the job done
can I get the code to work and believe
me I understand if you're feeling like
that some days that's all you can do
because on there most of the time I'm
like barely just getting the code to
actually function correctly
but when I have an opportunity to try to
refactor to try to improve this quote is
right at the very top of my
consciousness trying to figure out how
to rearrange that code so that it more
effectively communicates to my future
self because three days from now the
code that I literally wrote today I will
not understand promise you it happens
all the time I will go back to that code
and what was I thinking and I literally
can't tell because i'm just so bad at
communicating with code so this is what
obsesses me is how can i improve the
communication of my code now in the HTML
world there's a principle called the
principal constituencies and the
principle of constituencies basically
says wherever possible the users
concerns are more important than the
authors concerns which are more
important and it goes on to list several
different entities that we work with
like specification developers and
browser developers but you'll notice at
the very forefront of the list is that
it puts the user as the most important
constituency unfortunately we've seen an
awful lot of development in the web
platform that I think has switch these
two to where the author of code gets
more attention than the user the end
user of that but the principle of
constituencies is really important it's
a guiding principle for our we're
supposed to be developing stuff so if
that works for the web platform let me
be so bold to try to rewrite that for us
as developers and suggest to you that
there's a principle of constituencies
involved which suggests that the reader
is more important than the writer the
reader of your code their concern is
much more important they are a more
important constituency than you the
author of that code and I think
sometimes in fact most of the time we
have this backwards we think that to be
effective developers we have to be
really really good at writing code as
fast and efficiently as possible and
that's what's going to serve the overall
good as if we're the only ones that will
ever need to read our own code and
that's just flat-out not true so back to
this notion of keystrokes the keystrokes
that were spending ought to be spent
with the reader in mind not with the
in mind now I'm not hating on any
particular feature I'm going to talk
about a couple of quick examples but I'm
not trying to hate on any particular
feature or even a framework or a pattern
or an idiom but I want to suggest you
that I think by and large the decisions
that get made the statements that get
thrown around like oh well this is more
readable than that they really aren't
actually taking into account the reader
they're more taking into account the
writer and one of the reasons why that
happens I think is that we seem to be
very drunk on this notion of convenience
we are constantly developing new and
more sophisticated tool chains to take
more and more of the stuff that we used
to do is our daily job and automate it
away so that we can get back to the
important work of thinking about our
code and we are so drunk on this notion
of convenience to the extent that we
will sacrifice the real true non-tribal
knowledge readability of our code all
too quickly now I think one of the
gateways to that is this notion of
convention over configuration and I know
it's a hot-button issue because I know a
lot of people believe very strongly in
this idea of convention over
configuration and I will completely
agree with you that it absolutely makes
the experienced seasoned developer
significantly more effective at their
job there is no question about it but it
also makes the brand new developer who's
not seasoned in that particular set of
tribal knowledge completely lost and I
have personally had this experience on
many many occasions in my career walking
into a place on the first day and being
handed a big thick book that says here
read all of this tribal knowledge and
then you'll understand all of the
conventions that are used when the file
name is this way and it's in exactly
this directory and it just all magically
works we've been come very drunk on this
idea that convenience that ease is the
most important thing there's a really
fantastic talk some of you may have
heard of it before the most recent title
for this talk is simplicity matters an
earlier version of the top
was simple made easy this talk is by
rich Hickey and I honestly genuinely
truly believe that this should be
required watching viewing reading for
all developers not just once but
literally every month for your entire
career and without at the expense of not
repeating his entire talk let me just
give you the simple premise it's this
notion that we go after easiness and we
call it simplicity we think that ease
and simplicity are the same and in fact
they're really not they're very very
different simplicity being the opposite
of complexity complexity being things
braided together tightly bound together
and he suggests this notion in this talk
which if this was a religion I would be
a convert in and disciple to he suggests
this notion that when we go after
easiness first the thing that is quick
and easy for us to grab we oftentimes
end up with complexity incidentally but
up on the other hand we go after
simplicity first we have plenty of
opportunities to grab at the easiness
but you see you have to change what you
value if you value how easy and quick it
is for you to get up and going and how
magical this tool just makes it all work
for you and you don't value the
readability for example then you will
reach for easiness and you will end up
with that incidental complexity so I
think that's one of the ways that we get
ourselves into this problem I want to
give a couple of quick examples because
i know i've been very abstract but i
want to try to give a couple of very
simple concrete examples to illustrate
what i'm talking about in javascript for
example this expression X plus y times Z
now when you write code like that
without any parentheses you are inviting
your reader to participate in a set of
tribal knowledge called operator
precedence if they're aware of operator
precedence then they know that the
multiplication will happen first before
the addition but if they are not aware
of it they might be tempted to think
well I've heard that stuff goes left or
right so maybe it'll do X plus y and
then it'll x z and we as the developers
that are clever it will I save myself a
couple of keystrokes and just took
advantage of operator precedence because
I chose to learn it and I've
suggest that these two key strokes are
really important now those parentheses
are not needed by the computer the
compiler would probably laugh at your
code it chuckles to itself like what a
waste putting those parentheses there
but our codes not for the computer our
code is for the person that reads our
code and doesn't already have that pre
tribal knowledge another example this is
extremely common I do this all the time
in my code the default value idiom using
the or operator and we're saying if X is
not already set then set it to the
default value of 42 super clever right
but I can tell you from firsthand
experience teaching brand new developers
that they struggle to understand what on
earth that is all about and it takes an
awful lot of teaching and and in fact
developers from other languages where
the or and operators don't operate this
way they actually operate returning
boolean values they're like wait how
could 42 come out as a result of that
it's different and weird to them but we
as JavaScript developers we think I'm
clever i'll use what i know of the
language to my advantage that i can save
a few keystrokes lastly the ternary
operator versus something like an
if-else statement now the ternary
operator in and of itself I use it on a
regular basis I'm not saying that is a
bad operator but let me tell you one
example where ternary really goes off
the rails is when you start chaining
them together and you're chuckling and
laughing because all of you have seen
code like this and a few of you have
committed the sin of doing it and see
you invited the reader of your code into
a special set of tribal knowledge not
just operator precedence but another
special set of tribal knowledge called
associativity and for those of you that
understand what I say when I tell you
that the ternary is right associative
where other operators are generally left
associative well i just spoke your
language and you totally understand what
i'm talking about but the rest of you
like what right associate that doesn't
make any sense should we be asking
people to go and study for a PhD exam
before they can read our code or could
we spend a few extra key strokes and
make our code more clear now are you
asking am I saying that we should dumb
down
the code is that what I'm claiming no
absolutely not definitely not i don't
want you to dumb down the code but you
know what i do want i want you to have a
culture in your teams of everybody
learning and when i think one of the
best ways to do that is to have code
review not code review in the style that
you've made me heard about or seen where
it's an insult to a person like oh let's
laugh at how terrible this was that you
feel bad or you feel scared about
submitting your code no I'm not talking
about that at all I'm talking about the
kind of code review where a junior
developer submit something that works
and a senior developer takes the
opportunity to say let me help you learn
a little bit here's an article about
that idiom that you used or that
operator that you use and here's a
slightly better way of doing that so in
the future you have an opportunity to
write better code and then that
developer turns around and participates
in that process with someone else code
review is incredibly important and we
should all be striving for a constant
continual learning cycle that we learn
to teach and then we teach to learn it's
symbiotic a brief note about es6 i know
that there are some really loved
features of es6 and a few maybe not so
loud features of es6 let me just give
you one example of a feature the dot dot
operator now i actually like this
operator a lot but it certainly does a
really good job of hiding some magic
under the scenes and if you teach this
operator completely out of context
somebody just thinks of it as purely
syntactic sugar they don't understand
what it's replacing that it's replacing
the spreading that the apply function
does for example they don't understand
that context so it doesn't make sense to
them why it's being used in that
particular context so i think you can
actually teach these things and we can
develop that culture of constantly
learning the biggest narrative that I
think you should take away about es6 the
features that are in there some of them
i love and some of them are not so much
a fan of but the biggest narrative to
take away from es6 is that it moves us
from more from to the less of the
imperative programming model and more to
a declarative programming programming
model if you're not familiar with the
notion of imperative versus declarative
to put it very simply imperative is
telling it
to do something and declarative is
saying this is what I want to have
happen you figure it out now no program
can be an entirely declarative or
entirely imperative that's not healthy
but it would be a good idea to have a
good mixture of the two and maybe err on
the side of declarative because
declarative forms are easier for people
to learn and understand so I like es6
but I like es6 as long as we commit to
learning and that's why I don't teach
es6 and totally in isolation I always
teach it in the context of what these
forms are improving upon from the prior
versions of the language so what about
abstractions are abstractions good
absolutely abstractions are good it's
just bad when you hide those
abstractions that's really bad don't
hide those abstractions have them right
out there in the open how many of you
have heard of clarks three laws
specifically Clarke's third law which
says any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from
magic I like to be so bold as to
repurpose that quote and say any
sufficiently unlearned technology is
indistinguishable from magic the
abstractions are not bad they make us
more effective but you know what the
purpose of an abstraction is not to hide
stuff it's to make you better at coding
the layer that you were being confused
by so it's to remove confusion and noise
so that you are better at coding that
particular layer good programmers don't
try to hide stuff good programmers
intentionally move things behind
abstractions and they know exactly how
that code works so just don't hide your
abstractions a quick note about code
comments and then I'll begin to wind
down now some people say that code needs
to be self documenting and therefore we
don't need code comments and i think
that's complete nonsense I think code
comments are absolutely important but
the problem with code comments is that
we're often trying to answer the what
question which is terrible you should
not have a line of code that says i
equals i plus 1 and then a comment next
to it that says add 1 to I that's what
the code is for don't answer the
question what that's not the important
question you know what you should answer
why why am i adding 11 is a magic number
what is
the importance of incrementing by one
and optionally sometimes we have to
answer the question how those are the
questions that we need to be answering
with our code comments so to try to come
back full circle here code is about
communication communication can be made
more or less effective if we are better
or not so good at using our keystrokes
wisely so 2 sort of leave you with kind
of a closing thought on that topic I
would suggest that you should try to
make every keystroke and every keystroke
saved count for real value I'm not
saying never use a shortened form i'm
not saying always write the longer form
I'm saying think a lot more about this
than you currently are I want you to
make code that is more teachable and I
think the path the more teachable code
is what's going to make us rich in the
economy of keystrokes thanks very much
for listening I appreciate everybody's
attention I know it's been a long day oh
I ran out of characters again but I
appreciate it very much thanks to the
organizers of this fantastic company
