sure um so I'm mostly an engineer but
I've done a bunch of other bits and
pieces and I helped start the Mozilla
project a quite a while ago and I've
been affiliated one way or another ever
since and I really over the last however
many years it is now I guess it's more
than 15 s about 17 years ago we started
Mozilla my my sort of perspective on on
how software development works and Ken
work and works best has changed a lot in
the sense that I went from an extremely
naive point of view to one that is at
least marginally more enlightened and I
feel like one of the things that I
really picked up along the way was the
the idea of retrospectives and and how
they work and it feels to me like that
sort of helped me and the teams that
I've been working with in recent years
really get better substantially faster
and set up a sort of a framework where
it's easier for us to work together so
that's maybe I got a good start well so
when when did you first start using the
retrospective and how big was the team
it was kind of the situation so I
started using it probably four or five
years ago and this was mostly just me
and another guy and there were maybe a
couple other people who were sort of in
and out of our project we were working
on a an ill-fated gaming a framework
called Gladius for Mozilla and it didn't
really go anywhere but one of the things
that we were doing sort of for the first
time was trying out a bunch of the agile
techniques and so I was sort of given
some pointers from a friend of mine
again in William Petrie who's very very
good at this stuff and he he suggested I
check out some questions that came from
norm curse since I sort of took those
and with me and this other guy would
just get together a week and we we talk
our way through these questions and and
sort of help figure out what we would do
well how we would answer them it's
probably but but how I guess it's going
to be a lot more useful to talk about it
less abstract so the four questions that
we would ask ourselves
time would be what did we do well what
have we learned what puzzles us and this
is sort of an interesting foil question
and what before that is actually what
could we have done better and that's
actually seeing the foil question so
really what this is all about find what
it's been about for me is providing a
cadence of being a little bit
introspective and saying so like how are
we working like what our process is
actually like I don't like process
processes for me kind of annoying except
for the fact that it turns out to be
incredibly helpful when you have really
good process and then incredible
hindrance when you have bad process so I
could go through the questions might be
the easiest way unpack those questions
and by the way are those the four
questions from the guide of New York
that you bear some derivative I don't
actually know why I originally started I
took them from from norm kurth and I
think my friend may have evolved in a
bit and I know that we've evolved in
them that the teams that I've been
working on since then just to sort of
see what helped us the most and this is
where we've landed for now I think
there's a lot more space we could try
yeah yeah so the first question of what
did we do well is really and you guys
should just jump it in holler at any
time if you have ideas or suggestions or
your experiences of like why things work
a certain way or things that I've
forgotten or thinks I'm totally wrong
about which it turns out happens far too
much but what did we do well is really a
nice way to give ourselves credit
because one of the things that I found I
was doing and a fair number of folks
that i was working with were doing over
the years was we were trying to we were
just focusing on well we've got all this
work to do like it's all in front of us
right and one of the things that we sort
of hadn't realized is that paying
attention to it and really giving
ourselves credit for the stuff that
we've just done makes us feel really
empowered and really allows us to say
all right now we can do the next stuff
as opposed to just feeling kind of
overwhelmed because we'll look at that
mountainous to do
so that's sort of relatively
self-explanatory the next one is what
have we learned this week and that's
kind of nice because it comes to it
comes to it forces us to reflect a
little bit around like what's new and
also oftentimes like something that
would be due to one person wouldn't even
be known to the other person and so just
the act of talking about it would sort
of like oh yeah hey that's a really good
idea or you know oh so that's how you
debug that kind of thing and you know
it's it's more context I think for the
stuff that comes next and the one that
comes next is what could we do better
and this is sort of an odd question
because what it's intended to do is say
what could we do better that we already
know how to execute like we just drop
the ball on it like we didn't we didn't
keep track of our velocity this week and
and like we didn't do a good job of
assigning points to bugs and boy that
sucks but we know how to do that but one
of the things that happens almost every
time it gets asked is a bunch of people
will say well we should have shipped our
localization stuff better and that's
completely undefined and we don't really
know what that means but one of the
things that this gives us the
opportunity to do is sort of say all
right that's not really something that
we know how to do that we can do better
that's something that puzzles us and so
you sort of booted on to the next
category and then the puzzle us what is
really interesting for me because it's
one of the things about it is that
you're allowed to just leave on the
table like you're allowed to say if this
puzzles me and then like people maybe
talk about it people maybe don't have
too much to say about it and you move on
but this to me feels especially
important because one of the things that
happens in lots and lots of other
meetings that I've been parts of is the
messenger gets punished when somebody
says oh yeah there's this problem there
with you know the way we're doing our
code reviews and then somebody else says
okay so why don't you want fixing that
and you know that doesn't really make
you want to speak up very much about
problems if you're going to be forced to
own the thing
and so I think that itself is is really
a big deal but the other thing that it
does is and i'm still trying to
incorporate new wording into this
question i feel like because one of the
things is that people it's often sort of
helpful and interesting to just sort of
ruminate and what puzzles us this
particular thing and he what's wrong and
what could we do and all this stuff but
the thing that's my found most useful is
the what are some small experiments we
could try to make it a little bit better
and this sort of goes in in in cadence
with the fact that well the whole thing
is a cadence of you know you have your
retrospective every week and so you this
gives you sort of a chance to try things
without just saying oh well that's
broken we're going to change our process
and that'll fix it and if that goes
sideways well uh and so I could dig
into that more but maybe I've rambled a
bit here yeah ya know and that's really
good you mentioned the cadence and that
was one thing I was going to ask is have
you because you have this continuous
improvement thing of checking in was it
once a week yeah we still do it once a
weekend yeah so do you ever pull back
and go like at the end of a month or a
quarter like a meta retrospective where
you see patterns or do we have a man
will do that at the end of project um
I'm not sure if we've done it enough I
don't know have other people in here
been involved in retrospectives very
much in the past anybody have any
thoughts on that like is frequency more
in the meta question because I feel like
I think I feel like at least in the
groups that I've been working with we
haven't totally worked out the best way
to do that do you I'll go ahead yeah
yeah action items sort of the recording
so someone says they also include action
items yeah well so we do something we've
been doing something sort of similar to
that which I kind of left out which is
at the very beginning of a retrospective
we review the the experiments that are
in flight so usually there's somewhere
between two and five process experiments
in flight from last week
and so what often happens is in the what
puzzle of sections will say well we
could try you know ask ask three people
for a code review and just hope that one
of them picks it up quickly let's just
try that for a week and see how it goes
and so every week we review the list of
stuff and certain amount of the time we
say okay that that works pretty well
let's just declare that a success keep
doing it certain amount of time we just
say we don't really know yet we're going
to do it for another week and a certain
amount of time we're like yeah that's
not really been working and so then we
either try and think of something else
or we just move on and assume that if
it's an important problem it will come
back yeah some more thoughts so what
length of Sprint's was that about all
right and did you know it like you know
I'm really curious about and what kind
of insight did that did you feel like
that sort of percolated up or or this is
all one document it is a long scrolling
google doc and so we copy the template
from the bottom every week to the top we
copy forward the the three or five
experiments that we want to carry
forward and at the very very top we
actually have a successful experiments
list just because we find that that's
pretty motivating pretty much I mean
mostly I've been running the
retrospectives but it's not really that
firm and so and so like if i'm not there
other people run them and some weeks
other people run them anyway and it's
the format sort of helps us track them
because the first five minutes is really
go through each bullet point in the
reviews I'm sorry review the experiments
in progress and then decide what to do
about it and so occasionally will even
say yeah this thing has been on our
review q it's sort of a reminder for you
know five weeks now and it's making no
progress at all this is not the place to
progress this and then somebody can
either decide to pick it up or we just
eject it tamara lee so that it doesn't
screw up our retrospective process to
how big is your team did surgeon our
team
is probably on the order of 10 to 12 at
the moment yeah to pizza for that that's
right yeah I've heard a lot of different
theories on this including some people
who say that the modern thinking is that
Sprint's are a little bit obsolete and
once you get to a certain point you just
want to keep going and have regular
retrospectives but I don't have a lot of
expertise there like I've always done
one in two weeks prints and certainly
I've always done the retrospectives on
the one week cadence which to me feels
about right because it feels like by the
end of the week you're starting to
forget the stuff you cared about at the
beginning of the week and by the end of
two weeks you've like a bunch of stuff
is just gone so I mean the conditions if
feedback yeah i mean the biggest thing
that we try to do i think is we try to
focus on the same the actions you know
the the actions that were taken
regardless of who took them and what
happened around them and not really talk
about who did what when were in that
kind of feedback and part of it too
though is it's really important in a
retrospective to build up trust so that
people can actually feel like that it's
safe to say stuff that it can be a
little bit critical and some of that I
think comes from the puzzled section
like the fact that we were willing to
admit that we're puzzled rather than
than having to pretend that we just you
know well we know this will fix it
and I think some of this too comes from
what we did well because I think that
creates a more sort of confident and
comfortable atmosphere as opposed to
we're back on our heels we got it
we had a fixes and like one of the
things that I try and do that's not as
many other people in the team do and I'm
not quite sure what to make of this is
for the stuff and what we did well like
two fat specifically call out people and
thank them for things that they did well
like when we landed this one thing and
and this one guy drove it it's like dude
thanks is that's fantastic so it's
personal when its positive right yeah
and in person what is it right I think
when it's
yeah did you have one and then a couple
more back there yes I could do that um
yeah I'll have to figure out it will
have to figure out how weird that you
kind of stole one quick question then
we'll definitely get to those but that's
it touches on the question I was just
you mentioned like some things to avoid
right like calling someone out and they
don't are there other things that you
would avoid or caution against when
doing it retrospective no no nothing
wasting chose to mine yeah I feel like
the teams that I've done retrospectives
with have all managed to build up a good
level of trust such that we didn't spend
a lot of time wandering around in
retrospective pain like people found the
retrospective pretty valuable and seem
to be able to open up during them mm-hmm
that wasn't one of the problems we
happen to hit yeah yeah okay there's
there and then one more in the back i
think but go for it yes so i'm gonna i'm
at a waffle how about to do some of them
some really good waffling on the answers
for that one oh yeah repeating the
question so one of the one of the points
was these are these can be pretty
weighty questions and so how can they
like what's a good level of time since
if things are too long people tend to
get distracted and lose focus if it's
sure you tend to miss key stuff what
what's what's a good length of time and
so i'm going to take a little digression
into the way our process happens to work
which is we have a very very distributed
team so what we actually do is at the
beginning of our meeting it's this
fantastic thing everyone shows up and
there's basically silences everyone
types in their bullet points answers to
these questions and then after they're
all in after five minutes or something I
or somebody else like all right we're
probably readies we've pretty much done
and nobody haulers which they almost
never do then we go down the list and
each person taught sort of talks us
through the thing that they wrote up
there the things that they wrote up
there as we hit them and so
I feel like 45 minutes is really
comfortable and works well especially
when things are pretty stable when
things are changing a lot it tends to to
go a lot longer or it can go a lot
longer if you don't just cut it off and
so like right now we're probably at an
hour and 15 minutes which feels too long
like I don't like it but it also feels
like we have a lot to talk about so I
have been in retrospective in the past
where what happened was it took an hour
in 15 minutes and the reason was sorted
towards the end of it people started
rattling on stuff that wasn't really
that important or doing really deep
dives or whatever and so that those
point we like all right we could just
call this but that's sort of what I now
so one more in the back before up there
you go so the question was how to how do
people how do we parcel out the action
items and the experiment management
among different people as they as it as
they happen and so we don't have a scrub
master so it's very organic with us and
it's sort of this mix where oftentimes
it's sort of a parent who should own it
like the person that runs a meeting
typically it makes sense to have them
take the thing that involves changing
the process of their meeting for a
little bit and then there's other stuff
where we get volunteers and then
sometimes there's stuff that nobody
wants to take and sometimes somebody
will ask someone else to take it like
sometimes the manager will and sometimes
we'll just let it fall off like if it's
not important enough and people are
motivated enough to do it and we're not
willing to ask someone to do it then
let's just let's see if it comes back
selection
so when you say so the question as I
understand it is how do we track the
extra work of process changes right no
we have this leads to a variety of sort
of semi related answers how do we track
our stuff in general and and so the
short answer is we don't track the time
spent very closely on very much at one
point we were actually doing substantial
amount of estimation and putting points
on all our bugs lately we've sort of
fallen away from that which I don't
particularly love but it's where our
team is at the moment so I think the
short answer is for at least the process
stuff we mostly don't track it like i
would say that two-thirds of the process
things are really simple like we'll
start with this item at like we'll start
with the list of priorities at the
beginning of stand-up every day next
week it's like that doesn't really take
extra time per se or we'll ask for
reviews in this different way and then
that takes 70 15 minutes to set up in
our in bugzilla so and then the ones
that do take time we just sort of we
don't track it and I think we would
probably be in a better place if we did
track more can you um share maybe an
example of like an aha moment that came
out of a retrospective that you may not
have learned any other way I would say
that the aha moment that's interest it's
interesting for me is that
more than once we had our team sort of
rebooted organizationally and and the
the gnarliest one was where we just got
our boss was set aside and we were moved
into a different organization and this
was run by people who had a very very
different very a very old-school water
folly style process and it wasn't an
option to start with to say oh yeah
we're going to do all this agile stuff
like that just the the people in the
team were not capable of absorbing that
at least all in one piece and so what we
did was we can um we said well the one
thing we want to do is we want to do a
weekly retrospective and the thing that
was so that worked out so well about
that is that we were able to effectively
reboot strap all of our other processes
from the retrospective because he like
you know we were basically said we were
told you will use this old-school
process and it's going to work this way
and at the end of the week we discussed
that and be like yeah so that's not
working very well and what could we try
and of course because we've done this
before we had some pretty good ideas
about what we could try and ultimately
our manager very much bought into this
and she was very impressed with it and
tried to bring other team her other the
other team she was working with some of
those things as well so like to me it
was just an overall that's sort of what
made me a convert into retrospectives
like I'd always found them to be more
valuable than most other meetings and
then that to me like really showed me a
deeper power of some sort so in other
words like the retrospective itself was
a yell tool to convert other people to
agile in some ways yeah yeah or it yeah
and at some level I I prefer to just
talk about agile techniques I think just
because so many people have had agile
forced on them in ways that is highly
dysfunctional but to me the techniques
are the more interesting pieces because
the other thing I sort of learned with
this is that the same techniques don't
work for every team or even the same
team over time so you tweets along the
way absolutely I mean we were using
points and estimation a lot for a while
for quite a while and then things
changed in our context and that became
less desirable to various people for
various reasons and
here we are and I mean whether or not it
was the right call it was it wasn't
gonna politically work so we didn't have
to try and pretend that it would and try
and force it any well thanks i won't
attempt to summarize that because that
was a fair bit but one thing that did
remind me of which is interesting is
that i realized that one of the biggest
vectors for change is framing it in
terms of small experiments because
anytime you suggest we're going to
change this thing that's big and scary
because the people who imagine it as big
and scary treated as what they're
imagining and if you say let's try this
thing for a week nobody gets too freaked
out so what I heard you say was that you
you like the idea of hat leaving
questions on the table and then I didn't
catch the second part of that how do you
handle the experiment that comes oh I
see so in other words we don't ask
somebody we leave it on the table what
happens to the experiment um I think it
varies depending on sort of our various
people in the rooms feeling about the
experiment right like fire manager
things we got to do this he'll ask
somebody to do it or he'll say I'll take
it and figure out what to do about it
and sometimes we just let it be because
one of the things that's nice about the
puzzled question is that a lot of times
or I don't know if with a lot of times
but certainly often enough just this act
of having brought something up and
ruminating about it sort of as a group
has a bunch of value and it turns out to
affect the way that we act afterwards so
sometimes the nature of problems changes
based on just having had the discussion
and so it's often I mean one of the
things that my friend William taught me
about agile too is that one of the ways
that you avoid over managing stuff is to
say if it's important it'll come back
sounds like a key theme that you've
touched on yes I'm any other important
questions no
dan that was awesome thank you we still
need to figure out how to share all that
extra wisdom still residing in Dan's
brain to your request but we haven't
figured that out but Dan's twitterccount
is at demos that's dmos e so between the
aisle 12 at at some point sweet probably
not this week because I have a deadline
this week and it's kind of exciting what
are you learning thanks you good hmm
thank you everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
