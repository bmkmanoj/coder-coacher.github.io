so pitch club really cool I'd love to
get your feedback good or bad just let
me know how I'm doing so you guys could
vote for me on pitch club or give me
your paw to negative feedback I really
appreciate that you should know how I
did how you guys thought that I did so
if you need to know my twitter handle
again it's m kelly 12 if you want to
give you some good or bad feedback on
pitch club so who's here is following
the Occupy movement it's gotten a little
kind of crazy recently all right on a
lighter note I started my own less
political movement called Occupy ie I'm
if anybody's heard of this it hasn't
really taken off yet but we had our
first rally I think he was pretty
accessible there were no tents but
people certainly brought signs some
people were really emotional they're
very sad we've all had good and bad
times DYI some people made some really
clever signs but after a while things
kind of like calm down people lost
interest they walked home except for
there's always that one guy who's just
like way into it you know his sign says
thank you ie for create industry so um
yeah so with or without ie the future is
coming the landscape of how people are
using the web is changing and we need to
change with this I'm gonna talk about
today with responsive design people are
consuming our content on way more
devices than they were five years ago
this is a gardener and she's in love
with her devices most these devices
actually Apple devices so it's not
really giving you the full picture
people are consuming your devices on all
kinds of crazy things
so in some regards the future is already
here mobile traffic is huge especially
we're talking about consuming content
I'm looking at this graph excusing by
2015 traffic
users are going to outnumber desktop
users and it's probably gonna happen
even sooner than that if we're looking
in different countries taking more of a
global view across Asia and Africa
mobile accounts for more than half of
all the traffic
in Africa now more people use phones to
access their bank online but they do
from an actual terminal so smartphones
are much more pullet in these countries
so you see a lot more of this these are
feature phones these aren't like your
fully featured iOS devices so again
thinking about that if you are doing
kind of a world wide app you try and
deliver content to everyone it's not
just about Apple device it's about all
kinds of different devices so this means
new challenges these are actually old
challenges that haven't been important
until now I mean I'm sure like four or
five years ago fluid was like all the
rage right elastic layouts were a big
deal but nobody really got onto it that
don't looks too hard the knee wasn't as
big I mean the upside was okay you take
advantage this giant monitor but the
downside is all this extra work and now
the upside is you're gonna get on all
these devices and people can actually
view your content so it's an old
challenge but now there's a new reason
for us to attack it so take HTC for
example HTC alone has eight different
screen size and resolution combinations
on Android not even counting the
orientation right and HTC is actually
one of the simple or Android lineups
we're not even talking about Acer
Motorola LG Sony Ericsson or the 25
other manufacturers of phones all have
different resolutions all who are
putting out new devices all the time and
that's just Android phones iPads iPhones
Android tablets blackberries kindles
maybe webOS but probably not so
designing a different interface for
every single device and screen size is
impossible you can't do it there's just
too many of them out there they're
coming out too quick but not considering
all these different devices is gonna be
a death sentence if you want your
content to get to the people who want to
view it and you want it to be in a
pseudo presentable way you need to start
thinking about how do I make content as
viewable on every single device without
killing myself trying to do all these
different versions of this stuff so the
old ways a web design don't work so hi
I'm Matt I'm from ZURB service works
over 150 startups to create over a
billion dollars in exits and we've also
worked with a lot of larger companies as
well so we have a pretty interesting
perspective as to what companies are
trying to do where they're looking at
and we've done a lot of work that a
lotta different companies helping them
get there so I think we have a pretty
good perspective what's going on and I
wanted to put a fork in it 960 is done
who here knows what I mean when I say
960
right okay I'm not gonna explain it it's
over right 960 was great it works
awesome for desktop devices we have a
lot of good frameworks out there already
that addressed 960 good grid systems and
it's a very simplistic way to look at
things right
everything is 960 pixels wide if it's on
a larger screen we just have a nice
background color and if it's on a
smaller screen it just gets shrunk down
right this works great on desktops it
works pretty good on tablets and doesn't
really work on phones and this is Jeremy
Keith he calls this 960 the consensual
hallucination right because everyone
believes this and no one is really going
after a mobile or thinking about
differently we've all just kind of been
like well you know this mobile thing
whatever we'll deal with it later 960 is
the world right now let's just stick
with 960 but like I said before we have
to address these different devices so
how are we going to handle this right
are we gonna do dedicated apps for every
device are we going to write devices if
excites or maybe is there something
better they can adjust this problem us
having to write a site that works across
all different devices so let's talk
about dedicated apps first they're still
difficult to build if you're delivering
content via the web you're probably a
web shop you're more familiar with
markup and JavaScript than you are with
like a maybe cocoa so it's a difficult
thing to just jump in and say we're
gonna do like iPhone apps for Android
apps these still to be approved on a
slow timetable if anyone's stuck with
the iTunes Store it's not as fast as
just you know doing a quick deploy at
night to push that to your server to get
an update and all here's the move across
devices if we do an iOS app it's not
going to run on an Android phone
so you're still coding a separate app
every single device they're great for
Angry Birds
I love Angry Birds if you're trying to
deliver you know a device of sitting
like a game then you can go with Angry
Birds I mean building the apps and they
did that make sense in that case but if
you're delivering content if you're
trying to deliver something's gonna be
accessible across multiple devices or
you're kind of in that middle area like
pitch club where you have a web app that
application features there but it's
still content driven and easily
accessible everywhere obviously
native apps aren't gonna work so what
about doing device specific sites when I
say that I mean taking your website and
skinning it to kind of look like an iOS
device site or maybe that look like an
Android app you're gonna put a little
widgets on there they kind of match the
Chrome that way you can still work on
the language you are familiar with which
is web stuff but you're not actually
learning the native stuff the problem is
growth is still heavy on development
because you have to do one for each
different phone to pull off the facade
that hey this is kind of a native app
right they're very difficult to pull all
convincingly and if somebody comes to
your site on an Android and it's skin
that look like an iPhone they'd be super
pissed if you use an Android user you
probably don't like iPhones anyway so
you're gonna be kind of offended it like
though why would I want this like shiny
button right so we'll talk about today
is responsive prototyping but it's
actually rapid response to prototyping
because if we can't do it fast you know
in the world of startups getting things
out there then it's not gonna make sense
business-wise anyway so what's so great
about responsive prototyping like what
are the benefits we're gonna be able to
prototype for every device very quickly
we're gonna cut down steadily on
development by using a single codebase
across all the different devices and
screen sizes there's gonna be less
development work and we're gonna be
ready for a device that don't exist yet
by looking at this from a responsive
viewpoint we're saying we don't care
what the size of the device is it's
still gonna work on any screen size in
the orientation so new devices that come
out it's still gonna work on those it's
not gonna be future proof but it's going
to be future resilient so I mean what is
responsive prototyping what are the
principles for building these kind of
future friendly sites because again
there doesn't think it's future proof so
I think the core concept is responsive
prototyping is about giving up control
you're not going to have total control
over how your content is going to look
on every screen right but this kind of
what's happened already maybe you're
just in denial about that so you have
some content and your content gets down
to your users through a TV an iOS device
that's monitor and RSS feed there's all
these different ways people are getting
at your content and it's delivered to
your users right and you have no control
over how they get there so what we're
gonna do with our responsive way of
thinking about things you're going to
start with our content and layer
everything else on top of that it's kind
of like progressive enhancement where we
say at least our users need to get their
content and we'll layer in all the
pretty stuff on top of that javascript
the fantasy TV just get in the RSS feed
at least be able to read the blog post
see the title and figure out what's
going on get to our content we spent all
this work creating a responsive
prototyping is about doing practical
design reviews the old way of just
firing at Photoshop and creating a
a template in 960 just isn't good enough
anymore right this isn't how people are
viewing your sites so why should you be
doing all your design reviews on a
fixed-width you need to be prototyping
and checking them out across every
single device as early as possible so
rather than creating your stuff in
Photoshop you should be creating it at
least the skeleton for your site right
in the markup look at how I see how it
looks on a phone how does it look on an
iPad on a desktop what's the flow going
to be like between those different pages
that's what you mean by responsive
prototyping and everywhere else you can
you could test out your content and
think through how does your device how
does your how's your design work
everywhere right if somebody sees a link
to your blog post from a tweet and they
click on it they're gonna be on their
phone what's that experience like coming
from a tweet or getting back to Twitter
so now we just need something to
actually help us do this so what would a
responsive toolkit look like what are
some of the tools to build this
framework to help us you know rapidly
prototype these responsive sites the
most important concept is a the
supporting component is having a
flexible powerful and most you know
critically a fluid grid system like I
said before our content is going to flow
to all the different device sizes so
it's important that we have a grid is
fluid to do that rather than a fixed
width grid we'd have styles for images
that don't care about pixels again
because we're really working the fluid
grid or anyway just need to scale up and
down for different devices and we need
tested elements like typography forums
buttons and base styles doing though
these things are just going to work
across all of our different resolutions
right we just want to know we had these
core elements that always work in this
toolkit we don't have to kind of go back
there redo buttons redo forms every time
we do a different layout of our site so
indeed the toolkit like that is why we
built foundation deserve this is blatant
self-promotion but foundation is a
totally open-source framework MIT
license you can do whatever you want
with it I'm just going to kind of use it
as a way to talk around this responsive
stuff but if you go to the documentation
site foundation it looks like this on
the phone it looks like this on an iPad
or any tablet that I matter and it looks
like this on a desktop machine and it's
the exact same code base for all three
of those places we're only using a
little bit of extra presentational CSS
all the structure for this page all the
basic UI elements of the buttons
all part of the the base foundation
toolkit so I kind of want to go into
some of these places explain what these
components do in a foundation how you
use them and why they're useful so first
I'll talk about the grid-in foundation
we have a 12 column grid that you can
nest it's fluid percentage base with an
arbitrary max width so out of the box I
think the max width is like 1024 or
something so it won't flow past that
again there's not a lot of value in
thinking about how does well it depend
on their application there may not be a
lot of value in thinking how does my app
look on ginormous monitors you're
probably more concerned with everything
1024 down but you can just take off one
line of CSS get rid of the arbitrary max
but if you do want to flow the whole
with the page if I default we do have an
arbitrary max width and we modify it by
media queries for small devices so we
take the the perspective on devices they
fall into three categories we have
phones we have tablets and we have
desktop devices so of course we're
responsive our grid doesn't care too
much about what the class of devices are
but when we're designing overall we will
use different UI elements for those
three classes of devices like how it's
gonna look on a tablet the tablet and
desktop don't change too much but
obviously on phones there's difference
iterations that we make we're not going
to take the totally purist approach and
saying no no you know everything has to
be completely responsive across every
single device stuff does need to be a
little bit different for phones but
again we can use the same code base and
we can reuse a lot of the same elements
so I want to illustrate this with an
example every year at ZURB we do this
thing called Erb wired we pick a
nonprofit and we spend 24 hours building
a new website for them new material some
new print stuff and we start at 8 a.m.
and we have 24 hours and 80 in the next
day whatever we have we launch it no
matter what so it has to go to their
life site so it's like a total time
crunch thing this is the end product we
have for Rebekah Children Services they
help with adoption a really cool
nonprofit and like I say we do this in
24 hours so I'll kind of walk you
through the process and how we did this
with responsive prototyping so the first
thing we did is we did sketches sketches
are really important like they're the
fastest way to just get ideas down and
show them the other people obviously we
had to work with a non-profit sell them
on why these new pages were cool why
we're going to dump other pages so we
started by just sketching every single
page is going to be in the new
if it was bad you just crinkle it up you
throw it away the time you invested in
each sketch is like 5 or 10 seconds we
get really fast at it a really useful
tool for rapidly prototyping at this
very low fidelity way from the sketches
we got about three front-end coders who
hacked together the entire site and
foundation and it looked like this so
these are the base foundation styles
there's a tiny bit of presentational CSS
for this hero piece but it's like two
lines the rest of this is all just based
foundation styles and you can see we can
do some fairly complex layouts with just
the basic foundation grid and I'll show
you how this is structured so again if
you're familiar with grids this is going
to be old stuff but it's three columns
on the left and we have nine columns on
the right our hero piece is the full 12
columns and each of these pieces down
here are four columns so there's a
little bit of padding that's inserted in
between each of the columns you
specified so everything is nicely
separated and the mark up just looks
like this super straightforward I get if
you're familiar with grids you've seen
all the stuff before that outside div is
the container which gives us just a
little bit of side padding on the left
and the right to make sure our content
is it pushed up right against the edge
of the page within that we create our
row which has against the padding it's
going to go max with 100% or if you have
you her art rated max it's not going to
extend past the 1024 pixels and within
that we have our three columns on the
left and our nine columns on the right
and we end up with a little bit of
padding between the two columns section
everything is spaced out really nicely
we can toss another row below that and
the row below that we can take a row and
we can nest two more rows within that
column and you can keep going crazy you
can get a pretty complex layouts here's
another page it's like an all in the
foundation base tiles eight columns for
our hero piece within that we're gonna
embed a row two columns on the left for
the image and then the remaining ten
columns on the right so I mean just with
a little bit of markup you've got some
really nice structure for your page
right so that's all good and fine I
talked about how this works really well
on mobile responsive portion is let me
take a row this is how it looks on a
desktop or a tablet we have all of our
columns X each other when we go to phone
we automatically take all those columns
and just stack them right on top of each
other so I mean well the app you
probably use the most on your phone is
email so you're used to opening email
and seeing your content linear top to
bottom right so the base idea for
foundation is well people you seen their
clients top to bottom let's take all the
columns and just stack them top to
bottom so right out of the box if you're
using foundation for your layout you've
got a pretty decent look of how
everything is going to be laid out on
the phone they can just scroll top the
bottom nothing's going to get buried you
can also hide things on mobile I'll talk
a little bit more in a second so we have
these different classes for the grid one
column two column three columns you can
offset your columns if you want to take
your columns with a space next to them
and you can just Center the columns if
you want to do a center type of layout
you can just say three columns centered
those columns will be in the middle of
the row
so I mentioned images before argument
just need to scale up or down depending
on what the grid tells them to do so the
width of our image is just whatever
right whatever the content tells the
image to be that's gonna be the width
the CSS declaration we use for that is
it max width 100% this ensures that the
image is never stretched past this
native size but as it gets pushed down
the image will shrink down because
remember a responsive prototype is all
about giving up control we don't know
how our contents going to be viewed the
image to be viewed at any different size
so images in response to design they
have to be able to scale for different
devices they have to be large enough to
handle the very large screens because
again we're not going to scale them up
so when they reach their native with
they're just gonna stop and if you're
concerned about loading very large
images on a mobile device then there's
some really cool back-end solutions so a
foundation doesn't deal with anything on
the back end it's totally a front-end
framework if you want to do some neat
stuff Scott JAL has a responsive images
solution that's really cool
it lets you serve different image sizes
for different devices because obviously
for doing these like giant you know
megapixel images for the big screens we
don't want to serve those same things on
the phone you're gonna take forever to
load the page so typography forms and
buttons at ZURB we're like we're really
big on CSS buttons I don't know if you
guys seen any of our button blog posts
there's like a ton of button stuff I
don't know this guy's like button nuts
so here's what the buttons look like in
foundation on an anchor tag just add
small blue button and you get a small
blue button right very straightforward
looks pretty good other colors in there
we can also have a large blue button a
large blue radius button gives it a
little bit of corner rounding right
that's really hot and a large nice
radius button this is I think the only
image and all the foundation is this
little button shine so you wanna get
this shine of the button add the nice
class looks a little prettier so again
going back to Rebecca children services
we went from the wireframes to building
out the entire site in two hours three
front-end coders we're just like going
through all those sketches and throwing
together this this framework we could
then look at from there to the other
guys about seven hours to go from that
to the actual visual design so the huge
advantage of us doing this is we were
able to take those wireframes on the the
left the basic site in Foundation gave
to the development team so they start
hooking everything up with a Content
back-end so they're working on that in
parallel to the front-end team doing the
visual design and this this actually
work it's kind of crazy and at the end
they just added the CSS and we got the
styling for that so that way we were
able to have our visual designers doing
all the fancy work and Photoshop
chopping stuff up and paralleled the
developers it let us do this entire site
I think it has like 20 pages on it to
get the whole thing done it looks really
sharp in our 24 hours so here's what the
final site looks like on a browser on
the desktop here's what it looks like on
a tablet device mostly the same but you
can see some of stuff is flowed down a
little bit and here's what looks like on
a phone so before I talked about how we
address you know phones differently from
the browser the desktop so we actually
use a different nav element on the top
we use one that's stacked top to bottom
so you can get to your where you're
trying to go with Clee on the phone but
the other stuff is just being stacked
like I showed you so that hero piece
shrinks down to that width we have the
image and all their content is down
below you can just scroll get everything
you need so you guys were promised to
talk about responsive web apps and I'm
gonna talk a little about web apps those
are mostly content sites we just talked
about Rebecca Children's Services this
is a web app that we launched it's
totally free it's called spur it lets
you do visual design critiques online so
you upload an image and then you can
apply these different filters to do a
really quick visual design critique so
like I'm gonna have heard that the
squint test take your visual design
squint if it still looks good then it's
a good design so this lets you
do that kind of training tool it uses
foundation it doesn't use the responsive
grid but it does use the targeting of
the three different classes of devices
desktop tablet and mobile so this is
what spur looks like on a desktop device
and then on the iPad we remove some of
the things that don't make sense so it's
a simpler layout on the top in
foundation we have these classes you can
apply to any element you can just say
hide this on a tablet hide this on a
phone or only show this on desktops so
that those elements are only shown to
those devices it's still gets served
every device because again foundation is
just running in the browser client-side
but it lets you really quickly when
you're prototyping just say yeah don't
show this now for the tablet only show
up for the desktop so we're showing a
different share element it stacks below
it it uses the space a little better on
the tablet device we want to find the
actions a little bit going down to the
phone we're still using that same nav on
the top but that's just a uol with some
li elements in it we're just hiding the
lis they don't make sense anymore so now
that we're on a phone like the rotate
test doesn't really make sense anymore
cuz you can just take the phone and
rotate it or just turn your head so we
hit that and some of the other ones so
we can make sure that all those buttons
are still clickable I think the
usability guideline you need to have I
think it's like 15 things by 50 pixels
at least for each clickable area on a
phone so using that as a guideline we
said okay how many you know filters can
we actually get in the top they're still
gonna be clickable without you being
frustrated hitting the wrong thing so
you got where the one didn't make sense
we're still able to deliver a pretty
good experience on the phone but we're
using foundation to just deliver the
things that make sense so this is
another app called axe axe lets you give
lets you critique a website by just
cutting stuff off of it and this one is
I don't even know you would call this I
guess it's responsive in the way that we
serve a very different experience for
each class of device so this is the
homepage how it looks across all three
different devices and it's totally
different
axe is a touch app so you have to be
able to touch the screen to actually act
stuff off and take it off the page so it
doesn't make sense you can't actually
use that portion of the app on a desktop
or a mobile device so on mobile devices
we're using those classes again or we
just show a different div it says on
mobile sorry only works on tablets but
here's a video where you can like watch
how it works
same thing for the desktop and the
tablet device we do show the actual
experience and the markup just looks
like
we have three different divs the first
one says showed this on desktop show on
phones show on tablets so if you're
using foundation you can just use this
these classes is to only show elements
on certain devices if you have a huge
amount of markup in each one of these
tags then maybe you don't want to use
when you go to production but while
you're prototyping it's a super quick
and easy way to say just show this on
the phone let's look at the phone and
see how it's going to go right when you
get to production you can put something
on your server code where you can sniff
the the user agent and say all right
don't serve this on these certain
devices for this we don't have a lot of
mark h1 of these divs so we actually
rolled a production with this the page
weight still wasn't that bad so we just
went like that it was fine this is what
one of the content pages on app looks
like this is the about page explaining
more of what app is so you can see again
on the desktop and a tablet the
experience is pretty similar but on the
right on the phone we've taken all the
element we stack them top to bottom so I
feel it easier to read you can just
scroll down and all the ailments look
the same
and even if you look at the text on the
tablet versus the desktop device you can
see the text is wrapping differently
because we're using the whit's so I want
to show you the video of actually going
through acts on the tablet you type in a
URL I did CBS Interactive when you click
on exit we're gonna actually capture
that page so on mobile devices people
don't always know what the touch
interactions are so our waiting for this
to load we actually show a little
infographic all in JavaScript of what
the different interactions are you can
like scribble on there to add notes you
can touch it whole to add a note or you
can use two fingers or scroll up and
down and by the time you've done
watching that the page is loaded we can
see the CBS Interactive page so I'm
gonna scratch out this marquee thing you
can't see it here because didn't capture
with a server capture tool just kind of
lame but there's this like marquee tag
type thing and I could touch it hold and
say you know no marquee please or you
know let's not give them a marquee tag
thing this is kind of my my axe feedback
right scroll back up I can give it a
quick little title boys have me up there
then say update so that's what the
experience is like on the tablet device
for actually capturing a page scratching
something out and give you some quick
feedback so when I clicked on that tap a
title on the top you saw that little
modal pop-up it looked a little slow so
this is this is acts in kind of
development mode I'm just gonna click on
these things a couple times it feels a
little sluggish there's this common
perception that html5 apps on mobile
devices are slow and part of that is
anytime you click and you're binding to
the click handler if you perform an
event from a click somewhere there's a
300 millisecond delay that's inserted by
the device because they're waiting for
you to double click to zoom right
because that's what the the device is
for the touch of it so if you bind to a
click event it's not gonna fire a few
milliseconds maybe you didn't notice it
right there but each one of those clicks
had a three die most like an delay if
you build a whole app around that the
whole thing feels kind of sluggish like
you're moving through a little bit of
honey so even though we're saying you
can't scale this window up or down you
just scalable zero it doesn't matter the
iOS device is still gonna say no no
we're gonna wait for that at the double
I think the latest build of Android will
respect this and won't put that delay in
saying hey they're not gonna scale the
window anyway I'm not gonna wait for
that double tap and they're gonna fire
they click on it right away but I know
for a fact right now on iOS that's not
the case so maybe they'll change that
but just you can see how pronounced that
is we actually look at the contrast so
here I have said that when you click on
tap to title it's going to open it with
a touch event which does not have the
delay and then it's gonna close the
modal with the click event which has a
300 millisecond delay so see if you can
see the difference between the two
clicks
when you see them side-by-side it's
really pronounced like what the
difference is that 300 milliseconds
makes a huge difference in user
perception of what's going on right it's
like what's going on is it kind of
thinking they may not cognitively or
consciously realize what's going on but
there's just this perceptions created
like oh the whole app is kind of slow
jQuery Mobile has the same problem where
because they've taken the hard line of
saying we're going to support every
single device with these these touch
events they have a branch that does the
touch this have a delay but the master
branch jQuery Mobile uses the click
event so every jQuery Mobile app it's in
the wild right now has this delay that's
why they all feel a little sluggish it
just kind of creates a perception it
like yeah mobile apps are just not that
cool that are in the browser html5 apps
totally so you can buy into the knocks
down events which is my next point so
you can bind to the mouse now at a touch
event or whatever Mouse down actually I
don't know if that helps you but um you
can bind a touch which will fire
immediately but the problem with touches
on again on iOS devices I believe on
most most tablet devices if you want to
then focus on that input area you can
only do that from a callback on a click
of it so we're working through this
right we want to be able so you tap on
that the texture you should come up it
should focus on it you know bring up the
keyboard that's the best visual
indicator that hey I want you to type
something in right that's way better
than having it open it's like okay you
know I click on the input right removing
user clicks is always great for a good
user experience and we're all about
making people happy so but you can't do
that I don't even know how they pull
this off but on tablet devices
if you touch and you bind the touch
events and then you try to say you know
focus this text area it just doesn't
work it just ignores it if you do from a
click event than it does so here we have
to like make this choice I don't know
you guys me Penny Arcade all right we we
have to make this choice where do I want
to either have the fast touch event or
do I want to be able to auto focus on
that and our experience developing acts
was that doing mobile stuff in html5
there's just a lot of trade-offs you
have to decide what do I want do I want
like the kick in the in the butt or the
poke in the eye what's it going to be so
we opted here for the focus in a text
event so we're in we're gonna have the
delay which sucks away for three
I guess not as pronounced if you're
trying to like actually move something
on the screen or perform some different
actions we're just trying to open a
dialogue so we decided to go to the
delay it's just really nice to have you
click on that and then have that
keyboard pop right up and you can see
okay those types of a new right followed
choices the other thing is some stuff
just actually is slower on mobile right
if we're doing Ajax requests we want the
user to feel like they're in control of
the interface so we want everything to
react very quickly at least give them a
visual indicator right away that hey
something happened so here we are gonna
buy a touchdown events but when you
click on the share button the top right
I'm sorry the saludable
we immediately swap that out for a
spinner saying like hey something's
happening right that action took about
maybe a second a second and a half to
run which does this seem like a lot but
give that immediate indication that
something's happening in the mobile
device makes people feel like there's
stuff going on again they're coming in
using this app with a preconception that
it's gonna be kind of slow if you can
make it fast instead they're gonna be
like oh I thought this is slow it's
really fast I'm a happy person same
thing for this button at the top right
this is our share action so another
thing we're talking about tablet devices
versus desktop devices when we let you
share this on Act's there's no point in
that's doing the traditional share which
is just a text area where you can then
copy and paste a link right this is what
we're kind of programmed to do to share
something grab a link you know share on
Twitter whatever on mobile that's really
painful I have to like tap and hold
select the whole thing copy it go to
another app like Twitter and then paste
it it's really painful so why do that we
can just do like a mail to mail to suck
on desktop devices because not a lot of
people have the default mail client
hooked up but on tablets and on phones
everyone has a default mail client
hooked up so mail 2 becomes an extremely
powerful tool for you to use on tablet
and phone devices I mean you saw how
nice that experiences on the iPhone
actually pops that overlay mail overlay
right over your browser it's pretty
sweet
so once we've shared something on Act's
we have a URL so this is what if I take
that email that's my buddy
and he was opening my feedback this is
what it would look like on the iPad it
look it looks pretty much the same you
can't draw it anymore and now we have a
share button did the same thing that we
saw it pops up the the email or we can
access our page if you want to do that
so this is where I become responsive
again so before we were saying you can't
create page in the desktop but now we
actually my desktop version so you take
this and you share it this part of the
app is responsive and then I see this on
my definite device so somebody email me
and I opened it in Chrome I see this the
most of the content is exactly the same
because we're using foundation it just
scales up and in the top right well now
we're going to use the more traditional
sharing mechanism of Twitter Facebook
and an input text area because now on my
computer I plan email open I copy I
paste it I tweet it out whatever that
makes sense on my desktop device and
this is what it looks like on a phone
what is it this only makes sense so we
just hide it so we are using some
different nav elements we're just
getting rid of an ad all together again
we want to make sure that you can see
click on things so it's a big share
button to show this feedback does the
same thing a tablet device does it's
gonna pop up in your email client and we
shrink everything down stead of fits
even the size that notes is smaller and
obviously on a phone you don't have
hover so you can't hover to see a note
so these are tap you can toggle them on
and off on the desktop use hover over
each note there's all these different
iterations you have to make if you're
thinking about how is my content gonna
consume it across all these three
different devices right can I create
content on three devices and if not can
I at least share it so because once you
let someone open that email and send it
out you've been given up all of your
control right we're gonna force you when
you interact you have to do on a tablet
that's kind of sucky that's the way it's
gonna be but you send the content out it
needs to work everywhere when someone
opens that email throughout a tablet
their phone their desktop be able to
open it and see it without any problems
so another little pro tip technical
challenge of working the responsive
world if you're storing these
annotations on different devices make
sure you're storing them as percentage
values and not as an actual life
absolute pixel value so right we're
storing the height to this we're gonna
store it as like 0.341 42 whatever not
80 things
in the top by storing as a percentage
with we just do this math over here and
we can display it on any size in it
because remember we don't know what size
the image is going to be so later we
pull it from the database we want
actually render these notes out we just
take our percentage width and height
multiply them by the actual width and
height and we can see it the downside of
this is that we have to know what's the
size of this image and we don't know
what that image size is until it's
loaded so if you have a super long image
they didn't wait for a while on mobile
until they see any other notes so it's
again it's about trade-offs right
Sophie's Choice what do you want do you
want to wait to load the image to load
the note how'd it work on every single
device or do you want to have it load as
soon as it shows up on the page but then
it's not gonna be responsive so what
what else can we do with these
responsive layouts right kind of what's
the mental model around this again like
I said about before understanding the
user intention the mobile device is huge
right when we sent the email from acts
we're sharing this link I just want to
view it my intention is to just view the
things that just show it to me whatever
device I'm at make that viewing
experience really easy right if I'm on
the tablet I want to create something
let me just create very easily content
first and navigation later when you're
designing design with the content in
mind don't start getting into it this
like this this hierarchy that tends to
break down other devices where you have
these very large knobs on the mobile
device that don't really work get your
content in their first nav lighter on
mobile it's totally cool to take your
nav and throw it down below the content
right if I come in here from Twitter and
I want to see a blog link the first
thing I don't want to see is like 10
navigation items at I parts of your site
just show me the title show me the
content let me read it and get back to
my tweets and be mindful of different
events like touch events or just click
and hover state again on tablets there
is no hover state how are you addressing
that and watch out for things like the
the like button right where you see just
taking a like button just drop it on a
page wham we have Facebook integration
if you try to like button on a mobile
app it generates something like I don't
know 30 HTTP requests it's just going to
drag your whole site down it's really
slow the current one is not optimized
for mobile you're probably better off
using the super old-school one it's just
the link the actual iframe like button
totally sucks up cool devices and cause
all kinds of weird problems and it's all
exact response because it's an iframe
for JavaScript modernizer is a great
tool for feature detection
give a talk about layering things on if
you want you said like local storage the
moderniser is awesome if you haven't
checked it out definitely look at that
and then we package to JavaScript
plugins in Foundation orbit and reveal
orbit is a fully responsive image slider
and reveal is a pretty basic Moodle tool
is also responsive toss the models up so
I want to talk a little bit about orbit
and the technical challenge we had to
overcome to make it work on responsive
devices so this is what orbit looks like
on foundation it's fully responsive so
it's going to shrink or contract to
whatever the width of the column that is
in so of course you resize your browser
up or down or risk going to size up or
down most image sliders have a fixed
height that a fixed width so they can do
all the math as to how they're going to
do the animations that slide the images
they can slide on top to bottom they
Athen know where everything is right we
took a little bit of a different tack
with orbit where we said we're going to
use absolute positioning to do our
sliding and we're not going to do
overflow:hidden on our container which
puts some more constraints on us but we
also feel like I kind of got it working
so the two things that orbit does that
Oh places that do it again is we're
using absolute positioning for the stuff
behind it slide pieces around and we
also have overflows not hidden thing you
can also have content slides in orbit so
it's not just images and content creates
another problem where if I just have
five slides of content like divs with
markup in it those aren't going to
shrink up and down just like images do
right maybe simply take for granted is
that images as you change the width of
an image the highest changes also it
maintains that asset ratio as we're
scrolling the page up and down that
doesn't happen for div so if our image
slider we had to find a way to do that
so what we do is we actually go through
each one of the images in the slider we
find the largest one which represents
hopefully the size of the whole slider
take it we copy it to the back position
it relative to everything else so it
kind of holds everything together and we
make it invisible and everything just
slides on top of that so that way you
scroll the page up and down as this
thing flows that image is maintaining
the aspect ratio for your whole your
whole slider so there's still slides up
or down so this is this kind of like
hidden div behind this slide up and down
if you don't have an image if you're
using an all content slider then you
specify an aspect ratio when you fire up
orbit obviously if it's just content we
didn't know like okay like how tall do
you want what's the aspect ratio right
there's no width and height in fluid
programming so you can just say I want
this content to be sixteen by nine on my
slider we use a placeholder which serves
that placeholder images and we just get
a 16 pixel by 9 pixel image we take it
we stretch it out to be the size of the
entire container and then we use that so
again using the magical property of
images where the height shrinks up and
down with the width we can then have our
image slider we'd be totally slidable up
and down just by using the placeholder
service and then everything slides nice
happily across all these area devices
either if you're using all content
slides so there's definitely some
interesting challenges to making all
this stuff we've always taken for
granted working in these fluid and
responsive designs but it's kind of fun
to work on on the server side there's
still things we can do to have a
responsive site you can just send people
to a mobile site if you don't want to do
the responsive layout that's the thing
you can do optimizing requests and
caching Firebug weitzel and PageSpeed
are all great tools that you use on the
desktop to just see how many HTTP
requests do you have is everything
caching properly the optimization may
not get you a ton for desktop users but
it goes a huge way from mobile users if
you have an app that has a lot of pages
within it you're not caching your assets
every time and they're having to pull
down all of your JavaScript or every
single page load it's ridiculous it's
really gonna hog the thing down even if
you're caching your JavaScript costs
different pages the browser still has to
render the JavaScript across each page
so different things you can do is split
the JavaScript up all the rules that
apply for the the desktop if these tools
show you they apply for the mobile
device as well so again being very
fastidious about I'm gonna have all my
requests be cached and have them be fast
it's gonna go really long way from your
mobile people very happy and then
creating device profiles the better
tailor content delivery like I was
saying there's three classic devices
mobile devices tablets and desktops so
this is how we have to build now there's
really no going back I don't think like
mobile devices are going away phones
aren't going away and there's really not
going to be some kind of like a magical
technology solution that's gonna make
all of your pages look really good right
the whole pinch-to-zoom thing it kind of
works but it's not great so again just
review like what are the things we
should be doing
design reviews on real layouts right get
out of Photoshop as early as you can
just get the code you just need to have
this stuff blocked out in the pages just
see how does it look how's the content
gonna flow up and down all the different
devices sites that work well on
arbitrary devices we don't know what
tablets gonna come from HTC next month
who knows we've seen like so many crazy
resolutions so part of foundations we
have to maintain all of these different
media queries to be able to determine
like what the device is right media
queries have an attribute that says like
it is a handheld or not they don't they
don't work that implemented the only
thing you have that we haven't
foundational a tool that we have is
looking at the dimensions of the device
and based on that we've created all
these different rules to test every
single app we can get our hand on every
tablet we've tried them out and see okay
you know flag this as a tablet flag this
as a mobile device so we're creating
this like huge wizardry of logic to work
on this always arbitrary devices
including device it don't quite exist
yet so the challenge for us is to keep
getting new devices and testing them a
challenge for you is just use foundation
and be happy that we had this library
media queries for you so that's how you
prototype quickly for a future friendly
site and that's all I've got</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
