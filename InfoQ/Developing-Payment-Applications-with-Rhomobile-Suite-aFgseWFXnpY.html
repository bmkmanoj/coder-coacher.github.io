mobile Suites payment industry is going
through a lot of changes recently very
interesting a lot of breakthroughs new
technologies coming in so this is the
right time to be in payment solutions
the agenda today is like three of them
one is just understanding the basics of
payment payment is a pretty complicated
process because money is involved so
understanding the basics of payment and
then what is Motorola offering its MPM
100 Motorola's payment device that was
released just a few days ago how it
works and what you can do with that
and after that we'll talk about
developing payment applications using ro
mobile and then we will say what's our
future looks like what's the vision what
do we want to go from here that's that's
the agenda and I do have a demo we have
written a ro mobile application to take
the credit card application our card
information and then it pretends like
it's doing bank transaction you can scan
and then you take the credit card
information and then you can print a
receipt that's what the demo does and we
we ran and we took the demo application
run it on 81 Android device what fine
took the same demo application ran it on
windows mobile device what fantastic so
that's a good demo or at least to begin
with okay so the basics of payment what
is a payment today well let me start
with this the payment is a lot today in
terms of you go to the grocery stores
you go online they all have different
types of payments in terms of what
happens behind the scene but we are
getting into the mobile payment here
with our devices which are mobile
devices
Motorola devices right so in a nutshell
what happens when you go to the grocery
store you someone scans the items does a
price check and then comes up with total
and taxes figures out the taxes and then
they will show it to you and then you
have to say yes I like yes I I want to
pay for that and then you take your
credit cards swipe it here in u.s. tap
it in UK or in Europe and then after
that Bank you may have to do pin you may
have to enter PIN if it's a debit card
transaction and signature comes later
but I just added it there and then it
goes to the bank a whole whole different
world up there a lot of things happen
there and then the approval comes
through and then you take that and then
you print the receipt hand it to the
customer that's the end of the
transaction
that's the basic but a lot of things
that happen in each of these steps we
won't get to details into this but I'll
skim through all of those steps and if
you have any questions stop me and ask
me and if I think that it's gonna take a
whole big discussion on it we can do it
offline later now how many of you are
already in payment today so maybe you
can correct me if I'm making mistakes
because we are also very new to this we
weren't in payment before we had DC ours
before and DC ours was kind of a you
know debit card reader we did a few
things but for the first time we are
getting into the real payment so this is
this is what happens so you this is the
the latest device that I was talking
about NPM 100 we also call a 10 p.m.
mobile payment module at least in this
discussion I may say reader terminal
payment device any one of these names
then we have more troller device mobile
device mobile computer that's for our
devices right and then you have so the
conversation between mobile device and
NPM happens with Bluetooth and then
Motorola device talks to the gateways
acquirers card networks all of those
through Wi-Fi or van depending on your
setup so that's that's the the picture
what were you picture of what will
happen when you start using Motorola
solution okay coming to that today in
u.s. a lot of us have credit cards and
they're all maxed ripes
maybe few of us have smart card smart
cards but many of us have only max type
max ripe is good for you know it does
payment on it
max ripe readers could do also other
things or driver's license and for other
applications normally there are about
three tags or tracks there may be four
tracks in some countries but here in
u.s. is three tracks it will have a
number of information like account
number account holder name expiration
data and all of that there are Mac
stripes for credit and Mac's right for
debit but the problem with this is it's
not very secure fraud can easily happen
and also it stores limited amount of
data compared to the smart cards
the thing with this even if fraud occurs
you won't feel the pain as long as you
are using a credit card because you
don't have to pay for it all you have to
do is claim and say I didn't do that and
they will take it out of your account
that they will cancel it well that's a
whole different thing if you're using a
debit card right so you're already paid
for that so but someone else is paying
for the fraud and the goal is to reduce
that one of the ways is to go with smart
card so that's max right that's low tech
that's there today all over the world
now we are coming to the next generation
of payments right EMV europay MasterCard
Visa but now it's Amex discover all of
them are supporting this all over the
world so it can do credit and debit just
like mac stripe with chip card
technology that is a microprocessor in
there and it's also card IC card smart
card chip and pin number of ways it has
more security and capability is built
into that we will talk a little bit
about all of these securities and
capabilities in the next few slides and
it may sound new to us but there are
already a billion EMV cards out there in
the world so advantages of EMV mode for
most of the part we are going to talk
about EMV here because Mac stripe is is
pretty simple in what it can do and how
the process works so with with EMV is
harder to do data skimming so today you
go to the restaurant you give your
credit card to them and they take the
credit card and they go away somewhere
and then they bring back the cheque and
then you sign it what happened there you
don't know and the restrictions if there
are any restrictions country
restrictions or bank restrictions if
there are any that's not easier to
enforce with Mac's right is much easier
with smart cards offline transactions
where you don't have online banking
services available
how does offline work right so that's
much more secure with smart card
compared to Mac's right Mac's right
there is absolutely nothing you have to
go go byte rush you assume he has money
in his account when you take offline
with the max right stores more data than
max right and another great thing about
smart card is when you have a car is
it's either driver's license or credit
card or debit card or some other
with smart card it can play multiple
roles it can be credit debit it can be
your healthcare identification card they
could all be in one you see where the
future is going finally so they all
could be there on one single card well
if you lose the card that's a whole
different thing but still there are if
you lose the car still there are some
built-in securities in there so that
could save you there's a chip like I
said right smart card there's a chip and
there are certain applications sitting
on the chip now when I say application
just to make it simply simplified let's
assume there are a set of rules as to
how the reader or the Payment device
should behave or what should happen if
there is no online connection so let's
call the rules as payment application
for now it's a little bit more than that
and it stores information secure
securely it's not easy to read what's on
the chip perform cryptographic
processing encryption and all of that
we'll talk a little bit more on that as
a huge subject how the encryption is
done and there are two means of making
connection with the with the mobile
payment devices or the readers like I
said one is contact you take the card
and then you slide it in you insert it
into the payment device and then it
treats it other one is contactless
tapping the card on the on the reader
there is a difference and we will also
talk about what's the difference between
these two when it comes to it's the same
card but what would happen in the
background as far as the processing is
concerned and other thing is if a card
has a chip on it
this possibility there is also a
magnetic stripe on the back of the car
and you take it to a reader that's
capable of reading the smart card and
you try to use the max right it may
refuse it you have the smart card use
it may because some may allow it
mm-hmm okay so next slide okay so one or
two differences in contact so contact
and contactless contact has to be in
contact until the transaction is
complete
what's the transaction all the way from
okay I'm ready to pay for it
slide the card in yes and someone reads
the data massage is the data checks and
make sure it's valid and then builds a
package out of it and sends it to the
acquirer and acquirer does a bunch of
things and then approval comes back and
once the approval comes back that's
where max stripe star stops max rep is
done once you read the card data where a
smart card the approval coming back Bank
would tell you I want you to update the
chip with these information so that
information goes back on the chip
what are those information it could be
how much money is left in your balance
is there or what's the maximum of
offline transaction you can do that
could change or depending on the country
you are in or depending on how much you
are buying those kind of things
contactless it's well you don't keep on
holding like this until the transaction
is complete you tap and then you take it
out so when you tap it it reads the data
and not all the things that happens with
contact doesn't happen with contactless
it's faster but you're paying a price
for that that means you're not the the
chip doesn't have all the information
that a contact transaction would okay so
let's just talk about how this EMV smart
card works in max right after the
reading the card you don't need a card
it's all done you still have to be
around to sign or put the pen in but
it's all done in EMV the card data is
read and the
rules set by the card issuers are
enforced so it's not just about reading
so what would happen is the Payment
device asked the chip okay what are the
applications we want to use and what are
the rules set by the bank and then they
both agree to say okay I am capable of
enforcing these rules that's what the
Payment device says and if they both
match then the transaction occurs so all
of that handshaking between the chip car
the smart card and the payment device
has to happen while while you are paying
that doesn't happen with the Mac's right
and the issuing bank dictates which
rules are enforced for the current
transaction once again a lot of things
matter as to how the transaction takes
place
what's the offline behavior has to be
what is the identification process that
you have to follow it may be different
from country to country so that's what
the issuing bank and forces and those
rules are usually read off of the chip
and for some reason they are
incompatible reader says whatever the
rules you are asking me to enforce I'm
not capable
I don't know how to get a signature then
in that case no transaction that's where
it ends that's the refusal okay here is
a very easy way of putting what how eme
works right so you start the the reader
says okay someone is asking me to do a
transaction so now it communicates with
the chip and then chip opens up the
communication the card and then this
select an application for this
transaction that you are doing this
application these set of rules have to
be negotiated between those two so chip
has chip says these are my rules
Reed says yes I am
stand those rules I can enforce them
right and then once that happens the
reading of the card occurs the card rate
data is read now encryption we come to
that a little bit later and then offline
authentication what's the offline
authentication that has to happen and
then it goes to the verified rules now
that I read the rules how do I verify
that it's set by the issuers allow me to
go forward with this transaction that's
verified and then the verification of
the cardholder has to happen right do
you do you tell the person to look at
the picture of that guy fingerprints or
pin CBM how do we make sure that's the
cardholder so that information is coming
off the chip and then reader is
enforcing that and after that there is
some risk analysis that the reader goes
through what's the risk if this happens
if I have to go offline what's the risk
and then it tells the chip okay this is
what I am gonna do and then chip says
okay I agree I'm fine with that
my rules allow me with what you're
suggesting so once that happens now the
reader takes the card data and builds a
package for the acquirer and it knows
how to talk to the acquirer and the
acquirer gets the package and that's how
the EMV transaction occurs one thing
it's not complete here but what happens
is once the data comes back from the
bank that may get written to the chip
back again so that's one thing that may
be missing here so as you can see this
is between and the payment device or the
reader now we are going to move up a
little bit we we read the data we read
the card now what's going to happen
only half the story reading the card is
only half the story the other half is
now we got to do bank transaction
someone gotta pay for this so let me
just go through I'm I'm just repeating
that determine the amount display the
amount it is a requirement in all
countries you have to display the amount
so that the and the customer says yes I
agree to pay for that amount and then
you read the card data request for pen
if required for debit and then the
encryption data occurs right and once
you read it and then that package that
the date are you read from the smart
card is sent to the acquirer who sends
it in this case mobile devices sensing
our devices Motorola devices sensor not
the payment device is not capable of
communication mobile devices are so it
can be through Wi-Fi or it can be
through van so the data goes to the P
where is this a quarter a quarter gets
the data does a bunch of things and then
say oh this is visa this is MasterCard
let me pass it to the card network it
goes to the card network there do a
bunch of things and then say who is the
issuer of this now of this card
oh it's chase let me send you the chase
so it goes to chase chase is the one
that checks do you have enough money to
pay for this yes music verified
authentication is done yes everything
checks good and then it says okay pay
for it
so that's we already jumped three now in
the future that number of jumps we have
to do may come down in numbers why go
through wires why not go to the Visa
MasterCard directly
so that's the request going to the bank
to the issuing bank card issuing bank
all the way and this is the data coming
back from the card issuing Bank
so card issuing Bank says okay he has
enough money enough funds prove it and
that goes to the acquirer I'm sorry that
goes to the coordinate work card network
from there it goes to the acquirer
acquirer sends it to the merchant margin
says oh nice now signature capture now
signature capture is a kind of a weird
thing pin has to happen before the
transaction begins with the bank where a
signature depending on the country
either signature is part of the
transaction or it's not part of the
transaction if it is not part of this
transaction what's the signature for
just so that you know you can verify who
the person is you look at the back of
the card and see the signature matches
how many how many people do that today
now very few but it may be different in
some other countries the regulation may
require that you pass the signature to
the Bank and Bank stores the signature
with them so that's where the sale
completes merchants prints the receipt
and that's the end of the transaction so
and there are some fees in Mardin here
obviously customer pays at the end of
the month you get a big thick bill right
and you pay the issuing bank you were
Chase and Bank of America and all of
them they take a card out of that and
then card networking American Express
and Discover MasterCard Visa they take a
card from the money you paid and then a
quarter or the gateways they may take a
card depending on the kind of if you're
a mom and pop store you are working
through water they will
and then finally much and gets paid
right so by the time Marcin gets paid
all of them got their fees so that's the
fees and now we're not even talking
about the government taking cut out of
this that's our different thing
so who what's the the EMV adoption how
what country is using you movies as of
today and how much are they using this
is a data that we got from you and we Co
probably more than a year old so it has
changed a lot since then from what I
understood if you look at that Asia has
about twenty six percent of its cards
are our smart cards
whereas 42 percent of the terminals are
the readers are capable of taking a
smart card so it hasn't kept up that
means merchants are much faster than the
issuing bank banks are not fast enough
in issuing the smart cards and if you
come to Europe which is much much higher
and that from what I was told just a few
days ago that is wrong that's a 65% of
the cards issued a smart card and 85% of
terminals are capable of smart card
that's not true I heard it's almost 80
85 % cards are now smart cards and
terminals are almost 95% of the
terminals are capable and if you go to
Europe and then you you try to use your
max right people look at you nowadays
Canada is Canada and Latin America is
about 26% of the cards and 55% of the
terminal I didn't get a number for us so
probably it's less than Canada that's
what I'm thinking
okay so now that's the basics of the
payment how the payment industry works
what should happen all of that
now what Motorola is offering for the
payment solution the device is called
NPM 100 it was released just a few weeks
ago a couple of weeks three four weeks
so what does it do it it can take it
does all the three max type contact and
contactless smart card transactions it
can also do NFC if you have the right
application running on the reader when I
say NFC Near Field Communication it
includes payment if you are doing a tap
it is NFC by application but it could be
more than payment it could be health
care industry it could be transportation
you could be using that for different
applications so this is capable of doing
NFC but you may require additional
application to run on that right now out
of the box as far as I know it can only
do payment there is another difference
between NFC and payment payment maximum
is 4 centimeters you have to be within 4
centimeters for it to read the card
whereas NFC allows a little bit more
than that maybe up to 8 or 9 centimeters
or it may be 10 centimeters so even
though NFC allows it the payment
requires only 4 centimeters so it has to
change what the range is for the payment
the transaction is done through
bluetooth like I showed before where do
you use it the smart cards or the MPM
for that matter there is a huge interest
in the MPM retail hospitality
transportation field service government
and public so it's coming our way and
payment industry is changing in a big
way and it's going to change in a very
very big way in the next 2 to 3 years
that's the way everybody is looking at a
bunch of our device support this MPM 100
years 400 MC 55mm 265 MC 95-81 MC 75 a
you can use all of those pretty much any
device with Bluetooth can work with this
but we are limiting the number of
devices for now because we don't want to
support too many right from the
beginning
these are specifications I'm gonna skip
this because you can you can see that
what it's capable of and how it's it has
a display small display that you can say
is it credit or debit do you accept it
those kind of things we talked about the
differences max right smart card chip
and pin and contactless the only thing
I'm going to mention here that I didn't
mention is probably max ripe easy to
counterfeit it's an old technology and
it's low cost very very low cost
compared to the other two who require
new infrastructure and a cosmo for all
for the merchant for the car networks
and the issuing bank for all it takes
money ok communication with the mobile
device happens with through Bluetooth
SPP profile it can work with either
Microsoft stack or Stonestreet rack
stack on Windows Mobile an Android
bluesy stack just to let you know we are
not supporting C II devices with NPM as
of today only Windows Mobile devices
configuring it's just the thing is you
got to manually do the configurator
manually paired with the device before
you can use NPM I'm just showing how to
do this with both Windows Mobile and
Android
I'm sure you all know how to do that
fraud prevention this is the the biggest
question how how easy is it our heart so
there are a bunch of things that happen
encryption is one of the big things
encryption is one say
dictated by the issuing bank the issuing
bank sometimes the countries the
countries may have certain requirements
basically the the issuing bank says I
want you to use this encryption and when
you swipe your card or when you insert
your card or tap your card that data
gets encrypted using that encryption
that the bank said to use and then the
data goes to the bank all the way and
nobody can understand that and only bank
has Bank knows how to decrypt so there
is one of the security provider and how
does the the encryption get on this
mobile on this payment device different
banks right you go to a different
country they may require a different
encryption so there is a process called
key injection that you do not everybody
can do that so if you just buy this you
can do key injection you got to send it
to motorola certified offices they have
a special tool to do key injection and
it requires special keys and everything
and even those keys are only half keys
because the other half key goes with the
bank so that is already built into our
devices both in hardware and software
and also if someone is trying to break
in and trying to obtain the seed number
for these keys NPM is built-in so that
it just wipes out everything and you
can't use it anymore
certification this is another major step
you can't use these devices within
without getting certification stuff you
just can use illegal so you go to a
different country they will have
different certification requirements so
you before writing your application is
just one thing to do and then there is
this whole process of getting it
certified so that's country
certification right u.s. has different
certification rules Canada has different
and the Europe itself has different
certification rules within Europe
Germany and France they all different
have different so you don't think that
I'm getting into payment business
I wrote my application I'm gonna start
selling it all over the world ramped up
time is there it costs money what we do
certify when we certify we certify this
device this hardware you can't tamper
with this device that stuff and the
software that comes under we certify
that but you may have to certify your
application that runs on our Motorola
mobile devices you may have to certify
that also depending on the country and
the banks that you are using so that is
something you gotta take care of we can
try to make it easier for you so that
make the the amount of things that you
can do that the the level that you can
go we can limit that only to a higher
level so that your certification is very
fast and easy okay what does
certification look for they want to make
sure it communicates well with the
network it doesn't interfere with other
transaction it doesn't intercept other
transactions they want to make sure and
in addition to the the country
certification there are other
certification required PCI certification
and EMV certification they're all
different so there is something called
international certification you can get
that if you get that you go to
new country is possible they will say oh
you did it in u.s.
fine we'll accept it they may say or
they may say you you have to go through
additional certification or they may say
I don't care what you did you have to go
through certification right from the
start there is no standard certification
for the entire work
like I said Motorola certifies but your
application still may have required
certification that we knew that the
device is sent to an independent lab for
this certification they may take
anywhere from one to two months for
certifications that's the length of the
certification depends on how well you
were devised the architecture of the
software and hardware is there is public
area there's private area how well
they're differentiated so private if you
can say this is the private and this is
the public and it's easy for them to
distinguish between them then it's
faster okay so there is no universal
role much certified device in country
prior to sale I have heard some people
in US using their devices and
applications without certification but
that's not the route you want to go okay
so that's MPM Motorola Payment device
now we are getting into the developing
the application yeah okay we talked
about Rho mobile Russian suite version
2.0 right that came out that has the the
capability to talk to MPN so uh I'm
explicitly saying talk to MPN not do
payment here okay as beta it's not
completely supported it's not formally
supported it's going to be supported by
q3 and of q3 this year but you can use
it we have tested it and some of our
partners are using it you should be good
MDK for dotnet if you
writing dartnet applications it's also
maybe depending on what kind of interest
this generates we may do it in q3 no
plans for C or Java whether it's on Java
on Windows Mobile or Juwan and write no
plans for that so right now we are
looking at Roma parsley and dotnet I'm
gonna skip this you all know Roma ball
very well right so the only thing I'm
gonna say here is the the component of
Rho mobile that's row elements is the
one that will support NPM only through
JavaScript functions for now and as we
move up the chain and add more value to
this it is going to be it's going to
support in all other different forms and
other things that row Mobile offers
right now is JavaScript only okay row
element the so application so so with
row row elements you can also do the
other things before and after payment
right payment is the world and then
there is this the password right point
of sale the point of sale includes all
the scanning and printing signature
capture and all of that in row Mobile is
capable of scanning signature capture
printing so the signature capture has to
occur on Motorola mobile device not an
NPM device the pin has to occur on NPM
device just to set the rules here so Rho
mobile lets you scan lets you capture
the signature print all of those things
like I said Java scripts is the only way
to access NPM device today and the help
that's distributed with row elements to
does not include any NPM documentation
like I said it's beta so and also the
plan
is moving forward we are not just going
to open it for everybody we want to have
some kind of a partnership with whoever
wants to do payment application there is
a reason is payment is not just about
writing application right we want to be
responsible we want our partners to be
responsible so if you need documentation
you need to contact Motorola ta and they
should be able to get you something
within a few hours and it also requires
a pin before you start using the api's
not the this is not the security built
into the RO mobile this is an additional
security before you can use am/pm it's
not really a security per se it is just
so that we keep track of people or who
are our partners and who are using this
so we know who is working with us on
this and there is a programmers guide in
the documentation on the NPM take a look
at that it gives you a lot of helpful
hints how to write applications this
architecture so this is where your
question gets answered and whatever the
infrastructure you have it could be you
know acquires I say here customer
payment gateway so if you are big
company Walmart targets they're not
gonna go through regular independent
acquirers they have their own
infrastructure they do a lot of other
things before the payment begins
well independent acquires are for small
businesses they want to set up something
fast and easy so they go to the
independent enviros so on the mobile
side there is motor over drivers about
that row elements framework and about
that you are application sets and your
applications response what your
application
and do with Rome mobile is Tartu the MPM
and then throw a bunch of menus and
commands on the MPM get the input
whether it's a credit or debit service
charge do you accept service charge all
those kind of things and then at the end
the card data itself it can take all the
data and that's what ro mobile lets you
do after that it is your responsibility
what you do with the data that's where
this customer customer ro application
that you will write and customer created
country bank specific code any process
that requires you to do certain special
things you have to figure that out
depending on the country depending on
the bank that has to happen on the
software application side today that you
have to do so now you fulfill all those
requirements you go get the car data
from NPM right now what you're gonna do
with that you gotta pass it to someone
else who is gonna do the bank
transaction once again that's your
responsibility today there are so many
acquirers so many different types of
gateways and now others are also opening
like we Ceramics are opening up so you
can do direct transaction with them so
all this we are not helping you with
this you know the best at this time so
we are we are giving you an a a means of
collecting the card data and passing it
to you and once it goes to the acquirers
once it goes to the issuing bank gets
approved issuing bank sends response
back you say oh I got the response back
now it's your responsibility to write it
back to the smart card and we give you a
bunch of api's so that you can write
back to the smart card so our role is
between Motorola mobile device and NPM
thus we we facilitate communicating
between these two hardware but that may
change in the future but I'll come to
the final one I don't have a lot of
information on that but our vision is to
make it much more
easier than where we are today okay I
already explained you what you can do
using row mobile I can turn Jess okay
I'm sorry
what you can do with row mobile sweet
you can scan items you can take picture
of items maybe for returns or something
like that
connect to NPM using row elements
display message and prompt menu on NPM
allow customers to swipe insert or tap
the card on NPM allow customers to enter
pain on NPM obtain card data and
encryption and clear from NPM who would
want to do clear write to the smart card
once the bank response is received and
signature captured on mobile device and
print device Row Mobile allows all of
these things what your application has
to do currently I emphasize the word
currently roll image does not offer any
feature to perform country specific
requirements that you may need to do in
your application you have to have this
knowledge you you got to figure out
where to get this information from and
and implement them get certified you
have to write your own process to create
the payment package and pass it to the
acquirer gateway what's your job you
must have detailed knowledge of
acquiring requirements and their
interfaces that may include you know the
encryption and all of that
you must understand all the
certification requirement for all
countries that you wish to use
you must certify your payment
applications if necessary well you will
happen once the bank response is
received your application must know how
how to read the bank response and do
post payment writings to the smart card
so whatever the format it's coming back
from the bank you should be able to
parse it and then pour it into our
structures third so that it goes on the
chip there they're all different tags in
the chip so each tag has a value so you
write to the tags we provide a number of
functions for this purpose
so here are some of the api's that I'm
just going to go through real quick
first you open the NPM and the passcode
is the one that you have to get it from
Motorola it's not really secret about it
it's just like I said that you that you
work with us you get the passcode from
us and you get support for this and then
come why use the port Bluetooth port
that you're using if you're using
Android it doesn't matter what the port
is and all the function calls you make
in JavaScript they all come back in a
callback
none of them are synchronous they're all
asynchronous call so when so how do you
set up your data event callback is shown
there and then when you get the callback
you get two parameters one is data
success or failure card data all of that
information and then the function that
it is returning so that you can keep
track of so I did I open and it comes
back open successful so you know open
was successful since this an
asynchronous call open we talked about
that and then obviously there is closed
before you do open you got to manually
pair with the devices your job you can
use it you can write code to do
automatic pairing but this one doesn't
do close doesn't unpair you have to do
on pairing yourself in your application
enable keypad and beeps for some reason
if you use certain calls certain
functions after using that function
keypad gets disabled maybe a security
thing I don't know so you have to make
sure you enable the keypad before
calling the functions that require
keypad usage PIN is a good example of
keypad key beeps whether it beeps are
not you can control that read card data
that's the biggest one
so when you swipe you get the data back
and all that information is gonna be
parched and put into this as it is as
you see here now that's if it is all
clear you don't have an encryption
encryption it's going to come in as one
big encryption data back to you and then
you should know what to do with that
prompt in you can say what's you got to
pass the account number before you can
prompt the pen because PIN is for debit
and then what it does is takes account
number takes the pin and creates an
encrypted string that you need to pass
it to the bank minimum and maximum
Finland weather pin required or not
believe it or not this allow empty pin I
don't know why that's there you can show
couple of messages and then also a
processing message you can show
encryption pin data written in the data
event prompt menu you can show a bunch
of menus and say do you want credit or
debit or you want to pay sir which tags
or any other things you can show it
prompt additional info is three or four
different functions combined into one if
you want to use it that way it's useful
otherwise you will have to use the
individual calls from message it just
shows you the message cancel previous
method which is very important because
you will have to cancel the previous
method so that it goes back to the main
screen the welcome screen otherwise the
old message is still sitting there
create Mack it creates Mack using the
Mac working key validate Mac complete
online EMV this does not do online near
me it's very confusing the name of the
function but it completes once the
online transaction is done this is what
you would use
- right back to the smartcard once the
bank transaction is complete and you can
also for depending on what's available
you can say I want to read only these
tags from the card or I want to set
these tags from the card this is not
reading the entire card but I'm
interested only these certain tags that
may be anything any value that the bank
is providing it could be offline turned
down or not so you read that and then
you can write it back and obviously you
can't write everything there are certain
things you can write certain things you
can't write authorized card authorized
card is it authorizes the transaction
amount on the smart card you send it and
then just how much I want to charge and
the reader takes that and pass it the
chip chip says yes and then you are all
fine remove card this is for inserting
contact transactions once you are done
you want to say remove your card because
if you don't do it they won't know when
to remove it there are some health hints
here how we should use it these are pre
minor ones take a look at them and there
are more in the programmers guide that
comes with NPM take a look at that so
that's what we have today and what we
want to do tomorrow is a whole different
thing so our vision is to create a
solution that makes the payment
application even simpler because of
encryption because of how about if
encryption is we are some remote and you
know those are the ideas that are in our
mind it's there in the industry it's not
like we are inventing anything and how
about all these acquires and all these
banks with different regulations how
about if we take care of all of that and
all you have to do is say I want to use
this acquirer
so that's one of our vision this is all
a vision right now we're exploring
options and provide interfaces to major
acquirer like I said you don't have to
spend time and effort to understand have
a you know all you have to do is set up
a business with them come back and tell
us what you did with them and we take
care of all the transactions behind the
scene
our goal is also to achieve
simplification and abstraction of
interfaces to different things
today's NPRM it could be different
devices different hardware vendors in
the future different mobile devices
maybe we go beyond Motorola devices to
other devices maybe pcs we can use this
with PCs different payment technologies
languages it Garby land the way I see it
is everything gotta be language agnostic
in the future it shouldn't be limited to
any one particular language
communication how the communication
occurs who takes care of the
communication who switches from wireless
van to Wi-Fi why do you have the right
code for that you tell us under what
conditions you want man what conditions
you want Wi-Fi it could be geographic
location it could be time of the day or
it could be some kind of acknowledgment
from the user acquirers car networks we
want to simplify this we want to
abstract it another vision is to reduce
the amount of certification you will
have to do with your application so the
more we do all of these things I said
and get it pre certified the less you do
when you write your application because
it's already taken care of your
application is passing all this
information or it's just listening to
the to this one big black box running on
mobile device and NPM device that's
already certified so you can't really
mess with that if that's the case your
certification is a breeze and all this
power and new features and there are a
lot more things I'm not mentioning here
is through not by coding the way we see
it is
coding has to be minimal it should be
through GUI certain configuration you
say I want this feature I want this
feature I want this feature when even
the scanning we can do it for you don't
have to do the scanning you say when I
started when I scan it you tell me what
data you got and we will do the price
check for you or you can do the price
check for us so these are all the things
we have we are looking at very actively
I guess a lot of this depends on what we
learn from what we have today and also
your inputs and your comments thanks a
lot
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
