today we're going to talk about the
different runtime modes of dart dart
apps can run in a virtual machine name
not surprisingly the dart VM and dart
apps can be compiled to JavaScript to
run in modern browsers for this episode
I'm gonna focus on the dart VM and it's
two runtime modes a speed obsessed
production mode and a developer friendly
check mode let's get started
understand why there are two runtime
modes we first have to understand how
static types work in dart dart is an
optionally typed and dynamic language
which means that variables can be
annotated with static types or variables
can be untyped also known as dynamic the
philosophy behind this design decision
will be explored in a future episode but
for now it's important to understand
that you as a developer have a choice of
when and how to use static type
annotations so what are type annotations
this is an example of an untyped dynamic
variable notice how I use var to denote
a dynamic variable obviously the object
pointed to by the variable is an
instance of a specific class in this
case an end but the variable itself
simply has the dynamic type in contrast
this is the same variable with a static
type annotation type annotations in dart
precede the variable name in this case
the answer variable is of type int now
that I've shown examples of both untyped
and typed code we can see what the two
runtime modes do with this type
annotation in the default runtime mode
of dart also known as production mode
these two lines have the exact same
runtime semantics this is because in
production mode type annotations are
ignored that's right in the default
runtime mode of dart the program runs as
if you used var everywhere this means
that in production mode this line of
code compiles and runs I know it looks
strange and I don't recommend ever
writing code like this in production
mode type annotations are ignored and
the compiler treats the code like this
which of course works just fine
remember dart is at its core a dynamic
scripting language types are optional
and thus the VM must in production mode
execute the code as if all static type
annotations did not exist production
mode actually gets a speed boost by
ignoring static types because it can
avoid many type checks production mode
gets its name because this is how we
want you to deploy your
our taps to production using the fastest
run time mode in the VM just because
production mode ignore static types it
doesn't mean you might as well just use
var for everything static types are
great for inline documentation and the
VM has another runtime mode that does
perform type checks at runtime in this
second mode named checked mode the VM
inserts dynamic type assertions
if check mode notices a case where types
don't match up it will throw an
exception developing and testing in
checked mode helps you catch potential
bugs early based on type annotations in
other words in check mode the type
annotations do affect how the program
runs going back to our line of code that
looks so very strange it's clear that
the expression one plus two evaluates to
an integer and not a string here the
type of the variable does not match the
type of the right hand side expression
in check mode this mismatch is caught at
runtime and surfaced as an exception in
check mode when the program is compiled
type assertions are dynamically inserted
into the code the VM adds something like
this approximation
notice how the type of temp results
value is compared to results static type
if they don't match an exception is
thrown otherwise results value is set
and the program continues getting this
kind of feedback in the event of a type
mismatch is really helpful when
developing and debugging your app
understanding darts to runtime modes and
how they interact with static type
annotations is important to getting the
most out of dart use check mode to catch
type mismatches during development and
testing for the utmost and speed use
production mode when you ship your apps
to production consult the documentation
to learn how to toggle these modes in
the command line dart VM and dart editor
