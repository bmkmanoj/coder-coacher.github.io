Android for the enterprise so that means
many things to many people I'm gonna
have my own sort of way of looking at
what the enterprise is and what the
concerns are so that's what we're going
to talk about before we get started just
want to tell you a little bit about
myself so my name is Marco my background
is in Java um I'm a Java developer for a
very long time before I was Java since
it was a little project that son called
oak and once entered came out I got
really interested in that and started
poking around playing with it and out of
that I developed a android boot camp
which is a five-day course taking people
who know Java all the way to being able
to develop just about any application in
android and since then i basically
bottled that course into a book called
learning android that was published by
o'reilly last year and since has been
translated into Chinese and German and
creation and it's one of the top 10
best-selling Android books I also run
San Francisco and users group and
frequently speak at conferences and such
so that's a little bit about myself and
my background these days is a focus
mostly on the internals of Android so
you can ask questions regarding
regarding the internals the security
things of that nature but they also
understand the app development
reasonably well so I can help you with
those answers as well um so what we're
going to talk about is a couple of
things we're going to talk about the
vision for android so basically what is
that God how the motivation for the end
of the project came about some we're
going to discuss that and kind of look
at that context because I think it
matters a lot to in in understanding why
Android this put away it is today then
we're going to look at the stack so
basically starting from the Linux kernel
all the way up to the apps and by doing
so we're going to explore various
enterprises issues at each layer of the
stack so that's essentially the goal i'm
going to give you a little hello world
example just to kind of show you what
the tooling
looks like you know how is it hard or
easy to build android apps so just a
really quick overview of what that looks
like we're going to talk about security
enterprise features and then some final
conclusions in terms of what we're
exploring so so that's roughly the
overview starting with the vision you
know so back in 2005 Google went out and
bought this little company in Palo Alto
called Android Inc and at that time it
was sort of off acquisition Google
wasn't really going around buying
companies like that right it wasn't like
last year where they bought a company
every single week 2005 they weren't
really in acquisitions all that much so
this was sort of off for for the
marketplace and a lot of people
suspected that Google was going to enter
the mobile business in other words
people thought that Google was going to
create a gphone that was sort of the
word on the street at that time Eric
Schmidt came out and he basically said
look our goal is not to create yet
another gizmo that's not our business
our goal is to create a mobile platform
that's going to run on many many
different devices so understanding this
vision is going to help us really
understand a lot of different technical
decisions that were made in Android
subsequently right so it's a mobile
platform and it's supposed to run on
many many different devices and so
that's kind of important design
considerations in android and guess its
implications on the enterprise so the
design philosophy was basically right
just about that to basically create a
mobile platform for many many different
devices and while doing that they had to
keep in mind the entire ecosystem and by
ecosystem we mean the device
manufacturers people who are actually
making the the gizmos the devices
network carriers because they're going
to be selling them app developers
because they're going to be providing
the actual value at the end of the day
and the end users who are going to be
using these devices and hopefully loving
them right so keeping all these
constituencies in in mind is something
that wasn't very important to when
designing
the Android platform so I'm going to
start by talking a little bit about open
source or the open nature of Android
because I believe this is one of the key
differentiators of Android platform
versus pretty much everything else that
we have out there in the marketplace
right as opposed to comparing Android to
other platforms and feature by feature
basis I'm going to look at more the
fundamental differences right so one of
the fundamental differences is that
Android is open in that that has a lot
of implications 2d to the enterprise
customers but being that it's an open
source project it doesn't mean that you
suck up somehow have a license to do
whatever you want it doesn't mean that
at all open source basically means that
you can see the source but the license
can be any number of different licenses
that are out there and there are
probably hundreds of different
open-source licenses now when it comes
to open source license is not all the
licenses are equally important there may
be a dozen or so that are kind of
prevailing out there in the indo in the
wild and out of all those licenses I
kind of split them into two two buckets
to help under help you understand the
implications of the licensing on a lot
of technical decisions made in android
so basically my bucket split is based on
the question does the derivative work
fall under the same license in other
words you as an enterprise you take
certain open source code and of course
you can see the source code and you can
modify it but once you modified who does
the derivative work belong to does it
belong to you or does it belong to the
community from which you inherited the
original piece of work from right and
that's a really important question
because if you do not get to own the
changes then you're less likely to put
your engineers at work to you know keep
creating changes in creating IP that you
you cannot claim on so when it comes to
the open-source licenses I'll just go
straight down to the bottom so the ones
that you do not own the changes our lgpl
so lesser general public license and GPL
general
licensed licenses so these are the
licenses that are in Android terms
unfriendly to two businesses right
because they don't get on foster that
goal aw for that mission of running on
many many different devices so entry
tries to keep away from these licenses
now the flip side the ones that are
friendly that we get to keep the
derivative work are basically the apache
to MIT and BSD licenses so a lot of a
lot of code that we try to inherit in
Android is based on on this and this is
going to matter later on I'll explain
I'll explain why and how so that's a
little bit about the open-source
licenses so basically the bucket where
you get to keep the changes in the
bucket where you don't get to keep the
changes that's essentially it now let's
explore the Android stack sort of to
take a look at the big picture of the
entire system how its put together and
what what some of the implications in
terms of the enterprise concerns are so
so this is basically the big picture
outlining the entire Android stack at
the bottom we have the lumix colonel we
have native native libraries native
layer we have the application framework
and finally we have the apps at the top
of the stack most of you have seen a
picture like this before right one way
or another so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to show you I will slightly
detailed more detailed view of the very
same picture right so in my little more
detailed view of the world we have and
let me go to position it like this so we
still have the Linux kernel now the
native layer I split it into basically
multiple components so on one hand we
have hardware abstraction layer which is
basically androids way of dealing with
drivers it's sort of unique to Android
with respect to how it does that native
libraries so these are libraries that
are you know C C++ code often board from
other open source projects native
damon's again native code and then a
bunch of tools that we have mostly Linux
type type of tools so this is our native
layer then we have the dalvik virtual
machine on top of that and then
we finally have the application
application framework layer and within
that we have the Java libraries which
are your standard Java libraries except
for those nine lines of code I don't
know if you've been following the Oracle
versus Google lawsuit so the judge did
find nine lines of code copied and
basically you know it is infringement
but it's only nine lines of code out of
like well they did yeah the lawyers
basically poked through that yeah it was
it was basically an honest mistake on
Google part I copied the range function
something that the high school kid can
implement basically so so the Google was
found guilty but the punitive damages
are 0 or something like that so it's not
a big deal this is a application
frameworks a brand new code represents
all the functionality that Android
exposes to the apps right like so you
know if I want to find out what my
location is as an app developer I just
simply say hey what's my current
location and the app framework just
magically tells you hey this is your you
know longitudinal attitude and but below
the surface there's a lot of magic going
on right system services are also part
of that app framework and then finally
at the top of the stack we have the apps
and they come in two flavors that the
apps that are baked into the platform so
they're kind of etched in the device and
you cannot take them off of the device
and then their user downloaded apps okay
so that's basically breaking the
previous picture in 20 more details so
now we're going to walk through various
parts of this and we're going to go
bottom up and we're going to talk about
the concerns so at the bottom of it all
Android is based on linux so enter it
the runs on top of Linux kernel so I
often ask people why do you think they
why did I pick Linux any any ideas out
to be you guys why linux if you're
building a platform like this open
source and free that's that those are
good reasons anything else how about
security
linux is considered fairly secure right
it's a it's been in the harsh
environments over the decades and it's
been patched pretty well so so it's
secure it's open source in the price is
right right it's free but then why not
for example BSD which is another open
source even more open I would argue
because it's a BSD license it's
friendlier much friendlier terms of what
Android needed it's it's even more
secure bye-bye is you know according to
some people so why not obsd versus
lennox adoption yeah do you guys are
right because remember the the vision
for Android was to run on many many
different devices so they did actually
consider BSD but BSD doesn't have nearly
as wide driver support there's device
support as Lennox's so that's one of the
reasons why the pic Linux so basically
Linux provides that low-level security
model which we'll talk about later on
which is something that's very very
important to the enterprise customers
how the security is implemented on on a
platform right and in a nutshell Android
outsources a lot of its security down to
the Linux kernel in Linux kernel is
something that's proven in the indo indo
for a while to be fairly secure we also
use Linux for memory management process
management the radio interface runs as a
native demon inside of linux device
drivers are part of the Linux kernel as
well so those are those are some
considerations for Linux that are good
keep in mind that these people think oh
this is you know yet another
implementation of Linux right so Android
is just like fedora or redhead or you
bunt oh and it's not it doesn't elder
it's based in the linux kernel it
doesn't have a lot of things you would
expect from standard Linux for one from
enterprise point of view there are no
users right understand that Lennox I can
go and add user Bob right like an ad
that user in Android we don't have
physical users there are logical users
but not physical users
it's a totally different sort of
approach to how the operating system is
put together from Colonel up but the
kernel itself is more or less the same
so I keep saying more or less the same
on in the in the old days a couple of
years ago the colonel actually the Linux
kernel for Android diverged quite a bit
from the main branch so it was sort of
like almost like a political issue going
on between the Linux maintainer xin the
google colonel guys and so they kind of
went on their own separate branches and
it was very political and kind of heated
debate over over that for a while but as
of as of recently it seems like that
things are getting cozier so a lot of
Android changes to the colonel have been
adopted by the linux maintained errs I
think we're only about seven thousand
lines of code no difference right now so
it's its peanuts compared to what it
used to be so things are getting better
in terms of that which is good because
it provides for longevity of the of the
platform given that Linux has a huge
huge adoption behind it so so that was a
little bit about the kernel space now
we're exploring the native layer and as
I said earlier that's basically this
part of the stack a couple of things
that are kind of interesting here that I
mentioned earlier so how is hardware
abstraction layer it's needed because
Lennox has a a lot of drivers but it
doesn't have a standardized driver
support so if I'm going to write a
platform that's going to run on many
different devices if I'm going to write
you know if I'm expecting an application
angry birds or some enterprise app to
run on a samsung motorola HTC in what
what not device then I need a very clean
access to the drivers right and each
manufacturer may implement GPS driver
differently for example right so how is
the abstraction layer that abstract the
driver that is sitting underneath in the
kernel space so so that's something
that's very
useful for the tender it provides sort
of as a way to put everyone on the same
page so that's a good thing the native
libraries we talked about are mostly
copy pasted from other projects demons
and tools that we have here so what
we're going to do next is we're going to
look at dalvik dalvik is I would
consider it a crown jewel of the entire
platform it's basically the engine that
runs every single app on Android so
every single application on Android runs
on a instance of dalvik virtual machine
so dalvik is essentially a replacement
for java virtual machine right most of
you guys are familiar with Java Virtual
Machine what it isn't what it does so a
lot of people think that the reason why
Google created dalvik was to bypass the
licensing that son had so basically son
makes money or now Oracle makes money by
licensing the Java Virtual Machine right
so for example every BlackBerry device
has to pay money to to Oracle for that
virtual machine that's running on a
blackberry device so that is one of the
important things in reasons for dalvik
but it's not the primary reason the
primary reason was actually technical I
happened to be neighbors with a guy who
wrote dalvik so I kind of had you know
privilege to to talk about that and
basically when they looked at mobile
they basically said you know you have
java virtual machine which is the one
size fits all virtual machine from a
tiny phone all the way to a
supercomputer that's sitting in a data
center right and those are fundamentally
different machines right so they
basically look at the constraints that
the mobile platform has and they
basically said a phone is gonna is going
to be battery powered and a battery is
not going to get revolutionary better
anytime soon right so we're going to
have a slow evolution in batteries but
batteries are going to be you know very
lone power for a very long time so they
basically optimize the virtual machine
for for purposes of the back
power devices right and they also
optimized it for for size so dalvik
doesn't really interesting and unique
things in terms of being well positioned
for registry-based chips such as arm
which tend to be better and battery than
intel chips it tends to it does an
interesting job of saving memory by not
loading all the classes into into ram
which you don't have a lot of on the on
a mobile device and so forth so
basically the core the engine of every
android app has been highly optimized
for purposes of mobile computing so
they're kind of gives you an idea where
it fits well in terms of the you know
enterprise sort of solutions now they're
so so that's a little bit about dalvik
we can talk about that later on if there
are more questions on that but i'm going
to move slowly to the to the framework
space so the framework space is
basically the application framework this
is mostly the clean room implementation
brand new code that was developed
purpose-built for android right so again
it looks like this and within this chunk
of stuff we have the standard Java
libraries which I said like I said
everything but 99 lines of code have
been a cleanroom implemented so from
scratch it's based on a Patrick harmoni
project if anybody cares but this is
basically more or less than their java
application android framework libraries
and system services were built
specifically for android and that's
that's basically the power that we're
exposing to the application developers
so as an app developer all you care
about is what's available in this layer
you don't really care about anything
that's down below in green and see in
native land um just to kind of give you
an idea this is a this is sort of the
blueprint for how location system works
right so everything from the moment my
app says what's my current location down
to the actual kernel driver for location
so oh I don't expect you to understand
it at all but I just kind of wanted to
point out the
there are a lot of moving parts there
are a lot of levels of abstraction so
just kind of like in a nutshell what we
have here is we have the client app and
we have the service appt right so these
are two separate applications and then
down below this is the colonel right so
this this will be my screen that says I
want to know what is my current position
right but that screen out talks to this
guy talks to this guy this guy now talks
to the binder driver which then sends
the request up here which then
eventually makes it to this guy which
then eventually makes it to this guy and
it eventually goes to the driver and all
along where we're going from Java to see
from process one to process to back to
Java so there are a lot of this sort of
we're crossing these bridges between
different languages and different
processes so to some people this seems
very inefficient and you know any any
luck any anytime you introduce an
abstraction you're kind of losing
inefficiency but the enter it kind of
chose this architecture mostly for
security reasons because now this
service can actually run you know in as
a as a system user and the client can
run as an underprivileged user so
basically they're now separated in terms
of security so you have kind of like a
superior process in a less superior
process so that's kind of why there's a
level of complexity introduced in
Android again to make the security hole
tighter so just an example of how one of
the frameworks work keep in mind also
when they were designing the framework
they right from the get-go they planned
to cab this run on many many different
devices so what that really means is not
just different hardware configurations
but also different form factors right so
Android apps are designed in such a way
that they should look very good on a
tiny little phone as well as in a bigger
tablet as well as in a gigantic
big-screen TV right so they should scale
up properly so that's one of the
considerations that they've addressed
and it's done a reasonably good job
given that we have I believe 850
different or nine kind of different
devices certified and Omarion out there
in the wild so lots of lots of different
android devices and they all pretty much
run the same maps the same angry bird so
whatever is your favorite app another
example of a framework that I find
interesting is the media framework in
the reason why I'm mentioning it is it
sort of shows the philosophy behind the
platform so when they were designing the
platform they said all right well we
need to be able to play media right
videos music audio whatever and and
there are many many different codecs and
in formats out there so what they did is
they took everything that was licensed a
licensed friendly out there they bundled
it all together and put it into the
platform which makes sense but what
about the things that they're not
licensed friendly what about what about
does windows media formats or Apple
codecs or things of that nature which
you couldn't put into an open source
project because it would pollute the
license bowl right so what they did is
they basically left they built this on
top of a very pluggable framework so the
media is you can think of it as
basically a bunch of slots it's
something called open open max I'll so
basically you can plug in different
frameworks what that means to an
enterprise is that if the proprietary
codec that you're missing is not
included and that you need is not
included you can go and license it and
then basically just put it into a slot
it's a very elegant way to expand the
platform yet keep it license friendly
for general purposes right so this is
the case with media this is also the
case with VPN and couple of other
frameworks that are sort of important to
to the enterprise concerns so finally at
the end of the day we have applications
so like I said at the end of the day you
need to provide some value to your users
that's why that's why you know they're
using the device in the first place so
in terms of applications like I said
they boil down into two sets of
applications those that are those that
are already built into the platform and
those are the user downloads so these
are sort of etched in stone you cannot
get rid of them and these user can
download then remove whenever they chose
to so the question that all this comes
is well what about fragmentation right
so you have all these different devices
you know there's a lot of talk at a
conference about bringing your own
device to the organization so if that's
the case then in a CIO or CTO is going
to have a case of a very non homogeneous
device base and they're going to want to
run the same apps on all those devices
how do you ensure they work and right
from the get-go Android he had something
called the compatibility test suite to
ensure a compatibility of a device now
basically compatibility is there are two
things that make up the compatibility
test with one is a battery of tests it's
an automatic testing mechanism you take
your device and you run it against that
set of test cases and you either get you
know yes or no true false its binary
either pass or fail that's pretty safe
straightforward the other set is a
document it's a pretty large document
that basically has a lot of mustards and
optionals right so it says things like
your device must have the following
sensors should have you know such and
such amount of memory optionally can
have telephony and so on so you kind of
look for things that are important in
terms of being compatible so so that's
basically what we're at with that
compatibility was there from day one but
it's been more important recently and
the what's important also to mention
about compatibility is that the only
sort of teeth in the whole thing is
google itself so if you as an enterprise
know that you're going to be modifying
the android but you do not care about
being on good terms with google you
don't really care about compatibility
there are lots of great cases where
that's exactly what happened for example
amazon kindle fire didn't care about
compatibility so they're not a
compatible device cisco see as the
business tablet same thing drd with net
warrior basically putting android in the
you know can serve all the
in the battlefield they don't care
necessarily about compatibility so the
only thing that you do is if you're
targeting the consumers and you want a
license thing and google apps such as
Gmail gtalk google maps and the android
market or whatever they call it this
week Google Play right so that's the
only time you really care about
compatibility to be precise so it's
mostly for consumer concerns so in terms
of in terms of the hello world what the
tools look like we wanted to kind of
just show you hey what does it look like
to develop for android just you know in
60 seconds or less so I have a little
hello world program that I can walk you
through what creating so basically when
developing for Android all you need is
eclipse well you actually don't need a
clips you just need the Android SDK so
it's a free software developing kit you
get it from android com eclipse is
optional but it's very useful so
basically what i'm doing here is i'm
saying in eclipse i'm going to create a
new android project eclipse is an open
source project comes from eclipse.org
and it was basically started by IBM way
back one an IBM open sourced it and it's
since it's become the de facto tool for
a lot of Java development so Android
builds on top of that you don't need it
you can use IntelliJ you can use notepad
whatever editor you you prefer it just
happens that a lot of people in the
developing android developer community
tend to standardize in Eclipse so
there's a concept of a project so i'll
create a project called hello app forum
so that's what i'm doing here just
basically specifying project name um
then I pick that the target that I'm
targeting so basically these this this
short list here are various types of
Android operating system that are out
there some are the official ones so for
example if I look at here android 403 it
would be the official android open
source project or AOSP whereas do and
right above it is the google proprietary
one from
so it's got the extensions like Google
Maps and so on and you may even find the
ones from like HTC kyocera sony ericsson
etc etc you as an enterprise can also
create your own type of Android flavor
and then basically kept developers
developed for that particular flavor so
if you create your own flavor of Android
it's going to support standard ended
plus the extensions that you have so for
example you know Motorola may create a
suite of applications that deal very
well with two-way radio and barcode
scanning so that would be the extra
stuff that they provide on top of entry
so if I as a developer wanted to develop
for barcode develop barcode apps that
specifically are targeting motor oil
devices I would download their extension
so it's just it yeah so the question is
what is really the extension it's meant
to be the doll the whole and complete
operating system so typically it would
be a superset not just the Delta yeah
typically it will be the superset so I'm
going to stick with a vanilla ice cream
sandwich and so on the next screen it's
basically just asking me hey what's your
application name this is just a simple
English name it doesn't really matter
it's not significant what this
significant is the package name just
needs to be unique and it's usually
going to be reverse of your domain name
so it may be something like Kumar Khanna
dot Android dot yellow for example and
perform just so I don't collide with
something else so that's basically all I
need here I'm saying yes to an activity
which is basically going to be a single
screen I'll talk more about this in the
next session if anybody is known on am
specifying what is the minimum SDK so I
am targeting the light is great
android the ice cream sandwich but what
if I wanted this to run on all the
version so so I get to choose how far
back I'm going to allow this app to to
run on because I have to support it on
the older devices so I could for example
say well let's run it on as all this
honeycomb so which is Android 3-pointer
right so that means that my universe of
possible devices that this app is going
to run on is honeycomb to ice cream
sandwich right so so I click finish and
I basically get the yellow app forum
application here now I'll just kind of
like give you a like a super high level
overview of this application so
basically what an application consists
of is a little bit of java code i'm
going to show you like this so basically
we have a little bit of a java code here
okay so that this is your business logic
this is the actual you know brains of
your application then you have on the
resources you have things that are not
code yet your application needs so these
are we call them resources and that
includes things like images graphics
sound clips you know things that are
their part of your app but are not code
right so lots of xml file things of that
nature and then finally there's a file
called manifest file which is sort of
the big picture what your application
really comprises well it's not a big
file but it's the main file explaining
the components of your app so that's
kind of like an application a nutshell
under well they can go under both but if
there's structure to go on the resources
under assets you probably know that
because a lot of web apps that's what
their put their stuff so if you're
writing an html5 application typically
it's going to be less-structured so
stuff goes in here but for a native
application we usually put everything on
the resources so um I can basically
click on run on this and this
application would just basically come up
on the emulator right here now I'm
running it on an emulator I could just
as easily run it on the real device
and I can't want to point out the
difference between an emulator and a in
a simulator that other platforms tend to
use so Andrew this sort of unique
because it uses it uses the the actual
emulator and speaking of emulator so
perfect there's a little bug in eclipse
that that basically makes it forget
about the emulator that already have in
place so it's starting a new one which
is going to take a while to start so
what I'm going to exactly well the tools
I kind of I mean it's good that this
happens the tools are flimsy a little
bit right it's you know there are low
quirks here and there they're very
feature-rich but they're they're quirky
a little bit the way I see it the price
is right so I can't really complain too
much about that so it's going to start
up now and there isn't really a 1-800
number you can call and complain about
eclipse bugs or anything like that so
but it also free so that's the hello
world app that we just wrote so it's up
there running of course I could now go
and you know modify it and you know this
would be my user interface here it's
sort of like a Dream Weaver you drag and
drop stuff and you make it into whatever
you want it to make it it takes a while
to load up but it's going to come up and
I'll talk about this more in the next
session so that's the that's the kilo
world so that was the SDK where to get
it from by the way all these slides are
available on the website on maracanda
com I'll tell you about that later this
was creating a new project anatomy of
that project that we just draw and this
was running it on the device so that's
basically that and this is still loading
up I guess so
I have no experience with the iOS or
Windows Mobile okay in terms of the
development environment good point so
the question is about developing
environment for applications so
basically Windows Mac and Linux are
supported and they're about equally good
or bad so they they both have their own
quirks but it's not like one is
significantly better than the other when
it comes to platform development windows
is not supported so you got to go with
the mac or linux so so that's basically
how it boils down to so but for the most
part is very similar okay so I want to
talk a little bit about security because
security 10 tends to be one of the
primary main concerns for enterprise
purposes so first thing to point out in
terms of security is the the application
sandboxing model that that enter it has
so in an Android environment basically
an application is its own process right
so each application is going to run is
its own linux process right and what an
application really is a droid like this
as well as all you know silo what an
application is is essentially a
collection of various application parts
we call them components I sometimes
refer to them is main building blocks
and i'll talk about them extensively at
the next session but they're basically
activities I screens services things
that run in background receivers and
providers for data and then we have the
dalek virtual machine right you may also
have additional resources like
permissions maybe native libraries maybe
databases files other resources and
things like that but what's important is
that we have a single Linux process for
an app that we have a propriety of
dedicated dalvik virtual machine for
that application and then everything
else turns on this application so
basically the reason why this is
significant
is that it provides for isolation
between apps so each app is an island on
its own one app cannot touch another app
right so they're basically vertical
cells and so that's that's a good thing
because it provides for security in such
a way that whatever you want to do
within this box is okay and you have all
the power within this box but the box
itself is limited right so I'll give you
an example so if I'm writing let's say
Angry Birds just because you know it's
very process intensive so let's say I'm
writing a game and I want this game to
work extremely well to be really fast
and so forth well I may choose to do
parts of that app in C C++ like for
example all the computations of the
trajectory of the birds and such the
physics engine right that's pretty
involved mathematically so I may choose
to implement that as a C C++ code right
in android that's perfectly fine and
that works great and that's exactly how
angry birds works and many many other
enterprise applications as well so
basically it allows for Java to talk to
see because everything is secure as long
as it's within this container so the
fact that we have some seed library
within our application is fine now
that's because the colonel the Linux
kernel is the sole enforcer of the
security now if you compare that to
blackberry where Java is the enforcer of
security you cannot have Java then
escape out of the sea world because then
all hell goes was right so so basically
in blackberry or not you're much more
constraint with respect to what you're
allowed to do so in Android you can have
richer applications because the security
is implemented much deeper down in the
kernel level right so i use the angry
birds as an example but it could be an
enterprise application as well so for
example the barcode scanner well there
could be a stative driver c c++ driver
in android world it's that's fine
because my app is going to be able to
talk to that driver as long as the
driver allows us permissions to talk to
it so so we can basically
do that quite easily so that's that's a
future so the question is about the
questions about the startup of the the
applications there's a that's arguable
if it takes longer to start up on on
Android versus for example iOS the
applications I'll talk maybe a little
bit about zygote later on things start
really really quickly and in absolute
terms they started about the same time
on Android and iOS what iOS does it's
it's a little trick I don't know if you
guys know about that but when you launch
an application it it appears like it
already started and actually what you're
seeing is just a picture of that
application so it throws up a jape or
PNG file and it's cranking in the
background actually launching everything
but all along you think it's already
started because by the time you touch
the screen it's actually replaced with
the real thing and it doesn't do that
there is option for that they were kind
of thinking should do that trickery or
not and they provide it as an option but
it's not on by default yes yeah you can
mm-hmm so that's a little bit about
sandboxing now this is a much more
complex picture but let me kind of walk
you through this a little bit so it kind
of explains what happens with all the
processes once they're started so you
can kind of think of it as the time goes
this way right so this would this is
this would be x 0 we turned on a device
Colonel got booted right so what we have
here is we have a bunch of Native demons
some our Linux related somewhere Android
related so that's the native C C++ code
then we have service manager this is
against native code then we start a
zygote zygote is basically the pre
warmed up version of any future app
every app in the future is basically
just a fork off of zygote that's that's
kind of how that works and ultimately we
have now the first android app which is
the system service
and then we have many many different
apps right 10 20 different apps that you
came running in your pocket right now
the point is that these apps are sandbox
so each vertical box is basically a
sandbox on its own it's got each has its
own Hall its own system it's all J&amp;amp;I its
own dalvik its own application code
finally so each one is pretty much
separate on its own and that's why it's
very powerful within the box but the box
itself is limited okay so that's that's
kind of how things work now because you
have so many copies of dalvik remember
we back back to dalvik why did they
write it in the first place well you
have so many copies for each app you
have a dalek so you guys probably have
about 10 20 copies of dalvik in your
pocket right now right so they get to
optimize dalvik for memory extensively
so Java would not have worked very well
so they did some interesting things to
optimize for loading of those 2,300
libraries that each instance would need
so if you multiply that by 10 20 you
kind of get a lot of waste so they did
some interesting things to optimize for
for loading of the libraries and things
like that another reason why we have
dalvik as opposed to job so that's kind
of just to kind of give you a high-level
overview of what that looks like when
it's all said and done but ultimately
each application can basically cannot do
anything that can adversely impact other
apps user or the system right so what we
mean by that is if there are things that
potentially cost money or intrude on
privacy or what not an app is by default
not allowed to do that right so for
example read my contacts or send SMS
messages or keep the screen on because
that's going to go in the battery where
is the batter in the zone on so that's
basically those are some limitations
that that we have like we said colonel
is the one that enforces the security at
the end of the day which is important
now what happens if you do want an app
to be able to connect to internet send
SMS radio contacts keep the screen on
and so on so some apps have a legitimate
need for things like that
so what happens in that case is an app
simply says it needs permissions so it
so you as a developer so you're quick
this is the client app this is what you
are writing is a developer and this is
some service the transfer no platform so
let's imagine i am trying to this is a
location service and i want to know my
current location based on gps well
that's potentially dangerous things no
thing right because GPS uses a lot of
juice not the battery so GPS service our
location service is going to require a
permission for use of GPS right so you
as a developer you need to specify that
your app uses a permission so you say
this app uses a permission for GPS at
install time user is basically
confronted with a screen like this that
basically says the app is using the
following permissions blah blah blah do
you grant it or not okay so once you
grant it at install time this app is now
made a part of the Linux group that
allows it to do that so again it's
Colonel managing the security so this
works great that the only downsides to
this system is the so-called social
engineering vector of attack attacks
right because you know this is usually a
very small screen apps usually ask for a
lot of permissions and we as users just
tend to want to play with that app right
away we want instant gratification so
when was the last time you read one of
those you know you know licenses or or
permissions or many of those right we
tend to just say yes approve so that
tends to be the sort of the weak point
of this security model it's only exactly
there is no yep exactly so you either
grant all permissions or none in which
case the app doesn't get installed and
this is all done only once at install
time so unlike blackberry which allows
you to fine tune it and change it
subsequently and it doesn't yeah the
order of this now the the order is
implicit so it it will system more of
organizes it ya know it doesn't deserve
the service is already there so enter it
comes with about 55-60 services as part
of the ice cream sandwich that's the
latest count so the services are part of
the so-called system server umbrella
there's an umbrella under which there
are many many different services like
bluetooth Wi-Fi telephony location NFC
etc so yeah file system and do it as a
file system it's also a sort of unique
type of a file system basically there
are three partitions or mount points
that are of interest system is where the
op this is where your operating system
is basically located and what's
interesting about this partition is that
it's read-only so user or at the app
developer you have no access to this
partition you cannot modify anything so
that's that's a good thing from security
standpoint on the the user data is on
the data partition and more specifically
each app stores data in a data data
folder where each app has its own
sandbox in the file system manager again
by user Linux you IDs so you have an app
has it sort of a private place in a file
this this system where you can store
stuff there's also the SD card which is
sort of the Wild West of storage it's
free for all
an explanation of what every folder in
the means for system and data for
instance I want you to have because city
map probably let me know something about
it but how can I know that the data of
an application goes into data data or
data whatever the structure of the
system I mean so is it documented
anywhere nothing is officially
documented I mean I did write about that
I have a chapter or part of a chapter
dedicated to how the file system is
organized yes but a lot of things that
go underneath the hood are just black
magic so there's no official
documentation on the the official
documentation is the source code itself
all 3.5 gigabyte sort of it so it's all
there if you look for it but just it's a
very painful to find what you're looking
for so we did a lot of that that kind of
work so it's all just reading the code
basically so I want to go to a couple of
enterprise features that that are
interesting to for android so according
to google more specifically google has
an enterprise team within google they've
been baking things into the android from
a security from enterprise point of view
for quite some time so in a Claire they
added a secure Wi-Fi they appear claim
to be to have added a VPN in in a fryer
they added a couple of things more
notably remote services such as remote
wipe remote lock and so on gingerbread
nothing really significant and honeycomb
and on they added the full disk
encryption so those are things that are
sort of relevant to the enterprise now
one thing that I want to point out is
that Google itself does recognize
enterprises significant but it's not
focus at all
all Google is one hundred percent
focused on the consumer so we we know
you know you guys have been hearing
about the consumer ation of IT quite a
bit of this conference so Google
basically is focused on the consumer
because the numbers are substantially
larger for the enterprise what they do
is they essentially provide the plumbing
they see themselves as the ones that are
responsible for providing the the
infrastructure for the enterprise
features so that everyone is on the same
page but they're not going to build a
complete solution okay so that's very
interesting from the enterprise
standpoint so an Android operating
system has very good core very good
plumbing for a lot of enterprise things
but it's by no means complete night so
you as a final end user and to present
user you still have a lot of missing
pieces on luckily there are third-party
companies that that are emerging that
are filling in the void and that's
exactly what Google is expecting so
they're expecting in a third parties to
basically come in and build different
apps that complete different parts of
the picture and make it all happen with
respect to bring your own device to to
to to the office Google basically
acknowledges this is an issue right
right now in corporate America most of
us have the company should buy Varian
personal iphone or android device and
that's probably not what the future is
going to look like according to google
the future is going to be a single
device and it's likely going to be a
personal device so the same device that
you use to download angry birds and
other viruses and spyware you're going
to bring to your office and you're going
to get in a corporate network and you're
going to access your secure corporate
network with right and of course a lot
of CIOs are like freaking out there no
there's no way this is ever going to
work out and so on and so on how about
how the corporate America thinks this is
this can work out and it's great in the
other half is like no way so it's very
religious at the at this point on
Android does provide for something that
could make people happy so it's called
the device policy administration and
it's an API that allow
to create applications that can
administer the device right so you can
create these apps that are uber powerful
they're so powerful that they can wipe
out your entire device in case it's lost
or stolen right or basically factory
reset it or remotely back it up if you
just lost it or can enforce how strong
your password is or how frequently
assume the screen gets locked etc so
there is an API for that again it's just
an API it's just the plumbing you still
need to build apps on top of it but
third parties have been working on that
for a while exactly that's that's
exactly the type of thing so your CIO
may say fine if you're going to bring
your own device to work and you want to
use it on a corporate network that's
okay but you must allow me to administer
your device and that's sort of that
middle ground where it could make the
you know the IT managers happy and you
are giving away a little bit of rights
to them but in exchange you can use a
single you only have one device in your
pocket as opposed to VPN VPN I mentioned
earlier when I talked about media
framework I said how media framework is
built to be pluggable right and similar
thing was with VPN if you remember that
chart it says you know baking in the
various features in Android dimension
that they added VPN way back when in in
Eclair days but it was a VPN that nobody
in America music it was basically not
very useful at all so you know I think
about forty percent of corporate America
uses cisco VPN right and that one wasn't
supported because of the license issue
so again it was one of those pluggable
cases as of Ice Cream Sandwich they
actually allow for an easier way to plug
in me p.m. so this this really helps
with that aspect and this was a big big
point for a lot of enterprise customers
one thing that wanted to mention also is
the cloud to device push so basically
sometimes you have enterprise
locations that you need to send push
messages to a particular device to send
notifications and such so there is a
architecture for that it looks like this
and I don't want to get into the
technical details of that but in a
nutshell this is your application your
enterprise app whatever it could be like
an email app for example this is a
particular user's device so if there's
something that your app server knows in
what's to notify the user it would
basically send a message to the cloud
and the cloud would then notify the user
right so that works great except you've
got to keep in mind that this is a
google cloud right so you are basically
running your proprietary sensitive data
through a google cloud some people may
be uneasy about that so one way to kind
of get around that is to basically use
the cloud or this architecture just to
tickle your application to basically
tell it hey I'm not telling you what's
new but there is something new why don't
you go over secure connection and and
retrieve the data so that's kind of a
way around that although I'm seeing
companies also build equivalent
architectures to support something very
similar that doesn't run through a
proprietary cloud markets you guys you
if you if you have apps at the end of
the day you got to distribute them you
guys know about google play or android
market amazon is another big one but
what what's interesting is we're seeing
a whole bunch of boutiques emerging that
sometimes enterprise-focused right so
Cisco drd companies like that they're
launching markets that are private or
semi-private that are highly curated
very tough to put apps in and so forth
so we're we're seeing emergence of that
that's that's definitely a good thing
also as an app as an enterprise you can
also do something called side loading in
other words directly distribute apps and
it's quite easy it could be as simple as
putting together an internet page and
putting all the apps on top of that page
so basically the conclusion behind all
this what it all boils down to is
androids been growing quite a bit these
are the number
us from a couple of weeks ago so half a
million new devices activated each day I
think the number is going up to like 850
k now 2.4 billion apps downloaded etc
that they're so huge growth you guys
know all about that 800 plus devices on
the market out there in the wild but
basically when it comes to long-term
advantages I tend to like I said prefer
things that are fundamental the
fundamentally different as opposed to he
has this feature doesn't have this
feature and basically the the key point
is that you know Android is open and
that's something that this thing it just
differentiates it from from anyone else
so look for opportunities where you need
to customize the operating system so for
example you may have unique devices
right maybe it's putting putting a
mobile platform incarcerates pay
shuttles or satellites things of that
nature tractors for that matter I've
done that it could be four unique uses
for like i mentioned DoD public safety
is another example enterprise customers
etc or it could be for specific
verticals so those are those are kind of
the areas where Android is going to
outshine any other platform for a very
very long time because it's a
fundamental difference and a lot of
people ask well what's going to be next
big thing in Android and the answer is
really we don't know nobody other than
Google knows but what I do know is that
you know it's going to be the breeding
ground for all the future innovations
just because the fact it's open and
there's so many different parties
involved with it how stable is it it's
stable enough that you know DRDs using
it for mission-critical safety it's
stable in update NASA send the most
powerful ever satellite to space the
first 32-bit computer was a nexus one
that was ever sent to space right so
it's it's stable enough for you know
life-or-death situations well thank you
