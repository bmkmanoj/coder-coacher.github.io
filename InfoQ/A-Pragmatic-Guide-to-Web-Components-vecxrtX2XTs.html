hour or so is called a pragmatic
approach to web components and so just a
little bit about myself my name is Jacob
Hughes ER I'm a principal web developer
at LinkedIn I've been with the company
for about I guess half the company's
life and have seen us move from Yui to
jQuery seeing us try and pick up new
technologies all while trying not to
break the legacy code that we've put
into the site to get it to where it was
so it's just a little bit about me
but today there's some stuff we're going
to talk about and before we get there
here's some of the things we're not
going to talk about so there will be no
w3c spec sing-alongs I promised I won't
do a soapbox about the WebKit prefixes
and how we use them and I'm pretty sure
there will be no dancing yeah I'm sure
some people appreciate that instead the
stuff we're gonna be talking about is
the what and why of web components
what are they why do they matter how do
we use them and we're gonna actually
look at some live code so as part of the
preparation for this presentation we
have live code that's going to be in
polymer ember angular and react all
providing web component like
functionality we're gonna be doing a
really basic carousel just to show the
code just to show some of the
differences and more importantly to show
that we can actually do web component
like functionality today and then
finally we're going to talk a little bit
about responsible component usage how
we're gonna do web components in a
responsible manner how we're not going
to mess up the internet in the process
hopefully and some of the lessons we can
learn from our predecessors who had
similar design patterns before we
actually came along with web components
the way I like to do these presentations
is when people have questions just put
your hand up I'll repeat them as we go
I'd prefer if people wait till the
approximate end of the slide or the
beginning of a slide just because then
we can talk while it's doing weird
transitional stuff but also instead of
getting a bunch of questions at the end
I find it's much better we have the
conversation as we go as we explore this
topic together so hands go up I'll call
on you I'll repeat the questions for the
according and also for the room I've
only got one of my to like lapel mics so
if I end up taking this down hopefully
can people still hear me in the back
okay
ish really well okay
for Carl sake I'll use the microphone
helps me say old school so let's
actually dive in what are web components
and why do we care so let's go back in
time to the start of the web where aside
from the doctype tag things were pretty
simple
you had your HTML tag you had a body tag
you had some content and things were
pretty straightforward to use paragraphs
for paragraphs heading tags for headings
things were really really simple pages
were easy they were they were the idea
of a single page app didn't exist and
you could go through submit forms
perform tasks it was it was pretty easy
so what happened well what happened was
we decided to start adding UI elements
to the page that weren't natively
supported by the browser these were
things such as tabs these were things
such as dialogues date pickers and style
able drop-down lists I realized to this
day we still can't style the Select
element the thing is is that with every
one of these things they came with the
opinion about markup about CSS about
JavaScript and you had to add these to
your page you had to add these layers of
complexity and the web got fat for those
for those are not able to see the slide
is a picture of a kind of chubby looking
beluga whale so he's kind of looking
around wondering what happened and what
happened was the web to him so here's a
screenshot of LinkedIn's page something
I'm not particularly proud of but it
highlights the problem our home page has
oh I'd say about 11 layers of nesting
until you get to the first content
on the page and that's just the profile
image in the top left corner we've got
divs we've got spans we've got
non-semantic classes we've got script
tags as placeholders where you can see
the stuff that says like LinkedIn slash
control we've got a minimal number of
IDs but more than I'd really care to
have throughout the page and all of this
is to create a rich page if you crack
open Gmail it actually has approximately
47 layers of nested divs in order to
provide the content and functionality
that's the web we've created we've taken
a pile of trash and made something that
looks good if you look at it in just the
right light this is a photo actually
this art installation is actually a pile
of trash with the right light the the
artist actually collected six months of
trash piled it just so and when shined
with a light actually creates the shadow
in the background of two individuals who
are leaning back to back kind of
enjoying life but this is the web this
is what our websites look like right now
is people see the stuff on the wall the
pretty shadows but we know inside we
know what we use to make it and that's
not good that's not the web we want we
want a simpler web we want something
that goes back to basics where we're not
piling in div tags piling in spans
basically piling in all the trash when
you use something like Twitter's
type-ahead
shouldn't you be able to just refer to
it by a tag say twt TR - type ahead and
specify a source how many people here
have actually looked at the site to do
MVC just a quick show of hands okay
about half so to do MVC is this website
that has JavaScript examples of pretty
much every framework that you could
possibly think of and has examples of
building a to-do list application using
all these different frameworks and it's
great but
for every one of those there's piles of
CSS piles of JavaScript why is it your
to-do application can't be a series of
tags can't be a local storage tag a
to-do app tag and in there there's to-do
items really semantic tags and if you
want multiple to-do lists on the page
why can't you reduce it down to a single
tag like to do - list and that
encapsulates all of your stuff the
return to semantic tags marks the start
of the extendable web what you saw in
those last examples with Twitter with
the to-do list that's the part of web
components that people really understand
and grasp the idea of taking
functionality and reducing it back down
to its semantic tags being able to
extend existing tags to add new
functionality it turns out hTML is a
great it's a great thing with HTML tags
we already gain a lot of benefits HTML
tags are semantic you can encapsulate
things you can put forms inside of a
field group and show their association
you can configure them you can put four
attributes on labels to indicate that
the text inputs that they go to and
they're already Dom friendly we already
know how to get elements by ID called
document query selector if we could
express all of our rich interactivity in
tags then we can use the existing
JavaScript API is to manipulate them
duplicate them clone them configure them
do whatever we want and that's the heart
of web components web components
contains several different
specifications put together by this
group called the w3c I promise we won't
do that spec sing-along I was talking
about earlier I'm trying to sing to a
spec is just never a good idea but web
components themselves besides having a
fancy logo really allows us to capture
the heart and soul of this idea of
having tags that represent a lot of
content
the creator of the co-creator of the web
components spec Dimitri glazkov said
custom elements is a bedrock API we
should be able to create any tag that's
in the browser using custom elements
that's how strongly he believes in it
web components web components consist of
several different pieces there's a
shadow Dom which means you can have an
entirely custom document embedded within
a tag
there's scoping rules and there's import
rules but at the end of the day most
people are gonna remember web components
for web components equals custom HTML
tag and because we're using an HTML tag
we're gonna get all this stuff for free
eventually so it turns out I'm kind of
picking on Internet Explorer here but
they're not alone native web component
specifications are only available in two
of the five major browsers chrome is
kind of the gold standard right now for
web components Firefox is close behind
it they have one minor bug they're
working on fixing opera is using the
blink engine so there are just a little
bit behind in terms of the actual
implementation but they'll catch up to
chrome relatively quickly
I'm unfortunate to report that Safari is
actually only does not support native
web components list some of the work
that have been there in shadow Dom was
pulled out because the code wasn't being
actively used which is good code hygiene
and they're working on bringing it back
but it's not there yet and as of ie11
nobody actually knows what Microsoft is
doing hopefully they're implementing it
they have them listed on their site as
specifications under consideration so
hopefully we'll see them in a later
version of ie 11 or ie 12 unfortunately
that means that 60% of the market share
is tied up right now and things that
don't support web components and if we
want to use native web components we're
gonna be waiting for a while the good
news is we don't have to wait if we want
the benefits of web components
day it turns out that there's actually
several modern web components here and
we'll actually go over them I call these
guys a Fab Four because I'd say about
four years ago all of them were just
Inklings in everybody's eyes they didn't
even exist how many people here have
actually played with and I'll go through
these these frameworks one at a time
have played with polymer by the Google
Group all right angular it's come up
like three or four times a lot of
angular hands
Facebook's react a couple hands and
ember and Virg is cool so one of the
things that's worth saying up front here
is as we talk about the code this is
gonna be an opinion free section we're
gonna be talking about how we do web
components I don't really have a
preference for what the best framework
is for doing this I'll leave the arguing
to the questions section at the end of
the presentation just know that you can
actually achieve web component like
functionality with all four of these so
this is our target markup we're gonna be
putting together a very simple hash like
carousel thing here we've got a my
carousel tag it's got three my carousel
items inside of it and so we're gonna
kind of initialize this carousel with
three things the reason we kept it this
simple was it gave us target markup that
we could aim for this would be valid
native web components in a web component
world and that allows us to actually do
our implementation in a very consistent
manner across all four of these
frameworks so we can talk about the
differences and what really where these
different different frameworks shine so
we're gonna start with ember and the
reason we're going to start with ember
is it's carousel markup is currently the
most non web component looking item out
of the bunch part of that is because
ember uses handlebars as a templating
engine and from there eventually they're
going to go to HTML bars but they do
everything inside of these script tags
and they compile
templates i've actually highlighted line
two here so this is the one people can
see where we use a handlebars helper
called II - carousel to kind of indicate
where the Ember carousel object is and
then we put the content nodes inside of
it so when you do web components in
ember you get the benefit of being able
to go back all the way to ie6 not that
anyone should be using ie6 by this point
but you could go back there if you
really really needed to Eric Bryn did a
bunch of work to make sure that the
ember stuff works it's slower the older
the IE you use but it actually is
functional as I mentioned there's a
handlebar helper for II - carousel
that's the handlebars syntax with the
double curly brace there that
instantiates the component and then
there's a matching template with a
handlebars name of components /e -
carousel that stamps out our template
there's a special handlebar helper
called yield which captures those
original nodes so all three of those
carousel items so you can do something
with them and then the J's convention in
ember you can map II - carousel - app
carousel component ember does a lot of
convention based magic and as long as
you follow their naming conventions
things ought to instantiate for you and
off you go so this is the actual
carousel implementation and assuming the
Internet is working watch you get a
jsbin here at the end where we've got a
Content tag here with our yield helper
just to highlight some of the big things
and then inside an ember to select the
carousel items we can do VAR dollar sign
items equals this dollar sign carousel
each content items and that can give us
our original initialized tags we can go
feed those into the carousel models
inside of ember and the end result is
our carousel so well actually I'll
animate this one so everyone can see but
for the most part these things click
they wrap around it's a very very
straightforward carousel and all these
examples are actually going to be
visible on jsbin they're also in the
presentation with the link at the end
here so everyone can go look at the
examples play around clone the j/s
and trying new things just enough to get
everyone going so kind of moving from
the really really not native web
components to the slightly less native
web components is react I know a lot of
people haven't really played with react
so let's talk a little bit about the
markup
so the markup looks something like this
this actually looks very close to our
web component specification with our
dash carousel and our dash carousel item
so a little bit of full disclosure in
this example we're using a plug-in on
top of react called reactive elements
and I'll talk a little bit about that as
well if you were using pure react you
could do react top to bottom in your
application and you'd be fine if you
want to have web components an
independent of whether or not you're
using react you want to just put this
tag somewhere on the page and have it
work then you want to add reactive
elements reactive elements with either
the Mozilla or Google polymer or X tags
shim will let you knock out custom
elements and you can register a react
component and map it to your custom HTML
tag the good news is because react uses
a language called JSX and has its own
compiler it'll go all the way back to IE
7 if using reactive elements the
polyfills go back to IE 9 so you have
the option of using pure react if you
need to reach all the way back to older
browsers the other thing is that the JSX
the syntax that Facebook uses in JSX
allows you to scope your styles and
scope your script at your school your
content script down into these local
react components so you don't end up
with any seepage if you want to refer to
an element and say all a tags in this
scope are read it'll make them read it
won't leak out into the main page that
actually ends up being really really
powerful because now you've got that
encapsulation piece so whereas with
ember we don't really have the full
encapsulation because with JSX we're
compiling we're able to achieve that
encapsulation piece so the
implementation either in a standalone
file
an inline script tag is you put this JSX
react Dom at the top that tells the
compiler hey I'm react I know what to do
with this we go in we set up our items
and then we have thanks to reactive
elements under the dis dot props there's
an underscore content-rich which refers
to our content nodes that came from
react we can then call document.register
react and that associates our - carousel
with this react component pull it all
together and there we go we've got our
same carousel we've got the R - carousel
you can kind of see here on the left and
then I've just got the JSX stuff in line
- beneath it so that it kind of fits on
one screen and that's how you can get a
react component going angular is
probably the thing most people here are
familiar with just looking at the show
of hands angular is a little bit closer
because angular allows us to natively
refer to stuff using the angular
directive syntax and I'll get into that
very briefly here so we have egg -
carousel with an egg - component and
then we've got our carousel items inside
when we do web components in angularjs
our internet explorer compatibility is
actually dependent on which version of
angular we're using so starting with
angular 1.3 is going to be IE 9 and
newer so just so people can keep that in
mind if you need IE 8 support you can
use 1.2 angular doesn't support IE 7 i
talked a little bit about this concept
of directives directives are angular's
way of being able to specify or identify
code to run within your markup we're
going a step further and I'll show you
in the code we're actually gonna declare
a directive within the application that
take care of the anger - carousel object
just as if it were a custom custom
element and then the other important
thing is that there's a very variable
and angular that
you can request in your controller
called dollar sign transclude through a
whole bunch of angular magic you can put
these dollar sign variables in your
function call angular will identify them
and it will give you back the proper
objects transclusion is a property
that's unique to angular it's their way
of getting a copy of the original nodes
before you go blow them away with your
template so when we go to implement an
angular we still have to stamp out a
template so there's a custom tagline
around
anga - template and width for and
carousel and this gives us our angular
template we can then refer to it and we
can pull it in by saying document query
selector give me that template we use
angular's angular dot module and angular
not directive in order to create the
Anchor cell there's a little bit of
convention in angular where if you do
anga - carousel it'll automatically look
for something with a matching camel case
so lowercase ang capital C carousel it
just maps that for you automatically and
then finally inside of our directive we
identify the angular controller and you
can see there we've got the dollar sign
transclude and the dollar sign
transclude function gets as a parameter
the original nodes so this lets you get
at those carousel items populate the
carousel and actually build the output
we click over to the jsbin and once
again we actually have a working
carousel and so when you guys are
clicking through these slides you'll
actually be able to for all these
examples they're all live J's bins and
you can actually see them actively
working you can play around with them
kind of do whatever you want we've got a
little bit of CSS in here where needed
just so people can see like a template
we gave it a display:none so the
templates don't show let's see put that
back the way it was there we go
and then finally in the list of the four
frameworks that we're talking about here
in the first half of the presentation is
polymer polymer is built by the Google
team and it's carousel markup is very
very close to web components the reason
for this is polymer is trying to be a
web components shim for all browsers so
we can actually expect what we're gonna
see is the closest to web components
unfortunately because it's trying to
provide the shimming certain
functionality is not available except in
what they call evergreen browsers so
Safari is evergreen because of WebKit
chrome is evergreen firefox is evergreen
IE 10 and newer is evergreen and that's
the plan and that's polymers target so
if you want to get on board with the
newest latest greatest polymer actually
is probably the I don't support anything
from the past issue of them so and the
way it works is you define a polymer
element inside of HTML you say polymer -
element you give it a name and you say
no script that's just their convention
and it defines a custom element because
polymer is trying to shim web components
all of your JavaScript and all of your
CSS is automatically scoped within the
bounds of the polymer element tag so
nothing leaks out you don't have any you
don't have like changing a P tag changes
all the P tags on the page you get that
encapsulation and as a result your
implementation starts to look a lot like
the implementation from the web
component specification you have a
polymer element in this case we declare
it as P carousel we then have a Content
ID that says I want to retrieve content
from previous Dom so the Dom before I
instantiated
I had to say in this case I wanted to
select P carousel items from within
there then I can go in with polymer
inside of the script tag and say this
doc content dot get distributed nodes
the get distributed nodes function is a
part of the shadow
and that's part of what polymer is
exposing is this new functionality so
you can say give me the original stuff
anytime you appendchild now you're gonna
be appending to a fake node and we'll
see if I can actually pull that up here
in a moment the implementation is very
very straightforward except I didn't put
a background so it's not as visible here
but like all the others that it clicks
through and if you come down here you'll
actually see here's our polymer element
with the template fully stamped out and
this is actually using the web
components template specification the
web components custom tag specification
the web components shadow Dom that's
actually why I'm doing the presentation
in chrome is because I know it'll work
in Chrome whereas with other browsers is
questionable you can do it in Firefox
with polymer I could actually switch
this over to native web components and
we could actually go all the way back to
our original example and we could
implement that so all four of these
frameworks unlock the ability to do web
component like functionality it's a
different way of doing the web no longer
do you have to go in and say okay I'm
gonna have my JavaScript over here and
I'm gonna have my CSS over here and I'm
gonna have my markup in this third place
all the way over here and then I'm gonna
tie them all together what web
components gives us is that
encapsulation it's almost like having a
bunch of iframes on your page only
without all the overhead of iframes so
if you how many people here remember the
iGoogle web page a couple people yeah so
the iGoogle web page had all these
concepts of widgets that you could put
on your page you can mix them match them
they were all relatively square shaped
custom elements really give you the
ability to do something conceptually
like iGoogle but without any of the
overhead you don't have the iframes
everything is in the DOM everything is
running native JavaScript and there's no
trickery at that point and that's
actually the heart and soul of the
composable web we're gonna be able to
create all kinds of beasts with this and
it's gonna be amazing
we're gonna be able to create tags for
everything we could possibly imagine so
the other big thing is that you can
actually put them together you can take
say oh I don't know your web components
that you do in angular and you can drop
them into polymer or drop them into
ember or drop them into react and you
can put them all together you've got one
of the co-creators of ember saying that
Ember templates should be able to work
in things like polymer before anyone
says it says that I realize there are
some caveats to this there's probably
quite a big problem with putting
frameworks inside a frameworks inside of
frameworks the end result of that is
going to be that we're gonna be taking
this beast and if we're not careful it's
going to end up something a little more
like this oh yeah which really kind of
brings us to the last third of the
presentation here about building a
better web and being responsible with
our web components so the first thing I
don't even have a slide for it so I'm
actually gonna talk about this very
specifically here while I've got
everyone staring at a really boring
segue slide we don't want to replace UI
elements of the browser so I'm making
this as a request to all of you please
do not implement X button X select X
scrollbar X I don't know someone else
named a native browser thing oh come on
browser UI thing which one which one
yeah list there you go X list don't
don't do that especially the ones you
interact with so much work has been done
by browser vendors to make these things
accessible to make them work in a
reliable manner there's a really great
post by Nicholas Zakas
from about I guess two years ago where
he said we can't implement a button he
talked about the evolution of the button
tag how his people needed a style it we
went from a button tag to a link and of
course for those that are accessibility
minded you said well links are a
terrible idea you should actually make
sure that it has more functionality so
we would add an aria role to it and it
would be a role button and then we'd be
like oh but you need to make sure you
can tab to it properly so we put a tab
index on it and we're still not to a
button the reality is we can't make a
button like the browser can that
interacts the way the browser can when
we think about the UI elements we make
we need to understand that we want to
build on top of existing UI components
provided by the browser not replace them
so with that said let's talk a little
bit about an old friend who doesn't even
exist in terms of macro media and
probably won't exist in terms of Adobe
probably within the next few years so I
know we've been saying that for like
three years the flash is going away
it'll go away I swear but there's a lot
of lessons that come from Macromedia
flash and the reason is is because flash
has been here the exact same stuff we're
talking about right now flash has been
here it has components via the movie
clips it allows nesting of movie clips
or components so you can do this whole
don't repeat yourself philosophy that
encapsulation gives you it uses Ekman
script the same fun --then date found to
that foundational scripting language
that javascript is built on this is
nothing new we've actually been here and
we were here eight nine ten years ago
with ActionScript to the idea of movie
clip libraries and it was like I think
there was something like free flash
Clips calm or so
like that we've been here we've seen how
flash can get plagued by bloat because
you have huge component hierarchies
we've seen the complexity when you're
trying to trace something and you'll
double-click on your movie clip and
that'll take you to your movie clip that
you double click on that you double
click on that you double click on that
you double click on that you double
click on that you double click on oh
there's a movie clip for the background
color somebody decided to take a 1x1
square of blue and turn it into a
background clip and put that in the
select box in the component in the
component and the component in the
component of the component we can end up
there we're not careful thankfully we
have a few new tricks in terms of
development and we're not restricted to
only the Adobe IDE in order to do it and
that's actually really beneficial for us
the first tool that's going to save us
is going to be Bower NPM could
technically fill this role as well but I
want to talk specifically about Bower
because of the way it resolves
dependencies in NPM when you resolve
dependencies and you say be depends on a
it'll put a copy of B inside of a this
works great for node modules where you
want to have isolation but it's terrible
for the browser where you want to
minimize the amount of stuff you
download Bauer uses a system called a
flat repository and so inside of your
Bower components directory if B depends
on a you get a copy of B and you get a
copy of a both in that top-level
directory and it's up to the build
tooling to resolve those dependencies
for you that means that if somebody
wants if you end up with a framework and
you want eight different versions of
jQuery instead of having eight copies of
jQuery you're gonna be forced to
normalize down to one and that'll keep
the bloat down significantly but
something has to figure out the
relationship between those build tools
the good news is grunt and gulp both
which have really kind of come into
prominence within the last year year and
a half have given us the ability to
solve this
there's bower plugins and grunt there's
Bower plugins and gulp if you're over an
ember
broccoli is gonna have a Bower plug-in
soon there's Fez there's brunch there's
I don't know you could probably throw a
stone and like hit seven different NPM
browser management utilities the good
news is is that these are catching up
quickly
these are allowing us to resolve our
dependencies and be able to make
intelligent build decisions as we put
our apps together and unlike where you
only had the limit of Adobe's IDE we're
dealing in just text there's Adam from
github there's sublime text there's text
mate there's of em there's Emacs there's
gonna be a plethora of things that are
gonna make it possible for us to do our
development and be able to do it in a
really good manner this is an exciting
thing because that means if you want to
go down and step through components and
step through dependencies all of our
editors that we use as web developers
are going to be are going to be
available to us and they're going to
understand web components because
they're gonna understand JSON and your
Bower dependencies are in JSON and
you're gonna be able to follow your web
component chain and it's not going to be
this mysterious black box so that pretty
much brings us to the conclusion where
we've got web components we've got this
really rich available ecosystem at our
disposal and we can do it today we can
do it in various degrees today if you
need to go all the way back to ie6 ie7
you can if you want to use cutting-edge
browsers you can if you want to use
native web components you can ich as
long as you're also not dealing with IE
and Safari but other than that we
actually have the ability to do great
things we have the ability to create new
rich interactions and encapsulate them
in a custom tag that's just something
we've never really been able to
conceptualize before and that's web
components and that's what makes
everything really powerful in this next
web so actually we're at about 10
minutes until time and
give or take and I wanted to make sure
there were questions we can go back to
any of the examples all the slides are
gonna be online at philosophy comm which
is my personal website /o wc6
is actually this exact slide deck only
I'm running it off a localhost copy and
yeah so I'm more than happy to go back
walk through some of these some of the
examples a little bit of history
learning three of these four frameworks
happen though as part of building this
presentation and going just to give
people an idea of how powerful this has
become we've all all those examples went
from knowing nothing to having working
an example in about five to six hours of
effort that's how good the documentation
is that's how good these frameworks are
that's how possible this really is yeah
so the question was what are the
downsides to web components and I think
a lot of the downsides we're gonna see
are gonna be really similar to those we
saw with flash it's gonna be
mismanagement and bloat I expect when
web components come out there's going to
be somebody that creates I don't know
web components for EUCOM and you're
gonna be able to upload all of your web
components for sharing and they're gonna
proliferate everywhere and that means
like jQuery plugins of your we're gonna
have to use a very careful eye when we
look at web components to understand
what are they doing are they valuable
and are they giving us what we want
there's Jake there's jQuery plugins
everywhere and I for people that have
worked with jQuery and have worked with
plugins probably have the experience of
plugins are very hit and miss sometimes
it's a fantastic plugin sometimes it's a
really atrocious plugin and you have to
go through like eight or nine different
jQuery plugins so you find the right one
I expect we'll have similar problems
with web components I think that the
other problem that we're gonna see is a
proliferation of components that strip
away accessibility so when I talked a
little bit on the segue slide about the
idea of buttons and selects all having
all this natural browser interaction
that makes life easier someone's going
to create X select it's not going to be
anyone in this room because I told you
all not to
but someone's gonna do it and it's
probably not you're not gonna be able to
tap into it right or you're not gonna be
able to use the arrow keys just right
and it's not gonna be accessible and
that's we're gonna screw it up it's
gonna go all over the Internet
hopefully these like 50 60 people will
help manage it and make sure that it
doesn't go into their code but at the
very least I mean it's gonna happen and
I think that's actually the biggest
problem is people are gonna look at it
like jQuery plugins and be like these
things are everywhere their varying
quality hopefully most people will do
the responsible thing and say you know
our app has unique needs we're gonna
build our own internal set of web
components on top of a web component
library something that gives us a local
storage module something that gives us a
very basic data model things like that
over here on the left yeah so the the
question was what's the difference
between what we're doing with web
components and what we were doing with
XML I think the biggest difference
between them that we're looking at right
now is we are effectively doing XML I
mean sensibly we are aside from adding C
data tags everywhere we're creating
custom tags and giving them meaning much
like XML enabled us to unlike XML we're
not relying on server-side
transformations such as XSLT in order to
turn XML into markup with web components
we're relying on the browser's native
engines to do this transformation for us
to say hey this one tag represents
actually this entire module of code so
that's that's probably the biggest
definition I imagine that somebody will
create a web component XLT fancy thing
because we we seem to be creating a lot
of that stuff right now and throwing it
up and like NPM so somebody will create
a transformation tool most likely where
you can go from XML through xslt and to
web components I dunno there's already
like gulp WC and grunt WC which can
actually assemble your web component
object for you so things are moving
really quickly here on the left and then
we'll come all the way back to the right
so the question of the question was
what's holding web components back at
the
part of it and I think was holding web
components back is whether or not
companies are able to identify the
blocks of reusable components it's a
very different way just a year ago we
were talking about single page apps and
okay we're gonna have models and views
and controllers that was all very I
think the term we tend to use is we call
it an imperative web where we said we
had we use code to describe everything
web components come to something that's
called a declaratory actually are using
very strongly typed HTML tags to
describe functionality I think what
holds the people back is that's a very
different way of thinking how many
people remember writing trying to get
dive into angular I saw about half of
the room that I put their hands up how
many people understood angular on the
first try and there's zero hands angular
was a very different way of thinking it
was one of the first frameworks that
really embraced declar de style
everything's a tag well what about if
it's not a text shut up it's a tag like
that was that was how it worked and you
had to rethink like well where do I put
my routing logic as an attack where do I
put my attack what a tag tag like that
was that was angular that's web
components too and I think what holds us
back is going is that idea of thinking
about things as reusable blocks of
content and how they relate in a
hierarchical structure so that we can
embrace HTML I think there will be
pattern sites that come out I actually
do know there is one I don't remember
the URL for it that has web components
if you really which one I think so
components kitchen and there's another
one which I should have put in the
presentation I'll probably update the
slides today as well to make reference
of it how many people have used like the
Google API s before like the JavaScript
API s so your world solved there's
actually a suite of HTML tags for web
components that do everything you want a
Google map less than Google map greater
than oh you want it with latitude and
longitude less than Google map lat
equals long equals greater than
for docs for spreadsheets for Google+
for Google Maps for all the Google stuff
has web components already that's how
much they're betting on it and from an
implementation standpoint you don't
actually want to have a bunch of
JavaScript that configures it and sets
it up and then manipulates it you really
want to be able to just here's my Google
Map object and then now I can access
that with like document.getelementbyid e
and do whatever operations I need to on
it so I think it'll come with time I
think to your question again what holds
us back we're being held back by a way
of thinking more than the actual ideas
themselves over here on the right yeah
I've actually so the question was
whether or not I built anything more
complex than a three item carousel that
wraps yes when you get into that I
didn't want to go too much into it
because I wanted to focus on the web
components piece but every framework has
their own concepts around message
passing and encapsulation strategies so
ember because you're working in the
ember app component namespace you can
pass you can actually use standard
eventing and ember in order to type of
components talk to views components are
really just an extension of ember views
for those that want to get really
technical and so they can push things
back in the models which can be listened
to by controllers and can push data back
into the view back into other views and
you can take advantage of embers data
data binding react has its own message
passing system we're using JSX you can
add on click handlers and you can public
bubble things in and out let's see here
angular has its message passing system
which I started down that road and then
I realized I was running out of time so
I decided I should really probably
finish the polymer example and polymer
because the standard is trying to
polyfill you can just use regular events
and so it's really gonna come down the
style if you're using web components you
can just attach them to your page and
you can partially adopt a framework
ember and react also let you go whole
hog so does angular polymer is about the
only one that technically doesn't
because I mean you can make a page of
web components and you can have a my
dash app
tag at the top but fundamentally like
it's a slightly different way of
thinking so depending on how many or how
few web components you want
they all have systems for the messaging
for inter component communication
some of them like ember have gone a step
further and have already thought through
Ajax data binding Dhamma react has
thought about Dom updates to minimize
reflows so they've all kind of got their
strengths and so in terms of things I've
personally played with I've done a lot
of ember I've done a very little bit of
angular and I've done a lot of polymer
just to see what the specification is
supposed to behave like cool we've got
about five minutes until time for any
other questions if anybody has anything
yeah in the back and then over here on
the right so the question was how are
people unit testing their polymer
components and I actually think there's
going to be two problems that people are
gonna run into the first problem people
are gonna run into is dependency
injection so your your polymer a your
polymer element or your custom element
once we get native depends on this other
thing how do you make sure you're
dealing with only your custom layer in
the composition how are you testing just
your stuff without a weird dependency on
the underlying infrastructure and the
piece of that I think is that we don't
have an answer yet
AMD which is a popular module system for
the browser it stands for asynchronous
module definition a bunch of great work
done by James Burke and the require.js
folks kind of touches on this where we
deal with dependency injection and
there's some stuff out there like
redefines Squier which allow you to kind
of mock your dependencies I think we're
gonna need something like that for web
components I don't think we have an
answer yet and I think that's one of
those pieces that will really hurt our
ability to do component level testing
because in theory it's integration
testing not unit testing at that point
but trying to test how that piece works
together and it works in ecosystems
gonna be a big challenge so I don't
think we have an answer yet yes I am an
employee at LinkedIn
so currently it LinkedIn we actually
have a older homegrown framework that
was some of those script tags when I
showed everybody the large like really
horrible nested markup stuff we're
currently running internal prototypes
where we're using Li backbone for some
stuff we have an internal backbone build
that we use just to avoid having to like
rewrite a bunch of Commons code between
apps and we're actually doing a lot of
experimentation with ember part of our
requirements as I talked about with the
Internet Explorer boundaries / framework
ie is a big dictator for us about what
we have to support while we've been able
to retire ie 7 we're still working on
trying to nudge people off of ie 8 until
which point we do that we have to look
at frameworks that make sure they
support ie8 and try and plan for it in
advance so that's actually how it kind
of informs our decision we do like many
other tech companies we do like hack
days and stuff once a month where people
will just build whatever they want
scratches things like that and so I've
seen people pump out different react
items different polymer items so it's
getting used and like prototypes and
stuff but internally the stuff we've
been actually focused on has been
primarily if you were to pick any of
these component strategies that's been
ember and that's just because of the
support matrix cool all right so we're
at time it's about 10 minutes till give
people time to go out shuffle room
