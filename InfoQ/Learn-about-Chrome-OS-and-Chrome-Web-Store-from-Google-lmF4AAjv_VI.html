the chrome developer relations team
basically what that means is I get to
get people excited about using chrome I
get excited about the web store because
i think it's a new type of engagement
with the web that we weren't getting
before i think what's possible now is to
build on top of that and really engage
users and get them involved in using
websites more like applications so doing
rich things like editing text editing
images even editing video or playing
games hi my name is our nuh I work for
Google in the developer relations team I
work with the chrome team so my
specialty is basically chrome apps and
extensions and that kind of thing these
are all stuff that all things that are
built using html5 JavaScript CSS
everything so I kind of get to talk
about a lot of different topics but
today I'm mostly going to focus on
chrome Chrome OS and the Chrome Web
Store just some little metadata I'm my
twitter handle is at Kerak k you are Rik
I mostly talk about stuff thats related
to extensions extension development in
chrome usually stuff that you'll find
that's near the browser so you can
follow me if you want and get up-to-date
on all that so let's kick off the
presentation I know you've all been
waiting here for a while and kind of
with the rain and everything so let's
cut to the chase it's 2010 where's my
freaking jetpack right it's we're in the
future I don't have my jetpack I'm
getting angry well this sentiment is
kind of one I at least and sympathetic
to but I do get to work with one piece
of future technology which is really
amazing every day and that is my
incredibly smart and capable incompetent
browser that never lets me down unless
it gives me a sad face crash tab anyway
smart browsers so we are living in 2010
and now we actually have these pieces of
technology that are so advanced that we
get to do things that we never thought
would be possible over the in
yeah we're no longer limited to
rendering only text or text and images
or needing a plug-in to do anything
really interesting the kinds of
capabilities that are possible today are
mine mind-blowing you know if I didn't
do it every day I wouldn't believe it
myself so I'm hoping that I'll give you
some examples of what is possible in a
browser today and what we can do and
what you can do as developers to take
advantage of that here's a controversial
a little image this is the html5 logo
which if you know anything at all about
html5 you might think it's a little bit
inappropriate because this logo is
actually covering a lot of different
technologies css3 kind of just a whole
bunch of stuff that's maybe not
specifically in the html5 spec but it is
a great great symbol to rally round
because this is kind of everything
that's new in the browser everything
that's kind of exciting and that's being
worked on so we're kind of using the
symbol to evangelize and just champion
these new features and what are these
new features well I'll cover a few of
them so we have storage and files this
is the first one that I really find
amazing that stuff that you couldn't do
in the past with just a browser so for
example I'm going to follow this link
here and what we have here is an actual
terminal that's been written using
javascript only javascript that's
running in the browser and i'll show you
some stuff that we can do now with with
the file system so we have this file
system demo and i'll just list the
directory so what each web app now gets
today is a virtual directory kind of a
sandbox environment where they can store
files and write files and read files
just like you would with a normal file
system so for example here are a couple
files that I've uploaded and I can
actually do things like open them so
open my cr-48 jpg and you can actually
see that I've opened up a image of that
was stored in this file system API this
is the JPEG that I put in and you'll
actually see that the the way that it's
kind of scoped here in
my browser hopefully you can see this is
that it's referred to as a blob so this
is just basically a string of bytes that
javascript is now able to manipulate and
it's scoped to the domain that the
sample is running on and the file itself
is just this serial hash so the files
don't have real file names they at least
to your operating system but to the
browser into the JavaScript that's
manipulating them you can actually work
with files directly so if I look here
again I can delete this cr-48 jpg LS the
scroll you see that's not no longer
there and then if I were to actually do
something like take this image which is
available on my desktop here and then so
this is going to be tricky and when I
drag and drop it on to this terminal you
can see that I file added the file i'll
just do LS here and i will do open again
cr-48 rate that jpg you can see that I'm
manipulating this file and interacting
with it by dragging files into and out
of the webpage so what does this mean
for the potential web apps that you can
do with it this functionality well think
about everything that you thought that a
web app couldn't do because it didn't
have access to local files right you can
download stuff from the internet you can
allow the user to manipulate stuff in
manipulate content and then you can save
it back into your file system and work
with that data so the the app itself the
website itself has this kind of stateful
nature now that it used to not really
have with without a server to stall this
data retrieve it and you're no longer
limited by the network itself so you can
do with this all locally without
uploading a single bite to the Internet
it's very powerful and it's brand-new
and chrome I actually have to run with a
special command line flag in this build
of chrome but we're hoping that in about
six weeks this will be available on
stable channel so hopefully you know
people will be able to start using it
when you start writing for chrome and do
some really really interesting things
storage and files so
the next thing I kind of want to talk
about is semantics obviously not the
sexiest API ever or a portion of the API
ever but probably the the part that's
most most relevant when you say html5
right this is actually in the html5 spec
and this is all the new page elements
that you can use to mark up your content
these are all style and their unique so
you can actually start referencing
specific elements on your page without
having to resort to classes and ID's and
so on and the really interesting thing
is that web crawlers like Google like
you know like being I guess and Yahoo
can all go over this content and pull
out semantic information from it screen
readers can go and pull out semantic
information about it they can identify
which parts of the page are important
and which parts are actually contained
information and which parts might be you
know side bars or headers and footers so
using these types of elements is
extremely important because it will let
us use mashups and really or let us
create mashups that really reference
stuff automatically and maybe do a
better job of presenting content for
example uh I don't know if you guys are
familiar with this new what was it it
takes a web page and reformats it so
that it's more readable using this kind
of markup can actually help create stuff
like that which is really cool and
useful for the end user multimedia is
another big major thing that we couldn't
do in the past so think about it as if
where you had an image before right you
you could draw an image into a page and
kind of just leave it there and then
JavaScript came along and you could
start manipulating that image and you
had CSS and you could style it and move
it around and and now you can do all
sorts of interesting static stuff with
images well just like images we can
actually start using javascript and CSS
to style multimedia stuff like html5
video and audio so when we have
programmatic access to a video for
example here we can draw it into a
canvas and because canvas has some
amazing drawing routines week
actually do really cool stuff like
blowing it up and that's where you
that's the power that you get when video
itself is just a raw data stream that
goes into the browser is made available
to JavaScript and you can pull out that
image info and redraw it back onto the
canvas and do some really cool stuff so
for example this demo I just love it
because it's so fluid and so kind of
responsive and it plays back at full
frame rate and that's because the
browser's actually doing all the heavy
lifting in the background you're just
kind of hooking up different api's
calling different routines in javascript
but the browser itself is doing direct
memory copy of the video buffer frames
so you can actually do these really
perform an interesting mashups with
video now do another interesting thing
when we're talking about visual stuff
the css3 and this is a whole wide range
of styles and stuff so personally my
favorite is you know the ability to do
rounded corners on things box shadows on
things stuff that you used to have to go
into Photoshop maybe do a 9 slice image
and kind of just stretch everything out
make little divs and and put backgrounds
all over everything well with the new
styling methods that you have you can
actually do some really really
interesting stuff for example like kind
of impartial to this one because it's an
eighty eighty that's done just using
images and then rotating them using CSS
transforms and transitions and it's kind
of animating this whole Walker like
independently using only CSS it's not
using any sort of stuff like flash or
anything so you can see here
here's all the kind of bounding boxes
for all the images that are being used
just really cool stuff and all done
declaratively just like CSS is so you
kind of just declare how the animation
should behave or how the transition
should behave if stuff should be rotated
or if it should be translated and then
the browser takes care of that for you
you don't have to do any sort of
complicated JavaScript animation
routines yourself if you don't want to
in the same vein of cool sexy stuff
graphics and effects so we have some 3d
stuff and unfortunately my machine is
running a version of leopard so I don't
actually get full benefit of this it's
kind of limitation that we have in
chrome right now but other browsers are
kind of working on hardware acceleration
in all sorts of different contexts but
what I will show you is again I showed
you video frames being drawn into a
canvas well here's some of the power
that you can do with canvas and this is
kind of a double demo because this is
done entirely using grit so it was
actually written in Java but the quick
gets compiled into JavaScript and it's
using canvas which is a new kind of HTML
API that's available in browsers and you
can actually see that the demo itself is
doing some really cool stuff with
deforms it's got this kind of fisheye
lens here it's your kind of responding
to user input and it's all just images
being drawn and translated and
manipulated down to the pixel level and
you can see how fast and responsive it
is it's just kind of really going crazy
and this is all just drawing routines
things that you would use to need a
plugin for like flash now it possible
directly in the browser without any sort
of plug-in all you need is a browser
that recognizes canvas so that's a cool
one
and if you ever go to html5 rocks com
you can actually try oh it's actually
enabled for me so I'm not getting
hardware acceleration on here but this
is the 3d stuff that's available it's
called WebGL it's a variant of GL that's
kind of close to what you would program
with if you were writing a 3d mobile app
and you can see here that it's not
really like a stripped-down browser only
version of GL write it this is a fairly
complex scene again sorry if the image
is not very clear for you but if you go
to html5 rocks com there's a there's a
slide deck that you can follow and
that's where this slide is and it's it's
playing here right in my browser and
ever since we pushed chrome 92 stable
we've had a WebGL on stable channel for
all of our users another really cool one
is connectivity and networking so if you
weren't aware of some of the new network
stuff i would suggest checking out
causing because they do some really cool
like client-server packaging stuff but
that's all based off of a variety of api
is the one that's most interesting to me
i think is the WebSockets api so if you
actually go to rum patrol I think it's
calm right now you might actually find
me I see some guests so I wonder if any
of you guys are around here and what I
can actually do is see the interactions
that everyone else is doing on this
website in real time so it's cool you
guys are following me around I hope some
of these are you and not just random
changes but but you get an idea of how
this is actually scaling out to all of
these clients we're getting updates in
real time people are kind of swimming
around and it feels very responsive and
the reason that we can we can build this
it is kind of you know many-to-many
system is because of web sockets which
allows your browser to open up a
persistent connection to the rest of the
server to the server itself as opposed
to a stateless like HTTP connection and
you can pass data two ways back and
forth up and down that channel so the
server and
no longer needs to do anything crazy
like if you've ever written an
application that uses long polling maybe
to get updates whenever something
changes on the server the server can
directly write out to everything that's
connected to it so programming for the
web now when you're using this API is
less like delivering static assets or
delivering stateless kind of content
chunks down to the user we actually
maintaining State on the server you're
passing data down and you're taking
advantage of the fact that you know that
this is all done with very minimal
overhead so you can do things like
multiplayer games or you know online
editors where you see one person type or
something like that and it's so much
easier now because you used to have to
do all sorts of crazy hacks to do it so
for example if any of you used waste in
peace the stuff that went into wave was
kind of helped lay the found work
founding a foundation for this but
obviously if they had to come up with
their own system they have to do crazy
hacks you don't need to do crazy
headaches anymore so i'll quit up have
fun with that that's kind of cool so
another interesting thing is the
tendency for web apps to get access to
the device itself when I talk to the
device talk about the device it's worth
noting that I don't necessarily mean
laptops all the time for example while
I'm using a macbook there might be some
people out there surfing the web on
ipads phones you know we just I think
the Zoom Zoom Zoom came out today and
basically these are all very complex
machines that have access to a very
sophisticated html5 smart browser and so
when you get access to this device you
can start doing stuff that start using
capabilities that are available on the
device itself so long story short we can
take advantage of some stuff that
weren't even really available in
computers until recently so for example
if I wanted to find out which where I
could find Lions near me I could either
type in my name or my location or I
could just let my browser track me so i
can say allow here and hope
yeah so here we go it's actually fairly
accurate 338 spear street I think we're
3 4 5 and there's one 7.4 miles away so
I can rest easy tonight I just have to
keep reloading this page so we have
access to the GPS in cases where there's
a GPS in the device itself or in the
case where there is not like my laptop
there's all sorts of crazy systems that
have been put into place to to kind of
abstract this away so for example it's
tracking my either my IP address or
something else that it knows how where I
am finally a in terms well i would say
finally because there's a lot of stuff
coming down the pipe I think we're
working on stuff like inputs where
you'll be able to get photos video
directly from camera audio from a
microphone this pay sorry you'll get
audio from a microphone that kind of
thing so that's not there yet I can't
show that yet but what I can show you is
the orientation API which is in place in
chrome and what that does is actually
sorry i have to i can actually use the
tilt sensor in my macbook to actually
steer this guy around and up I didn't
get it and you don't play this game
using a different sort of you know
something that wasn't really even
possible until I guess the we came out
were there any other gaming systems that
took advantage of full motion like that
so till we nice okay so sega megadrive
it probably has rum Bob polls what would
tux racer and think that's too okay well
that's cool so I mean that's still stuff
that is definitely like a console and a
piece of software and now we can do it
on the web using HTML Javascript which
personally for me is a lot easier to
develop in so we kind of have this whole
system of AP is and all these kind of
cool hooks into your machine and and
everything and so what do we do with
this right we have like the standard of
web development up until this point was
not really suited for this we didn't
have all these funk features so we
basically wrote
sites that were front ends for databases
that were very content based but now we
can start thinking about web apps as
completely different animals you know
they're more application like and it
requires a different kind of thought
pattern and approach to things so what
if Seth were here sorry he was called
away on business he would actually kind
of go over here and tell you about all
these stuff that our team's kind of come
up with in terms of what makes a good
web app what are we looking for when
we're talking about next-gen web
experiences and I'll go over just kind
of the key points that we had that we
came up with together the first one is
tight focus so we thought that a modern
web app would do one thing and do it
really well so no longer you kind of
getting these portals that are like
everything rolled into one or you know
these kinds of experiences where you
know it's just a lot of content put
together web apps should kind of have be
in the same vein as a mobile app mobile
app kind of does one thing it's very
small bit of functionality and you know
cost a small amount of money usually
compared to like a piece of desktop
software and it's very consumable right
you can use it for a little bit of time
then move on do something else so that's
what we thought the pattern would be
really good for in terms of in terms of
these modern web apps it should take
advantage of a big screen so unlike a
web app but maybe more in vain of like a
tablet app or something like that you
have a lot of real estate when you're
using a computer so my laptop is a 15
inch or my workstation you know has big
monitor on it so you have a lot more
chance to do stuff than you would with a
small phone screen but so at the same
time a modern web app should take
advantage of all the different layouts
that it can be rendered in your not
necessarily confined to a small mobile
space but I want to put a caveat on that
and say that you still want to keep that
simple tight focus you just want to
expand and take advantage of the entire
window that's available to you there's a
rich experience in a mote in a modern
day web app so this is kind of like
you're not just sitting there passively
consuming you're interacting with it
you're kind of
changing things around in the app you're
you're engaging with it you're using
some of those inputs maybe it has some
animation whatever just tactile feedback
audio cues whatever just to make you
more immersed in using the application
it's visually visually stunning
obviously this is not necessary for a
functional app but it does deliver a
rich experience when the kind that you
think about when you're using maybe one
of those products by that fruit company
you know what the one I'm talking about
they do do design really well and I feel
like a lot of their software is is
really elegantly polished so we're
thinking that the kind of modern web
apps should really follow that aesthetic
it's really easy to do good design
nowadays and there's a lot of examples
to call from so we think that modern web
apps should really look good and feel
good too and then finally they should be
fast and and this is kind of very
important to us at Google we've done
studies and found out that if you speed
up an application or a web page by even
a few hundred milliseconds that the
amount of user engagement goes up by a
dramatic percentage and that's a really
great interesting statistic and I feel
like a lot of people just kind of gloss
over speed so there's a lot of new
technologies that you can use to speed
up your pages you can use the new CSS
stylings to remove the amount of images
that you need to use or cut down on the
Dom of your page itself there's all
sorts of tags inside of the Dom to load
scripts asynchronously so that you know
they get pulled down by the browser in a
more efficient way you can preload
assets remotely using kind of preload
tags you can also do things like web
sockets which have the the efficient
streaming communication to the server
and you can store data offline using
this file API and some other AP is just
to make sure that your application is
fast and responsive so there's all sorts
of things you can do to do to make your
application fast and I feel like it's
worth it to kind of brush up on those so
we have all this stuff and I've been
talking about it and so your question
maybe you're thinking okay it's great
like you know we've been hearing about
these specs for a long time I mean some
of these are not new right
around for a while is it the future yet
can we use them in our day-to-day
applications well we have a few
resources and when I say by me it's not
like me and Seth if you were here it's
not me and like all the other Googlers
it's it's the web community at large and
the first of these which I personally
like is called can I use com so there's
a listing of all of the api's that I've
talked about and then some and it
basically tells you which versions of
which browser you can use each feature
on so it's kind of a good road map to
determine hey depending on what I'm
targeting what can I use there's also
html5 boilerplate com this is done by
Paul Irish and I think some other folks
too i just know Paul but it's basically
a very quick ramp up to get a site
running using some html5 technologies so
he gives you cite templates he gives you
some Apache server configurations a few
other technologies now I believe and
it's just everything in a simple easy to
configure and use package that will let
you get a site up and running that lets
you take advantage of some of these
technologies right away so I urge you to
check that out if you're interested in
kind of poking around this stuff without
really without really needing to go and
read a whole bunch of spec spec
documents or technical stuff so I'll
kind of diverge from from the future
stuff and and for a second and then kind
of put a question to the audience's
basically if you had access to all the
stuff that I was talking about the demos
that I showed you so far what kind of
stuff would you build right like what
kind of experience would you build using
the web you know don't have to call it
out just think about it to yourself I
mean like what kind of stuff do you
envision and does it look like desktop
software does it look like mobile
software and what I can tell you is that
we have some people who have actually
been building stuff with the full
confidence and full kind of reliability
that all these features are going to be
available to them and these are
basically app developers who have been
writing for the Chrome Web Store so i'll
show you some examples and I've screen
shots but I also have the live apps
installed so for example we have NPR's
applique
in here and hopefully it will load yes
so the so you can see that the
experience of reading the news and
playing audio and doing all that stuff
is actually very much unlike NPR
standard website right like you actually
have scrolling little bits here I'm
sorry that the resolution is kind of low
so that you can't really see it too well
but you have different scrolling areas
different sections you can click in and
actually read content but it's very much
in a Appy kind of way it's something
that you'd expect to see on an iPad
maybe rather than something running
directly in your browser so that's one
example the next example is a game that
maybe some of you have played
entanglement which is a full-on browser
game done using html5 canvas and if you
look at this experience I think it's
just stunning to think about how how
kind of fluid it is how much it doesn't
really feel like a web page at all right
I'm just kind of playing this game
there's stuff floating around if I had
my speakers turn on it would be making
sounds and you can see here that it's
actually using drawing doing some crazy
overlays just taking advantage of a lot
of different api's just to give this
really immersive stunning web gaming
experience it's a game it's a great game
and again using html5 technology there's
word echo so if you're a fan of Scrabble
I probably shouldn't even say that but I
don't know how I'm sure they've got
things I'm sure things are good but you
can actually see here that the that the
app itself and again kind of zoom out
here it doesn't look like a website it's
running in my browser it's using all
this stuff but it's not using flash you
know it's it's just laid out HTML and
you can go and play things and you know
put some words here I'll put the name of
a very cool programming language in yeah
I got eight points for it so again this
is an experience
that is built using HTML that is not
constrained by needing to be kind of
backwards are compatible or worry about
if api's are not available this is what
you can build when you build for a
future futuristic browser and it's
unlike anything that you've basically
been using for the web to this point but
we're expecting to see a lot more of it
finally I've got wikihow which is just
another really cool content website
that's just skinned up and presented in
such a really interesting way so for
example I can learn if I want to survive
an animal attack or avoid rattle snake
attacks and it will give me some info
it'll let me quiz myself etc so again
not an experience that you would kind of
expect if you went to use google com
okay RNA you jerk this is all chrome
stuff stop talking about standards and
then just showing chrome stuff we're
what about the rest of the internet you
know and this is a valid complaint but i
am from google i do work for the chrome
browser so i mean understandably we're
very proud of the feature set that we
support so when we're when i'm up here
and i'm talking to you about html5 i'm
going to show you the api is that we
think we really do a good job on but i
do have four responses for for people
who are kind of maybe saying i'm not
addressing everything equally well
there's the first which is the what
would you have me do response basically
I don't believe it's worth development
time to kind of support legacy browsers
you know I think we've gotten to the
point where we can finally start killing
them off for real and really not not
bothering to spend you know maybe thirty
percent of our time for you know five to
ten percent of the browser market the
amount of work that I've done personally
to make internet explorer 6 render stuff
and fall back and do all that stuff is
probably wasted time in my opinion now
and I really would rather use it
spending to make these apps that I just
showed you the apps of that quality and
that polish that run really well on
browsers that have most of the features
support that I want so that's one of my
retort there's the we're big and we're
getting better a response so you can
actually see that chrome itself has been
on a kick and a very big tear lately and
we I forget actually what the dates were
that these correspond with so early in
2010 we now it's 70 million we announced
120 million just recently so if you
think about it Facebook was you know 100
million users in 2008 and now there are
500 million so I mean we're seeing a
really like nice kind of exponential ish
curve for Chrome we expect to keep
gaining market share we're putting a lot
of effort because we want people to use
this browser we want this in the hands
of a lot of users and 120 million users
is nothing to scoff at so if you can
develop using these features and reach
that kind of audience I think it's worth
it and again you can add in things like
Mozilla and even ie9 you know really is
realistically to even bump up that total
total even more there's also the use an
escape hatch response so if you're not
aware of it we have a piece of software
called chrome frame which is a plug-in
for internet explorer and if you decide
to support a chrome frame in your in
your site you can actually prompt the
user to install this plugin it is a
plug-in admittedly but we've kind of
been evangelizing and trying to get a
lot of big sites to use it so that a lot
of people who still like their older
browsers I don't want to switch can
still get the benefit variance by
installing the plug-in which actually is
a copy of chrome without any of the
chrome on it and it will render pages
using the chrome engine directly inside
of Internet Explorer so so it's very
easy once the user has the plug-in
installed you can basically tell the
browser to render it using the plug-in
you buy either of these two methods
there's a meta tag and there's also a
HTTP header and if you serve your
content with either of these and the
user has chrome frame installed then
everything's golden you basically have
another chrome user that will be viewing
your content yeah question yeah the
question was basically would this allow
users who may be our handicapped or
can't afford into our computer
to access content that's maybe designed
for maybe a more modern browser yeah and
I believe that that is definitely
something that this plugin will allow
you to do it basically takes the
rendering engine from ie6 and replaces
it with chrome which is faster in a lot
of cases in javascript terms it's much
faster so even if you have older
hardware you actually could you know I
don't have specific metrics to quote you
on this but you you I would expect you
to see a speed bump in terms of
rendering pages or executing JavaScript
heavy applications yeah especially if
you're doing stuff for school district
you know this is why we call it an
escape hatch you know because there
there's always audiences that you can't
convince to upgrade so if you're if you
have to develop for that kind of
audience this is our solution to that
and then my finally to bring things back
on to my retorts against this imaginal
imaginary straw man who is criticizing
me there's the brand new market response
and I have a picture here of a device
that maybe you're all familiar with it's
a cr-48 it is the test device test
prototype device that we're distributing
for Chrome OS and so I know we had
Chrome OS listed here on kind of the the
topic list for tonight and you know I'm
sad to say that it's a great device you
know like it's fun to use but there's
nothing really special about it because
you can go download a copy of chrome and
actually use a lot of the same
functionality that you would use on a
Chrome OS device but the interesting
thing about this is that we've seen a
lot of adoption from enterprises from
like school districts for example people
who want kind of maybe a lower-cost
notebook which I say lower costs because
when you're only running a browser as
your operating system you don't need all
the extra hardware and stuff that you
might normally so the costs can be lower
also the performance can be better for
comparable hardware because you are
basically stripping out most of the
operating stuff that operating system
stuff that sits between the browser and
the hardware of the computer so when
you're running chrome directly on
hardware with minimal OS
that basically means that stuff will run
faster compared to a comparable machine
so we have these companies these kind of
organizations that are very interested
in these machines because they're
they're just a browser there's very
little you can do to infect it with
spyware for example or do anything like
that we believe it's the most secure
operating system that's ever been
written you know it's kind of the thing
that we've we've been saying so
basically we have this brand new market
of users who will only be using Chrome
as their operating system and this is an
attractive proposition for developers I
think just because these people need
apps these people need the kinds of
things that maybe they relied on for
windows things like notepad and stuff
like that so we've actually seen a lot
of very popular apps inside of the
Chrome Web Store have been stuff that
replicate functionality for applications
that maybe you were used to packaging
with your OS but now that it's available
on the web these applications can offer
enhanced functionality like
synchronizing online and things like
that so I'll kind of dive into a few
specific notes on Chrome OS for the time
being like I said it's it's unsexy from
a development point of view when you
compared to Chrome because it's
basically Chrome it has one new feature
as far as i know it has panels so if you
were to use window open the same
JavaScript function that you would use
to open a window on your browser you can
actually have it open up in a docking
panel and then a render content into
that using the standard HTML stuff you
would normally use on Chrome if you use
window open it just opens up a new
window so that's one difference and then
the other difference is Chrome OS does
not have support for native code so you
cannot use NPAPI which is maybe a
fallback that some extension developers
for Chrome have been using so NPAPI if
you're not familiar with is a standard
for browser plugins stuff like flash is
written using it and you will be unable
to write code which uses NPAPI for
Chrome OS we do have some solutions to
kind of replace it one of these is
native clients which is an open source
project we've been bundling it with
chrome for a while now and it lets you
compile
see code in a way that can be delivered
over the Internet run cross-platform and
run with the speed of native code while
still taking advantage of security
sandbox that we have available for it so
basically we're expecting folks to
develop in that manner going forward and
kind of trying to kill MP and a p.i
while we can and the great thing like I
mentioned before is we're relying on the
web to supply functionality so as a
developer think about things that you
use on your computer there there's no
reason why you couldn't develop that on
the internet for almost every
application you could throw at me I
think you know people say Photoshop in
3d modeling and I know I'll admit that
maybe the performance isn't good enough
yet for you know 48-bit color and all of
that but for the most part almost every
application would do fantastically with
JavaScript on the on the web and things
like Native Client can make even more
sophisticated applications viable so I
think that porting stuff is very easy
and we're and kind of the converse of
that is that instead of adding specific
api's into Chrome OS we're actually just
extending chrome itself so that not only
will Chrome OS users get advantage of
all this new web stuff we're basically
standardizing on stuff where we can and
we're delivering it to the Chrome
browser itself where we can so things
like the chrome apps that you would get
out of the Chrome Web Store or
installable on chrome and the chroma it
wouldn't make sense just to have it on
Chrome OS we want to have every chrome
user kind of AB similar experiences so
basically that's about it for right now
if you guys have questions about it you
can ask me at the end but I'll move back
on to the browser itself so just keep in
mind that Chrome OS is basically Chrome
for all intents and purposes at least
from this presentations point of view so
let's talk about targeting smart
browsers so you have all these api's now
you have some inspiration to do some
stuff you know really get excited build
some really interesting applications and
kind of what can you do when you're
targeting these modern browsers well
like I said we want to create desktop
quality applications we want users to
develop applications that they install
into the browser and run and have
Shin allottee and are following those
guidelines that I illustrated out before
we want developers you guys to be able
to distribute and sell them on the web
right so up until now mostly the way
that people will monetize is
subscription based websites or add based
websites something we do pretty well
here at Google but we want to open up a
third model and that is the idea that
people will actually pay maybe one time
fixed costs to use a web application or
pay a reoccurring micropayment
subscription to use a web application
the motivation so going for this kind of
application environment is that users
need a wet if we we basically sat down
and said if users we have this idea of
apps in these sexy apps in these great
apps Google search is not going to cut
it users need a way to determine what
the good apps are to rate them rank them
and kind of get metrics and insight on
what makes a good app so we needed some
way for users to filter out high quality
apps versus just normal apps that might
come up through searching and then
finally or secondarily we said
developers need distribution so
developers need to be able to package up
their apps put it in one place and be
able to reach a wide user base without
really much fuss or listing in several
search engines or that kind of thing and
they also need monetization so they need
to be able to take their apps and get
some sort of easy way to make money off
of it without having to roll their own
payment solution or anything and if it
hasn't been apparent to you what I've
kind of been rambling on about is I've
been talking about the Chrome Web Store
this is what we came up with so we have
all these great sexy apps and we wanted
to deliver a place for users to sell
them and for users of those apps to kind
of find them and install them and this
is our online web web front that we've
come up with you can actually see the
the URL is chrome that google com / web
store if you go the right now in your
chrome browser you'll have a wealth of
applications that you can install and
start using right away we also have some
client integration so on your new tab
page if you're using chrome you've
probably already seen it but we have
giant big icons that are beautiful
that kind of really give a nice laundry
feel to the the new tab page and these
are how you interact with the apps like
you saw me launch a few of them earlier
and we've actually had a pretty good
press I mean we it's not all been
uniformly great but we've had some
really shining gems of praise for
example a PC world did a really nice
article about our launch tweetdeck spin
the runaway success ever since we
launched so they just get tons of
installs every day they have a really
fantastic html5 app if you use tweetdeck
on the desktop I would suggest trying
out the Chrome Web Store version of it
it's almost I'd say it's it as good if
not better because there's nothing to
install you just go to the app and it
runs finally a new york times you know
people are finding a lot of inspiration
a lot of use out of the web store so far
and I'll get into a little bit more
specifics later on one interesting point
about the web store itself is that all
web apps are welcome so no matter what
your kind of working on it we're going
to host it we're not going to have
draconian review process before you
upload your app we do have terms of
conditions so you do have to follow the
terms of service so there's certain
categories of apps which we have to take
down but for the most part we're not
doing content review we're not trying to
police here at your stuff so I gave you
some suggestions some strong suggestions
on ways that you can make your appt
engaging and exciting for users but at
the same time do whatever you want right
it's the web it's not under the control
of one company what we can offer you
when you do host in the web store its
payments an API for payments which is
based off of checkout so for example
you'll be able to list your your
application for a certain price or for a
recurring subscription and we're
actually working on in-app payments
itself to sew a user's of your app will
be able to maybe buy items inside of it
and so on we have open ID single sign-on
so users of the store who actually go in
and buy an app or click install in an
app will actually be forwarded to your
application with open ID credentials so
if you take advantage of it if you kind
of accept this API then
you can actually get a single sign-on
basically functionality between the
Chrome Web Store and the app itself
which is tied to the users Google
account we have a license server so if
you do opt into payments especially
subscription-based payments or free
trial payments you can actually query
the license server again using that open
ID single sign-on system and find out
whether the users been has paid for the
app and offer them a different
experience if they have or have not and
basically what now let's kind of go on
to the two different types of apps that
we offer in the store so we have hosted
web apps and these are the ones that you
know and love because these are standard
web pages basically they're hosted on a
server and they're hosted on the server
and basically they take advantage of
html5 you do have to spend some money to
host them to let them run in the
background but you know it's the web
experience of development using you know
maybe PHP Python anything in the
background that you want use a database
that kind of thing we also do have
packaged web apps which are kind of a
new flavor of application and something
that we're pushing as well and this is
the idea that you don't need a server
component to an application for a modern
web app like I showed you there's a file
system now available for applications
applications can do things like
manipulate images manipulate files
directly using javascript so if you get
rid of the server requirement then the
app can actually be downloaded directly
onto the browser can actually run
offline and do all its stuff without
really needing to rely on a server it
can still rely on a server if it wants
to but at the same time it's an
interesting piece of functionality that
can run locally on the machine the it's
very easy to create an app so again I my
apologies for the colors on this I
didn't really realize how bad the the
projector would would make it look but
it's a very simple JSON structure
basically put in some metadata about
your application you put in some URLs
that constitute the range of your app so
places that you can navigate and then
launch URL which is basically a URL that
gets open when you click the app icon
itself and then finally we get to an
interesting bit at the bottom which is a
permissions
action so apps actually do have a few
permissions for things that are not
currently possible by regular web pages
and mostly these are just extensions to
the standard set of AP is that you would
get if you were a normal web developer
for example we have unlimited storage so
if you were writing an app that used
local storage or use that file system
normally you would be limited by the
browser for a certain amount of a of
disk space well what we said for apps is
now you can use unlimited if you request
if you request this permission we also
have things like notifications you might
have noticed that before I had a
geolocation prompt come up on my browser
you can request a permission for
geolocation you can take care of all
this up front in your app manifest so
that the user agrees to these in both
when they install the app and then you
don't have to ask for it again you just
have blanket / access to this stuff so
the user doesn't always get that yellow
bar at the top of their browser whenever
they're using your application and then
finally something that's really
interesting that we just kind of made
public a few days ago was the idea of
background apps and if you haven't
really been following along with the
developments on chrome I think it's one
of the coolest technologies that we have
it's the idea that you can actually
specify a page that gets loaded in the
background invisibly by the browser and
just sits there and runs so even if for
example if gmail were to implement this
background page even if I had gmail
closed they could open up a lightweight
minimal page that's invisible to the
user just to check for new mail and if
they found new mail they could do things
like pop up a desktop notification like
you can maybe see in the last permission
here it's kind of just a floating window
that's not attached to the browser just
to alert the user that there might be
something interesting to do they could
play a sound they could perform a
network access whatever all without
these are needing to even have gmail
open in one of their browser windows so
this makes an appt web app act more like
a desktop app in in a very significant
way and I'm really hoping that people
kind of take that and run with it and
make some really interesting stuff kind
of sits there in the background and just
processes data does some interesting
notification stuff so very quickly the
Chrome Web Store we try to make as easy
as possible to publish an app so i won't
get too far into the detail
here but you basically just need to
create an awesome web app so again I
showed you a bunch of great api's should
you some guidelines in terms of what
we're looking for when we're looking for
like apps that are really shining
examples of everything and you build it
and you know number one is obviously
going to take the longest and be the
hardest but once you're done the rest
are fairly easy so you just create that
manifest file that I just went over make
some icons for it maybe some image
assets for the Chrome Web Store you zip
it all up and then you upload it to the
Chrome Web Store dashboard and this is
kind of just a place where you can just
submit apps and manage them and find out
you know or set up their metadata you
configure your listing you play up a
one-time five dollar fee I am NOT trying
to gloss over this I'm just there's a
five dollar fee we try to verify that
developers are real people so we
discharge from the token amount and then
you verify any domains that your app
runs on in the case that it's a hosted
app with Google's existing webmaster
tools which you might have done already
if you were for example I think
analytics might require that and a few
other api's might require that as well
finally you just hit publish and then
you're listed in the store there's no
review processor or anything like that
you're you can be live on the same day
that you upload okay so I have a short
video but I feel like maybe we don't
need to watch it because you know things
started late so basically just trust me
it walks his walks me through the same
steps that we did last time but if you
really want an easy kind of to play
around with stuff maybe put up your blog
online I would suggest going to appt
mater appspot com and what this is is a
nice little utility that one of our team
members wrote and what you would do is
type in your normal website and it would
give you a icon that you can drag onto
your desktop so it uses some of these
file API is that html5 offers and it
will give you that package that you can
upload to the Chrome Web Store so you've
basically type in the domain add in a
little bit of metadata upload an icon
and then drag out the zip package so we
try to make it as easy as possible to
package up your app if you want to get
listed right away sorry I'll talk about
some of the best practices
just in terms of you might be asking
basically okay I have this app uploaded
doesn't the Chrome Web Store suffer from
the same disadvantage that all of these
app stores and stores do is that
initially yes they get a big traffic
bump and whatever but eventually there's
so many apps that it's hard to discover
and we recognize that and we're working
on a variety of systems to highlight
apps especially because we know that
we're going to scale past a certain size
but at the same time what you can do to
make yourself stand out is follow some
of these best practices these principles
that we believe make a really great app
and then we can help you out you know we
want to help developers we want to get
developers kind of successful it and
built up in the store so if you have a
really great app and you follow some of
these we will definitely work with you
to get you highlighted I get you
promotion that kind of thing so we're
actively engaged both in receiving apps
and also trying to help promote apps
inside of the store so the first would
be user analytics analytics as a
standard website tool is fantastic
Google Analytics if you're not aware of
it basically it will give you metrics
about how users are engaging with your
app and what are they doing we want
people to use this because even though
you think that your app design might be
great you might actually be surprised by
what analytics will tell you might tell
you that users are not using a certain
feature on your site they're totally
ignoring content that you're putting
somewhere they're not clicking on
certain links and so on and so when you
get these metrics you can actually start
tweaking things and optimizing your
experience so basically you want a
feedback loop I suggest using analytics
or rolling your own even if you if you
don't want to use Google stuff we want
to make sure that apps have easy
feedback for users so another thing you
want to be engaged with their user
audience these are new experiences many
of them will be used to using regular
web sites so you want to basically guide
them through the process of using your
app and also get suggestions and
feedback from the users when they've
been using your app so for example I
don't know if any of you are familiar
with gawkers kind of redesign recently
like that train wreck I think it's
actually kind of an interesting i've
been using it for a few days and I've
kind of gotten used to it and I like it
like it's growing on me but at the same
time it was a big
shocked because it was a completely
different experience from what I was
expecting so I think this kind of thing
of having feedback and acting on
feedback and acting on analytics is very
important we're kind of in this nascent
baby stage of the of this modern app
internet and we really want to kind of
guide people through as opposed to just
shocking them with with radical designs
we do want to use all the accessibility
and semantic features available in html5
because this stuff was put in there a
lot of people worked very hard on
implementing these features and so using
things like Aria should not be like kind
of frosting on like maybe an
afterthought on your app like there's
stuff in there that will help you reach
as many users as possible we want to
make the web kind of work equally for
everybody there as much so as possible
at least so I would you know my passion
plea is to use Aria and other
accessibility features in terms of just
making your app more attractive inside
of the store itself if you charge for it
offer a free trial a lot of people don't
offer a free trial and then what we're
seeing is that users are actually kind
of put off by the sticker shock of may
be paying a few dollars right if you
guys are fans of the oatmeal comic I
really should have put it on there
there's a great comic about some guy
basically shelling out thousands of
dollars for computer or like fifteen
dollars for movie popcorn and ticket and
then he gets faced with the idea paying
two dollars for a nap and he just goes
into sticker shock and you know wants to
call his accountant and basically that's
what we're seeing you know people are
not used to paying a you know upfront
for websites why don't you let them use
the site they use your app first and
then kind of encourage them to upgrade
through incentives like additional
functionality a better content etc
single sign-on also is a lot of people
are seem to be stuck with other
different types of logon systems usually
stuff that they've rolled themselves
rolled their own registration systems so
there's nothing that stings quite as
much to me as when i install an app from
the store and then the first thing I get
is a registration page because I've
already gone through the store right i
I'm already logged in I may have even
paid for the app but you want me to log
in on your side too we have a single
sign-on so
it's open ID it's not proprietary it's
just good standard to support i would
suggest supporting that at least give me
an option if you want to keep your own
system in that kind of vein i also want
to put out a plea for have good user
onboarding right walk them through the
process of using your application don't
just bombard them with a form to fill
out all their personal information ask
them for their email when you finally
need their email that kind of thing just
kind of let them use as much of the app
as possible with as minimal information
as possible things like etherpad if you
sadly were bought by google rolled into
wave and then killed by way but like
ether pet had a great sign on had a
great start up a kind of experience
because you didn't need to be logged in
to use it you just went to that page you
started typing and then when you wanted
to save something that's when you
started kind of registering accounts and
putting in information and passwords so
think about these flows right like you
don't need to have this monolithic
registration form on your site at least
until you actually need it there's the
big screen you I I see a lot of apps
that are kind of either repackaged
mobile apps or you know like little tiny
flash movies and and honestly I don't
have anything wrong with hosting uh
there's nothing wrong with hosting a
flash movie in the site but take
advantage of the fact that flash can
kind of be dynamic and be full screen
and everything we want to let people
take advantage we want people take
advantage of their big screens like i
said this laptop maybe a tablet maybe my
30-inch monitor you know just kind of
reflow the entire UI to make the
application work the way that they
wanted to so media queries are great for
this you can actually use CSS CSS 3 has
expanded support for media queries which
will let you actually specify ranges of
widths and Heights and then whole big
chunks of styles that you can do so you
can actually do a UI that will reflow
height components show more information
if it has more area and show less
information if it has a smaller area and
just really kind of think about the
difference between you know if someone's
viewing it your site with a small view
and a large view because it will have
it is the web you're not fixed onto one
display that has a set dpi or set
resolution so media queries use all the
screen expand use flexible layouts that
kind of thing in app navigation is kind
of part of this to write your app itself
should have a lot of controls you
shouldn't have to rely on the browser's
back buttons and so on it should be
obvious that the user wants to click
somewhere to go somewhere and do
something so just have a sensible
navigation inside of your app this
doesn't apply to every application but
it is a good design principle to follow
and again if we're going to crib a crib
from the best and think about the way
you know like mobile apps work right a
lot of them have that bar with like the
contextual buttons that you can press to
get around jump to different parts of
the app itself and then finally get your
app noticed there are no silver bullets
for making it successful so you have
great features you can build great apps
and nobody could use it if you don't do
any promotion yourself so we will work
with you if you list a nap and you kind
of contact us and talk about it but at
the same time we think that you should
go out there hit the pavement kind of
work hard and you know do promotion do
buy ads you know try to get written up
in tech magazines or tech websites blogs
that kind of thing there's plenty of
people who are looking for to highlight
apps as part of a App of the Week kind
of blog post and that kind of thing
there's all these opportunities and
people just kind of let them go by so
try to be you know out there and engage
and it does pay off it does reward you
oh I lied so I said last finally but
finally should we be fast so again like
I said Google search managed to shave
off a few hundred milliseconds or we did
some experiments where we slowed down
the page artificially and we actually
lost a significant percentage of usage
so fast really matters and people don't
really realize it I think you might
think that a couple second load time is
okay but when you cut it down to under a
second it's it's amazing how much more
responsive and like engaging the app
feels even just just kind of using a day
to day so do things like store data
locally processed data in the background
there's an API called web workers which
I didn't really mention but is available
on html5 rocks com more information is
at least you can minimize connections to
the server and you can decrease
bandwidth you know cash stuff take
advantage of just standard HTML HTTP
caching we do have tools inside of
Chrome so for example here's an audit
panel inside of the developer tools if
you're not using it you should basically
if you're familiar with Firefox there's
a great extension called why slow
there's a few more but this is kind of
chromes version of it use something use
one of them and it will give you a list
of items that are maybe warning flags or
errors about how you're actually just
serving and structuring your content
that's slowing it down so performance
matters we have tools people don't use
them a lot but don't take my word for it
we do have some third-party testimonials
just I i'm going to toot my own horn
here for a little bit we have to do lee
basically saying that ever since they
got listed in the app store their user
base increased by seven hundred eighty
percent so in the first three weeks of
being listed they they had basically
satisfied their goals for the first 11
and a half years it's great for small
startups like this you know the Chrome
Web Store you know people are admittedly
like kind of hesitant to buy stuff but
we're finding it great for exposure if
you have a really polished good app and
you're getting a lot of users and
getting a lot of reviews that just kind
of snowballs and you again you're
probably not even seeing this curve but
it's like this great bump of their
traffic ever since they got lunch so
they blogged about it and we're really
flattered that they have this great
experience with it slide rocket another
another app kind of like start up the
kind of app that got launched or listed
in the Chrome Web Store they got 50,000
installs in the first 10 days so we do
see millions of people hitting the
Chrome Web Store there is that kind of
exposure for for applications especially
if you're in a small start-up you can
afford to be a little bit nimble kind of
respond to to stuff that might come up
and really just try to get your app
listed in here so they said that sixty
percent of their daily leads are coming
Chrome Web Store means that people who
are going there are still eventually
more likely to buy something then then
you know someone who is just an organic
kind of coming in off the street for
example and they do kind of say that our
revenue shares is favorable so I don't
really get involved with this too much
but to me five percent is you know a
lower than you see in a lot of places
and we think that's very fair
considering you know the exposure that
we're able to give you and that's about
it thanks again and then lucidchart so
they got about 30,000 uses and keep in
mind we've only been launched for a few
months now they basically just found
again like I'm saying that the traffic
growth that we're seeing out of the
Chrome Web Store is very impressive so
again we want to work with these kinds
of partners these weren't really
specifically partners that we were
hand-holding through this process these
are people who found organic success
inside of the store and so we're really
impressed when we're seeing these kinds
of stories we want to see more of them
we want to see people in San Francisco
New York all over kind of indie
developers small companies launch their
stuff on the Chrome Web Store and just
deliver some experiences that will
revolutionize the way that people are
using their browser so to wrap up and we
want to target smart browsers we want
web apps that are built using html5
technologies they don't have to be we
just think that the experience is better
when you take advantage of the modern
stuff and when you do target smart
browsers you can actually use this
functionality fairly reliably and not
have to worry that whether users have it
or not for folks who may not have this
functionality there's either shims that
you can find online that replicate it so
maybe fallbacks to flash for things like
movies where there's no native media
support or things like there's all sorts
of shims that you can find online and
then finally we want these apps to be
distributed in the Chrome Web Store and
we're not saying that you have to be
exclusively distributed a lot of these
are web apps that run and work like
perfectly fine in Mozilla which is a
great browser people are using Mozilla
I'm happy to so
I think that basically we want the web
to just change fundamentally we want it
to be more engaging we want people to
realize success and engagement on it so
that's my plea to you it's very heavily
biased my name is our nuh here are some
resources basically just need to get
google com / chrome a / app / web store
/ chrome frame you'll find it code
google com and then some interesting
html5 stuff if you go to html5 rocks
calm again I'm not impartial here this
is a site that my team works on html5
rocks calm will point you towards all
these other resources and there's one
more thing so I did say I would stock
stop talking about Chrome OS but if you
stick around for the raffle at the end
I've got three of them that i can give
out so hopefully we'll have three of you
guys kind of go home with some cr-48 and
and you know maybe start developing some
apps with these would be fun yeah so the
question was when do I think there will
be a google maps that will behave in 3d
like the android version honestly i
don't know like i have no insight into
that team so your guess is as good as
mine i think the team is that google are
very excited about html5 but
understandably they've been you know
just like every other company who's been
invested in the web but this stuff is
crept up very fast so i think it you
know it takes some learning it takes
some training and we're working on it we
think we're the best at the web you know
as a company so i hope that we'll get it
fast you know there's nothing stopping
us at this point this technology is
there yeah like I said WebGL can do 3d
rendering or you can even do some stuff
in canvas for example or SVG to mimic 3d
and if you are interested there's a
great library called 3j s which is like
amazing 3d graphic stuff great so the
question is how does Chrome Web Store
play into google web toolkit or App
Engine or anything that we offer at
Google and this is great because we've
like
we've been working on web-based api's
and web-based technologies for a while
now and the chrome Webster is relatively
new and we really think that it works
really well with all of it so App Engine
personally I find to be a great option
for hosting like a hosted app for
example just because it scales out to a
lot of users very easy to develop for
and you know they have certain types of
AP is that make it attractive in terms
of wit we've seen people develop
websites with grit like I showed you
that canvas demo that we showed all the
Performing kind of yeah yeah the canvas
stuff is new in the newest version of
grit so we think that that's a great
solution because it lets you use Java
which is considered like a maybe not a
web based language or like you know
high-performance graphics language or
you know like not the kind of language
you write that kind of stuff in to eat
to write canvas based html5 apps it's
pretty cool so the question is when when
do you I think that we'll be able to
sell extensions to the web store this is
unfortunately something that we we
promised you know we want to sell
extensions as well we still fully intend
to deliver that there are certain things
that are keeping us from from being able
to do that from a technical point of
view so I can't really give you a
specific specific timeline I think we're
looking on launching the Chrome Web
Store internationally first and then and
then extensions should be pretty fast ah
index TV do I have a time travel time
table for that the question of index DB
if for anyone who is not familiar with
it is is it's another storage API that's
available in Chrome today I believe it's
behind a flag right on dev Channel I
might be mistaken but basically we had
the sequel database that was available
on the web there were some pushback
against standardizing sequel as part of
the web standard so some folks came up
with an alternative proposal called
index DB we've implemented it kind of on
the dev Channel and so on we're working
on it it's hard to say because the spec
is is very amorphous I think still I
think we have we feel like we have a
good implementation it's it's available
it's just
not unstable yet I feel I don't really
know sorry so the question was there was
no talk about mobile and I can I can
they approached this two ways right I
can either say that mobile app browsers
are really amazing because a lot of
these features are actually in these
mobile app browsers you can look at the
gmail view in maybe like the iPhone or
an Android and it's really good it
actually uses application cache which is
a way to store assets offline it uses
sequel databases so that it could
actually store metadata about messages
so you don't have to be online so it
kind of sing some does all this stuff it
uses css3 to kind of do drop shadows and
rounded corners and hover effects and
mobile is a great platform for HTML I
didn't get to it just because I you guys
are here late enough already an app
section for mobile apps we haven't
really we haven't really talked about it
so much publicly basically we're trying
to launch the Chrome Web Store as a
desktop kind of notebook tablet
experience you know stuff that was stuck
with chrome on it a common misconception
is actually that the Android browser is
Chrome but it's really not it's a
different browser it's based off of
WebKit so they have the same roots but
at the same time it's not chrome so
we're really worrying about chrome and
then we can branch out to other browsers
and other experiences going on that
doesn't mean that you shouldn't design
your application to work on a mobile
browser we're seeing some really great
shins that work as mobile apps and it's
a good cross-platform way to kind of
deliver the same sort of experience with
minimal amount of work porting between
them yeah the question was about our
international rollout and it is still
coming we this week we did announce that
developers can upload now and start
picking their pricing I believe for the
countries that will be rolling out to
first so we're in the middle of it we're
expecting it to happen very soon so if
your developer of an app you can
actually go and upload and start
preparing you know start thinking about
what you're going to charge we do have a
set pricing tiers so they're set for for
each country so you'll have to decide
how you want to
but yeah unfortunately we're not
currently launched but we expect to be
soon yeah basically the stuff that's
stopping us from rolling out to as many
countries as possible is less on the
technical side but more compliance
issues if you have a web store and
you're selling things in a country then
there's all sorts of requirements that
you have to go through so you know we're
doing it as fast as we can but it does
take some time faster to read the code
then to go through all the hurdles so
the question was given what we've
learned with the cr-48 48 where do we
see it like how does it fit into things
I think one of the major learnings that
we were very surprised about was it's
big in business you know we were
thinking it would be kind of a
disposable consumer device not
disposable but you've seen the video
maybe where we've destroyed a bunch of
them you know like by pouring ice cream
on it and so on so we were thinking that
this experience would be fantastic for
end users but it turns out that IT
admins you know would have a field day
with this because it no longer means
provisioning machines and doing all that
it means that if someone manages to goof
up their work machine they can just hand
them a new machine and not do anything
about it right they can just log in all
this stuff gets synced it gets pulled
down whatever apps they were using or on
the internet so the data is still there
so I think we underestimated how
attractive that it would be to
businesses I think that's a big one I
think we're still targeting you know
basically like lifestyle notebook
computer right like what you do on your
browser most of the time is checking
email doing Google searches reading
blogs interacting with apps you know is
a small bit of it we're hoping to that
will grow but at the same time we think
it's uniquely suited to that in the
sense that it's kind of like this little
companion that you have with you like I
use mine on my couch when I'm like
watching TV you know and a lot of people
say that about phones and iPads and
everything I just find it nice you know
using a keyboard and kind of just
looking stuff up falling
paying half attention maybe yeah it's a
great point that if you lose the machine
nothing's really stored on the machine I
mean it reduces risk yeah do we do we
feel inspired by the webos technologies
any particular ones I I do it's hard to
speak for the entire chrome team right
as a kind of a product I mean I do
admire webos because the as far as I
understand their interface was all done
in HTML is that as i right yeah yeah so
I think that's really amazing like if
you really look at webos it looks like a
polished modern operating system it's
really flashy has a kind of a lot of
effects and transitions and the fact
that they're building that using
javascript is is really something I find
inspiring i can't i can't speak for
everyone else but i think that's what
crumbs kind of mission goal is right if
we could make the entire web look that
good then why not
