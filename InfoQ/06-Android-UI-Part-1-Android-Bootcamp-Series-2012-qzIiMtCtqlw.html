basically in Android
like I said user interface is usually
one of the things that you spend the
most energy on it's very important
there's a lot of it and so on and so on
it's also the biggest difference between
Java plain old Java and Android right so
what you need to know about UI is that
they're basically two ways to do it you
can do you I'm in a standard sort of way
using Java but the or you can do it in
using XML right so you can do basically
the XML based declarative approach or
you can do Java based procedural
approach where you write Java code
what's the best way but the best way is
actually used both approaches
so you start here first right and then
you finish off yeah second that's the
best approach right we're basically
gonna go from here to here so what does
that really mean so let me give you an
example so if you are if you are for
example designing a button right XML is
actually a really good tool to describe
the button is the button large is it
below does it give rounded corners right
I mean XML kiss tools making like
drag-and-drop resize do everything kind
of like what you see is what you get so
that's with the that's that's that's
what external is much better right now
what happens when a button is clicked
XML is not as good at that's where job
is much better what happens really click
on
so that's that's kind of how we do it we
do first we start in axonal I'm Jonathan
any next what do we do like talking job
yes this XML gets converted to Java yes
ultimately well so let's do let's create
something that we can actually
experiment this with this a little bit
so let's start this Yamba project so
let's create a new project you guys can
do this along rather give you something
to do some typing otherwise and it's
late in the day so so let's do this you
can clean up your previous stuff we're
not gonna need it so let's do a file new
Android project right and then choose
we're gonna create a project called
Yamba right so I'm gonna say yeah um
okay so now we're gonna pick the similar
next just like before I'm gonna shoot
for for Andrews for Oh Ice Cream
Sandwich but I'm gonna say it works in
is all this ten for instance
well packaging pick whatever you want
I'm gonna say calm example
now
are we going to create an activity I'm
sure we can create an activity I
wouldn't call it t on bhakti VT I would
call it status activity because this is
gonna be our status activity the first
one so basically what we're doing is
roughly this iteration so creating this
guy first so possible
does anybody have any constraints about
versions of Android you guys are using
an athlete before but and because like
all we have to Stockholm okay as
Pakistan okay
No can't get you you could also get
people with cap performance in your
phones but that you're going to be doing
stuff on tablets or not or is
No okay okay so so this is our yellow
project so I'm gonna click on okay okay
and it makes sense to kshitij to shoot
back as far as back as 10 because 10 is
50% of the market
yeah it's a huge chunk of market right
so you should add a little bit are
giving that yeah so there's my Yamba
there's my java in it and then there's
no research layout now this pain this
may this name main may not make sense in
this case yeah because what you mean
about this layout versus mother Elliott
is a matter of fact timeline is gonna be
more main than status activity so I
actually don't like this named much so
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to rename
this so refactor rename so right click
on the refactor rename and I'm gonna
call it status dot XML to correspond to
status activity now that's gonna break
you know status activity why can't so it
breaks it because you do not have our
layout main anymore we have our layout
status remember how I said something is
watching your resources all the time so
you can go to main and you can delete it
press button just wait for all the
options established should be there if
it's not that there's another problem
yeah
yeah so what you're gonna do next is so
we just fixed it we really didn't do
anything in the Java usually like I said
we start oops we usually start with the
XML file okay so this is the XML file
the way it looks like right now now what
you're seeing is sort of the WYSIWYG UI
for developing the the application so
one thing that I will do in here is I
would open up the side bar the outline
you can see the outline of it and one
thing that's kind of interesting is also
the properties that you get for each of
these UI elements so here's what I would
do
we are currently missing the properties
window okay now whenever you are missing
a window easy way to get a window is to
go under windows show view and find
properties if you're still missing it if
you will likely well go under other and
then under general find properties
so I personally don't like properties
being I guess by default it opens it up
here right something like that I don't
like it down there I like it more on the
side so I tend to put my properties here
as part of right next to the outline and
then adjust the width of properties in
values now let's take a look at this
really cool what we have here is we have
some boilerplate UI that has a linear
layout and then it gets a piece of text
inside of it
also known as text view right you can
actually click on the Status XML down
here okay and you can actually see the
XML version of this so there's our
linear layout and then there's our piece
of text in there right so this is just
the actual text the actual code this
would be the smoke now let's take a look
at this what is this really mean so
basically what we are saying is that we
have one layout containing a piece of
text okay so in Android the UI works
sort of like this we have so called a
composite pattern here basically cab the
container component model how many of
you did
aw tear swing work properly okay so you
know how in a wtn swing we have a
component container and component bottle
right so we have like for example you
have panel and panel can contain buttons
button panel is from
called a container in button would be a
component right now a panel can contain
other panels because a container is a
component that's a composite rank you
can compose them so in Android it's very
much the same except we call them
slightly differently so containers are
layouts and components are called gears
but sometimes also called widgets that's
what kind of gets confusing and where
it's also different than Java regular
Java is that the regular Java we your
your container cad up layout in andhra
the container is a layout it's not the
HESA but it's a easy relationship it's a
subclass is a possible problem
yeah that's slight difference but I mean
that it's also conceptual so so so
layouts contain other components so
that's basically what we have here so we
have linear layout containing this piece
of text text year text feels like a
label or J level right so what happens
when we run this and by the way you can
click on run anytime it's not really
gonna do much it's just gonna run a
hello world for you but what OC coli now
I have two devices it's asking which
device if you wanna run when we talk
about so the question is what is the
what is this code
remember how I said we are basically sub
classing I first of all I said job is
the top dog right Java is what runs the
end of the day secondly I said what
we're doing here is we are basically
creating a taking activity subclassing
it and then overriding a metal called on
create right the very first metal and
then we're calling the super in that
method right no big deal then we are
doing although all the meaningful work
in this line 911 right and what I said
earlier was that this line 11 simply
points to this file takes its content
puts it here and inflates it yeah so
what that's really gonna do is going to
go to his file parse it right for each
of these elements it's gonna create a
Java object right say what I'm drawing a
second Java object and for each Java
object it's gonna set these problems so
at the end of the day what we are doing
here is we're basically doing you know
the same like 20-some lines of Java code
right that's what this is going to
involve them to what's that
so back to the graphical layout okay so
we want to create a screen that's going
to look similar to this one
just else on it so you want a screen
like this how many components do you
guys see on the screen or us more
precise
okay so name so depends on our cue
counter so you guys are counting data so
you're saying this this this and this
and this okay
yeah so except this in itself is not a
component but this is okay so we have
the container that contains the whole
thing then within that we have some
stuff right well we're gonna keep this
simple
we're gonna start by having the big
container which we must go and then
we're gonna create a piece of text the
seal to enter something and then we're
gonna get the Update button
just these three things we're not gonna
deal with a label until later the
counter so first again so I'm gonna
delete what I got here I'll select it
and delete it so now I'm empty screen so
what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna
for now just dump the components that we
need so what are the components that
we're gonna need on this on this campus
yeah you can take you can take it yeah
you can take this this piece of text for
modules and you can say large I don't
think that large time step
yeah that's gonna be my title what's the
next one
yeah if you follow people this this
there is a direction the textbox will go
the negative be the next one but I
actually suggest the button to be the
next one because the button it's easier
when the button is above then below
because of the way keyboard works
wait keyboard comes up so actually the
better UI design is if the button is it
Tom
so I'm gonna take about next
in the next one that I'm going to do is
I'm going to find the text that's on the
text field and I think this lorem ipsum
all right so we now have our three
components that we care about you can
actually kind of see them right here you
can say that we care of a linear layout
we have a linear layout with text view
button and edit text right so what I
will do next I would kind of do this in
iterations what I will do next is I
would basically adjust the size of these
components when it comes to size you can
couple ways to do this but basically
each component should have the width and
height and one simple way to manage the
width and height is via these two
buttons this is sort of new wasn't there
before but you can specify the width and
the height now this is only going to
allow you to put a width to to be either
as small as the text inside of it or as
big as space available so this button
here this so text field the width is as
big as it's available
we call that match parent so matches the
parents with right so this it's called
fill parent but it's just an old name
they change that to match friend but
they're basically fill parent my parents
are the same thing the second one this
this way up here the vertical is called
is Co basically wrap content because
it's only as big as its own content and
the fact that they have certain fun
expected there that's why it's that big
now if I wanted to make this text box
really big I would press this button
here and I would make it back
so that's basically one way similarly if
I click on this button if I wanted to
make it wide I will do that
no I'm just using those two buttons
that's it
in this text what what I probably want
to do with this text is I would want to
align it right so you could present this
whole thing here and you could try to
align it to Center
so I selected this last thing to do that
slightly definite big line
yeah so so that's basically so you know
I can I can save this so make sure you
save it right and then I can run it and
this should not be running as a data
application by the way this approach
that we did of writing things the way
the designing it the way we did it
should look good even on this screen on
portrait screen so I'm now running a
portrait screen and you can see that the
actual thing is adjusting its worth in
height to match what's available right
so that's why my button is still filling
the parent or matching the parent and
it's still wrapping the conference it's
not like you know it's not just like in
the top left corner of your big screen
right so if I deployed this app or that
Google TV there it would actually be
that big and everything I mean if you
take all the available space look proper
so so that's basically what just kind of
like in a nutshell what the UI is we
just started basically with this I know
it's sort of toward the end of the day
did you guys get this to work so far
okay cool okay so tomorrow we're going
to continue with the with the UI so
we're going to basically work on this to
make it pretty and explain a whole bunch
of things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
