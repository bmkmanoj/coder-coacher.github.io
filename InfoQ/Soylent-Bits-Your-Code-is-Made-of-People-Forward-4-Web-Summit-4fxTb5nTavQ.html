entitled Soylent bits your coat is made
of people the story of a API and an
aubergine hi
my name is miles I'm the alpha nerd on
twitter feel free to follow me that's
cool I currently work at a small
disruptive startup called IBM
contributing to a small open source
project called nodejs it is just worth
mentioning before we get started that
this talk does not represent the
opinions of my employer this is all my
own rage before we get started a warning
this is actually really serious i'm
going to take this seriously it's a
trigger warning this talk is going to
involve mentions of suicide trolling
harassment misogyny and racism if you
find these triggering i want to give you
an opportunity to leave the room because
you should it's about to get real part
one is a preamble i have been involved
in many open source communities and
various online communities for a number
of years some of those communities are
communities that i'm very proud to have
been a part of such as the monome
community which is where i learned music
a lot of what i know in electronic music
and in a way gave me the career that i
have now the first node repo i ever
wrote was modifying node OSC which is
open sound control which is the protocol
that the monome uses to communicate with
music software I kind of owe my whole
technical career to this community and
it was phenomenal another community that
I was really proud to be a part of was
my last job at famous industries where
we worked on an open source framework
for doing animation in the browser you
may remember it you may not that's all
good but some communities that I've been
involved in over time and getting less
and less interested in being involved in
them for a variety of reasons
so what makes me feel this way about
these communities the issue is that I
care too much when I started off an open
source I was filled with Wonder
bright-eyed excited about everything you
know you'd go on / r / programming and
you're just so excited about all the
people who are excited but the same
thing that you're excited about
everything is amazing there's so many
amazing projects and there's so many
amazing people and it's really easy in
that mode to just kind of feel like
everything's awesome I don't know if
you've seen that amazing webcomic I
should have put it in here where the
guys in a room and everything's on fire
and he's just like everything's okay but
there's a lot of hate there's a lot of
hate in these communities that isn't
necessarily always obvious so let's talk
about some things that people hate
people like to hate languages they like
to hate on people who use particular
languages you use JavaScript I guess
you're not a real programmer you use
Haskell I guess you don't plan to ever
work a job there's lots of different
comments that people may make to hate
languages people love to hate frameworks
whether it's angular or react if you're
using something that they don't use well
you're probably not very smart people
love to hate each other almost more so
than anything else it's really quick and
easy to start fights to start bickering
to start being negative people hate
women online and this is a really shitty
and serious topic and we'll get more
into this afterwards but misogyny is a
real thing and you see this happen in
online communities a lot and people also
enjoy hating people from other
minorities those can be underrepresented
groups due to race due to religion it
could be people who have disabilities
but in general you tend to see a lot of
hate towards people who are not the norm
over time it becomes harder and harder
to ignore these patterns and the
systemic problems that exist I myself
seem to just be getting kind of salty or
insult
every day I think I'm about two steps
away from yelling at children on my lawn
every morning not everyone is bad though
like it sounds like I'm kind of
frustrated with the whole internet I'm
not in fact there's a lot of really
great people but the problem is that
these great people get driven away from
our communities by the people who hate
some people like to pretend that it only
matters what you contribute a term that
gets thrown around is meritocracy you
are as good as the contributions in
which you bring into a community if you
write great code that's all that matters
if you can help bring things forward
that you're of value to the project if
you show up on a random forum and
suggest that maybe a project should
introduce a code of conduct so that
people feel safe to contribute but you
haven't contributed code why should you
be there this is a really toxic
viewpoint there's tons and tons of ways
to contribute to a successful project a
really great example the creator of
jQuery last year at jQuery SF mature on
Reza gave a talk about why he thought
jquery was so successful the number one
reason was not the code the number one
reason was the documentation the empathy
the ability to support users really good
code does not necessarily mean success
your code is made of people and people
matter and you need to not forget that
so let's take a second let's look at a
cute picture let's get her spirits back
up again so let's talk about an
unfortunate API so back in november of
last year a thread was opened on fixing
a message that was in the cluster api of
nodejs for what context the cluster api
is a module that allows you to create
and control and spawn various instances
of a service it allows you to
to handle routing it's essentially like
if you use elastic Beanstalk it's a very
similar way of doing load balancing but
it's built in internally to note there
is syntax inside of of the cluster API
that you have a master and you have you
have the children and if a child process
dies it has a flag that it can set
called suicide which sets whether or not
the threat has killed itself so during
this code review of an update a
collaborator on the project mentioned
that maybe the term suicide is not a
very good idea for an API and I kind of
responded to that pretty loudly you know
it isn't a really good name for an API
we're responsible for the words that we
choose and we're responsible for the way
that they make people feel so why do we
want to include an API with a word like
suicide Michael Rogers who is you know
fairly well respected in the community
he works for the Linux Foundation as
kind of the steward to the node.js
project came up with a solution which
was hey well how about we deprecate the
use of suicide and shim it with an
alternate name it creates pretty much
zero surface area of breakage and we
undocumented as an API but we won't
break it for other people so inspired by
that I started a thread saying hey let's
replace suicide as a verb one thing that
I did hear that I want to point out that
I've been doing in general a lot with
things that tend to be somewhat
controversial I've been trying to not
take a stance so if you read the
language that I used there i explicitly
said as discussed and i say the
discussion and offered the question what
should we use instead by offering
questions for people to answer i'm not
making myself a target to people to
attack and this ended up being really
interesting as we'll see there was a lot
of targeted attacks based around this
thread and i myself received very few of
those but as you can see this thread
kept going and going and going and going
and this is not including all of the
issues that we had to moderate do too
blatant racism or blatant misogyny it
was pretty bad images like pretty much
anything that you can imagine that could
have gone in that would be negative made
its way into that thread and we
eventually ended up having to lock it
only two contributors so we started a
discussion in the diversity working
group at the time now known as the
inclusive vide working group of hey what
are ways that we could maybe avoid this
in the future and this was just a
thought experiment that we talked about
this interesting tool called Alex that
can actually analyze text and do
sentiment analysis and so we went
through and we did that and we started
seeing like hey what are like all the
different words that are potentially
problematic in here I think if I scroll
down just a little bit you know what I'm
not even going to bother trying to find
it because there's just oh here it is
where I went through and I found hey
like we went through and these are all
the things that are coming up as flags
in the code base and some of them are
reasonable and some of them aren't some
of them are like don't use the word host
I mean that's a bit of a bit off from
what the term host is but something like
using the word stupid only in a comment
isn't really necessary so we were able
to use this to uncover a handful of
things that we can improve but this
actually became an attack vector for
people online who started getting really
afraid people who thought that we were
trying to thought police people who
thought that we were trying to censor it
all kind of hit the fan when a user came
into the thread and posted an emoji
aubergine which you can see right here
is the lovely eggplant at the time we
had a code of conduct in place making it
very clear what was acceptable and what
wasn't acceptable within the
organization but we had not done any
work yet to make moderation guidelines
to state if someone is breaking the code
of conduct what will we do how will we
respond and so we opened an issue on the
tsc repo which is the technical steering
committee
and the issue pretty much just said hey
you know this user is d railing and is
posting derogatory stuff maybe we should
ban them and we had some other stuff
here as well there was some stuff that
people were copying and pasting directly
from 4chan threads and this just turned
into another thread and so far everyone
that you're seeing in here as you can
see as a foundation member these are all
collaborators so far and it's getting
very heated in the discussion just
internally about what to do because at a
project we hadn't yet come up with
moderation guidelines the entire ability
for us to moderate and make the project
a safe space for people was completely
derailed by the need of discussion of
how we should do it what is appropriate
this thread ended up being a really big
problem hit the fan the thread got
posted on 4chan people started talking
about how we're censoring it I think
that we can maybe come in here and read
a couple of the really hateful things
are these people for real I know
we should get rid of the concept
entirely because some people like to
live in a completely sheltered world
where nothing that makes them
uncomfortable is allowed and they need
to grow up and to be wise rel rounded
human beings people also started posting
all sorts of emoji porn in the in the
threads I can't even I don't even know
how people are so creative with
eggplants but pretty much everything
that you can imagine that could be done
was and this wasn't the only place where
it ended up being posted it end up being
posted on a Chan i am not going to
screen grab that though it ended up
getting posted on facebook this was a
really interesting one this was a
hackathon hackers group to talk about it
and some of the comments in here are
just ridiculous my eyes are bad so I'm
going to lift this up so like simply
because the word may have a different
meaning that is considered bad in a
certain context it should be replaced
does that mean that violent video game
should be replaced as well an
insignificant nitpick of an
insignificant codebase nothing to see
here terms like suicide kill death
orphans zombies are all heavily entwined
and processors in OS terminology for
better or worse renaming words will
confuse so many peeps this was a really
interesting argument node if you are not
aware of it is heavily heavily heavily
entwined in UNIX philosophy from streams
to processes to a lot of the
architecture within node a lot is based
on unix so a really great argument to
derail something and say hey we
shouldn't change is oh well UNIX did it
after doing a bit of research though it
turned out yes unix does use the terms
like kill but no the word suicide never
appeared once in unix further a look
across major github repo showed that the
term suicide wasn't really used at all
in any software project so this this
creates a really interesting question if
we the maintainer zuv node have an API
that is potentially harmful is it our
responsibility to get rid of it because
in 10 years from now when someone's
doing something that's not-- inspired
and they base it on our api the argument
that's being used for already toxic
words can be used once again for stuff
that we have control of and even further
what always confused me is how can
people argue against this it got posted
on hacker news and you can imagine how
the response was there it got posted on
kotaku and action which tended to be one
of the most hateful forms if you're not
aware of kotaku in action it's part of
the gamergate brigade and i'm not going
to give them the pleasure of saying
anything more about them the most scary
thing about all of this to me and this
was new to me when I experienced the
situation was seeing a consistent
pattern of the ideas of men being
attacked well alternatively people
attacked women who had ideas there were
multiple women from our community who
I'm not going to name out of respect but
people who are friends of mine
people who have been contributing to the
project for many years who quickly
people would go through their github and
their Twitter and the first thing they
would try to do would be to try to prove
that these individuals are not real
programmers a little tip for all of you
if you ever start a debate by trying to
debase or tear down the person that
you're arguing with rather than
supporting your argument with facts
you're a shithead there were various
targeted harassment campaigns against
women are our community who spoke up
from people on Twitter consistently
sending aubergines to emails to we had
one person actually open a code of
conduct violation threat against a
member of our community as they were
offended by a joke project repo that
they had on their personal github this
one all the way to people's employers
who are being contacted by these trolls
to try to get people fired and
consistently every single one of these
people who are being harassed were women
or people who identified as women this
 is really scary why do people react
like this I have a lot of theories the
number one thing that I saw consistently
especially in people who I generally
thought were level-headed individuals
was fear fear of being oppressed fear of
being silenced fear mostly of being
excommunicated one thing you'll hear
many people being afraid of is well what
happens when I'm the one making the joke
at the wrong time and I have a brigade
of people coming and fighting against me
there was a conference I think it was
Pike on a couple years back an event
known as dongle gate that was an
extremely unfortunate situation where
everyone involved got fired pretty much
and nothing was solved and no one was
helped and no one felt safe things like
this make people really afraid of
anything that could potentially moderate
them
we saw recently if any of you were
following the code of conduct thread in
the Ruby community that was extremely
toxic people were extremely afraid of
what would happen matts went on the
record at first is saying hey you know
our community is all made of friends
we're all friends here I don't see why
we should have to moderate anything that
doesn't involve the police that's pretty
darn toxic in my opinion I I think that
there is a culture and language
difference and I don't I have no ill
feelings towards Matt Matt's but that
thread devolved into people pretending
to be quarreling the person who started
that thread and posting Nazi propaganda
and meanwhile the very thing that could
help monitor that threat is the thing
that's being argued against and I don't
know how people expect anyone to want to
get involved in these communities so we
started a thread to discuss concerns
about potential intolerance as a result
of political correctness and I'm not
going to get too much into it right now
but the term political correctness
itself and the term social justice
warrior both of those are constructs
neither of them exist political correct
political correctness was originally
created as a way to derail conversations
I'm not going to get into that although
I am thinking about doing a talk all
about the history of that term but if
you go through this thread you can start
seeing all the people who are talking
about reasons why we shouldn't be
monitoring people reasons why we
shouldn't be deleting stuff it got to
the point where one user who he ended up
having to ban from the repo was boasting
large tirades with racist epitaphs
simply to have them moderated so that he
could screencap it and claim censorship
freedom of speech exists but it doesn't
exist in a github repo where people are
trying to do work if you're d railing
the conversation your comments will be
deleted and for some reason a lot of
people tend to think that they have
something to gain or there's some sort
of political I can't even get into it
they think there's some sort of
conspiracy and it just kept going on and
on and on
and it was just terrible so in looking
at this situation there's things that we
did that were right we had a code of
conduct when we got started so we had
some pretty clear guidelines to begin
with as to what we could do we had a
working group that had started before
called the diversity working group this
event pretty much reignited it and
there's a really interesting history of
what happened that's being put online if
you're interested in learning more but
we had a network of people in place
already who were not the average
collaborators who are knocked the
average person who was involved who was
able to give us a really great alternate
look at what was going on we also had
people who really cared whether or not
we were doing it properly or efficiently
is secondary to the fact that as a whole
almost everyone on the project cared
about the project being successful and
cared about people not getting harassed
but what did we do wrong because there
was a lot of things that we did that we
did wrong this time the first thing that
we did wrong is we didn't have a clear
moderation policy we didn't have
anything set in stone of hey if someone
types something or someone puts in
something bad or someone's being racist
how do we respond to that now it may be
easy to just delete something but one
thing that you have to keep in mind
trolls get fed fire if you delete a post
from a troll that troll is going to post
ten more posts we saw a lot of throwaway
user accounts being created on github on
the same day just to derail conversation
just to get people riled up what ends up
happening is that these trolls who
managed to get people riled up get
people who otherwise would not be trolls
to start drinking the kool-aid they get
fired they get angry and it just turns
everything into a hate war it's really
really terrible another thing that we
did wrong was we didn't necessarily take
things as seriously as we could as a
project is not to say that we need to
groupthink as a project and everyone in
the project needs to agree with each
other but there were some comments that
were made by people from the project and
from collaborators that were a little
tongue-in-cheek that makes it seem like
we as a project don't take this
seriously if we as a project don't act
together
don't take this seriously we can't
expect other people to take us seriously
and even further this consistently was a
colonel that was used by trolls to tear
us apart even further and there was some
pretty terrible infighting that started
happening due to all of this due to the
pressure due to their like the large
number of threads it's hard to even
imagine waking up in the morning to 200
emails filled with hate so why does a
code of conduct matter a code of conduct
matters because it makes it extremely
clear to you and your collaborators what
is appropriate and what is inappropriate
it doesn't mean that the code of conduct
outlines that we're going to fought
police it doesn't mean that you're going
to start banning on mass all the code of
conduct does is outline what is
appropriate and what is not appropriate
why is a code of conduct useless without
moderation guidelines if you do not have
clear moderation guidelines set in place
you will spend weeks months all of your
time bike shedding over how you should
moderate and that is what happened in
this situation in this situation where
we had people posting threats we had
people posting everything you could
imagine we're sitting there in another
thread arguing about whether or not we
should do anything and if you think the
trolls didn't notice that they did and
you go into the 4chan threads and the
eight Chan threads and the kotaku in
action' threads and they're making fun
of us they're making fun of us for not
having our stuff together they're saying
look at them arguing in a repo about
whether or not to ban someone for an
emoji and then they build on that to say
oh my god the social justice warriors
are winning this is the fire that people
need to attack you everything that you
do is a project to not be on the same
page not be working together is going to
be an attack vector another cuteness
frame
I feel better now so where do we go from
here I don't really have an answer to
that but I do have some things that I've
been thinking about this is really
upsetting and it's burning a lot of
people out be aware of that don't give
in to groupthink it's extremely easy
when you're in a large thread with lots
of people with lots of opinions who are
upset and on fire for you to start
thinking the same way and start shining
in you know what a lot of the times your
opinion doesn't need to be in there and
I don't mean that to say that your
opinion doesn't matter but more so that
when people just constant consistently
jump into a thread and throw their
opinions in all that it does is
consistently derail and get us further
and further from reaching an actual
conclusion don't give in to fear there
may be things that you're afraid of so
for example as I was talking about with
the code of conduct of moderation
guidelines a really big fear that people
have is I'll be at a conference I'll be
sitting in the front I will be on the
wrong website and open a tab and the
wrong tabs open and all of a sudden I'm
banned from ever going to any conference
in the city ever again moderation
guidelines are there to protect everyone
one of the biggest fears that people
have is that when one of these events
happen that there will be a tide of
people on Twitter and social media
piling on and attacking the reality is
that a code of conduct and moderation
guidelines protect everyone it is
clearly stated in the code of conduct
that your conduct in social media when
it has to do with the project is also
part of the code of conduct if that's in
there which is in the note conduct code
of conduct it makes it very clear that
you have nothing to fear of brigades
coming to attack you if you make a
mistake people make mistakes I make
mistakes what you do is you apologize
you learn and you move on and people do
forgive in almost every single instance
that I can think of where someone has
been attacked by a large group but has
caused the real problems for them have
been their reactions to that
and then getting deeper and deeper into
a problem the number one thing that you
can do if you cause a problem is
disengage if you don't engage it won't
blow up call out people for being
terrible don't be afraid to say stuff I
know for a fact that this is really
really scary when the code of conduct
thread and all this stuff was going live
I had my picture posted in multiple
4chan threads or in reddit threads where
people were making fun of me I know that
I have my resume on my github I know
that pretty much anyone in one of those
threads who saw my picture and saw my
handle was probably three or four steps
away from daxing me from potentially
knowing where I live but you can't let
that fear control you from doing the
right thing hold your leaders
accountable it's not only the
contributors who are accountable for
their actions is the leaders of the
project if you're part of a project and
you see that the leaders are not acting
in a way that you find to be acceptable
disengage from toxic projects if you
don't see a problem with with things go
ahead and work with the status quo but
the only way that we're really going to
make a difference is if we band together
and work on projects that have clear
guidelines and clear structures to make
safe spaces for people don't burn
yourself out which is advice that I can
probably listen to I'm pretty much
consistently in a state of burnet the
last four months after all this but you
know sometimes it's really helpful to
just walk away from this and remember
that it's not everything even if it can
really feel like it and don't forget
your code is made of people that's why
we do that we do this so that people can
be empowered we do this so that we can
work with people we're doing this
generally i'm imagining to make the
world a better place so if we're all
working together for people then
remember that it's not just all about
the code it's about the people who write
the code the people who read the code
the people who use the code thank
