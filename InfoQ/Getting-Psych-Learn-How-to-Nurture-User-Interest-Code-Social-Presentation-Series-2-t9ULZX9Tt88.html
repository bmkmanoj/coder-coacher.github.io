vp engineering bebo that's my latest
claim to fame since then I've been
taking a little break but that's how I
know the anything social guys and
they're all rock stars from bebo so
that's cool that's my contact stuff
that'll be back at the end of the
presentation as well and this today's
presentation is about getting psych you
might be like I thought it was getting
psyched you're like wait psych yes psych
I mean the now not the verb i'm using
psych here to mean the level of
excitement you might have with the
current experience so i couldn't
originally this project was this
presentation was called nurturing
interest but i'm like that sounds really
vague so like let's have like some sexy
word green is cool and so I'm calling
its psych so like a gut feel psych right
now you can just think yourself 0 to 100
with like 100 being like Oh fmg and 0
being calm like how how much psyched you
have for like this moment right here at
this current presentation being in this
space you can just think to yourself of
a number and then so right now I'm like
I don't know 60 70 somewhere around
there like I'm pretty psyched
but I'm almost a little you know I'm
pretty far from Z so anyway so that's
kind of like a psych meter so think of
it like using in conversation you could
say users are dropping off we need more
psych on the website like we need to
increase the amount of excitement that
people have with the website experience
it needs to go up or seeing the mocks
gave me more psych I'm going to crank it
out tonight so you can think of a little
like a gas tank whenever you're excited
about something you add psych you
increase in like your gas and your fuel
as it were like so when you're on
website if it's like view photos you
have a new message you're like wow this
is exciting but then when you do work on
the website you lose psych so you're
kind of gas goes down you're like
psyched fuel tank decreases so like it's
like oh yeah it's complete all the
fields below all fields are required
you're like where I or it's like oh yeah
into your credit card for the free trial
and you're like that doesn't sound free
to me this sucks and so then it goes
down and you end up with this like
little e-meter and stuff like that
which is honestly how a lot of users are
going to like be on your website they're
going to grow like almost off so that's
the reason it's good to kind of keep
track of this metric as I think of it so
with that said we have exhibit a match
coms landing page so they've been doing
this for a little while longer than I've
been doing this so you'd imagine their
landing pages for decent so you just
look at the landing page and kind of
take a step back and be like hmm how
psyched am I like what's my psych level
for this for this page like if you're
single it's probably higher like if
you've used match com is probably lower
and so you know you got these different
things playing into this and so you know
you're psyched in this level might be
something like thirty percent like this
is pretty cool but I could be on
Facebook and so so you're checking it
out so let's kind of pull it apart a
little bit and just quickly keep both
keep with the pictures theme let's go to
just like the parts of the website that
increase psyche they're like the good
parts does it work so here's the
exciting stuff the things that increase
psyche so arguably the logo in the
header although that's a little bit to
the side really but you see there's like
photos of attractive looking people so
you're like that's pretty cool and then
there's also view photos of singles near
you you're like wow viewing photos of
singles seeing people married people is
not so exciting and they're near me this
means things can happen with these
people and I can view photos and the
button is green I'm supposed to click it
and it's all capitals like the button is
very serious about this whole viewing
photos and also there's these little
arrows there's these Chevron's that say
next and like they indicate that
something good is going to happen very
soon so you're like this is exciting but
if you took the kind of the opposite if
you reverse the page and showed only the
unsafe only the work of the page you get
something like this if you like do a
search on match com and then a form and
submit button and you're like okay this
is a lot less exciting it's not clear
that photos are coming it's not clear
that anything will happen with the
results in this search like this might
not be such a good use of my time you
know maybe I should go back to facebook
so this is work okay so what makes what
makes that page compelling overall so i
listed a number of them cute single view
photos also this experience is kind of
unlockable like you see the
pictures on the back but they're kind of
faded out and it's like but wait there's
less like you have to go through this
experience first before you get to the
photos so you're like oh this is good I
want to unlock and get to the photos
also one thing that I think increases
psyched while slightly decreasing the
amount of work you have to do is the
heading up there says I'm a woman
looking for a man so I mean there's two
kinds of people are going to come see it
there's women and men for the most part
I want to be very fair to the other
point one percent of our community but
for the most part there's women and men
come to the site and the and when women
see that they're like this is great it's
pre filled out from any women like women
looking for men this is great now in men
come they're like hey there's already
women on the site I'm three words into
the site and it says woman like this is
good and so they have to change it but
it's all but it's you know something
along what they want already um the age
range is both attractive and easy 25 to
35 a lot of people can leave that
default some people are going to change
that slightly but it's a it's a good
default it's also kind of attractive to
think of 25 to 35 year old women if it
said you know 18 to 25 that wouldn't be
attractive for a lot of people come to
the site also the postal code is if
nothing else a relatively easy way to
get some location and it has a big green
button nothing wrong with big nothing
wrong with green okay so here's this is
the money slide so I'm going to go
through it very slowly but I want to get
all in one slide so let's see if you
guys like this so I told you guys about
psych I told you about the idea of this
fuel tank I might am i speaking too loud
is this good is this good okay okay so
this is the idea so you got this fuel
tank kind of right that's like certain
amount full like the juice you had this
gut reaction to the web page I'd say my
gut reaction to the web page is about
thirty percent psych in my fuel tank to
start and so I could showed up on the
site and I'm like oh right match com
yeah I heard of those guys thirty
percent psyched like this is kind of
cool it's not you know Fraggle Rock org
so then so I've got my thirty percent
psyched and then I pretty much go
through the website and I get this
psyched in this level going up and down
based on those features that I just
showed you I first see that oh there's
cute picture is sweet and it goes up by
ten percent so now i'm at forty percent
psyched and I'm like oh but they're
hidden I have to see more actually this
is kind of you know kind of interesting
that I have to open it up itself and so
that's maybe two percent more psyched
even even though it's you know kind of
distant but it's kind of exciting that
it's right there and then you realize
ugh I have to input three lines of
search criteria to unlock this thing
where like I'm not sure I want to do
this anymore fifteen percent down and
then you're like okay that's my gender
and like I already know by gender this
is no fun yes I'm a woman okay that's
smart did it match or you know there's a
woman on the site that's good but it's
still a little bit of a pain to like
fill that stuff out so you're like minus
five instead of minus ten if it was you
know worse and then you're like okay you
know that's a good age range but I still
have to kind of consult it and be like
is that my age range maybe a little bit
different that's some work and then
you're like oh my gosh I really have to
use a keyboard oh don't you have a drop
down or something oh my god okay fine my
zip code everyone knows it it's only fun
you know only five digits done eight
percent down and then is a big view
photos button you're like okay sweet
view photos I've done the work this
sounds cool again hit the button so if
you walk through that individually you
actually started thirty percent psyched
I did an Excel chart for you guys you
know and then you go up up by ten
percent I'm not going to walk through
every of them but like you go up a bit
at the first experience as you start
reading the page you see the photos and
then you see what you really have to do
and it's a pain and you go down down
down and you cut you you bottom out here
about like nine percent site not so
psyched and then you come up a little
bit the end so an interesting thing
about evaluating a webpage this way is
that you're able to see that hey I came
in with a certain unit of excitement say
thirty percent and then I left with
another unit of excitement fourteen
percent so one way of looking at it is
that my excitement for the site got cut
in half by the first page even though
there's only like maybe five or six
different things to like do that seemed
very easy and obvious but actually cuts
massively into what the user has to
on-site and their excitement for it and
then that also gives you a starting
point for your next page because on the
next page you've effectively got the
same graph again and then now that graph
starts at fourteen percent instead of
thirty percent so you have to think a
little bit about hey like is this you I
what I want to use up six
teen percentage points of psyched and
nasaan another thing you could think
about this is that i personally think
that when you hit zero that's
effectively good as the user being like
whatever i'm tired of this and leaving
the site so if you didn't have the
number to you cute pics like say you had
a combination of that like the work
screen well pretty much just the work
screen without the cute pics and without
the nice language you would just have
the negatives and the user would bottom
out probably about five or six and
they'd be off your site because they
mean the negative and they'd be like I
give up like if you had match.com front
page without you know without I don't
think of the slide if you have mass comm
front page without pictures on it your
click-through would be incredibly bad
you'd have to have people who are
incredibly motivated when they show up
at their site like this is my last
chance and they they show up like sixty
percent psyched and they go down down
and down and they still click through
but like most people are going to be
like you know what this doesn't look
like any fun I'm out so anyway so that's
kind of my that's my main thesis on this
site thing I'm gonna go into my next
slide yeah you do for sure and so match
com has made the decision that they need
this user input I mean they could have
just had like the best case slide where
you just it loses like photos singles
view photos and you go to the next page
right they could have done that as well
but through probably at least a million
dollars with AV testing iteration
probably like 10 million dollars they
ended up with this page so so yeah so
that's the trick is that you do need
information from the user you need them
to do work to meet your business goals
and actually to meet their site goals as
well like if you give them a default
search that wouldn't work for a high
percentage of people so so this is the
thing it's a balance right you need you
need them to do work to get to get the
site goals met but then you also need to
keep it light enough and fun enough that
they don't leave your site and you're
right calculating that it's a bit gut
feel and it feels kind of vague and I'll
walk you through the best my best
ability to communicate how I calculate
and things of this stuff but that being
said it's still a bit of a gut feel
exercise to be honest the start of it is
just taking the gut feel you make for
the whole web page and instead of that
making a gut feel for each of the
elements on the page like what if you
took that out what if you left it in
what would the difference be what's your
gut feeling that difference
and actually if you just write out all
the gut feels you have for the
components and then manually add that up
with your logical brain rather than
expecting your gut feel brain to add it
up for you even that will be better
because you're you're only I'm people
are unable to add up like five two you
know five to ten things is it five to
seven things at a time and you'll
automatically miss like this is a list
of eight already and your brain won't
like keep track of all those accurately
um actually one thing this has an analog
to ism pollsters do dial sessions for
for speeches like they'll show a bunch
of people a speech of a candidate and
during the speech the person is a dial
that goes zero to hundred or what have
you and then what happens is as i go
through speech let's say hey if you like
what's being said turn your dial to the
right if you don't like it turn it to
left and then you have this amazing like
cut of the speech with literally a curve
of how cool it is and then you literally
just go through that you're like okay
every time i went down cut it every time
i went up like say it again and i'm done
the speeches now doubly is good and
you're like oh my god that took like
zero intellect and to some degree that's
the same thing you're doing for a web
page like if things go down and you can
cut them you know and things go up and
you can repeat them you know and it's
it's some ways it's not brain science
once you break it down so okay so this
is some more info on cackling psych so
one thing about calculating psyched is
that the first thing you need doing
before you see the web page is you need
to correct for high psych especially on
your own site because you come to your
own site and you're like oh man Fraggle
Rock org this is the best like I'm
totally everyone's going to be fragging
their friends it's going to be amazing
you know when you use the site you're
like the sites always use like I can't
believe it's gonna be so good but then
the trick is that most people don't care
about your site you know most people are
busy with facebook if doesn't say
Facebook it done if they don't recognize
immediately they don't like it so first
in your evaluating your own products you
have to uncorrect your own high psych
defaults so a few ways to do that is to
show up on the site and before you even
look at it be like god I'm so bored I
want to go to lunch this sucks whatever
i'm so tired of the internet blah the
other thing you could do is just imagine
that your ex made the site just imagine
that like Sheila made this whole site
and you're like Sheila God why did you
leave and like you're just like you just
like you hate this site you're like I
don't want to touch this side
want to I don't want to click back on
this site I don't like the site so much
so that gets you in the right mode of
thinking that you're like whatever on
this site and your your your advert your
negativity toward the site will equal
most people's apathy towards your site
which is really what people show up with
they grow up with a bucket full of
apathy it's like eighty percent ninety
percent apathy and like ten or twenty
percent psyche so that gets you in the
right mode to like start at the right
place as you do your calculations the
next thing is when you calculate this
you want to go actually from upper left
to lower right this is a little more
kind of obvious but um people read the
websites they pretty much discount the
header and then from there they read the
content area from the upper left to the
lower right reading it most i would say
three to five words per heading that
they run across and then going on to the
next unit and if they hit a button and
they know what to do they do it and they
hit a button they don't know what to do
they repeat the cycle with a longer
delay so they repeat the whole cycle and
they read like ten words and stuff as i
go down and so um so that's how to
calculate your site from upper left to
lower right for instance that's the
reason that pretty much every website
has like the pitch on the left like the
pitch on the left and then the sign in
box for the work on the right it's like
welcome to amazing land like please sign
up because because people starting the
upper left and they read down if it had
the like please sign up welcome to
amazing land people be like ah like die
and they like fall off before they even
got to amazing land because they reach
them that side okay then the next thing
is you have to do is you have to use
like use the force a bit um that's like
a sexy name for saying like turn off
your logical brain which we all have
plenty of in this room so what you have
to do is you have to kind of think about
all these things kind of take a step
back and just spit out the first number
you can think of one to ten like 87
that's my number and then you have
reflect on and say hey does that jog
with all my other numbers so i think i
showed up with like yeah i showed up on
the site with like 60 site and then like
I shot cool photos and i went up to like
120 psyched and then like there was a
submit button and I went down to zero
psyched you a sec those are not
proportional to each other those are not
those don't seem accurate so really I
showed up more with 60 psyched I got
more psyched and got to 70 maybe and
then the submit button wasn't that bad I
went down to 65 you're like okay those
numbers make sense relative to each
other and if you do that a few times
eventually your gut feel will start to
be pretty awesome anyways so we can do
that with this site again same
sorry I only had so much time um but you
can start like I just I just walk you
through it I won't spend too much time
and belabor the point but he started the
site first day like all the web I webs
lame i'd rather be eating a sandwich and
like you know oh my god mike my ex made
this site oh I have to use it this sucks
okay fine Oh God okay so discount the
header and then like oh there's some
cute girl like she's pretty cute well
what's decide about then okay I can view
photos of singles near me I'm signal so
that works and then there's women on the
site sweet I'm a you know guy and I'm
looking for a girl and then 25 to 35
yeah I do almost cougar level at this
point and like zip postal code I know
that I've used it so many times view
photos let's do this you know and just
as you go through this you're just like
I said you're like 30 plus 10 I won't i
won't belabor it okay so the next
question of course is how do I get more
psyched great algorithm driest make my
sight better so first you can just give
more um you can give them more data be
like hey you're here all some things
here cute people here are like what your
friends are doing here like all these
awesome things that you can have for
free we're just giving it to you because
we want you to be happy like take it
like oh yeah a hundred things happen
today like 10 things happen your area
like oh we're a car rental site you can
rent the test lawn here that's the
coolest car we have but we thought we'd
tell you because they're on here like
give them awesome stuff you can also
just give them a good bargain you know
there's not a whole lot going on the
side immediately you can say hey if you
do this will give you that like if you
give us all your data related to concept
X will you everyone else's data related
concept that you're like sweet i'm
interested in concept x that could be
any number of different things so you
can also do quality just something that
looks good something that looks
attractive well it will make people
believe that there's something
worthwhile they're just good looking
photos good colors etc make people be
like huh this is interesting exciting
positive also you can promise stuff as
mass comm did you could say you know
there's photos on the next page there's
like something awesome coming like just
give us your zip code and we'll give you
awesome deals in your area like give us
your email will send you the best deals
every day blah blah you can promise
something some of these are kind of
obvious I'll admit but you can see I'm
match.com freeze them together and you
can see how import
they increase the psych Louisville which
didn't can leverage later to get work
out of people also you can start right
before you even get to the web page you
can have a trusted channel like if it
comes to a friend recommendation or from
facebook or a site that people believe
in they'll show up with more psyched if
it comes from a friend invite they might
show up with 40 instead of 30 psych and
more more patience with your with your
experience also if you just dilute that
lose them if the person just seen a ton
of invites or they've seen a ton of ads
for it they'll come with a lot more
energy so like for instance eat Harmon
just has lots of high quality ads they
have quality and deluge and then people
show up on the site they're like hey
welcome to the site how about you get
sino profiles and nothing until you
figure fill out a 10 page questionnaire
and people like okay you can also use
psych the site that you have more
smartly you can be as smart as possible
there's another site that another dating
site that I went to where actually it
guests your location said oh are you in
san francisco and i said yes and that's
one less thing to fill out and that
means no keyboard time for that
interface which is really a big win if
you can so matcom i'm not sure why they
don't have that maybe i want to be more
specific but but have but being as smart
as you can asking for as little data as
you can guessing the rest is good
grouping things decreasing visual
complexity is good like they had um six
different items five different times you
fill out and one button so like six
different items but they put them on
only three lines and because it's three
lines to your brain it mostly feels like
three things to do if they put each one
of those like minimum age maximum age
like your gender urgent their gender all
in one line all on one line each it
would just feel heavier and it would be
effectively more work to fill out or at
least would feel that way there's
different tests you can do to make sure
that you're using the least amount of
psych possible there's many million to
test out there but these are these are
some that I thought might you guys might
find fun what I call the 10-foot test
where you just roll your you just roll
back from the computer monitor for about
10 feet and you see if you can tell what
to do on the page for instance is mass
comm page you could be quite far away
and realized that you have to address
this form in the center and you will
probably unlock whatever's behind it and
that big green button really wants to be
clicked and so like if you can figure it
out at a long distance away you're
probably doing something right you're
using
out and colors to communicate what's
going on without people having to read
which is great there's also the cross
out test so like if you write a bunch of
registering like hi I'm dries contractor
and it's really great to see you guys
and I'm doing a presentation on getting
psyched you just cross out words until
the thing no longer makes sense so if
you cross out my name it's like hi I'm
and I'm blah blah blah anyway sex
something's wrong like his name's out
there but if you could cross out and
across up things more and more and more
you'll get down to like eventually it'll
be like dries contractor getting psyched
and you're like wow that's so much more
powerful when you cut out all that BS
and so um you could just cross out words
and just look at it and you're you're
like subsystems psychologically will
just tell you whether it's better or not
you don't have to do the work just cross
it out and your you'll know also um one
thing I always love is it I I think it's
less not a celebrate it could be but one
place that design is always awesome is
for military equipment because pretty
much is made for people like who might
just have a high school education we're
about to get killed I feel like and so
you just make it so it works and it's
like brilliant like laptops open with a
huge power button like the bazookas
actually say point towards target which
it first seems humorous right but if
you're like oh my boy target like it
makes a lot of sense and so pretty much
if you can use your web page while under
fire like like oh my gosh have to click
something within three seconds I have to
get down with this web page and it works
then it's probably gonna work you know
maybe tell people to hold your poop I
just came up with a pilot maybe tell
people hold your breath and get through
a whole red process if they could do
that you got an efficient reg process
okay so back to our only page um can you
guys think of ways that this page could
create more psyche or use less psych
just looking at this even optimized
hundreds of tens of millions of dollars
gone into it can you improve upon it I
can any ideas yes the sectors of code is
one of them that's that'd be good yes
you can show what friends are using it
without them even logging in and then if
they logged in you could say or facebook
login in which case you could guess all
this data that's a great yeah like which
like would you like this girl or this
guy or this kind of you know other
looking guy you know and you could just
you
picture I think it'll be great merge the
fields yeah so I think you mean like 88
between 8 25 and 35 would be an age
range and then women would be women
seeking man yeah yeah so it'd be a
single drop down that makes a lot of
sense to me too oh so you could
immediately access the pictures yeah
that's true that would also that would
increase site quite a bit if you could
click on a photo like enjoy it more
somehow and then save the form for later
then you'd have more in your tank and
can come back to it that's true yeah you
could just have an action-based I like
actually that's the best that's my
favorite idea I don't think of that at
all and I think it's a great idea just
interacting with the content yourself
because that's what you want to do if
you can somehow make getting the data
directly in the path of what user wants
to do make the getting psyched and make
doing the work the exact same that's
totally the best so I didn't want to run
out of time I was going to this entire
presentation again for teams because at
bebo I was a programmer for the first
half and then I was a manager for the
second half and I learned some some what
about like keeping team psyched and
keeping the energy level high they're
just like and it's actually really
similar to users in many ways so here
are some of the bullet points it's just
one page so with someone's job if you're
able to build someone's job for them and
decide what they're doing one of my one
of my favorite things was to try to make
sure that each job for a person has a
creative aspect that they enjoy doing
and have independence doing so this is
different for different people some
people love building spam prevention
systems that like I'm going to get those
spammers and other people are like oh my
god statistics statistics i hate it i
failed statistics you know so just make
sure they have a creative aspect of the
job that they enjoy and then every job
is dull aspects you know someone's got
to clean the wastepaper bin or whatever
so and someone's gotta like clean out
the log files or like you know deal with
bugs or user complaints so just make
sure the dull aspects of the job or
things that they're good at you know
they might not like it but at least they
can pound it out better than anyone else
in the room and the wastepaper bins are
always empty and it's not a big deal
because they feel it's kind of a
zen-like okay sure and oftentimes you
can possibly do that creative aspect
only needs to be a small percent of the
job so you just find something that it
can be creative at they can really get
excited about their what they're working
on um for projects I mean this is
definitely lean startup stuff as I know
talk about but get the project to a
show-off Apple point eight
up um so for instance if you're building
a car like the first thing there's so
many things you have to do the first
thing you might do is either just make
the engine and make it sound good you're
like yeah that sounds like a real car
like wrong wrong like sweet or you just
make the platform and the thing just
like rolls downhill doesn't steer or
whatever but just having a platform you
at least get to the point where you're
like hey you want to like roll downhill
in my platform you're like yeah let's do
it you know and it's like fun you could
show it off you can tell your friends
about you can tell the boss about it
everyone's psyched and really I
personally think of the first quarter of
a project as simply building momentum
for the rest of the project because
everyone in this room knows how software
timelines are always like Oh it'll take
two weeks oh we're almost done
after two months oh it's completely
shift after two and half months you know
and so all that stuff is delayed and so
getting to a show off point quickly gets
everyone excited about working on it
because now they're taking something
awesome and making it super awesome
rather than taking something that's not
there and making it sooner potentially
there which is a lot less exciting you
much rather take something awesome make
it more awesome also you should build an
order of sexiness like one thing about
the car example like if you have a
platform that rolls downhill what's the
next thing you want to do with it you
want to steer it you want to steer it
before you really need the engine for it
like that's the next thing that would
make it more sexy and fun and make the
next round of interesting things to
share to do with it adding the engine is
incredibly important but a lot of work
and rather be like oh we have this
perfect car it just doesn't go up hill
yet and you're like okay well that's
exciting it does everything but uphill
so building an order of sexiness keeps
your team psyched and and going
organization um this is actually kind of
a tough one and so it's a lot of work
but it's got a big payoff as much as you
can if you're a manager of a number of
people and you have control over
policies and practice and practices in
organization or you're a small company
you just kind of can see this stuff
happening try to identify all the
different pain points in the
organization because every pain is a
decrease of psyche in someone's it's
kind of psyched in this fuel tank and
every ongoing pain is kind of like a
hole in their fuel tank or they're
constantly leaking psyche and eventually
they're going to run out and they're
going to blame it on you and that's no
fun so as much as possible identify
really I should have said the ongoing
pain because it's always minor pain it's
not a big deal but all the ongoing pain
are all if
the fuel leaks in the organization one
classic one is um you know you'll have
coders who you know right buggy code and
be like oh it's fine ship it um and then
you have one guy whose job it is to put
on prod and then it's up on prod and
then it breaks and the guy who's there
eight o'clock shipping the thing while
the guy who wrote the code is out having
a beer is like Oh guy who wrote bad code
I hate you got your Oh bad code like why
do you write that you know like you
should write tests for everything you
know like and then the guy rope add
codes like everyone makes mistakes and
like you as as policy maker have to kind
of get in between that that's those are
ongoing leaks in the organization so
that if you leave that be each person is
going to get more resentful and it's not
going to work so figure you have to
identify those leaks and then all leaks
should if at all possible route back
into the gas station they came from so
um this is kind of a complex concept but
um like with that release issue what you
do is you break into two problems like
if you know there's always bugs but if
you have one bug a month you have the
guy you have the release guy just deal
with it you say that's your job and you
have more than one bug a month you say
to the decoder hey you need to make it
max one buck a month if you make more
than one bug of months that's your job
and so you're out kind of potential
leaks back to the the area they came
from okay also um I'm almost done um you
should appreciate specifically and
constantly like it's ridiculous how much
appreciation you can give and every time
you give it you're putting fuel in the
tank what I used to do at bebos I've
just appreciate that out of everybody
and you put all this fuel in the tank
and no one ever got angry at each at the
other person we're always angry at
processes and systems and realities but
because everyone's tank was full you
never take it out on anyone else because
that's the only reason you yell at
anyone because your tanks empty so you
just tank everyone up constantly on one
great way to do that is to highlight
what would fail without them instead of
just being like good job on this project
you like well someone else cooked on
this project you have to be like look
the other guys we're doing this and this
and this if you end on this project this
one who got done thank you so much and
then people like hey that's right and
then people feel full they feel part of
the system and they feel important then
it's it fills a tank up and it saves a
whole ton of hassle that comes from just
having your tank empty like half the
problems out there aren't even problems
they're just people who
you know are making them problems
because they want their time filled um
also this is a separate thing but just
having one designer / decision that is
kind of a clear way to say that roles
and responsibilities should be clear for
any given decision there should be only
one person whose job it is to make it if
that's the case it makes a lot of
discussions a lot easier and it makes a
lot of things go a lot faster um that's
all I got here's my fun ending kicker so
that you can remember me as being a
funny guy so the reality of that photos
bitch right you you put in your five
four meals you pushed all five keys to
get in your zip code which you finally
remembered and you hit the huge
greenview caps all photos button with
the Chevron's and everything you're like
this is gonna happen well guess what
after that you get to a pages like just
a little more data you're like dog no
just a username it's right there you're
like yes and then it takes you to
 like full red like the deepest
fullest red you've ever done and then
you're like oh deep red yeah like give
us your parents like religious
affiliation like oh did your mom
breastfeed you oh like like where do you
want to like give us your bucket list
like like please list out 300 things you
love okay now 50 things you hate okay
now you are get this I couldn't believe
myself you are now you probably an see
in the back but after this much you are
now like 17 head to the way through the
process and I also have to say that um
after you get to this page when I forgot
to the page I was like oh this i'm
gonna click search on top i'm not going
to do full ridge and so I went to the
search page as like like I'm a web
developer and I click search I went to
results I'm like photos you click on it
you click on any of those guys and you
actually go back into deep bridge and so
I like game over match me not okay and
that's that any questions queries I'm
around later and you can tweet me email
me what have you and thanks a lot for
your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
