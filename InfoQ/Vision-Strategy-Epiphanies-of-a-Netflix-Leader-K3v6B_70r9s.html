I'm live oh there we go
cool in 1998 I was working at a small
startup called poor Terra you wouldn't
have heard of it it's a failed startup
now but at the time I was working there
it seemed like an interesting place to
be and I was working for a gentleman
named Rob Gordon and Rob was my manager
he previously even imagined manager at a
previous place he and I were friends and
one day he's like hey let's go for a
walk
I'm gonna be leaving poor Tara I'm gonna
go to this place called Netflix and they
do this cool thing it's you go to a
website you put a DVD in your cart you
go and say I want to get this ship to me
and then you wait several days for it to
show up and I'm like doesn't sound like
a great business model but ok that's
interesting I actually sat with it in
the next day I without even stronger
reaction what an incredibly stupid idea
who would do that who would go and add a
movie to their car weight of several
days to receive it when they can just
get in their car drive over to
Blockbuster and go pick up the movie it
didn't seem like a very good idea to me
but fast forward a year later where Tara
still wasn't doing that well I wasn't
that excited about it I decided to move
on and Rob calls me up and he's like hey
Josh you want to come interview a
Netflix I said ok what have I got to
lose
it was the boom of the market at the
time I figured if this doesn't work out
I'll just go find something else so why
not all go in and talk to them so that
day I went in for interviews in August
had I met with this rather dapper
gentleman this is dr. Neil hunt who is
the chief product officer at Netflix for
many years and he just said a few things
to me while we were sitting there that
really changed the way that I thought
about Netflix and the opportunity he
said we're gonna do this thing it's
called a home rental library
you never hear them talk about this
today at Netflix but that's how we
thought about it at the time people are
gonna have these DVDs at home they'll be
able to watch whatever they want when
they're done they can send it back
they'll have this list we're gonna call
it a queue very British thing you can
tell me it was involved in that but
people will have their lists they can
have a movie ship that's going to be
great and it's going to be a
subscription service not ala carte so we
think this will really help us get a lot
of traction and in just a few sentences
Neil had conveyed
a lot of information to me he had given
me an experience that I could imagine
and I could relate to and he told me
about a business model that could
potentially be successful so I'd
actually decided to join Netflix at that
point and not only that but I stayed
there for 17 years
so I joined this incredibly stupid
company and loved it
for a very long time so just introduced
myself here I'm Josh Evans I was a
Netflix from 1999 to 2016 I did
ecommerce for a while first for DVD as
an engineer moved into management helped
foster sort of the e-commerce part of
the business moving into streaming I
worked right into the heart of Netflix
of streaming service working on playback
services DRM device activation security
all those kinds of things and then my
last stint there was an operations
engineering where I got to learn about
performance and reliability and had a
drive engineering velocity but when I
think about my career at Netflix I don't
really think about it in these terms I
think about it as if I went just going
to school for the last 17 years I know
some people have actually done that I
learned about modern architecture and
how to build distributed systems in the
cloud operational excellence how to move
quickly with confidence I learned about
leadership from some of the strongest
leaders in the industry I learned about
how to organize for success and how you
use culture to align incentives to get
people to do the right things and move
things in the right direction and today
I'm here to talk to you about vision and
strategy all think these are the things
that I'm very passionate about and this
is a new topic for me so I'll be looking
forward to your feedback on this I also
want to inspire all of you if you're our
new managers to think of leadership as a
journey I didn't learn all of this at
once I learned this over 17 years
through experience and by learning from
people that I knew and trusted so why is
Netflix relevant to this story of vision
and strategy and I would make an
argument that Netflix is more relevant
than most businesses because lightning
struck twice in the same place first
with the DVD business where Netflix
launched this dvd-by-mail business that
was quite successful the incumbent block
Buster was a six billion dollar business
when Netflix first first started out
they were going after this incumbent
that seemed insurmountable and yet they
still managed to put blockbuster out of
business and then Netflix did it again
with streaming built a highly successful
and even more successful business than
the DVD business today Netflix is a
global leader in subscription internet
TV with a growing slate of global
original content right now if they're at
a hundred and nine million members and
going strong by the end of the quarter
they expect to be at a hundred and
fifteen million they're in a hundred and
ninety countries and tens of languages
on almost any device you can imagine
streaming on if you look at the stop
over the last five years the proof is in
the pudding two thousand percent
increase since 2012 and the really
interesting thing here is that this
didn't happen by accident this happened
from leadership this happened from
vision and this came out of good
strategy something that is repeatable at
Netflix so for today's journey I'm first
gonna do a little bit of a deep dive in
division and talk about why vision
matters and then we'll go into strategy
a concept that I struggled with quite
honestly for years especially as a new
manager so we'll talk about what is
strategy and how do you formulate
strategies what does that look like and
then we'll go deep into this story we'll
talk about Netflix versus blockbuster
how did Netflix actually accomplish what
they accomplished how did they take on
an incumbent and take their market away
from them and then we'll talk about
Netflix streaming another great use case
where we can apply strategy we'll talk
about how Netflix got to where they are
today and then finally I'm gonna talk
about my new job at github where I see
some very similar sort of early
inflection points that are possible that
are very similar to the experience that
I had early on when I join Netflix so
let's talk about vision who wants to
which brave soul would like to raise
their hand and tell me why does vision
matter what does it do for you it's a
road map okay any other thoughts
only one breaks justin provides clarity
and focus good when I've been asked this
question before I've asked my team's to
say hey let's go look two years out what
are we gonna go build and I've gotten a
response of how can we do that we can't
even really figure out what we're doing
in the next three or four months it
keeps changing maybe I could look out
six months but two years that just seems
crazy why would we do that
and so the best analogy I've come up
with is hill climbing who here is
familiar with the hill climbing
algorithm we've got a few good I don't
feel bad about explaining effect which I
plan to do anyway so hill climbing you
start at some arbitrary point on a grid
and your goal is to get to the high
point and this is some code that I
lifted out of Wikipedia the very simple
algorithm this is sort of pseudocode
don't worry about the elegance of it but
essentially all you're doing is saying
walk into my current node look at the
adjacent nodes pick the one that's
highest make that your next node lock in
do the same thing until you get to the
very highest point and then you just
exit out and now you're at the top of
the hill but imagine you don't just have
a hill imagine you're close to the hill
but what you should be climbing is a
mountain that's not nearby and so if you
run this algorithm you're very likely to
end up at what's called the local
maximum the one that is closest to you
but it's not what you should be shooting
for you should be climbing a mountain
not the nearest hill and so for new
managers I like this analogy I think it
really resonates for me I hope it does
for you which is that managers climb
Hills and we need great hill climbers
it's an it's more algorithmic work it's
about execution it's about getting the
next task done it's about project
management and those are all incredibly
important things so I don't want to
downplay the importance of management
but managers are essentially hill
climbers but leaders take mountains they
choose the path they want to go in they
select the mountain they don't just go
with the thing that's right next to them
they paint a picture of what it looks
like to be in a certain place and they
get their team together and they get
their equipment together and they figure
out
they're gonna need and they accept the
fact that they might start out in a
certain path but they might need to
course-correct as they go and so
managers climb Hills but leaders take
mountains and vision is the mountain
vision is the picture you paint that
helps people understand where you're
going it as Justin said it brings
clarity to the situation it helps people
all go along the same journey together
and knowing what the end point is going
to look like and so that's why vision is
very important and I'd like to move on a
strategy we're gonna spend the bulk of
the time talking about strategy because
I think it's sort of the deeper topic
but I think it's important that we keep
that in mind so when I was a new manager
I've been manager for several years my
peers were getting promoted they were
becoming directors and even while I was
still a manager one of one of my peers
even became a VP and I thought what do
they have that I don't have what am I
not doing right here so I asked around a
little bit and I got this sort of vague
response well Josh you know you're not
strategic enough I'm like what the hell
does that mean I had no clue I really
had no clue I was just stumped luckily I
had a great mentor and friend Patti
McCord and I went to Patti and she's
standing in her cube and I'm talking to
her I'm saying I'm just lost people are
telling you I'm not strategic enough I
don't know where to get started how do I
develop these skills I don't even know
what this means I couldn't see what I
couldn't see and she's we're standing
there she's seen her Cuban she's got
this stack of books just this classic
Patti had a stack of books of stephen
r.covey is the high seven Habits of
Highly Effective People and she just
reaches over from the pile hands it to
me and says just read the chapter on
being proactive said okay I'll take a
look at that
so of course being the overachiever I am
I read the book and within the next
couple of days went through and and
there was some really useful stuff in
there so I want to share this with you
because these are the baby steps these
are the first steps towards thinking in
a bigger way and moving beyond that sort
of hill climbing algorithmic mentality
and starting to really grow as a leader
so cubby talks about these concepts your
circle of influence and your circle of
concern your circle of influence are
those things that you directly affect
your circle of concern are those things
that you're still responsible for
dealing with and if you're a new manager
at frequently if you
like this and it feels like there's like
there's all this pressure coming at you
that are just squeezing you like a tin
can getting just crushing you it feels
like everything's happening to you and
you don't have any control over the
situation this is very common I think
for new managers but the goal is to meet
those challenges head-on this is what it
means to be proactive to start pushing
your sphere of influence out so instead
of those things happening to you you are
reaching out you're getting ahead of
these things and you're taking those
challenges on head-on you're
anticipating what's coming your way and
this is incredibly powerful and if you
just start with this one thing it's a
very helpful thing to do
Kubby also talks about beginning with
the end in mind envision what you want
in the future so you can work and plan
towards it seems really like straight
forward stuff but this is the beginning
of developing vision what does it look
like when we're done have you aligned
people around that so they can get to
that place and then he also talks about
putting first things first and he sets
up these quadrants of urgent versus not
urgent important versus not important
and everybody knows that you have to do
the urgent and important stuff that's
sort of the no-brainer stuff but people
frequently find themselves prioritizing
the urgent and not important stuff after
that that's what builds up that
distraction layer if you can't parse out
the difference between what's important
and what's not important then you can't
choose to prioritize and that second
quadrant on the right not urgent but
important
that's the proactive space those are the
investments you have to carve out time
for you have to choose to make these
investments and these are really really
important investments it's about
preparation and prevention it's about
long-term planning creating the space
for innovation and creativity clarifying
your values and who you are building
relationships that you'll have partners
later when you need to lean on people
and you have to go build something
together it's about empowering your team
so they feel autonomous and ready to
take on challenges and it's about
finding work/life balance for yourself
and hopefully for your team as well so
you're refreshed and you're able to
tackle those challenges they can't
encourage you enough to focus on that
second quadrant very very important
so this is all well and good but it
doesn't really answer the question I'm
still puzzled myself at this point I say
okay I'm being proactive I'm looking
ahead I'm starting to make progress I
don't feel like I'm getting crushed like
a tin can anymore but I still don't
really understand strategy so started
looking around let's look at definitions
let's trying to get our brain around
this just by looking at what's out there
sort of readily available so the
Wikipedia definition a high-level plan
to achieve one or more goals under
conditions of uncertainty and this is
useful it tells you that it's not a
specific tactical plan it's not like
taking a route on a map it gives you
that room for adaptation it's high level
and you can accomplish multiple things
along the way so that's sort of a good
start but it's still very abstract this
is the famous quote from sunsoo strategy
without tactics is the slowest route to
victory tactics without strategy as the
noise before defeat what this tells me
is that strategy cannot be successful it
must be supported by tactics you have to
ground it in the actual work that needs
to be done and that tactics are useless
if they're not informed by strategy last
quote here the essence of strategy is
choosing what not to do and this is
incredibly powerful because this is
about focus this is about choices that
you make you don't take on the world you
don't try to do everything you make
specific choices about where to invest
your energy and so in summary still very
abstract but we've got some pieces here
we've got sort of the gist alt of what
strategies are there proactive and goal
oriented they're high level they're
adaptive but they're focused at the same
time they're realized through tactics
and I would add informed by vision
because if you're not actually trying to
accomplish some end result why are you
doing all of this in the first place so
I think to really internalize all of
this and this was true for me the first
time that I actually truly internalized
strategy was when this gentleman came to
Netflix to teach a class on strategy
this is a gentleman named Hamilton
Helmer he's an author he's an investor
has been incredibly successful and he
has a method a framework for how he
thinks about business strategy and
business
strategy is absolutely critical for
everybody in this room who wants to be a
leader or is a leader because everything
that we do should be grounded in what's
important to the business and should be
aligned around the strategies at the
business level so I'm gonna spend some
time on this it's going to be slightly
academic but bear with me and there will
be a quiz after this so please pay
attention this is a bit of a flyby but I
think you'll get a good flavor here
so Hamilton's definition of strategy is
very specific it's a route to continuing
power in significant markets so it's
that sense of a pathway of getting
somewhere I'll talk about power what
power means in just a second but
significant markets means that it's
actually worth putting in the effort to
take that market on there's a lot of
money to be had there's a lot of impact
to be had in that space you don't bother
doing this at the markets not very big
and power is this is the academic
definition I'll elaborate the set of
conditions creating the potential for
persistent differential returns and this
means that essentially you can make more
money than your competitors over a
period of time it gives you an advantage
over them so he wrote this book luckily
I had taken a bunch of notes ten you
know seven years ago but I sort of
scrounging around trying to found them
and I got lucky because Hamilton
actually published his book which
captures all the stuff that I learned so
I do encourage you all to take a look at
this and he describes seven powers and
walks through each one of these I'm
gonna cover this and we'll do this
little sort of one by one but at a high
level scale economies Network economies
counter positioning switching costs
branding and cornered resource I'll
explain briefly what each one of these
are but I also want to point out I'm
sorry on this process power and it's one
of my favorites I also want to point out
that there's no mistake here that Reed
Hastings the CEO of Netflix wrote the
foreword for this book because these
strategies have been applied at necklace
thisis this is these are the models that
have been applied when formulating and
making plans at a fairly high level so
Hamilton talks about power giving you
two things it gives you a benefit a
barrier
the benefit essentially is you can make
more money than your competitors usually
it's because you have lower costs you
might be able to charge more for your
product there's a variety of reasons why
you might have that benefit the barrier
is just important how do you keep your
competition from taking that benefit
away from you that's essentially all
that this says and you need to have both
of these to have real power in a market
for example scale economies this is a
business in which per unit cost declines
as production volume increases this is
classic scale this is the more I buy I
can buy in bulk I can get a lower costs
on a per-unit basis I can make more
money Amazon is a great example of
actors they're doing this on an
absolutely massive scale I think they're
well over a 300 billion dollar company
now and almost everything they do is
about scale the benefit is that they can
get lower costs the barrier is that they
have so much efficiency in what they do
that if a competitor comes along they
can smack them down quickly by just
dropping their prices teaching their
lesson it won't do prices back up you do
that a few times nobody's gonna take you
on and that's essentially where Amazon
is today nobody's trying to build the
next Amazon certainly not as a direct
competitor network economies the value
of a product to a customer is increased
by the use of the product by others
people go to linkedin to connect with
other people and potentially to find
work recruiters go there to go find the
people to hire and the more of them that
are come on each side the more benefit
there is to all the participants in the
system and this creates a lock in that
system this is why there are many
companies out there trying to rip people
away from LinkedIn I just kind of delete
all those requests from all those other
little companies because LinkedIn is
kind of where I am this most efficient
place very personally counter
positioning is an interesting one a
newcomer adopts a new superior business
model which the incumbent does not mimic
due to anticipated damage to their
existing business Vanguard did this to
fidelity they did these no-load index
funds there's no managers picking stocks
not charging you those extra fees to pay
for their time and the investments
they're making and Vanguard came in and
took a big chunk of the market away from
those mutual fund investment companies
switching costs the value loss expected
by a customer
that would be incurred from switching to
an alternate supplier for additional
purchases Apple made a really smart
choice with iTunes they put things in
their own proprietary format you go to
some other company to try and get your
your music you're leaving that behind
there's a huge cost to a user to go to
another company and that creates sort of
a lock-in effect
branding I looked it up just this
morning so I wasn't sure Tiffany's been
around for a hundred and eighty years I
didn't know that
branding is about the durable
attribution of higher value to an
objectively identical offering that
arises from historical information about
the seller Tiffany can charge two or
three times what a competitor might
charge for the exact same materials the
same workmanship all of that and that
gives them substantial power in the
market and you can't take it away from
them you have a hundred 80 years to
spend to build up that kind of brand
probably not brand can be built up more
quickly than that but this is sort of
the quintessential example here cornered
resource preferential access at
attractive terms to a coveted asset that
can be ended that can independently
enhance value the easy no-brainer on
this is something like a patent where
you simply have exclusive rights to that
thing for a guaranteed period of time
but Hamilton uses that the story of
Pixar where ever cat Little John
Lasseter and Steve Jobs came together to
build this amazing company that was
going to transform animated film and
they came together explicitly because
they wanted to work together and they
weren't gonna go work at DreamWorks or
someplace else so this was a cornered
resource for Pixar and finally processed
power embedded company organization
activity sets which enable lower costs
and or superior product which can be
matched only by extended commitment and
you think about Toyota and the
incredible investments they made into
automated assembly lines they had
disciplines around saying that anyone in
the assembly line could pull a cord and
stop the entire thing if they saw
anything wrong and they don't fix the
root cause make it work better and move
forward and that allowed them to create
cars much less expensively with higher
quality it's a really powerful stuff
there as well so that's the little
academic section thank you for bearing
with me and now we're going to get into
kind of the fun part here I wanted to
lay that foundation for
because I'm gonna ask you about what you
think these powers are and what's been
apply so the vision for Netflix again
home rental library subscription nice
simple vision here but given what I've
sort of gone through this is kind of
unfair because this is pretty deep stuff
but I'm gonna I'm gonna ask you anyway
what form of power did Netflix have over
blockbuster does anybody want to take a
guess say it again
counter positioning what else switching
cost that's interesting their work
economy maybe I'm not sure there are two
that I am pretty sure of it and I would
argue that Netflix had two forms of
power against blockbuster I call this
the one-two punch for blockbuster this
is why they went down so hard correct on
counter positioning whoever had that
Netflix had a business models radically
different from blockbusters and they
couldn't even conceive of embracing this
model so much so that in 2000 and they
go right past this as we just talked
about this blockbuster actually laughed
Netflix out of the room in in 2000 when
Barry McCarthy went there to say hey you
know what you guys are doing the
in-store stuff we're doing dvd-by-mail
why don't we combine forces and they
wanted none of it they just couldn't
even conceive of taking on this kind of
model and for years and I remember this
for years they said Netflix is a niche
business it's never gonna go anywhere
and they just double down and stayed
with their model until 2004 when they
suddenly realized that we were starting
to eat their lunch and gauge but in 2004
Netflix had a five-year run way ahead of
Blockbuster to do something else to
develop another form of power and that
was processed power this is hidden which
is why you might not have known this
intuitively because this is not
something that everybody knows in terms
of investment and reminder process power
the embedded company organization
activity sets which enable lower costs
and or superior product which can be
matched only by an extended commitment
well that extended commitment was
happening over five years
they Netflix and calling it a niche
business and if you back then if you
went to one of the depth of shipping
centers you might see what you would
expect initially you know there's trucks
and you walk in and there's the manual
steps for doing rental return you can
imagine an army of people dealing with
DVDs and there was some of that some of
the process was manual and did have
humans doing it like opening and
inspecting for cracks cleaning the DVDs
and polishing them although this was
actually automated later but here's
where the fun starts
that place modified or had the company
that created postal sorters for the USPS
and had them modified to automate their
business this is an example of that and
this machine was used to do rental
returns so essentially scan the DVDs on
the way in register in a software system
check to see if that same DVD needed to
go out the same day don't go put it away
into storage if you know you're gonna
ship it the same day as the envelopes
are flying past it had a named jet
printer that could spray on people's
addresses and barcodes you could do
presort and put the DVDs into bins by
zip code so they could just be picked up
by the USPS and delivered directly to
that correct host office and this
lowered necklaces cost substantially
there's a close of a barcode scanner the
printer in the sorter section here's a
fun device this is the envelope stuffer
this thing could stuff 4200 envelopes an
hour there would be several of these in
one of our our hubs a little bit of
clothes up here on the conveyor stop
fold seal and these little suction cup
things that would put the stickers on to
seal it and of course that was just in
the hub itself those system software
systems were then deeply integrated with
all the software systems for the rest of
the business so you can see your movies
shipping out of your queue and going
into your your section of what's out we
did address validation to do bar coding
the logistics systems that we're
tracking all the inventory and flight
were deeply plugged in so we knew
whether we need even ship some over to
another hub because that was closer to
the customers that had demand so really
deep deep integration and incredibly
efficient and so when blockbuster
started really thrashing it they had
entered the market they were competing
with Netflix and they started lowering
their prices to try to take market share
away from that
there were two things that we could have
done we could have followed them down
and chosen to lower prices along with
them out of fear or hold the line and
because we knew how efficient we were
because we knew that they were charging
less money in their costs must have been
astronomically high because they didn't
have all those years to do that
automation we just waited and that was
the knockout punch
they eventually just collapsed under
their own weight they could not afford
to continue with the model that they had
and so now in 2011 there were stories at
the very end of how Netflix just
destroyed Blockbuster I love that sounds
great I'm very proud of that that was a
phase when I was very happy when that
happens it was stressful time so I do
have to tell you so now let's move on
and let's look at Netflix streaming and
let's talk about counter positioning
because this is really interesting so
Netflix haven't even fully won the
battle with blockbuster before they
started going hmm
so if we're the incumbent who's going to
take our market away from us and we knew
that bits weren't always going to be
delivered to people's homes to watch
movies on a physical disk there was this
internet thing we were actually using
for other things that probably could be
used and so Netflix did something that
very few businesses are willing to do
they counter positioned against
themselves they chose to cannibalize
their DVD market knowing that their
future was going to be in digital
delivery over the Internet
not on DVD and so the business model
shifted just ever so subtly
from DVDs by mail with the home mental
library to streaming on-demand with a
subscription so again all the muscles
we've built around subscription all that
we got to continue all we did was change
the delivery mechanism and Netflix had
some visions for where they wanted to be
we wanted to become a much loved global
Internet TV service create a highly
valuable durable business which is why
Netflix focuses on the long-term not
short-term in terms of its business
metrics and lead a creative revolution
this is the fun part
enabling artists enabling directors and
writers to find their niche to create
content unencumbered by studios trying
to micromanage them and create amazing
content
so here's an interesting question you
all know a necklace is successful today
that's not going to be a big story for
all of you but what power now do you
think Netflix has in the market that
gives it defenses gives it a benefit and
a barrier in the current world branding
interesting cornered resource
interesting okay I hate to tell you this
but you're all wrong
sorry the clue is right here in the
description that I gave early on look at
the words here global leader in
subscription internet TV growing slate
of global original content 109 million
to a hundred and fifteen million see the
drift here scale economies that's what
Netflix has in its favor I can get into
a debate about the other powers it's
interesting to talk about that but this
is this is really what it's all about
for Netflix and I'll walk it through so
you and so you can see why again
business in which per unit cost declines
as production volume increases but in
the beginning Netflix didn't have power
in the market you have to get started
somewhere so we started licensing
content early on for streaming doing
what are called non-exclusive licenses
and what this means is necklace could go
to Marvel and say we want your whole
catalog we want to have it available on
streaming we're willing to pay you a
certain amount of money for that but
your competitors your direct competitors
subscription video on-demand competitors
to Netflix could also get that same
content there was nothing to keep them
from acquiring it let's walk through
I'll walk you to the math on this is
really very straightforward imagine
Netflix has 50 million members who are
willing to watch one piece of the
content from that catalogue a Netflix
says ok Morrible let's use that example
we'll pay you 50 million dollars for a
non-exclusive deal to get access to that
content and that works out ok this is
actually real math if that fools paying
a dollar per view they go out of
business but this is great from a model
perspective so $1 per view Amazon comes
along to the same studio and says well
we only have 5 million members we're
still new we're trying to break into
this market so we'll pay you 5 million
dollars because we want to get parody on
a per view basis from Netflix this is
what we can afford and hey you're gonna
get an extra 5 million dollars so why
not take it and so the studios did this
is how things played out in those first
few years
but the strategy came in once Netflix
started to hit scale and this is a model
where we used exclusive studio contracts
to create competitive barriers
competitors cannot license the same
content at the same time but you have to
pay more for that and so let's walk
through that same exercise again but now
with the exclusive model Netflix has
it's 50 million members which you're
gonna watch one title but this time
we're willing to pay 60 million dollars
to get an exclusive contract and it does
cost a little bit more it's goes from a
dollar to a dollar 20 per view
proportionately that doesn't seem too
bad it's only a 20% increase but here's
what happens when Amazon tries to take
that deal away they still only have 5
Lea members but to take that deal from
Netflix they have to pay 60 million
dollars to take that deal away because
now it's exclusive they can't get that
same content unless they pay what
Netflix was willing to pay and at that
point that's a bankrupting business plan
$12 per view just doesn't scale and this
is why you see the market today sort of
becoming these exclusive independent
channels because this is the strategy
that all the players are now taking
trying to create their own original
content and when you look at the
original strategy all that originals are
is a more efficient global version of
exclusive studio contracts but natheless
gets to move all the way upstream to the
very beginning to the inception of the
project talking to people who are
writing the script sometimes even before
the scripts are written so you take on
all the risk but you take on all the
benefit and by the way when you're
trying to license content from studios
they like the license it region by
region by region you got lawyers and
people negotiating over every single one
and that's incredibly inefficient for
the business to do that but but if you
get the the contra if you own the
content from day one then you also an
exclusive global rights on day one this
is why Netflix is able to release
globally all at the same time and get
the scale benefit of being able to make
that content available to every user in
the world that is a Netflix member not
locked into two specific regions it's so
incredibly powerful this year necklace
is spending about six billion dollars on
content a lot of that almost all of it
is exclusive I don't know if they're
doing any non-exclusive deals at this
point and they're trying to get to a
model fairly soon an SV
for half of that's going to be original
content half of it will be licensed
that's huge next year going to spend
eight billion dollars on content that's
how much they're doubling down on this
strategy so this then begs the question
okay that's great but how do you get to
scale so that you get that advantage and
this is kind of a more important pathway
the route to getting to that power and
I'll say there are really two dimensions
to this one is the concept of ubiquity
and we saw it before every possible
device in the world yeah we launched on
Windows Media Player in 2007 it took a
little while they get some steam going
and then we started going platform by
platform by platform in 2010 when I was
managing streaming infrastructure we had
one year where we launched on all the
Apple devices gaming consoles phones and
then a 20011 rounded things out with
Android we also were systematically
expanding geographically so get let's
get access to more more customers by
going to more countries and you can see
again this relentless path towards
growth expanding geographically and then
of course languages if you're going to
go to these different countries not
everybody speaks English so we should
make sure that we localize that so the
people can really enjoy the content and
deepen the penetration there and then in
2016 we just said this is getting really
really tedious going country by country
let's just get this over with
and go global and that's exactly what we
did we launched on that day in 190
countries except for China
everybody knows China's a little more
challenging in terms of market and
trying to break in for regulatory
reasons and there's a few other small
places in the world we further deepened
our penetration by doing something that
I didn't even expect getting onto cable
boxes the cable operators early on
thought Netflix was a threat was causing
cord-cutting there was all this fear
they saw us as as really a pretty
dangerous force the necklace discovered
that with the right approach we were
able to actually work with those cable
operators and get right on the device
that people have in their home and for
some demographic some of you typically
an older generation that might be the
only device they used to watch content
so this gives us access to an even
deeper deeper reach into various places
and in different regions and of course
we added more languages Chinese Korean
and Arabic
but here's the interesting part I assume
all of you are sort of more in the
engineering world we also aligned our
infrastructure goals to mirror the
strategy of the company at the business
level and I've created what I would call
ubiquitous infrastructure we used AWS to
launch
rather than building our own data
centers and the goal was to reliably and
efficiently serve any customer from any
region and so we built out and
eventually consistent ubiquitous data
plane our Cassandra rings were expanded
out to replicate data in all regions
roughly sub-second to a few seconds of
delay between replication we built at a
similar infrastructure ourselves because
we didn't have this for ourselves we
have a memcache D distributed solution
called VB cache we built out this
complex mechanism using kafta to be able
to be replication from multi region
replication from three different regions
and our traffic management was also
dealt with this concept of ubiquity
where any region failed because the data
was always sitting in all three regions
all we had to do was use DNS and our
proxy back channel to move traffic over
to the other regions that were surviving
and this gave us an incredibly resilient
global platform so the other answer to
the question of how we achieve scale I'm
going to go all the way back to that
Michael Porter Club strategic focus what
you do and what you don't do and I
really want to underscore this point
because this is incredibly powerful and
has also helped Nepos be very successful
Netflix originally when we're gonna do
streaming was gonna build a device
you know the netflix player we had
acquired Roku and brought them in-house
and we're building this thing and then
before we launch the service who had oh
if we do this we're gonna be competing
with the very companies that we want to
partner with and so that device got spun
out and we decided we were a service
company we were not gonna be a hardware
manufacturer
likewise Netflix doesn't do pay-per-view
electronics sell-through or ad-supported
and so again we were not competing with
the companies we wanted to partner with
Microsoft we got on the Xbox they did
their own cell through model if we had
been competing with them they would have
said maybe not
especially not early on in fact this was
so powerful that Apple chose to have
Netflix on the iPad on the day of launch
because they felt that we were not
competing with iTunes at all and we were
a must-have for the device we also don't
do sports and news these are real-time
require completely different technical
investments and so again we were focused
now another part of focus is shedding
your legacy how many people remember
quickster yeah I wish I could forget
don't you so Reed Hastings woke up one
morning and and realized that the DVD
business domestically was was slowing us
down in terms of global growth very
different business models and every time
we were trying to make changes for the
global product we had to go oh but what
about DVD what do we do there and so the
decision was made to spin off this
separate company increased prices
because now we needed a streaming plan
that could stand on its own and we were
only charging like an extra two bucks if
you're on a DVD plan and so we did an
equivalent of a 60% price hike for
people that were happy what we call the
hybrid plans there was no plan to
integrate we wanted to sever this down
the line and it's gonna be a whole new
brand while customers were not that
thrilled with this you have to remember
this is during the financial crisis
Occupy Wall Street was happening we sort
of misread the times and Netflix became
the poster child for corporate greed for
a very short time wasn't our intention
wasn't really what you know what we were
intending to do we thought we were just
making our business more efficient but
it was not well-received so here's a
question for you is this a bad strategy
so we want to raise their hand yesterday
how many people think this was a bad
strategy I see are you guys know what
this say obviously yeah it was a good
decision from a strategic perspective it
was flawed execution I would argue
because DVD really was a boat anchor for
Annapolis global streaming it did slow
us down and it was very very important
that we figure out how to free ourselves
and we did even after the quick stir
thing when we backed away from that
behind the scenes we started peeling
away and separating out those systems
really doing what we probably should
have done in the first place which is
have a lightweight integration between
the two services but not disrupt the
customer experience too much and so
really this is what happens when you
have unencumbered expansion that 2,000
percent increase
came after that not exclusively because
we decided to abandon the deep
integration with DVD but it was
definitely one of the elements that put
wind in our sails and allowed us to grow
more quickly
looking ahead these are the current
projections for Netflix and every year
they go up now some analysts are
predicting we'll get to 160 million in
the next few years so now I'd like to
close this out I'd like to talk to you
about my current job and and how it
feels very similar to that moment in
time when I was talking with Neil Hahn
sitting across from him at a at a picnic
bench this is a slightly more modern
story instead I was on a video
conference call with this gentleman
Jason Warner came from Heroku and
canonical ran engineering there and he
and I were having this conversation and
he starts to paint a vision for me that
seemed kind of interesting he said you
know github set a point now where people
think of the business as it's about
source code management and pull requests
and sort of lightly project management
but there's a much bigger vision here
there's an inflection point that's
happening right now imagine a platform
enabled developer ecosystem where all of
the best technologies can come together
within this one single ecosystem but
this can become the destination for
software engineers all the tools that
they want in one place they can come
here every day and have an amazing
experience and get their job done and
that's sound pretty amazing to me and I
started thinking about Hamilton's work
when I was having this conversation I
was thinking about network economies so
if all of the integrators are there all
the people writing best-of-breed
products are bringing their products
into the seco system and almost of every
developer in the world at least has a
gift of account maybe they don't use it
all the time because we can drum that up
we can end up having a world where
engineers come there because the tools
are there and the tools are there
because the engineers are there that's
the essence of a network effect but I
think there's actually another form of
power here which is cornered resource
github also sits on the largest base of
source code in the world and imagine
what happens if you let machine learning
loose on that data the kind of things
you can learn the kinds of things you
can do to help your customers be better
understanding what are the best
practices around security what
technologies are getting traction right
now and why
so real power I think there's the
potential here for some savants
substantial power in the market and to
be honest that's why I joined because I
saw this because I understood the
strategy and I see the potential I also
get to do fun stuff I get to take all
the stuff that I learned at Netflix
learning about micro services and
distributed systems and cloud stuff that
we learned incrementally over the years
and figured out as we were going and
take all of those best practices all of
that perspective and do it again
building out a first-class modern
architecture one that's reliable
scalable and secure fast layered so you
create correct abstraction layers that
keep your architecture clean distributed
of course because that's how you achieve
scale and reliability portable built on
top of something like kubernetes that
could run in multiple environments or
could run in a data center or cloud just
as easily multi region of course again
for reliability but also for latency
purposes and multi cloud my team is
building out this red layer here of
platform services which you can think of
as AWS abstractions for the github echo
system so putting things like storage
and database and get behind these
abstraction layers and enabling
integrators to go and create new
products on top of that platform with
access to our information our metadata
and data so I'm really looking forward
to this this is just the beginning we'll
see how it all goes but I'm really
excited about building a github universe
and if you're interested in hearing more
about that certainly come track me down
at the conference I want to give you a
few takeaways as we go here first of all
start out being proactive start to get
ahead of your demand put first things
first and focus on those things that are
not urgent but important and be
visionary if you're a leader paint a
picture for your team about what it
looks like when you get to the place you
want to get to the clearer you can make
that picture the more likely it is
you're going to accomplish it if you can
see it you can get there study strategy
I am still a novice at this I might
sound like I know what I'm talking about
here I feel like I'm just scratching the
surface myself but study strategy
because it really matters especially if
you understand the strategy for your
business and use that all of the
to drive alignment and ultimately it all
only matters if you make an impact if
you actually get something done all of
this is not just for the sake of doing
it it's for the sake of accomplishing
something that matters and making your
dent in the universe so I think I have a
few minutes left I can take a few
questions and I'll be around a little
bit afterwards to take more questions
one on one any questions thank you
in 2011 the decision was made to
basically separate this DVD business out
of Netflix and you got the drop and
stock price and you got this negative
public perception how was this vision
communicated back to the engineering the
individual contributors and were they
supportive of that the way was community
engineering was that we needed to do
this split and so we needed to start
figuring how to sever all the ties so
we're common building systems or were
common subscriptions we need to build at
ease all that apart but essentially if
somebody was was put in charge of
starting to put a plan together and work
directly on that it was actually a very
well coordinated project we're good at
the execution on that side the poor
execution that I was talking about was
just the decision to do the quick stir
thing that different brand all of that
but under the hood in terms of the
mechanics of it it was a classic you
know put a leader in charge get people
together figure out what the pieces are
figure out your dependencies put and
just start executing on that so it was
actually relatively straightforward from
that perspective and that's actually
what we did under the covers afterwards
once we pulled back from the quick store
brand you'll notice there is actually a
separate DVD com brand today for DVD and
it is very much a separate business but
we didn't make customers pay for the
complexity of having a totally separate
service they cancelled bouncing ball
forth back and forth between the two
services other questions
in the abstract you mentioned as well
that you were not promoted several times
what colleagues work what were your
personal lessons that changed that the
proactive piece helped a lot so starting
to get ahead of those kinds of things
the other thing that happened was and it
was quite interesting I was put in a
situation where I was forced to think of
a higher level of abstraction because I
was moved from e-commerce where I had
been an engineer and I knew everything
about the space I could go to a meeting
I didn't need my engineers to come with
me at all and then I moved into
streaming and I knew almost nothing and
suddenly I had to become very much
dependent on my team and it forced me to
think differently about how I led people
it forced me to lean on my team or get
better at setting context talk about
strategy and vision where are we going
what's important I could no longer be
the person who could be both the
engineer and the leader at the same time
and I do recommend for leaders that you
move around in your career as a result
because the more different kinds of
roles that you have and the more you're
tested the more you're gonna be forced
to develop these more general skills so
that you figure how to lead almost
anything but early on you'll start out
being very very good at one thing so I
think that was probably one thing that
helped me a lot in terms of getting me
to think differently about leadership
and then of course taking this class
with Hamilton just blew my mind I think
most people at Netflix who took this
class felt like it was a real game
changer in terms of how they think about
leadership yes in the back one over here
problems so you mentioned how originally
you were considered not being strategic
and then you took the class and then you
that epiphany started happening there at
what point in time in your career did
you feel that you started you were
recognized as being strategic and and
things started turning around for you I
think it happened gradually and I think
during the course of even managing
streaming infrastructure it does I said
it created this forcing function for me
when I started functioning at that
higher level but I think during that
time also I chose to explicitly make
some investments in operational
excellence
so completely outside of my domain I set
up a cross-functional team for us to
talk about overall how do we improve the
quality of the member streaming
experience and we ended up having some
great discussions there and what came
out of that were some great investments
one of the other device side the device
teams started deeply investing in
instrumenting what was happening really
deeply understanding the error rates and
what was happening categorizing things
and then systematically working through
and making improvements there so I
really felt like I made an impact there
because it came out of a forum where I
developed partnerships where I had
leaders sort of playing at the same
level and at the end of the day people
were inspired to go and do good work
that we would not have done otherwise so
I look at that as sort of the beginning
we are now out of time I will be around
for a little while I can hang out for
20-30 minutes if people have follow-up
questions I'm happy to talk about those
one-on-one and thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
