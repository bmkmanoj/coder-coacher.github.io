Chaudhary i work at qualcomm i run
product management for a couple of
different areas one is web technologies
so obviously that's why i am here today
we are going to try to do this with the
ELMO I don't know why this thing is
called the ELMO if you anybody knows
please let me know but I thought it
would be really interesting to to talk a
little bit about where mobile is now
many of you know Qualcomm right it's a
Qualcomm is a leader in wireless 3g 4g
by the way i have to say that so i can
expense my trip up here I've done that
now it's captured on camera which is
good but of course Qualcomm realizes
this in by making the mobile processors
that we now brand is Snapdragon right so
Snapdragon processors show up in you
know smartphones and tablets and the
very near future and a lot of computing
devices as well end up so in my world
specific to Qualcomm you know clearly we
do a lot of things around wireless as
well as you know hardware design but we
actually do a tremendous amount of
software as well this goes well above
and beyond what you would typically
think is the software we do when we take
an operating system that we glue it down
and make it work on on our processors we
actually do quite a bit of modifications
to what's what you might want to call
middleware or even application
subsystems like the browser which is
what it's going to be the main purpose
of today's discussion to really take
advantage of the different functional
blocks on these processors in mobile
just like in digital video and other
things system-on-chip is not a new thing
it's been what's been there forever so
you know we get we talk a lot about dual
cores and all this good stuff but at the
end of the day you know all these mobile
processors in your smartphone and your
tablets have a cpu sometimes two CPUs
sometimes four cpus have a very very
powerful GPU which itself is made up of
inter internal processing elements you
typically have a digital signal
processor you typically have hardware
decode
for video and that's even before you
start talking about the modem subsystem
for wireless LAN for Wi-Fi for Bluetooth
what have you so there's a heck of a lot
of hardware there and if you're not
really using that hardware you know you
get vanilla in you get to use today's
theme poop out right you actually don't
really get the great performance the
great battery life you actually just get
blah right and so um one of the things
that I like to really share with a lot
of folks who are actually coding
developers people use a compiler or
people who write code that actually runs
through a compiler the people doing the
real work hopefully many of you is the
fact that you know most people think
that our hardware manufacturers take
something like Windows Phone or takes
something like Android and actually just
take it from Google or Microsoft and
then do the work themselves in shipping
that's actually quite not the truth
truth at all instead what they do is we
actually glue it down on to and do these
different optimizations they actually
then take most of our code and actually
incorporate that into their production
production custom hardware boards and
designs themselves sometimes as a
platform you know one design that spawns
multiple other times not as a platform
so why that's relevant is because a lot
of what we do upstream essentially a
Qualcomm around making web technologies
and making the browsing system better
ends up essentially being the source
work that that OEMs like Samsung and HTC
and motorola and Lenovo and Xiao Mei and
companies you've never even heard of
ship in their devices so it's it's a
great return on investment for us as
well as for our OEMs so now let's talk a
little bit about you know web
technologies specifically so if you when
we kicked out kicked off and formed this
group three years ago it was pretty
clear that there was you know whether
it's just you know page download and
looking at a page or your web apps
called them html5 apps that's a new of
course buzz word now but really HTML and
JavaScript applications that really
there's really three vectors where
there they were and are perhaps
different or seen as different than an
eighth their native counterparts you
know one was around performance the
second around capabilities and third
around i'll call it merchandising and
monetization you know these are things
that native apps all really have have it
down whether you're talking about native
on iOS or android or or or windows phone
or even rim well i'm not going to talk
about the last about about actually you
know where where the app stores or
stores are there's plenty of work going
on there but i'd like to spend today
talking about the first two bits and the
first part is something that i'm not
even going to show you a demo because
there's been so much talk about it in
the industry and there's been so much
improvement that i will actually declare
that for the largest part the first part
of performance is solved and that's
around javascript performance if you
look at when the first android device
launched that was on Qualcomm processor
we were getting JavaScript performance
if you run the SunSpider of benchmark as
an example in the 20 millisecond type of
time frame to run the SunSpider
benchmark three years ago when the first
if you remember the nexus one that had a
1 gigahertz CPU core base SOC also a
Qualcomm processor Snapdragon we
actually had brought that down really
soft a lot of software innovations to
make the JavaScript engine which is
really just a compiler that that uses
the CPU brought that down to about 14
seconds if you look at today some of our
latest processors this is something
called a Snapdragon s4 that's running on
these developer devices that i have here
we are down whether it's in this build
here or the production devices that are
coming out like the HTC One 1s and 1x we
are down to 1.5 1.6 seconds that's a 10
times increase in the in that one
benchmark and you'll see the similar
type of you know increase whether it's
your writing the SunSpider benchmark the
v8 benchmark suite etc so JavaScript
performance is something whether for the
desktop or mobile that the industry the
brow
vendors the ourselves where the second
largest contributor to the v8
benchmarking our v8 JavaScript engine
code we've really tackled and done a
great job at so you know you could
actually now say anything that's not
going to be my performance limitation
anymore so where's the next performance
limitation and really where it is it has
been in the rendering pipeline so of
course iOS has actually a graphics
accelerated rendering pipeline that's
great a windows phone is starting to get
there android is starting to get there
what i'm going to show you is a really
good example of what a difference that
may see in your in your html5
application so Android today has HTA
rendering pipeline in the Android system
for the parts after the browser is done
to actually do GPU accelerated a
rendering and compositing but within the
browser itself if you're actually using
for example the canvas tag it is not
hardware accelerated so you know GPU
accelerated rendering is probably the
second most commonly you misuse term
after platform right you know everyone
wants a platform but so but but this
does make a big difference in
performance so what I'm showing you here
is we have a one of our developer
devices here we call this the MTP it's
not a production device it's actually
pretty fat I just want to make sure that
nobody wants to buy it but it runs our
latest Snapdragon s4 and I have two
builds on these two different devices
one is actually as vanilla Android 4.0
Ice Cream Sandwich as possible you know
from when we got it we have to basically
get it up and running and then
essentially the Android the latest
Android Ice Cream Sandwich codebase
that's optimized by us that we can to
our OEMs so that's a little bit of
example of what you're seeing here what
I have also loaded is I didn't know
about Wi-Fi happening here so we loaded
the local pages all on the SD card but
these are completely unadulterated
websites many of you are probably
familiar with microsoft's IE test-drive
site which has a lot of really cool
almost like you know real world usable
benchmarks here you could look at one of
the things
that happens here is that you're looking
at essentially fit a variety of fish
this is there a fish tank website a test
you're looking at 20 fish and it's kind
of hard to read there so I'll read it
for you here it's 24 25 frames per
second now compare that that's that's
actually canvas that's not hardware
accelerated in the browser compare that
to this one and I was hoping that we
could show you this at the same time so
that's not going to happen but compare
that to this one this is our code that
we where we hardware accelerated the
render path you're seeing it maxing out
at 60 frames per second so here's a good
example of a modification that we've
done essentially into the Android
browser and you know I mentioned this to
you because great you know you'll get
this on Qualcomm based devices that are
shipping so that's cool but you know you
typically what we're doing about six to
nine months later either it's up
streamed into the core code base or some
or it becomes standard into the by the
browser vendors themselves in this case
Google so this is hopefully this whole
talk is to give you a little bit of an
idea of what's available either today or
all the way through to the fall of this
year but you can see that not only do
you get higher frames per second you
actually get smoother running fish and
of course unfortunately with the ELMO
it's a little bit harder to see but I'm
going to try to hold it up here think
i'm good with battery here as well but
hope you can kind of see it and you guys
could come up here afterwards to see how
you know how much difference in
smoothness that is another good example
of this i don't know how many of you are
familiar with GUI mark so let me let me
just show you that as well here again is
the the base system and all on i'll
bring up GUI mark GUI mark 3 is a html5
canvas test and again what you're
looking at here is that with GUI mark
you're actually seeing you know very
good frames per second regardless of
which one which one you're looking at
here but but take a look at the the
gameplay how stuttery it is on the base
system here versus when you have optimum
I html5 canvas look at how much smoother
that is and of course you know this
isn't talk just about you know if you're
a game developer this makes a difference
this is actually makes a difference just
in standard swiping scrolling and that
that kind of functionality so i'm going
to you know hopefully that gives you a
little bit of a view of what a big
difference that that you can make them
so that's one example of how performance
as it relates to the really the last
vector of where html5 applications are
really lacking versus native
applications really around but 2d and 3d
rendering performance and we believe
from qualcomm both with the work that
we're doing here that is going to be in
devices this spring or with essentially
this kind of technique is going to be
used by all the the browser vendors and
on phones that this will become also
again checkbox a non-issue let me show
you something else as well so it's not
just about you know 2d let me give you a
let me talk a little bit about our
experience of what we've had talked
about 3d so what you're looking at here
is WebGL WebGL and this is a this is a
very popular web GL webpage that many of
you have seen it's called the jellyfish
web page from a guy named Alexander very
long Russian sounding name Axelrod or
something I can't say it I apologize and
so a little bit of history here you know
a lot of times everyone says we know
well you know html5 is is fine you know
if you're making lists you know the
you're doing the the App Store app
you're doing I don't know many of you
also probably know that the the weather
app on iOS is all html5 and JavaScript
but you know games night you can't do
games you can't do more complex things
there's always a need to do something
native first of all look at that is
there a need to do something native I
challenge that the reason why I
challenge that is we actually said those
same words not even a year ago when we
kicked off what was then at the time a
project with Sony Ericsson no of course
they're Sony to port the WebGL bindings
from WebKit into Android make sure that
our driver that's sitting underneath his
performance modifications to the binding
and actually that's an open source
project now on on on a github project
that Sony Ericsson and we contribute to
what we found which is really
interesting was that the Native
equivalent of the same application was
yes was ran at higher frames per second
but frankly unless you were a hardcore
gamer you would not notice the different
sprites and things like that so some of
you may be familiar with the Android
benchmark called neo core yo core is
essentially a jaw it written in Java and
OpenGL ES it's something that Qualcomm
did so we have the source code so that's
what what we did was reported near core
over to the essential equivalence
JavaScript as well as the WebGL calls
and when you looked at native neo core
something like 60 frames per second on a
device like this and you had the WebGL
or the web html5 neo core you had
something like 40 frames per second and
every once in a while you'd see a sprite
that's not shaded nearly as nicely but
frankly and for a very very complex game
like application you couldn't tell which
one was running in the browser or not
similar to this I mean we've had people
come up to us at a trade show say oh
that's really cool you got flash running
on your on your system that's not flash
that's actually web geo and so some of
you may know that Sony Ericsson and all
their snapdragon based devices already
include WebGL this has been there from
gingerbread this was the work we did
collaboratively with them and now for
ice cream sandwich android 4.0 we're
incorporating are we releasing WebGL to
our entire customer base so any
Snapdragon based device will have WebGL
support so when you talk about rendering
and and graphics capabilities that's
going to be you know at your hand at
your fingertips it's not just about
using canvas it's what you know you'll
have essentially keep access to the GPU
and this in the exact same rich way
another example of fidelity
I think is the right way to way to say
talk about it is is really the the
access to more you know richer and more
real fonts so you know we've been
limited on the desktop unfortunately too
we've been limited I should say on the
mobile to you know dealing with just
kind of simple fonts that you have
because almost all the mobile browsers
with the exception of Firefox now just
simply don't support rich web fonts or
what's known as wolf web open font
format so you know why for example
should you have this kind of a
experience when you should actually have
instead this kind of a web experience
where you have you know the rich fonts
that you as a website developer or a web
app developer want to portray with your
device now obviously with your content
so obviously to have this versus this
you actually need to of course you know
load in and release your fonts as part
of your web app but now you know you're
going to be able to do that open font
format is something that's actually a
standard in html5 and what you're
looking at here is the same of what I've
just like with WebGL we're incorporating
and releasing the web open font format
engine essentially as part of our
standard Android builds to the OEMs so
that you can have a more rich immersive
Flipboard like experience on on the
devices as well so again trying to you
know our goals have always been around
trying to knock down all the different
performance and type of differences
between native and and native and web in
order to really be able to make html5 a
true platform not just something that's
kind of limited in its own way so a lot
of that was talking about kind of
performance and I would even put the
fonts as a performance issue because
it's really kind of a
issue of you know how how beautiful it
looks how how well it responds response
and again javascript and and rendering
really kind of dominate that but let's
talk a little bit about some of the the
other parts which has really been that
that's been lacking has been around
capabilities so what I mean by
capabilities is you know there are a lot
of things that you can do in a native
app that you just can't do in a web app
historically and I'm i guess i'm happy
to say that for the very first time in
industry forums like w3c there's this is
actually being tackled either you know
working groups that have kind of been
stalled being restarted by companies
like us or others or just new working
groups starting so one really good
example of that is a web audio so i
don't know how many of you are familiar
with web audio so some of you have heard
about this so essentially one of the
things that you see in the HTML audio
tag is that essentially it's more like a
DVD player interface it doesn't really
do much more than that and so what web
audio does is really extend it so that
both so you can have richer audio not
just for game developers but you can you
know for example change pitch and rate
and really have more of a control of
your audio stream hardware accelerated
audio stream just like you would in a
native application itself so this is a
very popular app called Web Audio drum
kit unfortunately it's almost being
washed out there let me you can kind of
see the controls here and I'm going to
go ahead and start it and I think you
can you can kind of hear them
all right I don't know if you can really
hear it here it's such a pretty low well
you gotta take my word for it to come up
here but you can see that essentially
what this is essentially a drum machine
you can looks like this one's this tim
was actually installed right here but
with Web Audio what you could do is have
a more richer access to the audio
streams and now no longer have a play
pause fast-forward rewind seek type of
use case a similar example that's
something that we've been working on is
access to the camera so why is it that
you don't have access to the camera or
camcorder in the same way that you would
for a native application so there is no
html5 camera tag however there is
something in the device API working
group a camera spec API essentially been
stalled for a long time so what we've
done a Qualcomm has gone off and
actually implemented that into our
software builds and release that to our
OEMs and this is something you're going
to start to see in the fall of this year
so i can go ahead and take a picture
hopefully guys can see that just taking
a picture actually know what let me
delete that picture yes took a picture
of you guys may be about that i think i
think that's air so you can see that i
just take a picture this is again all
completely the browser and this is not
using a media capture which actually you
know if many of you know pops out goes
to the native application you take the
picture and pop back in this is in line
embedded within the browser and one of
the nice things about that is because
this actually goes down to the native
camera interface you can have all the
all the funky features that you would
have in the native camera so I can pick
sep sepia again this is where maybe
maybe here how about this I'll turn on
the flash so you could see you guys
could see that turn on the flash if I
take a shutter you just saw that the
flash
again and let me take another picture of
you guys here delete go back inside I
want to spend more time Rhonda on that
but you but the key point being is that
even in areas where there are stalled
kind of specifications you're starting
to see new new moon with movement there
to bring some of the new features that
you typically would not have had in
html5 back into the browser itself so
expect from Qualcomm we're going to be
releasing not only support for things
like camera but also in the very near
future things like web notifications
geofencing as well as even orientation
lock I mean how simple is that that you
know there's some applications if you're
an app developer you don't want
necessarily the browser to be relay out
it yeah lay relay out of your app if you
want it in landscape or portrait mode
right it's actually not just annoying it
actually gets within the within the user
experience flow and so simple things
like orientation lock or things that we
can do to build into the browsing system
that we hand to our OEMs to make your
lives easier and so this ba by this fall
you'll see devices that actually have
that that level of support up and then
finally let me also mention that this
isn't only limited to talking about you
know graphics and and capabilities like
audio and camera video is obviously
pretty important as well so we're doing
a lot to ensure that video works very
well so the Snapdragon systems are the
first systems that actually you can from
the browser have multiple or multi
context hardware accelerated video
playing we actually built this a mock-up
web page again apologize that the limo
is so so poor here you can kind of hear
the sound we are from San Diego so we
have to have surf videos right of course
right but what you're looking at here is
an html5 video
playing actually something else is some
other processes running in the system
fortunately but you can see I could pick
a second html5 video over here is this
carousel running all the different html5
videos there and I can pick one let me
wait for this one to come around here
and this is a second second video there
we go there we go so it comes out and it
replaces the first one so what's going
on here we're looking at is not just
multiple html5 videos playing back but
it's all happening essentially within
the browser where it's actually
accessing the hardware decoders this is
one of the reasons why you can actually
have multiple multiple ones playing this
is pretty important because over time we
know for a fact that a lot of the major
websites are going to actually act add
multiple playback support but further to
that I don't know how many of you are
following the the dash standard it's an
MPEG standard dynamic adaptive streaming
over HTTP it's the first real open
standard for streaming you know to a
client using you know not using flash
not using Adobe's technologies no slam
against Adobe and really it's the sister
spect html5 video for adaptive streaming
and so with dash you'll be able to the
client will be able to pick and and the
application in this case you using
javascript will be able to actually
request different quality video streams
from the server so it's no longer the
server just telling you what what it is
it's actually you're requesting so it's
a client-side implementation furthermore
it's actually adaptive in the sensitive
you can leave it up to the system to
actually request the different bit rates
depending on network condition and
buffer bandwidth but also you can also
in addition to that you can actually
change the bit rate yourself so there's
a working group called media elements if
you could look into you can look into
that itself but dash support with
multiple html5 video will be available
and we'll be rolling out in devices
later this year is
so again not just this you know the the
new capabilities that we're talking
about aren't really only limited to
things like no you know location or
camera etc but also really extend both
to audio and video and so with that let
me just summarize by saying that you
know there's a lot of different things
that the industry is doing to make sure
that to really make the html5 brand i
guess the use of HTML and javascript
programming a reality in mobile you know
a lot of what i'm showing you is
specific to what we're doing at qualcomm
what we release to our or have released
or are releasing right now to our OEMs
so almost everything you're seeing here
will be in devices by the fall you know
essentially there is of course that lag
but really even further to that these
are indicative all these kind of these
demos are really indicative of what is
happening in the industry at large and
where you know all the different
performance and capabilities gaps are
really being kind of plugged to really
make html5 a reality for devices i'm
going to call it mobile or not really
device kind of devices other than your
traditional computer so with that maybe
it open it up for any questions right so
so talk about adoption of things like
camera API is etc so you know our
approach has been to try to push and
pull at the same time you know kind of
need to do both right so we participate
in the w3c to actually get the spec kind
of restarted and participating in this
case for camera in the device working
group as you guys probably know w3c
aspect can be in any working group
there's no rhyme or reason geolocation
has orientation stuff in it right so so
that's one thing second thing we're a
founding member with Facebook and others
of the whole ring mark I don't know if
many of you know about ring mark please
do check it out R&amp;amp;G I oh it's
essentially the goal is to actually
define a set of AP is instead of like
rings ring 012 of compliancy really of
you know this these browsers on these
devices support this level of
functionality so things like camera
might be in ring to little bit further
out
only on Paul com android devices
initially and then later you know you
six months later it's in all Android
devices in six months later it's an
android and blackberry and things like
that in ring 0 so we are actually
working in that area as well but last
but not least you know going back to the
real thing here there's no no different
way to kind of jump start the market
than actually doing the work so we are
actually doing the work to implement the
code and releasing it in our software
builds for OEMs to then ship with so I
clearly that's fragmentation initially
but our goal is not fragmentation the
goal is to actually make it not just a
standard but it adopted across the board
so you know coming from the device side
we actually bring a lot of experience as
to what can the cameras do today and
next year in the scan in the you know in
the in the processors what can the video
decoders do and etc etc etc so we're
tackling it from all three areas w3c
ring mark and the Facebook community
working group as well as actually in our
software builds that go out to our
audience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
