thank you for coming out tonight or this
evening rather to the when Android my
cloud presentation my name is sandeep
note i'm a senior developer evangelist
for salesforce com can be found lurking
at cloudy sun on twitter for those who
were so inclined again want to thank you
all for coming out this evening i know
there's a there's a giants game tonight
so i'm glad you guys chose chose me over
that maybe you just didn't get tickets
for that whatever i'll take it doesn't
matter as long as you're all here so
thanks for coming out also irony alert i
just realized i have javascript books
down there propping up my android
presentation so that just shows you the
right place of javascript in the world
at the bottom of the heap alright no
more JavaScript jobs all right promise
so before i get started this is our
standard legalese disclaimer I'm
required to show it all public
presentations keeps the lawyers up in HQ
happy and there's one thing I've learned
in life it's you want to keep America
lawyers happy right so Stan legal
disclaimer make any purchasing decisions
of our stock on publicly available
information not on any forward-looking
statements I might make today so on to
the topic at hand when Android med cloud
so what I'm going to talk about today is
basically is Android developers why you
know I'm not going to insult your
intelligence and and assume that you
don't know what cloud is everybody has
heard of the term cloud cloud computing
says I a so many many acronyms flying
around but what I want to do today is
really spent time on I'm trying to make
the case why is Android developers we
all should care about the cloud what is
it in it for me as an Android developer
by tricare about the cloud what are some
of the advantages that I can get from
the cloud and specifically I'm going to
focus my attention mostly on enterprise
android apps right so we all know the
consumer world mobiles wall right there
hundreds and thousands of apps that are
focused on the consumer market but I
want to really focus on the enterprise
market them and actually I'm going to
talk about that minute why it's even
worth talking about enterprise mobile
apps because people ask me all the time
is really there's something going on in
the end
mobile world there is actually a lot
going on so I want to focus today's talk
really on how enterprise mobile
applications can leverage the power of
the cloud to really build their
applications with quicker time to market
higher ROI and all the other good stuff
before i get started i mean i already
saw somebody snicker so obviously some
self you got the reference to the
infamous scene from that movie from that
picture but no varies every nothing
about this presentation will be fake
unlike unlike that scene all right so
let's start with i mentioned earlier
that i'm going to focus really on
enterprise android apps in particular
right so you know obviously the first
question i want to address is why why
are we talking about enterprise and not
what everybody in the world seems to
consider or think about when they think
of mobile apps which is true for android
and iOS and pretty much any other
platform well there is no other platform
the world is just ahead word and iOS so
bottom line everybody when they think of
mobile apps android or otherwise things
of consumer apps right we all know them
we you know there are literally hundreds
and thousands of them on the app store
apple app store android app store we all
know what consumer apps is you know
they're there all the gaming apps and
non trivial ones as well obviously but
what's interesting is how the revolution
really the mobile revolution that kind
of started in the consumer world is sort
of bleeding into the enterprise world
right and different analysts have been
given different terms to this trend you
know some you might have heard
consumerization of IT some other
analysts have called you know call it by
different names but it all refers to the
same phenomena which is namely we can't
imagine living our lives our personal
lives without our phones or our tablets
or whatever whatever device of choice
you have right anybody who's on who's
taking a Muni bus knows that we're we're
glued to our mobile phones in our
personal lives right but more and more
in the enterprise IT world the CIOs and
the IT managers are being asked by their
users by their employees is hey I'm used
to getting my data anywhere I want
whenever I want on my mobile device how
come I can't access my enterprise data
from my mobile device right
is what you know I'm the consumer world
has taught us as I said to expect
ubiquiti of data and access anywhere we
are on any device we are you know tablet
mobile or obviously desktop and why
can't that work in the enterprise of all
right and so more and more of the
enterprise decision makers the IT
decision makers are having to address
that question and try and address how do
i make my enterprise data available to
my employees or customers or partners
whatever your use case may be but still
address all the requirements that
typically enterprise mobile apps have
some special requirements that may or
may not always apply the consumer apps
right we probably all know them you know
security is probably number one and the
price mobile apps that's probably the
one booga boo did that people come up
with as an excuse of why your enterprise
data is immobilized Oh security well
alright so security is important
scalability is important reliability is
important right all of these things are
super super critical for enterprise
mobile apps maybe not so much for
consumer apps right but more and more of
people are trying to answer that
question is how do i enable access to my
enterprise data while still meeting all
these enterprise level requirements for
it and there are many statistics out
there that back up that whole
consumerization of IT trend the BYO d
trend somebody some people have called
bring your own device to work trend and
there's you know what this this survey
that we did recently kind of backs it up
forty-six percent of IT managers
surveyed today say they allow your BYOD
basically you bring your own iOS or
Android device and you can access your
enterprise data from it right whatever
some some selected enterprise apps you
can access on those devices but fully
ninety percent of CIOs at least claim
that they will support that by in the
next two years and again another metric
from gardner which again Backes at the
same point mobile is literally number
one and number two on the list on it on
the list of things that CIOs and IT
managers care about the most this year
this is not next year this is not in the
near future it is today the enterprise
ball the mobile the mobile question is
looming large over the enterprise world
so in a nutshell that is why you as an
Android
developer should care about enterprise
mobile apps because frankly that's where
the money is that's where the market is
right so that's why you know that's why
I want to focus really this the stock
and today's evening discussion on
enterprise mobile apps and how they can
specifically use cloud computing
speaking of cloud computing I promise
not to insult your intelligence by
defining trying to explain what cloud
computing is but I did want to do a
quick level set of what i would consider
the three flavors of cloud computing
right there is no right or wrong answer
here is I'm not meaning to imply one
form is better than the other or
different they're all just different
therefore different use cases right and
I'll try you know sort of contrast them
but bottom line you have your you know
at the bottom sort of the stack you have
what's called infrastructure is a
service right is probably heard that
term a lot and those are the vendors
from anywhere from your friendly
neighborhood online bookseller to their
many other is vendors in the world of
course but of course amazon is the most
famous example and these vendors
basically provide virtualized hardware
servers and other other piece of
database etc etc all the all the
physical hardware that you need is
provided to you completely virtualized
over the internet on as I need consume
as much as you need basis right like
your utility bill you pay as much as you
want on a monthly basis and if you want
to ever shut it down you just shut it
down as simple as that it's awesome is
it just is great but on top of that
there is another flavor of cloud
computing called pass
platform-as-a-service right and these
are the vendors and and the platform
that I'm going to actually talk about
more the force com platform that
Salesforce provides is an example of
past however that's not by no means the
only one there are many many others
there is Microsoft Azure this google app
engine just to name one of the two more
better known vendors that provide pass
actually you know stack mob our host
today is would be an example of a
pass/pass provider that provides a an
abstraction layer over just the hardware
so in other words unlike is providers
fast providers provide you some
additional application services for
example a managed software stack on top
of just virtualized CPU
virtualized computing power they provide
an additional level of abstraction so
that you are back burn that much more
productive right and then of course at
the top are the sass this software is
service applications again Salesforce
the CRM were probably best known for our
CRM application all delivered over the
Internet on a need-to-know consume as
much as much as you want monthly
subscription basis there's so many other
examples especially of enterprise apps
that are built and delivered to the SAS
module concur for expenses i use that
myself NetSuite you can run your entire
erp in the cloud with the i stash model
right so those are you know just very
basic definition of the three flavors of
cloud computing now for android
developers specifically for you know for
the topic of today you know for the
purposes of today's discussion SAS
doesn't really play a picture those are
ready-made applications you can access
them from any device any form factor
they're not that relevant we're really
going to focus more on the pass
providers really because i'm going to
try and make the case of y paz using a
pass backend for your mobile app makes a
lot of sense right and and it's it's
it's better to do versus using just a
simple IAS cloud provider as your
back-end so i'm going to try and make
that case alright so with that sort of
basic or white wats cloud computing
those are the basic three sort of
flavors if you will of cloud computing
so to the core question for today is
that mobile as mobile developers android
or iOS whatever mobile development or
html5 whatever you do as mobile
developers why should we care about
cloud and it really gets very simple
just one word time to market is cloud
really enables you to focus on the one
thing that you should ever actually
focus on as a mobile developer which is
your mobile app which is the client
which is the user experience that your
users get from your mobile app right
cloud takes care of the all the stuff
that needs to happen on the back end
right we all know any mobile app
specially an enterprise mobile app is
need some data it needs to source its
data from somewhere right typically it's
from some server or database running
behind your corporate ID firewall right
but with the cloud you don't have to
worry about managing all that hardware
or software that's running in the back
end that's completely delivered by the
cloud right so you got a free to focus
purely on your mobile app
and that's why I believe using a cloud
back-end for your mobile app leads to
wave wave wave faster time-to-market
higher ROI all the attendant benefits
want to break that down a little bit
further exactly so you claim its posture
time to market exactly why is that
faster time to market to use a
cloud-based back-end three basic points0
infrastructure scale and application
services that pass providers provide
specifically so let's quickly by quickly
go through each 10 infrastructure right
this is your traditional enterprise
mobile app architecture doesn't even
have to be necessarily enterprise even
consumer apps usually have some
variation of this architecture right you
have a for-sure mobile app which is
where you know you're right your Android
application but then typically you need
some piece of hardware and a whole stack
to be managed on the back end or in the
server side and typically that's all
done in house behind the ID firewall
right you might need some sink servers
you might need some app servers database
servers load balancers whatever
firewalls the list goes on and on and
all right typically that's the interest
that's the sort of the classic
architecture if you were not using a
cloud-based back end the problem with
that of course is you are stuck with
having to maintain that entire
infrastructure on the back end right
from procuring the servers to racking
them to managing them making sure
they're always up time patching them the
whole the whole you know start to finish
you are responsible for doing all that
which takes away from time you can be
whoops time that you could be spending
on on your Android app right compared
you know contrast that to a cloud-based
back end where it's really very simple
you have your Android device or any
mobile device gets its data from the
cloud right no servers should think
about because that's all managed by the
cloud provider you don't have to
everybody about servers or hardware etc
no capex just kind of you know may not
be as important to developers but for
the money guys in your company that's
really important is since you don't have
to go buy servers and put up data
centers etc there is no capital
expenditure when you're using the cloud
it's all part of your operating expenses
it makes it actually big big difference
when you're doing
that kind of stuff managed hardware
software stack I already talked about
that the past providers specifically not
only give you virtualize hardware but
they give you much more than that they
manage the entire software stack so you
don't have to worry about oh how do I
patch this Linux version that I'm
running on my servers that needs to be
patched with the latest critical
security patch they've got released you
don't have to worry about any of that
the cloud provider takes care of that
and then automatic upgrades mean for
example our platform is upgraded three
times a year just every every four
months we upgrade a platform you don't
have to do a single thing you don't have
to pay anything you don't have to do
anything it just happens overnight and
almost all other cloud providers do
something similar as well so you don't
have to worry about upgrades they just
happen scale so the second point about
why is it quicker time to market when
you use a cloud-based back end it's very
simple the scale that our cloud back-end
gives you is literally unparalleled it
is literally almost impossible for you
to try and recreate the scale that a
cloud-based back-end can give you and
this is just one example of our force
calm platform we did fifty for over
fifty four billion transactions in the
last quarter billion and that's just one
number right amazon has equally
mind-boggling numbers of how many
transactions how many data they have up
in there s3 storage it just
mind-boggling the scale is just
mind-boggling it is almost impossible
maybe start impossible but it takes a
lot of money effort and time and
resources if you were to try and
recreate that scale on your own in your
IT infrastructure if you want to do this
in house that is the whole lot of work
time and energy that you're spending
where you should really be focusing on
your mobile app and your mobile user
experience right and and the last thing
is a mobile developer the last thing you
want to worry about is is will my
back-end scale so let's say I'm really
successful with my mobile app and there
are hundreds if not hundreds of maybe
even millions of mobile devices
connecting to my back-end running my app
the last thing you want to worry about
is will my back and scale to meet that
demand and so with the cloud you don't
ever have to worry about that that just
cloud handles the scale piece up or down
it's pretty much elastic it's pretty
much infinitely elastic really
so application services again you know
you see this picture before this is your
classic three-tier architecture as i
call it for classic in a non cloud-based
backends right now the key point here is
as an Android developer as any mobile
developer you obviously have to write
your client logic you have to build your
app itself obviously but you also have
to spend a fair amount of time a
significant amount of time in some cases
writing logic and code on the server
side to expose data that your mobile app
is going to call out to right typically
this involves some sort of rest or JSON
API or god forbid soap if you really
have to just kidding from you typically
that's a API call that you make from
your mobile device to your back-end to
get data right and so in a classic
architecture you're you're stuck with
having to write code on the back end to
expose that data securely mind you
especially for enterprise that it has to
be secure it has to be scalable it has
to be reliable right that is not an easy
undertaking and as I said as an Android
developer where where do you think you
want to be spending your time i'm
guessing on the front end because that's
your core competency that's what makes
your app unique and stand out in the
marketplace not the back end back end is
just there to support to maintain your
data and support your mobile app you
want to be spending as much time as
possible on the front end and that's
exactly what you get with a cloud-based
back-end right because again it's very
simple you have your client your your
mobile device and all pretty much all
the logic that you need for your app
resides on that device you I and
applauding and then you simply use api's
connect to the cloud over HTTP open
protocols get your data update data
whatever you need to do simple to tier
architecture no no server no code to
write on the server side so specifically
if you were to use a Salesforce back end
which is I'm going to you know we do a
little bit of a deeper dive into the
force com platform that Salesforce has
this is what the architecture would look
like right so just a brief introduction
on force common database calm how many
here have heard of Salesforce I mean the
company our company a couple have you
mostly heard of us in the context of CRM
yes that's fairly common what most lot
of people don't know its sales force
obviously we're we're CRM company were
actually the number one company in the
world in CRM but we also have a platform
of past platform as a service offering
called force calm right so the CRM
application that Salesforce is typically
well more better known for sits on top
of this platform so you want me to think
about this is the world's number one SAS
application by far in terms of usage
users transaction by almost any metric
you care to measure by the CRM
application Salesforce CRM application
is the is the biggest SAS application in
the world that is running on this
platform and so about five or six years
ago this has been a while we actually
opened up that platform to any of our
customers or partners to build any app
that they want it can have nothing to do
with CRM in fact most apps built on a
platform have absolutely nothing to do
with CRM so you can pretty much build
any enterprise business app that you
have in your company on our force calm
pass platform and database calm is just
the underlying database so our platform
obviously the data that you have in our
platform in our cloud platform has to
live in a database and that's what
database did calm is and you can
actually pick one or the other if you
don't care about some of the application
services that force are calm provides
you can just go and buy database calm
and if all you want is store your data
in the cloud you can use database calm
so they're very close where they're
related but slightly different right so
with with with the Salesforce
architecture you have your four calm or
database calm back end either one and
then you have an SDK that we've created
specifically for Android we also have an
SDK for iOS and we have an SDK for
JavaScript html5 development as well but
for today I'm just going to talk about
the android mobile sdk and i'm going to
do a deeper dive into that so on your
android if you're writing an android
mobile app enterprise mobile app
specifically you would use the mobile
sdk to connect to the our cloud back-end
and the hdk will take care of stuff like
authentication and stuff that i'll cover
in more detail well speaking of which
more detail so the sales force as the
mobile sdk i mentioned for android
basically does these following things
its first of all it's all completely
open
source up on github so not only can you
download the SDK itself you can actually
even the binary you can also download
the code and tweak it if you if you need
to so that's that's great and it
supports to do I'll above I get asked
this a lot what versions to be support
so it's pretty much any Android device
really know in the world today which is
great and specifically what it provides
is an OAuth implementation how many here
know what anybody familiar with what a
couple good so for for the rest of the
crowd authors I wouldn't say a newish it
is it's not really that new anymore but
it's relatively newest security protocol
so as opposed to doing username password
authentication which is what more most
mobile at least consumer mobile apps do
earth is a more secure protocol
especially when it comes to mobile
devices because with OAuth by the way
it's an industry standard it's not a
sales force it's not an invention we
were just following a well-known
industry standard Facebook Twitter just
about any company can think of supports
auth including us so basically oh
there's a mobile developer why you
should care is bottom line it's a more
secure way of doing authentication
compared to user name password because
it requires redirects the application
the Android application it says never
gets to see the credentials that the
user enters in to log in and want to
show you in a minute so auth is a much
more much more secure option than
traditional username password and so the
SDK includes and implementation of that
so as a developer you don't have to
worry about that sdk takes care of that
rest api is all the data that you get
from force calm is all west base as i
said rest json the SDK provides by
simple java wrappers for you to access
an api and secure offline database you
can you know especially for enterprise
app that's the way common requirement is
okay what if i'm offline one of my guys
are on the field and they're offline or
if they're AT&amp;amp;T customers in san cisco
which is really one of the same thing so
how does my enterprise app walk so the
the the sdk has a secure storage
basically we use sequel cipher under the
covers to store your data for offline
use okay so i can see some people
getting restless let's enough enough
preamble let's actually get some get our
hands dirty with an actual app so what
i'm going to do is I'm going to show you
a very simple app that
built using the Salesforce mobile sdk
right well the lighting is not the best
but you on the left is the screenshot of
the app which I'm just going to show you
in a minute but before I do that let me
just explain a very simple use case that
I built which is imagine that you're a
field service agent you know like I know
you work for like GE appliances or
something right and you're out in the
field and you're going house to house
fixing whatever you know somebody called
in to say my whatever fridge isn't
working so let's say you're a field
service agent and you need to access the
what we call cases right every time you
call into a 1-800 number or go online to
a website and you know log a case log an
issue that's basically stored in the
industry it's called a case right that's
the name of the of the table if you will
right so this app very simple app all it
does is lets field service agents on
their android app basically check all
the cases that are assigned to them so
they can look all the cases that are
assigned to them while they're on the
field they can click into a case record
see some of the details edited change
the status whatever add a new case
things like that very simple app right
and of course the data the case data
right all the data that that they're
getting on that mobile app that's true
all stored on the force calm backhand
right so that's getting basically using
our REST API is to get that data from
the back end all right so let me just
quickly do a demo of the the app and
since I can't demo from an actual device
I'm fortunately stuck with the with
everybody's favorite emulator the
android emulator since I wanted my
presentation to finish sometime today I
took the liberty of having it booted up
all right so I'm gonna actually the
first thing you will notice when I
kicked on that case management app you
notice how I screw that you notice how
the first time the first thing that it
did the app did was basically threw up
at indication screen which is the
standard salesforce authentication
screen which by the way you there is way
to customize this case you're wondering
for your app you can customize how this
looks like but this is by default this
is what you get and that's something in
my app when I wrote my app I didn't have
to do a write a single line of code to
implement this authentication logic
that's all covered by the SDK is part of
its fourth implementation and I'm going
to cover that in a little bit more
detail but just remember this is the
first time i launched my
app if I haven't launched it before I
will need to attend dicate to Salesforce
for calm so you need to have a valid
user credential basically let's see if I
can dremel I believe that's what I did
let's see my very secure password which
i'm sure you guys didn't see login part
of this is part of what you actually
have to authorize the application as
well i'm not going too much into detail
once you're logged in very simple app if
you're not going to win any prizes for
creativity here but basically what it's
doing is showing you for that logged in
user what are the cases that are
assigned to that user right so if i'm a
field service agent these are the cases
I should be walking on today that's the
case number you see on top and then the
thing in blue that's basically the name
of the account so basically the name of
the customer who filed that case right
very simple so if I click on any one
record I should be taken to some of the
details for that record i can update it
i can create new ones i can go back to
the main list based on book right
classic list detailed view nothing
nothing fancy whatsoever let's go back
and look at some of the some of the
plumbing for that app but before i go to
the android part i want to spend like a
minute or two on actually on the back
end on the fourth con side just to give
you an idea as an Android developer if
you want to use a for calm back and
cloud back-end for your for your for
your server side how what would that
look like what would you need to do so
remember in my case I'm storing my case
data in for calm right that's where that
that list came from this list came from
from my force calm database so this is
me logged into Salesforce I already save
time i've already logged in i'm actually
going to drop into the setup menu here
and this is a furin system at if you're
a system admin in Salesforce not every
user gets to do this if your system
admin that means you can get to get to
this admin view in effect right and you
can do things like setting up your data
model setting up the users etc etc
things that admins typically do now what
I'm going to focus on is this thing
called that schema builder so again as
an Android developer you want to use
let's say you want to use for common
database calm is your back end to store
data what is the first thing you want to
do
your data model right create a data
model what are the tables you need what
are the fields in the table what are the
columns on the tables what are the
relationships between them so the way
you do it in enforce com is with this
nice sort of decorative drag-and-drop
tool which I will need to with my
resolution I will need to shrink down
see if i can find the case that's the
account there there this case let me get
rid of this guy you can see that a
little better so that's very simple to
write its decorative it's all point and
click drag and drop which is nice you
know no Dino DD else to mess with no no
scripts to mess with it's all graphical
this is the case table as I said this is
what I'm pulling from in my mobile app
right and you can see it has a bunch of
columns like any table has you know
account name etc etc it has these
relationships you can see all the you
know one too many many 21 relationships
across your data model that kind of
stuff let me actually show you if you
were to create your own data model I
already obviously have this built up
because my app is already working but if
you were to build your own data model
you can simply again just do all drag
and drop so let's take an example let's
say I wanted to add a parts and labor so
let's say in addition to tracking my
cases I want to track what does what are
the parts i use to fix the machine or
whatever right and how many hours I use
that very simple let's create another
table called parts and labor again
you'll see what is its all you have a
poodle labor parts and labors I don't
know that makes sense but whatever let's
save that and just like that you have a
new table in your database in your cloud
database right you have a new table not
only that you'll notice these audit
fields / system fields you get those out
of the hope you can see them at least
yeah those are things you get out of the
box with for calm right so the platform
takes care of maintaining not only
creating those system feels like created
by who created this record last modified
by a timestamp as well as the user ID
who is the owner of this record all
these sort of system / audit fields are
created automatically for you every time
you create a new table not only that the
data is maintained automatically by the
platform you don't have to do anything
anytime somebody inserts a new record
the platform will automatically target
with the datatype stamp and the user ID
same with modified by so kind of nice
not to have to worry about that versus
traditional tables you sometimes I have
to worry about that stuff right and then
you can drop in all sorts of these are
all the different types of columns
basically in a table we call them feels
this is really the same thing you can
create all these different kinds of
fields on that object in a checkbox
state email you'll notice some of these
are sort of higher level type fields
that you might be used from a
traditional database right so not only
are your traditional text and text area
type of fields but you'll also see some
feels like phone or or currency or even
this very interesting thing called a
formula field which is you can actually
embed Excel like formulas directly at
the database level on force calm right
which again goes to the whole
productivity time-to-market question it
you can of course do this in any
traditional database of course you can
have formulas and all sorts of triggers
and that kind of stuff but typically
that requires coding and that requires
time in for calm that's all
point-and-click config driven right so
so all these fields that you can create
and then you can of course link up your
your tables to you know parts and
Labor's will probably be linked up the
case etc you can also by the way create
triggers on the table so just like a
native database you can create triggers
and do validation rules and other stuff
to maintain data quality all that you
can do in this database but the one
thing I want to actually point out that
is really relevant to mobile developers
specifically is every time that you
create a new table in our back-end you
automatically get so as a mobile
developer you're probably thinking all
right so i have my table and I'll let's
say assume i put some data into that
table somehow so how do i access that
data from my mobile device my android
device right where's the end where's the
api Ardwick at the api and that's where
really it comes up where the sort of the
application services as i mentioned that
a platform is a service provide the
provider like force.com provides this is
what really distinguish a pass offering
from a pure is offering is these little
additional application services so this
is one example where I just added that
cable right now in front of you guys
right and I took
liberty of doing a because I learned
this the hard way today is it takes
forever to type this out so I just
copy-paste it already the point being is
as soon as you add a table in our
database you instantly have an
authenticated rest endpoint for you to
hit in order to get data from that table
out of the box you have don't have to do
anything you don't have to configure
anything you don't have to write a
single line of code it's just there the
platform takes care of creating that
rest endpoint for you to hit so that's
what I wanted to show you with that call
command not sure how readable that is
maybe that's a little better so simple
call command you will see the URI this
is basically the the rest you are I I'm
sure most of you are familiar with the
rest right so this is the rest you are I
that you would hit so I'm giving
examples of parts and labor right that
new table that I just created by the way
the underscore underscore see that's
just a convention every time you create
a table we append the underscore in this
course three to the end that's this just
so you know so you literally this is the
URI you would use you would give the
instance of Salesforce crowd you can see
this is my tab 0 dot salesforce com /
services / data all our api's have
abortion and they're all backwards
compatible so you don't have to ever
worry about backwards compatibility /s
objects and then / whatever a table you
want to access in this case I'm going to
do parts and labor and then remember
this is an authenticated not only is it
https but it's also authenticated very
critical for enterprise mobile apps not
anybody can hit that rest URL a valid
Salesforce user has to be logged in in
order to access that rest endpoint and
that's what do you see this what header
that I'm actually is missing from I have
to scroll all the way right you'll see
this a big piece of what access token
that I've copy pasted in there without
that the rest endpoint wouldn't work if
I hit my curls I should get my JSON
response coming back from cell phone for
calm right now you're seeing this is
actually returning metadata about the
table it's actually not returning data
because for one I don't have any data i
just created that table I haven't input
any data on that table but you can in
fact also query update delete insert all
the simple crud operations you can
perform on your data all the
end points that are automatically
created for you and ready available as
soon as you create a table in Fortune
calm so that's really neat that goes to
the whole productivity time-to-market
reason why it's quicker to develop a
mobile app using like a pass back and
like like for calm okay let me just
since my parts and labor doesn't seem to
have any data let me see if my cases
data might have lets me show you hope
this is all over the place oh well I
want to show you some data from the
cases table that my that my object is
that my android app is pulling from but
we just have to take my word i don't
know what's I think the resolution is
screwed up here all right so enough on
the backend let's go back on our on the
Android side now let's look at the the
the Android app that I built and how i
use the sdk to to build that the
salesforce mobile sdk how i use that and
my android app so if you're interested
in using you know the mobile sdk our
mobile sdk to develop a mobile app and
have for common database calm your
back-end first thing you need to do
obviously it's all on github so you need
to clone the repo and put it into your
local machine step number one obviously
next we need to import the sdk into your
own application your Android application
right in order to be able to use it so
there are actually two different ways
you can do that so this android sdk
project that you see in eclipse that's
me having obviously clone i already
obviously have the sdk bits on my laptop
and i've already imported the salesforce
sdk project that comes with the sdk i've
already imported that into eclipse so
you can see the whole source code for
our sdk right here right so if you want
to do ever if you were really suffering
from insomnia and you want to look at
the source code it's all there but more
importantly how do I so you know the
SDKs they are fine I just want to use it
in my project how do I do that two ways
this is the template app this is the
case management app that I just demoed
this is this app should probably call it
something more more intuitive sorry
about that but basically what I could
have done is I could have gone in here
and linked up the store
if I import the Salesforce SDK as a
project in Eclipse I can go in and
basically link up as a library project
it's created as a library project so
Android developers I'm assuming you know
what I'm talking about if I just go to
Android I can just create a reference to
that STK as a library project I can just
simply select Salesforce SDK right
that's one way to do it I haven't done
it that way what I've done is simply the
SDK also ships in binary format so in
other words we ship a simple jar file
that you can just drop in to your
android project which is what I've done
so I've just dropped them this SDK into
my lips directory and that's how i'm
using the sdk right so one either one
either one will work whatever works for
you and then finally you need to do some
scaffolding once you imported the sdk
into your project you need to do a
little bit of scaffolding let me just
quickly show you I won't cover
everything that you need to do for in
the interest of time but let me just see
if this makes a little better to see so
the one that you do need to do is
implement a class which extends this
base so it's an application class in
Android obviously application is special
significance right so you need to
implement an application class in and
your Android application that extends
this base class that's included is part
of our SDK called for sap okay and as
part of that there are couple of things
you need to override and return to the
SDK but really them the biggest the most
important thing and the only one I will
point out is this method called get main
activity class so if you remember when i
launched my project that it showed me
that login screen right i logged in and
then i showed me in my actual app right
so how did the sdk that whole login
process the whole thought process was
completely taken care of by the sdk as
an Android developer I didn't have to
run a single line of code to do that but
then how does the SDK know after it's
done authenticating with Salesforce what
activity in your app do you want it to
to display right and that's what this
does is and you can see then in my case
I am just basically telling the SDK is
once you are done successfully
authenticating a user just basically
display the tap controller activity
right and that's this activity that
you're seeing this is the two tabs right
you're saying the Home tab and this
other tab that I'll cover later on so
this is that main activity that's how
the SDK knows
once it's done authenticating what class
what activity should display right
that's a simple the couple of other
things we need to do as well you need
for example in your in your manifest
file you need to include a couple of
permissions that the SDK needs let's see
a couple of ones let's say for example
managed accounts you need that because
under the covers SDK uses the account
manager of Android to manage the OAuth
financials so you need to add a couple
of permissions fewer as TK society or
manifest file as well right so that's
the scaffolding that I was talking about
pretty straightforward shouldn't take
you more than like two or three minutes
to do in order you start using the SDK
alright so once you've done all that
let's go over some of the basic
functionality of off of what the SDK
provides starting with the OAuth
authentication so this is really one of
the most critical components of the SDK
because again remember our platform is
really tailored for enterprise apps
right we're not the photo com platform
and sales forces a company is really
meant for to be used by enterprises more
than consumer apps and as I mentioned
earlier security is probably the number
one requirement for any enterprise app
right there are other past platforms out
there obviously but not all of them
provide the enterprise level security
that that that our SDK provides and the
auth implementation is part of that so
what do you need to do in order to
implement what you actually need in your
in your Android app you actually don't
need to do much you simply let me scroll
down here you simply use this this class
called login options which is part of
the SDK this is kind of controls how you
are going to log into force calm right a
couple of parameters I'm not going to go
over I'm not going to go into go into
the weeds there just do things you
should remember though is you need to
pass in something called a callback URL
and something called a client ID now if
you know what you probably know what
those are but if you don't know it's
basically that's how it works is every
app is assigned a unique what's called a
client ID or also known as a consumer ID
in the world and that is something that
Salesforce will assign to your app so
you just simply copy paste that value in
this case you can see I'm basically just
as best practice instead of hard-coding
it in my code I've put it somewhere in
my
in my resources so where think it's
somewhere here yeah so this is my client
ID this is the long string that you have
to copy paste that Salesforce a science
to your app that's all and then the
other thing you need to do is a callback
URL that's something that you select
yourself that's not something Salesforce
of science but those are the two
critical things you need in order to use
the auth piece of the of the SDK right
and after you do that let's get rid of
that you simply call this client manager
class you pass in that login options
that I just showed you and then you
invoke the get rest client method off
that class alright that's that's the
basic interface of using the Salesforce
Mobile SDK client create a new client
manager and get the rest client right
now in order the rest client you it
actually uses an asynchronous design or
a pattern rather you actually have to
pass in a callback instance or a
callback class into the get rest client
call and sales for the SDK rather will
invoke this method authenticated Western
method asynchronously after the user is
done authenticating with Salesforce
right under the covers when you invoke
this method I know the covers the SDK is
going to go start off the OAuth point
the user to that login page get the
credentials make sure they're logged in
blah blah blah all that is abstracted
out for you as a developer you don't
need to worry about that STK takes care
of that but it is asynchronous and it's
important that's important because
remember i'm i'm calling this from my
main UI thread in my activity class
right and as you know in android you
can't make blocking HTTP calls from the
main UI thread so that's why it needs to
be asynchronous and that's why this you
know the sdk implements asynchronous
pattern where you you you basically give
us a call back and we're going to call
that method once the authentication is
done successfully right there is another
way to do a synchronous you can also get
a synchronous stress client but that is
only meant to be used from like a
broadcast receiver or something like
that anything that's not running on the
main UI thread if you're if you're
invoking this from the main UI thread
you need to do this and so once you get
back this rest line this is the main
class that you're going to use from that
point onwards this is the class that
you're going to use to make the rest api
calls to get data or update data of
from 4.com right that is this is the
class that another covers abstracts out
all this this rest URI end point that I
showed you before right where is that
somewhere huh where is my endpoint gone
alright that big end point HTTPS URL all
that is completely abstracted away for
you you don't have to worry about what
is the rest endpoint the rest client
will take care of that right so that's
the basic variable that you need to
store in your class which is what I'm
doing here from that point onwards it's
all authenticated you can start making
rest api calls so the other thing about
OAuth implementation is is the fact that
it actually persists there it's
something called Earth has something
called a refresh token flow if you're
familiar with what you might know what
that is bottom line is basically I
remember me functionality so after a
while what basically gives you an access
token right part of the earth dance as
it's called is getting an access token
that then you can use to make rest api
calls to salesforce at some point that
access token is going to expire you can
control the limit you know one hour two
hours ten hours whatever but at some
point that access token is going to
expire and so if the user tries to go
launcher app after that time period he
might you would think that he would
basically have to login again all over
again but the SDK takes care of that by
implementing what's called the Refresh
token flow under the covers which
basically means it rehydrates the access
token whenever that access token expires
another covers without you knowing it
the SDK rehydrates it from Salesforce
and gets a new valid access token bottom
line as an Android developer that's
probably too much detail but as an
Android developer all you need to know
is once your user successfully logs in
and they can always launch back launch
the app back again so let me go back and
launch the app again I will not be
prompted to do the login again because
the SDK under the covers is maintaining
the valid access token and in making
sure it's always rehydrated etcetera
etcetera right so it's that kind of
remember me functionality which by the
way you can disable if you don't want in
your app okay so that's what n occation
authorization or tons
user authorization so not only do you
need to know especially again for
enterprise apps enterprise mobile apps
this is critical not only do you need to
know who the user is not not only do you
need to authenticate the user you also
need to control what data they are
allowed to see right so this app again
is a classic example of that is you have
let's say service agent one the mobile
one user that I logged in as is seeing a
certain set of cases that are assigned
to that user but if a different field
service agent logs into this app on
their device they should see they should
not be able to see this cases they
should only be able to see the cases
that are assigned to them right so it's
the classic how do you control the data
level access in your database question
and in Salesforce that is all embedded
in the API you don't as a developer you
don't have to write a single line of
code either on the Android side or on
the server side to control that it's all
done on the server side through
configuration we have a really complex
and rich sharing model which lets you
control which rows of data down to the
row level so you can say service agent
one sees these rows of cases or these
records of cases and this service agent
use sees these completely different set
of rows you can even control it down to
the field level or the column level so
in other words you can say here on the
cases this is my cases table right so I
can actually say in the foreshore come
back end that certain set of field
service agents only get to see the I
don't know what's a good example maybe
the escalated field right only a certain
set of users because it's critical for
whatever reason but I want these other
set of users to be able to see that
field you can control it down to the
column level as well as the row level
all in the back end all completely
configuration driven I'm not going to
show you that but just you know take my
word it's not you don't have to write a
single line of code on the server side
it's all point and click and you can
control the sharing model on a very very
fine grained level and as a develop and
Android developer it's great because you
the API respects that right the rest api
respects that user authorization and the
data sharing so here's an example let me
log out of this app which is my lame
icon for log out
sorry about that let me login as mobile
two that's another user I had in this
org and let's see what data that user
sees one two three quickly do that well
that's no good this is another of the I
will actually need my I will actually it
actually emails out a security access
token that I will now need to enter
since I logged out which I probably
should have done I guess sorry about
that guys won't take me more than a
minute there you go by the way you can
control this behavior you can if you
don't if you think this is an overkill
for your app you can get rid of this
extra security layer as well 398 57 all
right I should do it again allow that
and so now I'm seeing a different set of
case theta and I didn't in order to do
this again as an Android developer I
didn't have to write a single line of
code on either on the Android end or on
the server side why because the rest api
the the authorization model is embedded
in the API you just make the API call
and the platform will make sure you only
get back the data that that particular
user is authorized to see all right
that's the bottom line okay so that's
authorization rest api we kind of been
talking about this for a while but so
how do you exactly make a REST API call
from your Android device to get or
update data on the back end so for that
you basically do what you do is let me
show you an example of how i'm getting
the case data in my android app is in
this case I'm be you know one way to
very data from the for sure come back
end is through something that's called
Socko which is basically a subset of
sequel it's very sequel like syntax so
it should look very familiar to you if
you know sequel but it's it's a subset
of sequel and I'm basically doing a
stock will query as we call it to get a
set of case data from the back end so
you can see I'm selecting a couple of
key fields from my case record from the
case table right where certain
conditions are true namely I'm looking
for cases that are still open that have
not been already closed basically right
and I'm ordering by certain order
limiting by five right so that's a stock
aquarium that's the data I'm one from my
photo come back end in order to do that
I simply call this this rest request
object that's part of the SDK for which
you can create an object right there are
different types of a REST API calls you
can make to the force.com platform you
can query data you can update data
insert delete all of those functions
each of them have a different rest api
call here you simply create the
appropriate rest api call using this
method and then simply invoke the send
async method that's going to basically
under the cover is going to make the
rest api called for calm get back the
data and asynchronously again this is
asynchronous once the data comes back
from for calm is going to call this on
success callback method and then it
simply gets back json it just gets back
JSON data and then it's up to you what
you want to do with the JSON data right
so in my case I get back a list of JSON
array of cases and I simply iterate
through that and despair the set of
cases on the on the screen that's what
you're seeing here so that's how you
make rest api colleges is again the sdk
has some a simple wrapper classes you
can do queering updating deleting
inserting whatever data manipulation you
want to do using those simple wrapper
classes secure offline storage right so
I mentioned one of the key requirements
for enterprise mobile apps is can I
store my data on the local device
securely so that's available even if the
user logs is offline right and the key
piece is secure right you can of course
store data on Android and you could use
sequel light whatever the store data but
it's typically not not secure right so
the SDK includes something called a
smart sort function or a component which
basically uses sequel cipher under the
covers to store data on the locally on
the device but it's completely encrypted
so that even if the user loses a device
nobody can get access or hack that data
right so that's one of the key
components of the SDK is this March tour
component and let's see if I want to
test my luck here so I'm not sure about
the actually this should work fine it
was right about the verification code so
you'll notice obviously I you see the 3g
icon right so obviously my my my
emulator is online and connected to the
internet which is why it's able to get
data from Salesforce now what if i hit
my f8 which is kind of a handy way in
the android emulator to sort of simulate
offline behavior so at this point for
all intents and purposes this emulator
is offline no connectivity to the
internet which means it can't get data
from Salesforce or any cloud back-end
right so let me go back out but however
i've implemented offline in this app
which means that the last time i was
online that case record should have been
stored locally on this device using my
spot stored function and i should be
able to access it fingers crossed let's
go back to that app what do you know it
worked so even though
the emulator is completely offline right
I'm able to get access to that data I
can still view all the details about
that case record why because it's stored
securely offline sorry it's secured
stored securely on the mobile device
itself using the SDK all right so real
quickly let me show you some of the code
for how you would do that let's go up
here all the way to here so the smock
store i called you know smart so as I
mentioned that's the sort of the name
we've given to our offline storage
component under the covers as I said it
uses sequel cipher if you if you're
familiar with that it's basically a
encrypted version of C polite right
that's why it's secure so under the
covers that's what the smart store uses
and as a developer what you do is it it
exposes but you actually don't need to
know anything but see polite so actually
you don't in order to store I get data
from this offline database you actually
don't have to do make any any sequel I'd
calls we in fact provide a very high
level abstraction over that a very
simple no sequel ish type interface
where you can basically give any random
JSON to the smart store and it's going
to save it and you can compare v8 and
update it in the leader it's very simple
name value pair based storage right so
that's what it does here what I'm doing
is the the smart store has a concept of
a soup so any related piece of data that
you want to store it's kind of like a
database table but not really but for
the cases of today you can think of that
as a table so what I'm done what I've
done is I've registered a new soup as I
always reminds me of that Seinfeld
episode about the soup nazi but you what
you basically do with you register or
unique you just give it a unique name
that's all you need to do right you
register a new soup with the smart store
SDK and you can also set up some indexes
so in order to speed up the craving of
the data you can actually even specify
indexes so this is actually how I have
indexed you basically have to give the
path in your JSON data how do you want
the SDK what is the path to the index
field right and what type of field is it
that's what this thing is doing here is
I am setting up an index on the ID field
on my case record so that i can create
it really quickly alright so that's
pretty much it you register the soup and
then once you get data you know this
this piece of code gets invoked when i'm
online right you can see this here is my
cat case data method actually makes that
distinction if it's online it gets data
from Salesforce if it's not it gets from
the local DB right so I'm showing you
the the case where I'm actually getting
data from Salesforce and once I get data
back from the server side I basically
just use this absurd to pantries method
to actually store that data in the
secure offline database and then so once
it's there what how do i access it if
I'm offline let me show you that method
here get data from from local database
you simply just there's another method
on on the on the on the database or on
the SDK class called query soup so you
can simply query the soup what is the
name of the sleep you want to query and
pass in a query now there are different
types of queries you can do i'm not
going to go into details this is a very
simple query where i basically saying
get me all cases that you have in your
database simple but you can do much more
complicated queries obviously and that's
where the whole indexing comes into play
if you index it properly it will be
quicker yeah that's a great question the
the SDK itself is read-only so all we do
is store the data in the sequel sequel
cipher database we do not take care of
syncing that up to the back end when the
device comes back online which is a
great question so the sink and hold that
thought after the Q&amp;amp;A I want to address
why we did it that way but that's a
great question but but the short answer
is no we do not do the thinking for you
you need to do that yourself but that's
a great question all right so that's
pretty much it that's how the offline
works you register soups you add data to
the soup you query data from the swoop
and your upline done the great thing is
under the covers it's all secure
encrypted and you can see how easy it is
versus trying to do this with sequel
light or trying to encrypt your data and
then storing it again you can do it I
know people maybe some of you have
already done it in your mobile apps it's
all doable it's just time more time did
you have to spend doing that verse is
working on your app that's why using use
the SDK makes a lot of sense
finally just some some of the
application service as I mentioned you
know black bass platform provides some
additional application services that are
really useful for a mobile developer
unlike infrastructure as a service
provider so one example I want to
quickly give you buyed especially
relevant to mobile developers is
geolocation so what I've done is in my
app here is probably need to be again
offline for my app and since this guy
all right let me login as the other user
because that user could see more cases
than this one Mobile one that's hope
that's not it at demo com3
choice of using the Android emulator
let's see login allow don't ask me for a
verification code please thank you
alright so we're back to that initial
user i was using now here's what i
wanted to show you guys is this other
tab that I have very simple I know it's
trivial but it's kind of makes the point
which is a basically a very simple
geolocation function where I've uses
I've actually used the Google API add on
if you're if you're curious and Android
you get the google maps add-on so I've
used that to basically map out the
current location wherever the mobile
devices that's what this guy is showing
here and then I'm showing any nearby
case records right so if this field
service agent needs to make some house
visits right what are the nearest cases
within a 10-mile radius I've done a
query and I'm displaying there should be
a couple more there it is so I've
randomly geocoded my case case data and
now you can see there these three icons
are showing you the case number that's
the case number right it's a very simple
example of geolocation that may lot of
mobile apps have this requirement now
you can of course do this many different
ways in the mobile device right in your
back-end you can do it in many different
ways here's how I have done it with
force calm is we have a special field
called geolocation in enforce combo
database calm you can I don't know if
you can really read this but this this
guy here you've seen I have created a
column called location on my case table
you know no points for creativity there
but basically I'm all I've done is
create a very simple field it's a
special type of column called
geolocation and that lets me geocode my
data in my database with simple lat and
long coordinates right that's all it
does that location custom column you can
add lat and long coordinates for that
case data right so let me quickly come
out of this and show you that case data
so this is my all the cases in my
database going to just quickly show you
this is I've just randomly picked up
some lat Long's in san Cisco this
actually took me longer than I thought I
had to go through google maps get the
lack long anyway you don't you don't
want to know all any of that bottom line
it's you have a special field
called geolocation in the database that
you can use and you can simply add your
laggin longs to that data that's
geocoding it that's nice but you know
whatever you could have created two
separate columns called lat and long and
done the same thing right what's the big
deal the big deal is on the server on
the client side once you have geocoded
your data on this database in force com
you can do the sock well you remember
how I mentioned so aqwal that's how your
query data stock will has some special
functions geocoding functions that lets
you make queries like give me all case
data within a 10-mile radius of this lat
and long right that's that's where
that's where it's important right and
i'm going to show you quickly nearby
cases activity that's the that's the guy
that gets invoked when I hit this tab
right and in that I wanted to show you
this is the this is the stock will query
this is that rest api call i'm making to
the server side to get back the list of
nearby cases within a 10-mile radius and
this is what you can do with with with
force calm and you can in your sock will
query you can say you have these we have
these special functions called distance
and geolocation again i won't go into
the details babe bottom line this query
is basically saying find me all case
records which are within a ten mile and
you can say mile or kilometers you can
specify the unit of measure and you can
say how much you can say anything less
than or equal to 10 miles of this given
lat and long I'm passing in my current
lat and long and it was going to return
you all the case data back to you right
so that's one one example of application
service that you kind of built into the
platform that you can use as a mobile
developer there are a couple of other
sort of productivity enhancement tools
that the data platform is a service
cloud provider like force.com provides
I'm not going to go into any detail but
you know you can model your data you can
have workflows in the back end you can
have analytics which is really key
especially for enterprise apps you can
actually do lots also reporting on the
back end off your data for your users
right so that's great you get that out
of the box with force calm okay so kind
of wrap up time hopefully I've tried my
best to kind of make the case of why
as a mobile developer specifically an
Android developer why you should care
about a cloud-based back-end right why
why is it faster time-to-market more roi
all you get with a cloud cloud based
back-end and of course I did a deep dive
into force calm specifically because
that's my area of expertise but by no
means is that the only platform is a
service offering out there my point is
you get some most of these benefits some
of these benefits from a lot of the
other cloud providers as well 4-star
calm being one of them right but as a
mobile developer it behooves you to look
at a cloud provider as your back end so
that you can focus all your energy and
time and effort on the front end on your
Android app and making the best it can
be not having to worry about the back
end and it's again specifically no zero
infrastructure nothing to worry about
cloud provider takes care of that scale
it scales up or down hundreds millions
billions of transactions you can run
against this back-end it will scale
elastically and then these application
services some of the stuff that I just
went through things like the geolocation
the fact that you get a rest api out of
the box you don't have to write a single
line of code the offline storage all
that stuff that we just kind of been
through you get all of that which
hopefully makes you more productive
developer that you focus on your Android
app so quickly next steps if you're if
you're interested in if you interested
in what you saw you want to learn more
about the force com a database com
platform specifically all three to join
all you need is a name email address no
credit card none of that required just
given an email address go to this URL
developer of force com /join given an
email address and you will have a
completely free environment to play with
an experiment and test fit for forever
there's no limited there's no trial
period is nothing it's just for it's
yours forever to keep it's a sandbox
test environment really easy to join and
start using and a couple of links as
well if you for you know again
developers com of course but it's also a
pretty detailed article I wrote up about
the mobile st the android mobile sdk so
I kind of skipped over a lot of the
details today because lack of time but
if you want more details about how to
use that SDK in your Android project
there's a there's a pretty detailed
article up on wiki as well
that you can refer all right so with
that thank you all for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
