IT everybody I think right what does
that mean where's that stand for IT
information technology yes
so yeah or other things so so what do we
mean when we say information as you may
know from my other keynotes all I do to
make a keynote as I used my dictionary
because my dictionary has all the
answers my dictionary says information
it's based on the word inform which
means to convey knowledge by a fax and
the purpose of that is to give shape to
the mind and information is just those
facts
that's what information is information
is facts so what's a fact well a fact is
a place where information is stored and
what's great about that is that there's
a place for every piece of information
and facts have operations like get and
set and they may have other operations
and those operations control how facts
can change and the other great thing
about facts is that they're there it's
easy to convey them to convey a fact we
just convey its location how many people
are uncomfortable right now I am this is
not true right this is wrong everything
I just said was wrong dead wrong and you
should be uncomfortable that's not what
facts are right so our facts places well
what's a place again back to the
dictionary a place is a particular
portion of space and space is an
important word we're going to dig into
later
and in particular the part about place
that matters is the fact that it's sort
of delimited right there there is a
specificity to though to the location
named by a place orbit vice versa and we
know about places right we have good
examples of places in our everyday work
and programming right memory addresses
our places disk sectors or places they
have you know addresses and we can go to
them and we can substitute their
contents with other contents and we're
very familiar with this notion of a
place and I think it's quite important
to think about whether or not with these
memory addresses and disk locations
we're actually building information
systems that are about information as we
just defined it in particular we use
memory and we use objects typically
especially at this conference and
mutable objects are nothing more than
abstractions over places their little
abstractions that are over places
especially you know well in particular
mutable objects and they have methods
just like the thing I talked before
about about facts having methods and
objects have methods and this is the
this is the core thing we're building
systems out of and on the other side on
the on the durability side we have the
same kinds of notions we have tables and
documents and records all of which are
places all of which have an update
notion
alright the notion of going to the place
and setting it to be a new value right
these are they these are the
underpinnings from which we build
systems but we were sort of making
abstractions on top of them that don't
hide what they're about and and I have a
word for this act or term for this which
I call plop place oriented programming
which is what this is and you can tell
when it's going on because anytime new
information replaces old information
you're doing place oriented programming
there's a reason we do place oriented
programming because way back in the
early days of computers we had to do
place oriented programming right I saw a
guy still to give a great talk where he
was talking about working you know
building these systems on a computer
that had four killer words of memory and
every piece of memory you knew the
address you knew that the even number
addresses starting at 2000 were used for
a jump table these other addresses over
here were used for data and other parts
of the addresses were used for code and
sometimes they were used for more than
one thing because you knew like right
now no one's using this for code so we
can use it for data and vice versa you
had to do it right there wasn't enough
capacity to do anything else
computer memories were really small
disks were very small everything was
very expensive right so we adopted an
approach to programming that was based
around the manipulation of places it
totally made sense and and the key word
they are in the key aspect of that is it
made sense it used to make sense right
those limitations are gone in the time
that I've been doing programming the
capacity of these two things have
increased a million fold a million fold
what other thing in life you know has
the same facts about it
remain true when the size of something
changes by a million fold imagine if
your car was a million times bigger than
it is what rules would still be would
still apply more characteristics would
still be true almost nothing but yet
we're retaining decisions we made when
things were much much smaller and and
moving forward with them so why does
plop still rule the key question here
when we talk about place oriented
programming we offer in talking about
these two things memory and records
these words had meanings before we had
computers yeah right and we've we've
taken them over we've said you know
memory means addresses in RAM chips and
records mean you know slots in in
database tables
and worse than just taking over these
words because obviously there's a
limitation to the number of words and
the analogies roughly hold right the
analogies between memory and memory in
your head
roughly hold but the problem is we've
now been doing this for so long that we
believe our own myths about what these
things mean but we should go back to the
facts of memory and records right the
fact of memory is that it's an open
system right if your friend gets a new
email address right that doesn't go into
your brain and find your friend's email
address cells and replace his email
address in that part and you know those
neurons in your brain that's not how
brains work
that's not how memory works memory is
essentially an open system and it's an
associative system it is not an address
based system right same thing
record-keeping we used to keep records
before we had computers what did we do
you know we took out the stone tablets
and we chiseled a thing or we took out
the papyrus and we wrote stuff down
right when we had new information what
did we do we did not go and like smooth
over the marble and chisel new stuff we
didn't go to the papyrus and take out
erasers and things like that and people
built accounting systems before there
were computers and they didn't use the
racers either right whether they use
double-entry accounting a ledger based
accounting they only made correcting
entries they did not go back with
erasers that's not the way things worked
before we had computers so this talk is
about values so that's another term we
should define and again we just go back
to the dictionary there's some very
interesting definitions for value right
first is relative worth and relativist
ends up being a very critical aspect of
values right because the next thing is
the one we probably are most familiar
with especially in computers right
because this next definition is the one
that applies to like 42 right it's a
magnitude it's a number it's something
we use to measure something else and
that notion of a value I think is the
one we're most readily able to adapt but
again the bigger notion of value is
about meaning and about comparability
and about relative worth that's the
bigger notion of value right because
because when you measure something you
have to measure it in terms of something
else if there's no absolute measurements
all right so the comparing part is
important so the question right now is
is a string of value how many people
think it us I love doing the answer the
questions we're raising house because
not everybody has hand apparently
everything you'll think about if string
is not a value how many people think it
depends but you always wait for it
depends right it's the best answer just
so you hold out for it right what does
it depend on
is it immutable right if the string is
immutable it's a value if it's not
immutable it's not a value how many
people work in programming languages or
still do where strings were mutable how
people want to go back no we don't like
this and and it ends up that this that
this equality notion of value because
right now we're string doesn't measure
something right it's not a magnitude or
an amount it doesn't correspond to that
definition of value but it ends up that
an immutable string is a comparable
thing and comparability is where we
derive our ability to do logic and to
make decisions right until we can say is
this the same as it was yesterday is it
greater or less than what it was you
know does the string label this thing
correctly a according to my
understanding of it or anything else we
do with information that comparability
inequality test is sort of at the bottom
and that goes back to the other notion
of value so we really don't we really do
not want to go back right so now we want
to sort of talk about values now from
the dictionary definition but it's very
specifically in terms of what we do in
programming and and there are lots of
nuances to this but for the purpose of
this talk given it's a half hour I'm
just going to focus on two values are
immutable
right and values are semantically
transparent it was the purpose of a
value is to expose itself to you so you
can do that comparison and that equality
test my value is not about encapsulating
something and methods and and doing
things I have values about saying
compare me to something else I'm telling
you what my what my what my precise
meaning or significant is significance
is right on the label right on the
outside so the value is about so you
know the reason to give this talk is to
talk about sort of the propositions of
the value propositions of values what
makes values good and originally this
talk was an hour long so and this is
going to go a little bit fast but
there's a bunch of characteristics of
values that are valuable both the first
is that values can be shared right if
you have a value if you have an
immutable thing can you give that to
somebody else and not worry yes you
don't have to worry do they have to
worry about you now because you both now
refer to the same value anybody have to
worry no right
so values can be shared that's very very
valuable values support reproducible
results right if you define a function
in terms of values every time they call
that function with the same values where
you get the same answer yes if you
define a function in terms of places
every time you're in that function where
you get the same answer
no right Penza what's into place right
reproducible results really matter they
allow you to run tests and reproducible
tests so many people running tests now
of places they can't tell you anything
they don't tell you anything they're all
conditional upon your ability to bring
that place back to the same place to the
same value another critical aspect of
values is that they're easy to fabricate
right you can make up a value from
scratch in any programming language
quite readily right can you make a
string in any program yeah can you make
a list of strings sure a list of numbers
yeah a list of a list of numbers yeah a
map of a list of numbers yeah right can
I make an instance of your fancy
interface in any other language no right
it's not easy to fabricate
it's not easy to make programs that
write programs not easy to make programs
that write tests if your if your
programs are not based around values so
the fact that values are easy to
fabricate is important all right values
are language independent right star just
talked about that already right the
notion of a list or a string or a number
or a map this has nothing to do with the
programming language those things I just
said nothing at all right nor any of the
aggregates of those things has nothing
to do with that they're generic right
these ideas that the notions of values
are generic right and I think it's it's
something that we don't think about
often enough in our programming designs
and our systems about the actual costs
of specificity right we love specificity
we use Java every new idea gets a new
class every new thing gets a new thing
right what does that cause to happen you
get this explosion of code just a
tremendous explosion of code objects
were supposed to support reuse that then
the exact opposite thing especially in
typed languages you get very little
reuse because you make a new thing every
time and what is more code mean more
code equals more bugs right away another
interesting thing about values is values
aggregate to values and this is
something I really want you to focus on
right we talked about 42 we talked about
a string we talked about sort of atomic
thing right but a list of immutable
things its itself an immutable thing and
so on and so forth so as you build
aggregates those bigger things are also
values and I think that we tend to stop
we say of course string should be
immutable but in an immutable collection
boom I can't even comprehend it but you
should it has all the same desirable
attributes that that immutable string
that nobody here wanted to program with
mutable strings anymore why do you want
to program with mutable collections
anymore you shouldn't and there's really
important benefits you get from doing
this for instance compare it to objects
if you have an object and you want to
share it what do you
have to do I have to define the object
to find an interface for it and
everything else but then you have to do
what what if it's in a concurrent
environment what do you have to have for
that object so I'm sort of locking
policy right very very difficult thing
in fact a lot of languages don't give
you any resources for defining it well
my it's like there's a snap Caen and on
it we've defined how we're going to use
this object right but if you've done
that and there's also other kinds of
problems like how do you copy it know
what are the cloning semantics whatever
you let's say you've done that work and
you've done that work for every one of
your classes right and now you build
something that's a composite of those
things do you get a lock policy from
combining them no it all falls away you
have to do it all do over again this
composite of all these things for which
I have lock policies now no longer has a
lock box you have to come up with a new
one I have to come up with a new cloning
policy and everything else over again
values aggregate to values all the
benefits apply to aggregates there are
other benefits you get from values and
we see these all the time right values
are easy to convey right if I have some
piece of information I think is useful I
can send you that value and I know I've
communicated to you what I was seeing
right if I see something interesting and
I communicate to you the place where I
saw it what am I actually conveyed to
you
nothing right not the information that's
for sure because you go look at that
place to see something totally different
from what I saw it works the other way
as well right when I want to perceive
something right if it's a value I can
take my time and look at it right
especially if it's a set of values right
if it's a composite thing if I want to
perceive something that's based around
places how do I do that
there's a bunch of places I want to sort
of look at it what do I have to do I
have to stop the world please stop well
I look at these places because otherwise
I'll look at one and as I turn my head
to the other something will have changed
by the time I've sort of perceived the
whole thing I don't know that I had
anything consistent I know that I'm
making a decision based on anything
consistent and this also goes to memory
right how do you remember anything if
you encounter an object during the
course of your program running and you
want to remember it what do you do do
you just store the reference not good
enough right what do you have to do
clone it how do you do that depends
exactly it's a pen okay so the other
thing I want you to do is start thinking
bigger bigger than your box bigger than
your process right because these value
propositions extend to your systems and
in particular values make the best
interfaces now here I don't think we
have any arguments I think we're already
doing this right what do you send around
on the wires
anybody still using CORBA or decom no no
they died for good reasons right we now
use values right we send around JSON or
XML or you know if you have to but both
are both are representations of values
and that allows us to build interfaces
to things that are easy to change on
both ends the other aspect of values
it's very interesting especially in the
large but it's also true in the small
right we talked about how do I perceive
something I have to lock the world down
that applies in a large as well how many
people ever have heard of read
transaction yeah how people like read
transaction know right the whole idea is
is counterintuitive and violates physics
right in physics we just look at each
other we don't have to stop everything
in order to look at things so when we're
programming with values and using values
especially in storage we again have
reduced coordination and another benefit
we get is location flexibility right if
in the small you build a system and the
system is defined in terms of processes
that are communicating values and you
decide you know what that part of the
system I want to rewrite that in a
faster language or I'm going to run it
on a different box is that
straightforward to do if you're using
objects and specific things related to
your programming language if I if I'm
passing Java interfaces is easy for me
to rewrite or let's say Ruby interfaces
is easy for me to write rewrite that in
Java no right right we know we don't do
this in the large right and the large we
don't do this in large we communicate
values but in the small and our
programming language we start doing icky
things and those icky things keep us
from being able to move stuff we can't
move it to another thread we can't move
it to another language we can't move it
to another box but if we're using values
we can that I would call location
flexibility so let's get back to in from
information technology and back to facts
so the first fact about facts is that
facts are values right they're not
they're not places right that slide up
front was a lie
everybody's sitting there saying but
don't facts change right don't we have a
president at one time then we have a new
president no they don't because facts
incorporate time how is that what does
that mean again the dictionary knows
everything because what is fact mean
fact means something that happened
something known to have happened or
existed it comes from Latin and it comes
from a past participle Latin that means
something that happened a fact is
something that happened it's not a place
it's not something you can change right
Bill Clinton was president the fact that
he was president will always be a fact
we can have new presidents that's a new
fact just like you can have new email
addresses right the other thing about
facts is that it's very important when
you consider facts that it's
insufficient for you to consider recent
facts and again we'll go back to the
whole point of information right
information is to inform right so that
people can convey knowledge but
knowledge is derived from facts right
when we when we try to make decisions we
compare times we compare two different
things we combine facts and especially
we use different time points imagine if
you only knew the present value of any
property or attribute in the world how
good would your decision-making
capability be
it would be awful it would be absolutely
terrible and yet we're building systems
that only know the most recent set of
facts I don't know anything else but
we're supposed to be making information
and decision making support systems
right so the bottom line is you cannot
data fact right and the reason why you
can update a fact is because you can't
change the past and that's what facts
are there documentation of the past so
let's go back and sort of revisit what
would it mean to build information
systems that are about information it
would mean that the systems would be
fundamentally about facts there would be
about maintaining facts manipulating
facts right and presenting facts to
users to give them leverage right so
they can make decisions that we think
we're doing this right when we're in
information technology we're thinking
we're building systems that are decision
support systems but we're not using
infrastructure that's fact oriented
right in in the most bottom level notion
before you even get to the temporal
aspect of facts we should certainly be
building systems that are value oriented
now that's not to say the programming
languages shouldn't have process
oriented constructs of course they
should but we don't distinguish them
right if you look at any program it's
going to have sort of - two different
parts right there's going to be the part
of your program that's sort of like a
machine right it's got a loading dock
the stuff comes in you put it on the
conveyor belt and it moves and then it
gets sorted it gets split and some stuff
goes over here and some other stuff goes
over there right all programs have this
aspect of themselves which is process
oriented and it's sort of like a machine
right and we build programming languages
that make allow us to use constructs
that are analogous to little machines
they do stuff the problem is we apply
that technology to everything including
to information and information is not a
little machine it's not at all like a
machine and so you have to separate out
these process constructs and in
particular one of the big takeaways
should be that place right that all of
your constructs related to place have no
role at all
nation model right there artifacts of
the way computers work they have nothing
to do with what your software is
supposed to be accomplishing if your
software is supposed to be accomplishing
information management and decision
support so one of the great things about
this talk is I think you all already
know this right right because we do
decision-making right we know what it
takes to support our own decision making
we're constantly comparing the present
to the past
right we're trying to spot trends we're
trying to see the rate of change we need
to add stuff up that's happened over
time we almost always need a temporal
aspect right so how can I tell you I
know this is true well it's really
straightforward we're programmers we
have stuff to do we have our own little
businesses right we make stuff what do
we make what are we actually what's our
concrete artifact we make source code
right and then we have an Operations
aspect to what we do what do we do we
run our programs and we maintain
information about both these things
let's look at programmer IT let's look
at our own IT systems the ones we build
for ourselves source control is it
updated place how many people use a
directory on the file system for source
control and when you have a new when you
have a new edit to your program you just
put it in the directory you really don't
want to raise your hand no of course not
it's not update in place anybody use a
source control system it doesn't have
dates and times on stuff no of course
not how would we possibly know what we
were doing how could we possibly make
the decisions we need to do to run our
little software business if we didn't
have this information no way okay what
about our operations IT we run our
systems what do we do with our running
systems
we log we log and we would keep track of
everything that's happening right
anybody use an update in place log
anyone use alive it says the last
latency was five yeah
no anybody use a log that doesn't put
timestamps on every entry no of course
not how could we possibly understand
what our systems were doing right if we
didn't have this information how could
we make decisions we know there's no way
no way so we don't do this so big data
it's all connected what is Big Data
I will contend that a certain percentage
of Big Data is this
it's businesses telling programmers that
database you have I like better than the
one you gave me because the one that you
gave me only remembers the last thing I
told it and your database your logs they
know everything that happened in our
business you know everything you have
times for everything let's go mine at
find find some good business
decision-making information because my
database it doesn't have it it doesn't
run the last it doesn't remember
anything other than the last thing right
the logs have all the information the
logs have the timestamps but I think
it's really sort of a shame here because
we're being reactive in this area right
mining logs we know much better ways to
represent information we know how to
store information in ways that's
leverageable right logs are not that
MapReduce over logs or not that logs are
full of crap to write the full of stuff
about the program operation itself there
is business value information in there
we haven't built databases to store that
yeah but that's our that's sort of our
fault so I think we're moving into what
I would like to call the Space Age right
one more definition space the unlimited
expansion in which all things are
located in all events occur what's
really interesting about the definition
of space is that it has always if you go
back to the oldest definitions in the
oldest languages the definition of space
has always incorporated both place and
time
never been something that applied only
to one or the other of those two things
it's always connected to two and there's
a certain physics aspect to that so if
nu never fails if you can call new day
after day 24/7 over and over and over
again you are not running in a place
you're running in space you're not
seeing the edges of things you're not
delimited you need new stuff you get it
right if s3 never fills up that's not
the cloud that's space right if every
time you want to put a file on s3 it
says sure are you worried about the edge
of of it most of the times we don't
worry about the edge of space I mean
maybe you do it I don't so information
systems should have a different approach
they should say that new facts require
new space right this should be the end
of place oriented programming we've had
the facilities to do this for a very
long time right if you could afford to
do this why would you do anything else
anybody feel like I wish I could log but
I can my disk is only five megabytes
everybody anybody ever have a five
megabyte this cost thousands of dollars
yeah it's not that's not that's not that
way anymore right right so you can't
afford to do this okay
lots of interesting things will happen
when you take this approach a lot of the
things that happen in memory with
garbage collection are going to happen
with storage right there will be garbage
but that's okay right these are things
that we're learning about how to manage
so to summarize unfortunately I think we
continue to use place oriented
programming and the rationale is gone
and the sadder thing is we continue to
make new things that are like this
brand-new programming languages and
brand-new databases right that still
take this approach still use a place
orientation that's been invalid for at
least a decade but certainly for the
last five years
right the rationale is gone
we're missing out on all those benefits
I listed before and I could talk to you
about any one of those benefits for an
hour there's a huge number of benefits
to using values we recognize them right
look at our information systems for that
we use for ourselves we're proving we
already know this right we are overwrite
our logs we don't overwrite our source
control we're already we're in the space
age for ourselves but we need to be in
the space age for the businesses we're
supporting right there's definitely
demand for this this whole big data push
and mining logs and everything else and
tracking everything and keeping the time
of everything businesses know this
tremendous value here they want it the
demand is quite obvious we have the
resources to do it and I think that the
challenge is to make sure that we do and
what I would recommend is that you try
to take an information oriented approach
so the way you build your programs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
