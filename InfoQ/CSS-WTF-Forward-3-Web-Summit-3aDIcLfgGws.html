awesome you can't even fit into a box i
actually discovered this is a this is
fairly hard to write i had to give it a
width i had to you know give it a whiff
normally you don't give it a with you
just let things be as big as they are or
you can write you know display inline
block and you're golden hopefully yeah
works right so let's not making fun of
CSS and then let's learn new and better
reasons to make fun of CSS but first i
want to show you some really good
features who here has ever complained
that you can't align in CSS okay this is
a line center there's too much text so
i'm going to just shrink up the screen
so you see it's centered no matter what
font size i have it centered it was two
lines display flex a line items center
if i change the text to shorter it's
still centered and I could have made it
I could have stretched it to the whole
container or I could have brought down
to the bottom we could do this anyway
there were like 100 different hacks to
do this without flexbox but now that was
complain to me about centering another
thing with flexbox is that you can align
baseline which is aligning on the first
line of content so here you'll see the
h1n eh5 and my mouth is nowhere to be
fine found that i will i would make this
a little bit bigger so you can see the
code the h1 the h5 are perfectly aligned
which they should be you can't really
tell a difference but if i add a margin
top of a hundred pixels to h5 the h1
drops down because i am aligning those
items on baseline and you can do that
with CSS that would be a wonderfully
terrific feature this feature has been
in the spec since 1999
and you've never used it because of ie7
but it has been supported since ie8 when
did I yay come out anyone know a long
time ago so why aren't you using it so
I'm counting the paragraphs if you
notice in the entire deck I have a
little five right here in the previous
page I had a four in the next I have a
six I'm counting i'm using a counter
because i keep adding slides taking
slides away and i don't want to keep
writing that counter i'm using CSS to
count my deck not JavaScript what do i
do I say bought body on on the body
reset my counter and then on normally
it's each slide but for this slide
itself I did it on a paragraph so you
could see that this is generated content
on the cat on the slide or on the
paragraph increment it and then write
write it with generated content so if I
want to just show you that it's actually
live i'm just going to write that and
you saw that i added a space and if I
want to I can just put a little dash and
that is generated counted count tent and
that is the browser that is counting for
me using CSS so that's a wonderfully
terrific feature but another feature
that you can do is count your errors on
a page I have a form and it says that i
want three numbers that are between 5-6
that are either five six or seven and
then i have an email so one of them
right now is invalid because it's
required but i can make more of them
invalid and the counter just went up
remember there's no javascript on this
page nine hello i now have four invalid
entries because that's not an email
let's make it an email that's close
enough to an email three invalid entries
I bring it down I bring this down and
then I enter something there and I now
have zero and valid entries this is
using the same counter and using the
invalid CSS pseudo class
a wonderfully terrific feature you
should be using all of these are
wonderfully terrific features you should
be using they are pseudo classes now
based on html5 web forms which are
pretty well supported at this point but
even if they're not you can still use
the attribute of whether disabled as
present or whether checked is present or
a neat trick I learned yesterday is to
actually include attribute selectors
based on aria because if you include in
your CSS if you target your elements
based on your REO or on your
accessibility features you will remember
to put in your accessibility features so
I highly recommend this little trick
that I learned from Leone Watson
yesterday of styling your CSS not just
on CSS pseudo classes but on the
attribute selector using your
accessibility features so the bane of
the every react developer that believes
that CSS is dead is they don't
understand specificity specificity is
actually fairly simple if you have an
element selector herb pseudo element the
weight is 0 0 1 if you have a class
attribute of pseudo class an attribute
selector the weight is 0 1 0 no matter
how many element selectors a single
class weight will overwrite no matter
how many a moment selectors you have an
ID is has a lot of ways it's 100 so
it'll overwrite any of your class
selectors no matter how many you have
for a pseudo class so the people who are
saying CSS is dead is they're basically
saying because its global yes this is
supposed to be global right you want
your site to look the same on every
document so that whole argument just
makes me a little bit angry and that's
an understatement now I'm going to make
myself happier by doing one of these and
I don't think I got that side of the
audience I don't have enough strength
for you guys for you people up there I'm
sorry I mean I do have enough strength I
can lift weights enough but not aim well
enough okay so in terms of understanding
specificity I've explained it a little
bit most important thing is the Cascade
if you write one line with the same
wait as another line and they have the
same property the value that comes later
will overwrite what people don't realize
is that the Combinator's of greater than
which is this child selector the Tildy
which is the adjacent siblings the
general sibling selector or the plus
which is the adjacent sibling selector
have no weight so the second lines on
each of these will overwrite the
previous lines because they're the same
way if you have the same attribute and
different same property with different
values and then the other thing people
don't know is that not the best selector
there is which says select anything
except with the you know except pull out
these the knowledge has no wait so the
Li that you passed as a parameter is the
same weight as just doing it in li so
these two have the same way the first to
have the same way these two have the
same way these two have the same way and
these two have the same way the knot is
basically ignored in terms of weight but
the whatever you put inside the knot
whatever you pass through there is is
the way if you have any questions about
specificity I wrote specificity and you
can just download it it's a little cheat
sheet and it is opinionated in the fact
that a shark is the ID selector and I
don't know if I can go down on this page
let's see I only use CSS no I actually
didn't code it correctly so that's
probably why so here it is I use the BP
oil tanker because inline CSS which is
what react is suggesting and the anti
CSS movement that is for the browser to
do for you and generally don't put
inline styles change your class put all
of your CSS into your style sheets and
just do a class switch it's much easier
to maintain some people think that
inline CSS is easier to maintain because
it's such a behemoth I was working on an
app that had seventy thousand lines of
JavaScript and a hundred and seven lines
of CSS which one do you think is more
difficult to maintain and of course
important is the nuclear bomb option and
I'll cover that in a little bit so
here's that
clear bomb option which is the important
I want it to be aligned through but I
can't no matter what selectors I put in
front of here you know oops Bobby it's
never going to happen I could go on with
classes and ID's so instead of using
important a little wonderfully terrific
feature is using the same class name
multiple times this one right here where
it says dot disabled disabled disabled
it checks to see if an element has a
class of disabled it does so it matches
the first selector then it checks to see
if it has a class of disabled it does so
it maps just a second part of it and
checks to see if it has the class of
disabled so matches it again you only
need to put disabled once on your
element of the class disabled once but
you can put an any number of times so
I'm giving it a specificity of 030 so in
the end if I do this because I really
really want it or you know I can
overwrite that important because it to
me it's important but it's not I don't
want my third party widgets to fail
because I gave a class name to something
so you can't overwrite important right
so why is this text read I did say white
is important because right now as in the
implementation of animation animation
properties overbite important that is
not actually in the spec but it's a
little hack that we can use until they
either fix browsers or change the spec
and then always use it forever so here I
said keyframes read hun percent color is
red and I did read and then forwards and
what forward means is at the Hun percent
mark stay there until you remove the
animation name so if I actually change
the animation to X right it's going to
stop but then if I say oh this is chrome
so let's just change it to green or
something I don't know color that's
going to be and if I change it to X it
became green
because it goes directly 100% keyframe
so here I used animations and there's
zero iterations because the default is
zero it's and it no the default is one
iteration the time is zero so it's a
zero second animation so it just goes
directly to to green and if you ever
have a third-party widget like your your
pluck point in someone's code and they
use an important one I would find a
different vendor for your widget but if
you can't do that you can overwrite
their code using a animation okay few
animation quirks important is ignored in
the keyframe so if I had put in my key
from animation if I had said red
important it never would have worked and
it's ignored for right now in the
original values when you give an
animation name like that read that i
called it that's a bad animation name
because its presentational instead of
what it's actually doing it should have
been change color important or something
like that it is an identifier and
identify should not be quoted if you
quote your animation name it's a WTF it
might fail in some browsers animations
are applied in the order they're
declared so the last animation takes
precedence over the other ones if you're
animating the same property in more than
one animation if you do not include the
zero-percent or the hundred-percent
keyframe the browser actually renders
that for you so if I had said fifty
percent red and I done a three second
animation it would've gone from white to
red to white because it actually
interpolates the original and the final
values for the 01 percent you can
animation iteration count by default is
one but you can do an animation you can
do zero animation iterations and you'll
still get the animation start in an
animation end event and it will still
work on forwards and on backwards and
you can do it point 25 you can do one
quarter of an animation it will go one
fourth of the way through approximately
animation start an animation end our
throne whenever you attach an animation
to an element so if you attach three
animations you're going to get three
animation starts and three animation
ends the animation iterations that
you're going to get depends
it happens after every full cycle of the
animation when you hit one hundred
percent mark but only that hundred
percent mark is not at the same time as
the animation end so you might get fewer
animation iterations you might get one
fewer than you actually have and then
there's this weird thing called most
people know the cubic Bezier functions
but I'm going to cover the step
functions the step function is basically
what you need to use if you're using
animations and you want to animate a
sprite to do a little character like the
little bicyclist that is not an animated
gif that is CSS animations so what I did
is I just moved I had a sprite that
looks like this right here and I moved
it the background position so I'm only
showing part of the animation to make it
a little smaller so I'm only showing a
part of that sprite in steps so here I
said four steps end so breaking the
animation into four parts i'm going to
show for parts of it now i can show 0 25
50 and 75 percent which is for parts or
i can show 25 50 75 percent and a
hundred which is also for parts one of
those either the 0 or the one hundred
percent i will not show if i'm using
steps and that is the second parameter
in this case its end i'm not showing the
hunted and i'd like to think of it as
which one I am not showing so if i write
end i'm not showing the one hundred
percent if i'm showing start I'm not
showing this that's the zero-percent
because I don't want to show this
because if I do that you see how it's
flickering now that makes it look more
like an animated gif right but that's
not what I want so that's the step
function now if you another CSS WTF is
using the cubic Bezier function in this
example here I say width goes from 500
pixels to 100 pixels and yet the red
lines are at the 100 500 pixel mark my
animation here goes below 100 it goes
forty percent mark and it goes above
over there goes about 750 because I've
used this wildly crazy cubic Bezier that
is outside of the zero in one range if I
do and I just have to detach and
reattach if I stay in that range it'll
stay within its bounds but the second I
go out of range it'll bounce if the
second I go above one or is it below
zero it'll actually pop out so that's a
little feature that you can use to
actually make things bounce beyond the
bounds of what you want if you want to
do some crazy animations so this is the
slide that is actually using code pen
it's the only slide that has javascript
in it and the reason I'm showing it to
you is because I wanted to show you a
little feature in in in in animations
that most people don't know which is you
can change the keyframe animations
during an animation if you change the
animation like on the fly in when it's
WebKit prefixed it will not change the
animation so I'm going to change the
animation a few times just by clicking
this button and then I'm going to remove
the animation and then I'm going to
reattach it and I actually changed the
animation on the fly well the only thing
was doing was going up and down so i
added different points so let's show you
a little bit of the code for this here
it is and there's nothing like showing
tiny stuff so let's just show you the
JavaScript and and show you here and
then
I've used three functions and where they
find rule and basically I find the
selector so I had a 0% a ten percent of
twenty percent all the way up to one
hundred percent I can find the animation
and return it and here I appended the
rule so at the end I'm adding a rule
that says selector percent and then I
did some variables so basically I'm
changing the timing function in this
line that's just return this here and
put a little plus and that should work
just as well so let's show it to you in
Firefox so you can see the difference
oops wrong control nope there we go so
here it is in firefox and i'm just going
to one remove paused I didn't want to
frame my battery and there it goes and
then I'm just going to click this a few
times and I didn't have to remove it so
that's to show the difference between
Firefox and Chrome but the rules that
you're looking for let's go back to the
talk that is not the browser and I hope
I did not did I kill my browser I did
not could tell you okay there we go so
it's delete rule append rule and find
rule and it's done on the animation okay
so a little bit more about animations
things you should not do but you can do
SVG and an animated SVG as a background
image SVG's are awesome don't use them
to make things hideous like this the
hideousness is one of the things a
hideous CSS is what I like to do SVG
rocks because it's a it's basically what
you can put it wherever you put an image
it's animatable the media query if you
use a media query and I'll cover this in
a little bit it is actually the viewport
is the container of the SVG it is not
the viewport of your browser so you can
use
and I'm going to show you a trick to as
a picture or source set polyfill you can
pull in raster images you can do it as a
data URI so you don't have to pull in an
extra HTTP request and you can use it
for masking so before I hit all those
features I want to do one other feature
which is completely out of place and I
don't know why it's here in my deck but
i'll cover because it is in CSS shapes
so here we have a picture of adam
sonntag because you always have to have
a picture of adam sonntag or kittens or
unicorns you can choose and I just
changed the shape and you can't really
tell but let me just pee color red ok so
you can't really see the text though you
could you can't see it here you can see
it up there so I've change the text and
you can see it's kind of round but that
looks ugly so I'm actually going to
change the shape of the image and have
it not work oh I just made it obvious
thing sorry please work no don't work
there we go okay so for some reason the
circle didn't work I don't know why but
the ellipse did and here i didn't use
border border radius I actually clip the
image to look like an ellipse and I
could have done it to look like a circle
let's hope this works and let's get rid
of this and it didn't well we can still
go on let's do triangles so here the
text is in the shape of a triangle and
now I keep hitting on thing I think it's
when I cut and paste that's not working
so let's do this there we go poor poor
thing okay so what I did there it says
shape outside polygon and I actually
gave it the coordinates and then I clip
the path to the exact same coordinates
so that's kind of fun but you can
actually do really really cool stuff
with it and here I'm going to make it
much smaller but I did polygon and I
gave it all sorts of values and I'm
going to just make it so it fits all on
the screen you want people to read the
code anymore but you see how nicely it
goes right around my character that's
because I that's the polygon shape i did
gave it so how did i give it the
polygonal shape i used a tool and this
tool probably contains javascript but i
will open up anyways oops
control shift I there we go so under
when i click on the element and i click
on this image and i'm going to open a
new page because this is actually gonna
work better here and i go to elements
and I go to shapes and I try it again
here there it is so I can actually
change and drag out the shape live I
didn't actually I just like this is
never going to work but this is an
extension called CSS shapes editor not
hard to remember but super cool so let's
get rid of this one screen and go back
to the talk so that is a shapes let's
close this out and let's make this slide
deck legible again okay so when I was
talking about SVG taking as its viewport
the you know the media query the
viewport is actually the container here
i have this clown and it is only one
HTTP request the only HTTP request for
this clown is the clown image i have an
SVG in this document and when I have a
really big when I shrink it it actually
bring gets another HTTP you for the new
image but I only pulled in one image
originally so this is one way of doing
it and this is background size auto and
so this is a responsive image whatever
size that container is it gives me the
biggest image that it can fit into that
container I can also do it so it takes
up the whole screen these are the same
images but as I shrink the container it
pulls in the different image apparently
i opened up my email client and is
telling me that I need to verify my
password which i'm not going to do at
the moment so how did i do this let's
bring up the code
so you can see it so here I I put this
into a data URI but I decided not to
show your data URI because that would be
eligible but this is what the data URI
reads the data URI reads give me an SVG
and preserve the aspect ratio in the SVG
I want the background image to not be
repeated and to have the background size
of auto the difference between those two
that I showed you is one is auto and one
was cover auto is better because of
performance when you use cover or
contain you have to actually decode the
image two to three times which takes up
a lot more CPU and takes a lot longer so
I prefer auto because it uses the
default size then I said media screen
and max width 300 pixels use the small
image media screen men with 301 to 600
use the medium image that media of 300
pixels or 600 pixels is not the actual
window of the of the browser which you
saw because I was able to change the
image it is the viewport of the object
in which it is found and so that's how
you can do foreground responsive images
right now until picture and source set
are supporting so another good use of
SVG is masking in this case though I
used PNG but i'll show you how you can
save a ton of bandwidth if you need to
use a transparent PNG but you don't want
to use the bandwidth of a transparent
PNG PNG so here is the effect i wanted i
wanted to have this little frame with a
lot of detail but i want the middle of
it to be transparent so i would need to
use a transparent PNG problem with that
transparent PNG is it's half a meg so
instead i can use a jpeg that's 88
kilobytes and in this case i used a mask
that is 4 kilobytes but that's the PNG
but i could have also used in SVG and i
say this is the part of this image that
i actually want to mask and to show and
so I created this
so in the next slide I'm actually going
to show it to you in action and there's
a typo in here and so it's not going to
work but I can't remember what it is so
let's try oh yeah the kittens don't work
I push this to production but I'm not
finding it no let's try it to left oh I
know what it is
didn't work because I'm live but anyway
what would have happened is there would
have been a gradient right in the middle
of that box because that is a JPEG the
iphone pick the picture of the old
iphone is a jpeg and the center is white
it's the white background of a jpeg and
by using a mask and I don't know why
it's not working because of my luck
instead of using a PNG that's 133
kilobytes I was using a 20.8 kilobyte
jpg and a mask of 0 point 3 ok next
thing I want to cover its material
design these are icons that come from
from material design at Google and they
have six airplane people sitting in
airplane reclining showing leg room that
is why you want a diverse team because
most people that is not their major
concern they have other concerns that
are not addressed in there in the icons
but if you are actually showing the
reclining space on an airplane you are
covered with this deck so here are some
of the images so how do you use them you
give them a bunch of properties and the
important ones are to use ligature
because let's just get rid of a few
lines here all I had to do is write face
and I got a picture of that face so what
exactly does that mean I'm going to show
you a better example I'm here I have
generated content and I have the word
accessibility so here I have the word
accessibility and I have the word
accessibility up here but if I had
written face I would have gotten a face
generated content using their icon fonts
and this doesn't work in ie8 ie8 will
just render face however that right
there using the escape character works
in IE eight so you can actually use this
generated font or this this font icons
in and just to prove to you that they're
live i'm going to pick a letter that's
not actually going to work there we go
it did work
okay so i did five stripes let's just
test our luck so you see just by
changing the either the word
accessibility here and that refers to
this one or the generated content which
is red and comes right afterwards using
this or the actual world so fault
ligatures have you ever seen like the FF
where the f is touching the other F in
the middle of the lines those are font
ligatures that's a that's a ligature
font where your fonts come together so
here that basically said the word
accessibility let's take the a in the
scene they're not really using the
letters they're basically saying when
you put that letter combination this is
what it should look like just when you
put the combination of the FF that is
what it should look like so the code is
right here but if we get rid of this and
make it smaller you'll see that all you
really have to do is pull in the
material icons and the CSS will come
with it okay we covered this one if you
are going to use fonts online use fonts
squirrel and use the subset of
characters that you need so in here
there's no time or so if someone can
tell me when that's about five minutes
left i'll be awesome let's just open up
in his own window and close this out and
make it bigger and go down the page so
i'm going to use the expert because I'm
anything but and then I'm going to go to
custom sub setting and then i'm going to
put right here single character
ampersand and when i actually asked font
squirrel for the font file it will just
give me the character that I need so who
here has had a go graphic design or ask
them to just use a different font for
three letters because they like those
letters the way they appear you can do
that and do use it
but there's another thing you can do
again with Google and I don't work for
Google and likely never will um is I can
just tell it I only want these
characters now you shouldn't do that
because that is the ugliest paragraph
you have ever seen but every vowel is
rum raisin so you can actually tell
Google don't import the entire file only
import this subset so you spawn squirrel
if it's your own font if you're using
google or you know a different font
service see if they can enable you to
minimize the size of your font file okay
this is a way to use CSS as moderniser
who here is use moderniser who here is
used modernize or I mean CSS instead of
moderniser to detect so here I'm saying
does the support of flex if it does then
I know I'm in a browser that supports
display flex I could use this to test
whether I'm in Mozilla browser that did
not work mom's appearance none did not
work WebKit appearance gone did i just
you a test in CSS i did and that is a
WTF okay so how do i do this entire
slide deck as you've been noticing i
said there was no javascript in this
deck and i am editing CSS on the fly and
it is working so here i don't like pink
I like Rebecca purple it's not working
today because I felt her name wrong so
let's just go with slate blue yeah there
we go that's a pretty color so what did
I do I just changed the font the color
there and it went live I displayed my
head block
I haven't given on a t-shirt well okay
someone down here here we go um I
displayed my head block hit everything
in the head except for the last style
sheet and then on that last style sheet
I put content editable and I put a
WebKit user modify colon plain text read
write only or read write only plaintiff
something like that so what does that do
contenteditable supported since at least
I a 5.5 possibly earlier allows you to
update to edit the contents of a dom
node and it actually updates the dom so
when you use generated content you're
not actually touching the Dom but when
use content editable you are touching
the Dom if I were to say what is the
content what is the innerhtml of that
element I would get this text or if I
didn't enter text so I'm displaying it
block so that I can see it content
editable so i can write to it and a
WebKit user modify we read write plain
text only so i can cut and paste into it
which you saw me try to do and that
failed miserably because I probably
forgot to put it on the deck so that's
that feature so it is here it is
readwrite play text only is what I used
and so let's test it out I'm going to
cut it and I'm going to paste it yeah it
worked so that means that WebKit user
modify is working I could have used lost
user modify and eventually maybe one day
I'll be able to use user modify WebKit
prefix has been supported for 56 years
I've been doing this for five or six
years I don't know why it's not and then
there was one other feature which I was
afraid that I wasn't going to cover so
it's right here and I can use it right
here as an example so here
let's unpause it when it goes above that
button I can't click on it so now if the
wait till goes back up but you'll see
that I can't click on it the animation
is still the same it hasn't changed oh
it did change I must have clicked on it
afterwards so if I do pointer events
none whether when you show an example
and it doesn't do what you wanted to do
it doesn't fail the way you wanted to
fail pointer events none makes an
element basically you can you can just
write right through it and oh the reason
that I was able to hit the button is
because the button actually comes later
in the code i guess but pointer events
none allows you basically to go right
through when you click on something to
go right through that element to the
element behind it so you don't want to
put this on a modal unless you really
want to piss people off and then you
could put a modal and just take click on
anything you want and you don't know
where you're going because you can't see
it and yeah that would be really good
usability an April Fool's joke if anyone
doesn't have enough ideas for April
first just gave you 10 another actual
good one for April first is a hover
transition 0 seconds space 2 seconds so
every single change that you have just
waits two seconds before it happens
that'll piss people off ok luckily I'm
not allowed near production how did I do
this deck I translated it scaled it and
rotating it 180 degrees that is why you
see it up in the upper right-hand corner
that is the next slide that is kind of
tell me what I'm going to talk about
next except for I have not looked at
that slide the entire time which is why
it was disorganized and then when the
slide comes after comes immediately
after a label that comes immediately
after inputs box that is checked I
translated 20 scale it to one and rotate
it 0 degrees and then the slide
is not checked that comes immediately
afterwards is actually this one right
here the other ones translated one
hundred percent and this one is
translated 45 degrees so I'm just going
to reload this deck and I'm going to go
back one slide because I actually put in
a little cheat sheet for myself just in
case anything goes wrong I have all the
checkboxes and all the labels right here
and we were on CSS only slide deck and I
just went right back to that slide so
then I could hit another slide and say
thank you so that's it but if you want
any of the resources there on my last
slide so thank you very much oh wait I
have more t-shirts
