we're going to talk about tonight may
bear a striking resemblance to what we
talked about at that conference that
resemblance is merely coincidence of
course this wouldn't be the same content
that would be tacky but tonight we're
going to talk about a couple of
different things we're going to talk
about ice cream sandwich android 40
which was released and is available on
the android site right now and some
devices were launched in some countries
since then and we're going to talk about
stuff stuff and we're going to talk
about stuff i forgot with the second
part of the presentation is a death with
them show remember when i see the slides
graphics &amp;amp; goo ease and animation is
usually what we talked about so there's
a good chance for you may talk about it
tonight so first of all ice cream
sandwich so a little bit of context
where we come from so google acquired
the android folks back in 2005 and then
things went very quiet for what one two
three years and then all of a sudden the
releases started coming pretty rapid
fire and they still are in fact recently
then we have this were little release so
we're busily working on these things
okay while he's editing the slides keep
talking and we're probably working on
stuff past the Ice Cream Sandwich
release but we won't be talking about
that tonight we're going to be talking
about ice cream sandwich so it was
released recently it's available on the
android site some devices are out there
we continue to do other good stuff and i
have no idea what you're talking about
what oh yes i joined then
and you joins what about here here okay
so he was actually I knew him when he
was suffering through all of these
scattershot releases and I thought well
I couldn't handle that so here I am
anyway okay so then we can think about
what the numbers are so we gave a talk
last March and we presented a graph that
had these numbers on it and said well
you know the android community is is
doing really well we have all these OEMs
we have you know over 150 carriers we
have all these countries that are
supported and we have look at that a hoe
over 150 devices that was just last
March that those were the public numbers
as of last month the blue is what it was
last March and the green is where things
are now well we have the number of
devices that's awesome market apps then
so this is how many applications we had
available on mark over 150 on market
over 150,000 applications available last
March and now it's basically doubled
since then pretty cool that's you guys
that's not actually us how many of you
guys have an F on market there should
count down that's okay we're clear that
take your time especially everybody in
the room has 10,000 have recorded that's
how this number which isn't that it and
then my favorite number is the number of
activations this is the number of
devices that are turned on for the first
time every day so it's basically the
number of new devices that were sold and
are available and are starting to be
used so as a December a year ago it was
just over 300,000 activations now it's
over 550,000 activations per day which
and again back to ition we mean you know
it's a phone that someone buys and turns
on and they goes through the setup
wizard and they stopped using the phone
it's not just shipped from the factory
somewhere it's actually some phone in
the hands of a user or a robot or what
we don't know so I find that number
really hard to understand so I tried to
break it down and sort of medical for
cold turns if we took every user of
every Android new Android device and
stacked them foot on shoulder on top of
one another then last March we could
have reached the moon and in just over
just about two years and now we're down
to four hundred four days just over a
year so next time I do this slide it's
going to be Mars and to be clear that
makes no sense sorry but I don't even
remember those slides but I like it look
at that animation it's so awesome it's
also not what Google is trying to do
with Android just Jets idea of what we
should be doing it's just what we could
do all right that's all yeah we're just
talking about possibilities so ice cream
sandwich there's one important thing to
cover its that ice cream sandwich is a
superset of all the other releases that
we've had it builds on everything that
we did before so the honeycomb release
that we talked about last year that we
finished last what March and ships all
of that stuff is in there ice cream
sandwiches basically taking all of those
features that we got ready for the
tablet release and making it work on
phones as well so that was actually the
big priority the of the release was take
all that good stuff we did for honeycomb
and make sure it can work on the phone
devices and we insist on saying that
it's a superset because we get a
question or what like I've seen you know
crazy blogs online saying that ice cream
sandwich would be 2.4 with new API is
that three-point no doesn't have and if
you guys that are music anyway know when
we work on the new version it's a new
version that contains everything that
the previous version had it's not a fork
there's nothing weird about it it's just
like you guys work I'm sure just like
any other platform in the world works
new version contains everything that the
previous version hat so here's a really
complicated visualization that we have
one died oh and then cupcake and donate
and declare and then froyo comes along
everything's a superset and now we have
ice cream sandwich yeah we need bigger
slice them all so the other things about
ice cream sandwich are there's there's
sort of two levels of things that we
enabled under voice there's the user
level features which we'll see soon in a
demo and then there's developer level
features the new things that you can
take advantage of a new
applications to make even better and
even more market applications so first
of all let's talk about user stuff so
I'll go through some quick bullet points
but mainly it's about the demo here so
we have a new home screen we have new
rich capabilities for launcher and all
apps and widgets and folders on home
screen that good stuff keyboard more
powerful keyboard easier to use keyboard
stuff text selection capabilities that
we didn't have before USB device
capabilities some of this was in the
honeycomb release and we've enhanced
that even more so we have more mouse
buttons support stylus support sort of
more well-rounded device support we have
action bar and system bar which will see
some of that in the demo these are
capabilities system bar is really
important when you get in the world of
not actually having hardware buttons
instead you have assistant bar with
notifications as well as software
buttons to do things like go home or go
back or see the menu action bar is a
more rich menu support I mean we also
have a rich recent apps capability
system bar this gives you the software
buttons and the notifications especially
important in the world where you don't
have hardware buttons on some devices
this was certainly the case in honeycomb
and may also be the case on new phone
devices so it's a rich system bar you
can go into lights-out mode if you have
a full screen application you can have
richer notifications you can populate
these from your application have rich
content in them you can do things we'll
see this in the demo where you could
actually have controls in there like a
play in a pause button for a music
player all within the notifications
instead of going into the application
action bar this is Richard menu support
basically if you built a menu for your
application and you target this SDK it
will automatically be folded into an
action bar instead there's really not
much you need to do there but you can do
a whole lot more such as navigation rich
navigation through the action bar as
well as items that can then come out of
this sort of opaque many that you can't
see into and actually be available
directly on the action bar itself much
richer support for
navigation renderscript new graphics
library this is actually is not a new
library but the API is new we finally
exposed it to the public so you can now
write accelerated and parallel computing
and graphics code in a portable way so
you can write an application once that
takes advantage of GPU acceleration and
that can be available on different
devices instead of the problem with n
decays you compile / architecture and
then you need to ship different versions
of your applications for the different
architectures a couple of important
articles to check out most of the links
that I talked about today are links on
the Android blocks if you go there all
this information is there and really
good articles graphics acceleration we
turn on GPU acceleration for the UI for
the first time we used you a graphics
acceleration a lot already for window
composition various other things in the
system you could do OpenGL applications
games using the ndk took advantage of
GPU but the you I did not so we enabled
GPU acceleration for the UI and most of
the apps that we bundled by default and
we took that a step further an Ice Cream
Sandwich as we'll see you later did you
see how I built suspension was that good
refuse to spend out there on the edge of
their seats layers awesome capabilities
with hardware acceleration for making
things really fast you're basically
caching a texture on the GPU for faster
copies during animation animation
framework obviously the best thing in
the release so it's it's more possible
to do much more flexible and powerful
animations now there's a couple of
articles in the android blog about using
the new property animation system as
well as the new view property animator
class and you can have terse code like
this to say i want to animate alpha 20
now go and much much more i've been
talking a lot why don't you talk yes if
you never showed up ICS well let's do a
demo of ICS because i'm sure many of you
have not seen it so first of all this is
my personal phone so if you see phone
numbers emails because i will show you
the wrong thing like you know cover your
eyes it's not for you it's my own
personal stuff but yeah let's take a
quick
to our ICS so this is running on the
Galaxy Nexus no I don't know when it's
going to be available in the US no on
what carrier so don't ask me don't I
said either it doesn't know either but
this is a Galaxy Nexus it was released
week ago a couple weeks ago at least in
the UK and Europe and this is your
launcher so i'm gonna i'm projecting in
landscape because when you go through
hdmi output it goes to landscape
automatically but it does work in
portrait like a normal phone you don't
have you have to hold it sideways when
you make phone calls so this is the
launcher screen is very similar to what
you have on your current phone I used to
have your widget you have your shortcuts
the big difference is on the side up
there you can see the new software
buttons so we don't have any hardware
buttons except the volume in the power
buttons on this phone instead we have
those software buttons and there at the
bottom when you hold the phone in
portrait and there on the side when you
hold the phone in landscape launcher
itself is very much the same just a real
nicer so you get nice visual effects
when you reach the end of the workspace
we have those you know little animations
and 3dfx all throughout the UI just to
make the experience real nicer and feel
more pleasant to use we have rich or
widget so now you can scroll widgets you
can have grids and list so for instance
let's add bookmarks let's see my
bookmarks are here let's grab my
bookmarks and I have this list of
bookmarks I can scroll through so those
are all night bookmarks synchronized
from my chrome account so those are my
desktop bookmarks and I can also resize
the widget like this so i can see more
you can see that it's report folders I
mean it's pretty awesome so your app can
also use all those new widget so you
have a listview gridview something
called stack view and you can create a
better things we are better charm
stacking that thank you yes youtube I
believe doesn't a glue yeah let's see
you too
you have too much yeah I install too
many applications there we go so that
this is a stack view in progress bar
that's a stacked a progress bar it's not
a new widget here we go so you get this
nice leo 3d effect you want to scroll
through an unbounded collection of data
it's it's a really nice way to just you
know randomly find something you might
want to look at front in the books
application is using it to scroll
through your book you don't know what
book you want to read next you just you
know go through your library this way
you can you can remove stuff so we have
better folders we had folders before but
didn't you couldn't tell what was in the
folder so now we have those little
previews you can see at a lot of games
you should write down the name of those
games they're pretty awesome games so
you get a better idea of what's in the
folders they're easier to rename and
also creating a folder is very easy now
so let's say I want to create a folder
with boring applications no offense to
adobe adobe reader and amazon there we
go so now you just drop an icon on top
of another icon and you get a folder
it's a lot easier than before and get
rid of that because I don't care well
okay something's not going right let's
take a look at the apps let's see we'll
start with their way more ABS than I'm
used to mean our demos browser so
browser is awesome browser is fully
hardware accelerated now it's going to
render pages a lot faster so you can see
here the page of the San Francisco user
group and this is I believe the mobile
version of the website which always
annoys me when I see a mobile version of
the website on you know this giant
screen so now in the menu you can
request the desktop site and if the
website is written correctly I should
get something refresh refresh no no it's
living oh the website is incorrect so
I'm going to use something else let's
try the new york times there you go
so New York Times I'm going to get the
mobile version no of course I know I get
the desktop version because I just
requested the desktop version so I get
the desktop version I could uncheck the
box and I could go back to the mobile
version of the website we have better
support for tabs so you can have up to
16 tabs open at the same time the tabs
are live so if you have animations
playing in a web page you're going to
CDN machine playing in the tab you can
discard the tab with a just a swipe and
this video swipe gesture we use all over
the place to navigate between pages or
just to discard elements so for instance
if i open the list of recent
applications with that button on the
right you can see you have a couple of
music players my email contacts chrome
apps i can just swipe a nap away to just
close the application and remove it from
the list of recent applications so it's
a lot easier to navigate and you can see
the screenshot the screenshot is the
last state of the app so it's very easy
to find the app you're looking for we've
also improved the contacts application
that we now call people so it looks a
lot nicer it integrates of course as
usual with the with google talk you have
your picture synchronized from google
plus if you have a Google+ account you
can also easily change the contacts you
want to display let's for instance show
all my contacts on the Google+ and then
when you open the contact you get you
know usual goodness there's not much
here because I don't have phone and
email you can swipe between tabs so this
is the the new the new gesture I was
telling you about we have the swipe or
in pretty much every application when
you see tabs you can always swipe around
between pages it's very fluid very
smooth so nice way to to go through the
various views of your application let's
see where else next application calendar
no I'm not going to show you my work
calendar and it's pretty boring lecture
the camera application family can show
the camera in landscape so the camera
has a lot of new features so one of them
is the ability to zoom we found we have
digital zoom and you can see that we do
face tracking so we try to focus on
faces so it's going a little nuts here
because there are too many of you so you
could hide your face that would help
thank you see it works
we have a bunch of I've mode so you can
shoot videos so here for instance you
can shoot videos in 1080p or 720p or you
know low resolution I don't know why you
would want to do that and there's a
really cool new panorama mode let's try
the panorama mode so I'll just click and
then just scan I'm going a little fast
but it's the demo alright and here we go
I have a panorama so this is this is
just a preview of the panorama it's
still it's still selling it to have a
high-res version of the panorama it's
pretty awesome when you want to take a
quick panorama of a cool landscape or
your cityscape oh one of my one of the
cool features i like about this new
camera application is the Wizards here
we go the time-lapse mode so you can
automatically set the camera to take
pictures at fixed interval and you can
any more creative video out of it if you
interested on youtube a video that shows
it's about a minute of time lapse shot
with the Galaxy Nexus so you can see
what it looks like and what's also
pretty cool is the fact that we have a
very fast camera so I can take pictures
oh wait I'm recording this camera mode
sorry you can also take pictures while
you're recording to agree justice video
in tech snaps so even with the flash you
can see that I can take pictures really
quick but it's a real blurry because
there's not enough light switch you can
start making light that would help and
you connect and of course you can click
on the picture you can start sharing it
with one of the many applications you
have installed and even better you can
just open the picture then you go to the
gallery application and here you can
edit your picture so it's not meant to
replace the fancy photo editors that you
will find on market but it lets you you
know make sure photos a real nicer so
you can do simple things like auto fix
the image to make it to better change
the shadows the contrast you can apply
like cool hipster San Francisco effects
like Instagram in those applications
change the saturation but what's really
nice about all those changes is they are
unknown this
active while you're applying them so you
can at any time undo at the top and redo
so you can you know your picture is safe
and when you save the picture it saves a
copy of the image you tell you already
know intact you don't have to worry
about you know making mistakes when you
when you play with it with that
application it also has video effect we
have those fancy effects that you can
apply to do just fine effects the nice
thing about them is that they track the
face so you don't have to stand then in
the center of the video you know they
will be applied anyway and they work
when you're doing video chats so if you
want to have fun during a video chat you
can apply those those fancy effects are
these from the effects library yes also
all those effects are available there's
a new API for developers the media
shelter framework I think it's called
you have access to all those effects
like the photo editor or the effect that
you saw you can use them in your
applications to 3d pictures so the
camera is awesome the gallery
application is pretty much the same as
before we do have integration with a
google plus so if you go back to the
list of albums if you see at the bottom
of the of the album's you can see the
optic a cycle those are all the photos i
have on google+ that are automatically
synced with the phone and we have the
instant upload so as soon as you take a
picture it goes to google plus so you
have a backup online let's see guerra
now the canada our central lot it's
really it looks a lot nicer you can zoom
in you can zoom out it has better
management of accepting or rejecting
meetings but I currently have my work
account synced on it and I don't want
you to see what's on my calendar sorry
will be better prepared next time let's
zoom we want yeah no market so market is
the same market application that you
have on your phones if you have you got
the updates except that now we have the
recently launched movies and music so
you can buy your music and it will
appear in google music I won't bore you
with the details speaking of google
music so this is an example of the new
rich notifications we have so you can
see here that i'm listening to the tron
soundtrack i can directly enter
actually the music player fun the
notification and again your applications
can also do that kind of thing so you
can have regional notification and just
in oly label and a photo and of course
you can discount notification again with
that swipe gesture you also have access
to the notifications from your lock
screen but only if your lock screen is
not secure so the I've software
installed on my phone I have to have a
secure lock screen so I can show you the
notifications but I can show you the
music on the lock screen so now you
don't have to unlock your phone to play
the music and again this is an API
available to application so if you're
working on a media player of some sort
you can interact with the deluxe screen
and I will change my pattern after this
presentation gmail gmail is very much
the same as what we have on tablet so we
have this new white theme if you open a
conversation we are once again this
pattern of swiping left and right to go
to the next and previous conversation so
every application feels very much they
feel more coherent with each other like
we have the same gestures all over the
place we also have the new action bar
the touch so if you select multiple
emails you get new actions that appear
at the top to automatically you know
archive several emails or delete them
things like that we do have a new text
to speech feature so let's say hi how
are you doing period there we go so the
nice thing about the text to speech is
that it keeps going so you don't have to
say one sentence and stop and wait for
that's what I did yeah I'm a bit far
from the from the microphone Google
talks and same story and we will talk if
you have several conversation you can
just swipe between the pages settings
settings do better they have been
reorganized so if you use to the
settings on gingerbread you will you
will feel weird at first you can you can
see that we made easier functions to
enable and disable bluetooth you don't
have to end Wi-Fi you'll have to first
enter the Wi-Fi section you can just
turn the Wi-Fi on and off directly from
here we have the data usage so the data
usage is actually pretty cool it shows
you how much data you've been using over
the past
30 days you can see here that market has
been using 5656 megs of data and if you
find an application that's using too
much data you can just click on it and
you can go restrict background data so
when you do that the application cannot
use data when it's in the background it
can only use data when you're actually
interacting with the application so if
you have a crazy application that's
always thinking it's a good way to to
make it stop you can also set warnings
so for instance if you have the data
plan where you start paying more after
maybe a gigabyte of data transfer you
can set your warning at maybe you know
500 Meg's and you'll just get a warning
and then you can shut up data entirely
if I can move that red line set mobile
data limit here we go you can shut up
data entirely at another threshold so
for instance that two gigs of data won't
stop using data completely
yes yeah so a lot of the stuff that
we're talking about it's not just
because they're cool user features on
this specific device like a lot of the
camera features you saw those are
actually capabilities of the software
stack and capabilities that you can
access from your application so yes okay
so we just have NFC enabled and we have
this new feature called Android Beam so
when we just step two phones together I
probably need to turn on okay it turn it
okay okay sorry yeah so when you have
two phones with a NFC enabled and you
can just stab them and you can exchange
data let's see okay it beeped wait no
you have to you have two digit they are
ok babe okay now if I touch the screen I
will send a web page to Chet's phone
call and now I should show your phone to
do that because I was going to show
calendar anyway yeah okay I'll do that
google wallet I don't know they might
they might be so eager Chad got the web
page and you can it's just more than
websites you can exchange sync contacts
information youtube videos if I'm
playing a game for instance and we just
step to being it will take the other
phone to the market page of that
application so it's an easy way to know
share our applications you like with
your friends and of course we have an
API so your applications can react to
the beam event and they can decide how
they share data and by default will just
open the market page right so it does
something intelligent by default but if
you want to customize that to actually
send different data you certainly can
all right so here we have a week view we
can go in show different views even
watch we could do a month view and again
we've got the swipe gesture so I can
show the week view again we can swipe to
show different weeks on the phone hello
one of the cool things is the the zoom
it makes it a little bit easier to see
things on these dense little device
screens so you've got pinch zoom
capabilities I don't know if there was
anything in else in particular you can
go into the debut that the swipe gesture
is especially useful
when during the days so there's a bunch
of developer settings you can use we
won't there's only one I want to show
you is the fourth GPU rendering so by
default hardware acceleration is enabled
only if you're requested in your
manifest or if you're targeting SDK 14
but if you want to quickly try your
application or if you want to try
applications on the market with hardware
acceleration enabled you can just check
that box and we will run all the
applications with the with the hardware
acceleration on so just make them faster
I was going to show notifications but
you're really pointless when you don't
have any but there's a little window
shade that you can pull down to see
notifications like emails that arrived
in calendar appointments and other
information you might want to know about
and then there's again swipe gestures to
remove them from there or you can remove
them all nice little animations that I
spent entirely too much time on and
again these are full-featured things
where you could provide more rich
content for the notifications so you can
access your notifications as well as the
play controls on screens where you don't
have is the pattern lock if you have the
low security lock then you could
actually use some of your phone
functionality before you get into it if
you have a high-security lock like a
pattern lock then you probably don't
want people playing with your
notifications while you're not there so
that's pretty much the tour of ICS is
there anything that you guys would like
us to show official okay so we'll try
but I don't know if we have enough light
because so face unlock requires the user
the camera and it does not apply to see
your face of course it doesn't work okay
what yes I could use a actually I have a
flashlight application yoyo chat good
idea try and close your eyes
what you're gonna are you know you'll
demoing the fissile look I'm providing
the light all right we will do no not
screen lock we want which one it is a
screen lock secures our credit yep ok
yeah whatever I'm going to be changing
my pattern lock later as well so just to
be clear when you set face unlock
there's a dialogue that tells you that
this is not the most secure lock screen
if you want a really secure lock screen
user password with many characters right
ok go ahead so we're setting up the face
on large
if
probably
naturally I mean it doesn't work on the
side but chase whatever yeah and when
you set up face unlock you have to also
use a set up a pin or pattern because if
there's not enough light or if the face
is not recognized you have a backup
unlock mechanism ready okay that's right
hey what if I tried yeah you go do the
light all right yeah it worked
haha me back my phone I really want it
to be you a picture might work and
that's why again you said the most
secure lock screen it's better than not
having a lock screen that's it there's a
we have facial recognition api's let's
say you know if you lose your phone in
the bar and someone finds it and they
don't know who you are chances are they
don't have your picture but again if you
want security user password yes I should
that's really quickly I wonder what I'm
running recently here's recent apps did
you have a particular question or you
just want to see the functionality yeah
so you use the swipe gesture to get rid
of an application so speaking of rate of
killing applications if you want to
uninstall an app now what you can do
from the lock screen you can just drag
it to uninstall directly instead of
having to go through settings and and of
course i missed it there you go so you
don't have to go to settings apps and
find yet so we talked about the user
level we went through the huge demo we
talked about what users see when they
use the device a lot of those
capabilities that we saw such as a lot
of the stuff that one man was walking
through on the camera are actually
available at the developer level as well
so we're going to try to cover some of
those some of these we don't know much
more than the bullet point that's on the
screen so we'll see how this goes now if
you want more information d android com
you'll see all the details but at least
you'll know what's available right so
there's a big emphasis at Google and on
Android and in the world these days on
social there are various api's that make
sharing information easier there's
social api's directly there's also
calendar api's so this is cool so
instead of having to write custom gooeys
to have your own sort of you know date
calendar entry mechanism you can
actually reuse the GUI system you can
also have the user input events directly
into the built-in calendar on the system
so there's api's for you to basically
access the existing calendar
functionality on the platform visual
voicemail yes we have it android be
we saw some of it you can plug into that
at the developer level like we said you
can your your app is automatically going
to link to a URL and market to download
your app but if you want to do something
custom you certainly can there's a P is
for that Wi-Fi directs that you can
connect directly to another device
instead of having to go through an
intermediate network Bluetooth this is
for health devices so there's standard
protocols for connecting to medical
devices and the device supports that you
can access that through api's network
usage we saw a demonstration in the
settings of this the abilities set low
and high water marks to limit the data
usage for the system overall or for
particular applications you can also
plug into that system and get stats on
on the amount of data that your
application is using or that the system
is using or what the limits are so you
can set up your application usage more
intelligently we do have low levels
streaming multimedia I don't know what
that is you can plug in at a very low
level to the multimedia stream if you
want to do your own decode support or
what are these damages nuclear
capabilities so in the the camera
application the user can touch a part of
the the picture to set where the focus
should be where the exposure should be
so you have access to the say P is if
the hardware supports supports them
media effects we talked about them so
what we saw in the photo editor all
those offensive shelters you have access
to those things in your application and
their hardware accelerated so we try to
use either multiple cores or the GPU to
apply the filters really quickly so you
don't have to worry about doing it
yourself in a remote control that's also
something we saw if you are writing a
media player and you want your your
media capabilities on the lock screen or
in the notifications you can use this
new wrinkle Troy pais to do so right so
we saw the standard music application
plugging into the remote control plug
into the controls on the lock screen but
you could actually have your application
plug into those controls as well in the
UI toolkit we didn't add many new
widgets but we do have something called
a grid layout the grid layout is an
article on the
droid blog describing how it works the
idea behind grid layout is to be able to
create a complex screen without nesting
a bunch of layouts with inside each
other so if you use to doing a linear
layout and inside you put not only in
Denali out in a relative layout and some
you know and the firm layout now you can
do all of that with just one grid layout
and set we are working on support for
the visual editor inside Eclipse to
support grid layouts you will just do
drag and drop by choosing it by hand is
actually pretty easy so I you should we
have another slide on grill out but you
should go to go read the article on the
official blog to see what it's about I
just did it took me 10 minutes to learn
how to use it it's pretty awesome and he
doesn't even know how to program on
Android the guy that wrote grid layout
is actually interested in doing a talk
sometime so I said I we mentioned do if
you want to pull any more Android people
text review i'm i'm excited about text
view because it's graphic stuff you
probably don't care but text review is
basically a surfaceview that works so
the primary surface you is that it digs
a hole through your window and put the
second window behind your application so
if you're trying to animate your your
surface you for instance you put the
surface view in the score view when you
scroll the score viewed it doesn't
really work with the surface you it
doesn't follow your finger really
quickly you can't pay the surface view
you cannot rotate it you can scale it
tons of issues if you have hardware
acceleration enabled you can now use
text review a texture of you is just
like a surfaceview but it behaves like
any other view so we have a I think I
wrote something on the blog about it so
you can stream a video in the texture of
you can render with OpenGL and then you
can apply animations put it in the list
view in the score view it's awesome
hardware acceleration we mentioned it
before again go to the official blog we
have long articles on how to use it and
what you should be aware of when you use
it stylist mouse and boots whatever
talked about some of that already
portable dictionary and spell checker so
you can again this is all for developers
to access you can
these capabilities on the device you
could have your own dictionary that
people plug into own spell checking
support a little bit more information
about grid layout once you ok you go so
just a quick example this is a very dumb
example of a screen that you might want
to create in your application a simple
login screen so if you were to do that
now you would probably use a vertical
linear layout then you would have a
textview then there will be two linearly
outs for the the fields and their labels
and then you would have another linear
layout at the bottom probably to do the
buttons wait so one of the problems so
you would have this you know relatively
deep nesting for what should be a simple
situation but you would also have a hard
time actually reproducing this exactly
getting everything to line up when
there's so many different components and
containers at play like baseline
alignment in addition to horizontal and
vertical imma with these elements tends
to be very tricky and haphazard oh and
this is not a good example of good UI
this is just a muck it will be we will
we will put grid layout in the
compatibility library so that you can
use it on earlier versions of Android
and the source code is out is already
out there so you can grab the source
code of grid layout it's pretty stand
alone so you can complete in your app so
that screen with a grid layout I won't
go into the details but this is what the
implementation of that screen looks like
this only one grid layout so it's a lot
easier to read the XML is shorter and
you can see that you don't need to
specify the layout width and height on
every child so a lot simpler
yep looks like a hardware acceleration
we mentioned very hard to use that's all
you have to do or you can use android
target SDK version equals 14 question
these okay so what is the truth or
extraction why don't we Nabal it by
default there's an excellent target we
gave a Google I other you can go and
watch the quick summary is we were not
able to map a hundred percent of the
existing 2d rendering API text doesn't
work oh now we got text to work don't
listen to that guy so we're not able we
are not able to map a hundred percent of
the API on top to OpenGL so there are
some obscure API is that very few apps
should be using first not stop it but if
you happen to be using those api's we
don't want to break your app so just to
make sure that existing applications on
market keep working exactly the same way
we don't nibble hardware expression by
default there are also bugs in the
hardware acceleration library so the
rendering you might not be exactly the
same as before we're going to fix those
bugs but in the meantime we don't want
to break your applications we don't want
to make it to have the user just be mad
at you because of us so it's an uptick
hopefully at some point in the future
soon we'd like to be able to guarantee
you know maybe ninety-nine point nine
percent compatibility with the existing
software running library and when is
that happens we might enable how to
expression by default so to be clear
this is not something that's you know
well kind of flaky and try out your own
risk the entire UI and most of the
applications that we ship ship with
hardware acceleration enabled that's the
level of functionality everything you
saw during that demo from the device is
using how to actuation so it's very very
specific API is we can go check out the
blog and go check out the documentation
the SDK we explain what the limitations
are we explain what you can do and again
if they are bugs father bugs I go I look
at the bug tracker every day and I make
sure that you know I fix all the
hardware wondering problems as they
appear so the main ship is compiler
application to use it see if your
application work
correct if you're not tripping over any
of these corner cases and if it does you
should be set to go accessibility
there's been a lot of work on making the
device and the platform more accessible
in general there's more api's for this
text to speech as well keychain API this
goes to the security questions that
someone was asking and that's about as
much as I know about it VPN support so
you can write the VPN applications that
everyone is dying to write and in the
meantime we worked on a lot of other
stuff so don't be mean we some people
find that missions boring they couldn't
they couldn't possibly everyone likes
animations right right okay so we spend
a lot of our time working on performance
specifically because we're in the
rendering group but we work on
performance we work in animations we
work in making everything more robust
and wonderful in general that is it for
this one thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
