informational world you know if I ask
you you know what's the weather today
right now in Paris you could tell me if
I asked you you know what's the tallest
mountain in team back to you could tell
me but what do you know about your house
what do you know what was what's the
temperature in your house just last
month how much are you have you used
your air conditioning or in the Bay Area
your heating during the last year if
you're away you know you have pets or
kids and you want to know how things are
going you have no idea
so you know when we look at science
fiction and stories in the last 20 30
years in terms of what does I you know
what's our house going to look like our
homes of today are disappointing you
know again I'm the information side is
nobody thought you know if you read
books science fiction books from 30 or
40 years ago you know they're all
talking about how in the spaceship the
mainframe is printed printing the pages
so you can find out how far you are from
the planet which makes it laughable when
we think about it today but when you
know when we talk about things like the
houses or transportation our houses or
transportations we're way behind where
we thought where we'd be now when we
think about things like flying cars and
jetpacks and things like that we just
don't have the technology right now
there's no way I mean well I guess with
the jetpacks there's been little blips
and here and there in flying cars but
really we haven't done a whole lot in
terms of transportation in terms of
moving forward and having breakthrough
technologies but in terms of our homes a
lot of the technology that we need to
have smartphones is already here today
it's not like we have with some
exceptions it's not like we can't make
our home smart it's just a way stuck
with a jumble of different technologies
so let's talk a little bit about what do
we mean when we talk about home
automation and by the way you know I get
tired of hearing myself talk so feel
free to raise your hand at any time if
if you're tired of hearing me talk or if
you have any questions or any comments
or anything so in terms of home
automation you know what do we mean
we're talking about controlling very
stuff in the house so control your
appliances turn on your coffee maker
your oven your fridge etc locks it
air conditioning and heating when is
your you know in terms of a money
perspective it's a really important
question of how much energy we are using
the house usually we don't think about
in that respect but media ham links or
turning on your TV changing channels and
all that one of the things I don't have
in here is alarm systems are sometimes
considered part of home automation and
finally we're going to talk about
scenarios a little bit down the line
yeah yeah yeah that's also a basically
that can be combined as part sorry so
the question was what about cameras
inside the house that that is also part
of the whole arena of home automation
and then the next question is well you
know there's a lot of cute technologies
that you know you look at and people say
isn't it cool that I can dim my lights
without getting up and the question is
okay so yeah it's cute but who cares
there's a lot of technology that's cool
but you know we want to have in here
more than just it's cool that I can do
so and so and so in terms of home
automation you know a smart home it is
going to be more convenient in terms of
how hard it is how cold it is you know
when you go turning off the lights when
you get out of a room it's going to save
you money because you're not going to
heat all the rooms that you're not in
its clearly green because we're not
wasting as much energy and it is cool
so one group of people so let's let's
talk about who uses home automation
today so I don't how many people have in
their house as a rack of servers in the
basement or anywhere in the house okay
nobody in here I used to but for
different reasons so when you have 4,000
5,000 square foot house it's a totally
different game and you know I know I've
talked to various people who have done
these kind of installations it's a
different game because you have the
money you know so you can do but it's
also a different game because you know
you're getting in the house and you want
to turn on the light and you have 10 or
12 or 15 switches on the wall and you
need to hunt and figure out which switch
you turn for this in which switch return
for that not to mention that later on
when you want to turn off the lights you
start you know flipping up and down
various switches so these kind of
installations you know you don't you
know either you're doing a major remodel
you know you don't just say oh I'm just
going to do usually it's not i'm just
doing home automation they're part of a
bigger change to your house you're doing
a remodel a new construction or
something like that so so I talked about
how you want to deal with banks of
switches lighting pass if you know if
you have a really big house you get to
the Hat you get to the house you know
and turn on the light in garage and then
in the hall and then in the living room
and indents so that's where you have you
start having scenarios where you see say
I'm home and it turns on a bunch of lies
so you can walk in and then you have a
different scenario and say turn off the
lights from the garage into the house
another scenario is i left the house and
it automatically turns on off so it
turns off all the lights turns off all
the appliances that don't need to be on
turns off
the heating air conditioning etc the
other piece thats related that is often
these houses have complex multimedia
systems you know big screens multiple
speakers sound when you move from room
to room the sound can follow you so that
you have the same music in every room
and so on so this next group I see some
people laughing here and I'm I suspect
it's because of the picture on the
bottom of the screen is that right so
for those of you who can't see in the
back you know there's a quote from one
of the forum and then somebody says
here's my USB / cereal and then they do
a d message and pipe it to grab PL 2303
and then this is the log then you know
the and it says register new interface
driver and so on and so forth so a lot
of the do-it-yourself today is white
geeky you really need to you know a lot
of it is people really are interested
and care and want to do it not so much
because they need to but because it's
fun and cool for them and along the same
lines you know this is and I didn't pick
the worst review but this is from one of
the reviews of a home automation
products on amazon has come you know
almost no documentation the most basic
functions requires you to the research
make sure you understand what you're
getting into so let me tell you about a
friend how many people here have both an
iphone and an android phone that they
used both what okay prom so we have see
you for okay so my friend Chuck has both
an Android and
knife on so he had a galaxy s3 and an
iphone and then he didn't like the
galaxy s3 so then he got well it's not
that he didn't like he got an HTC X and
he has an ipad and he has a nexus 7 and
then he traded his nexus 7 for Amazon
fire HD and every time he gets a device
what he does is he installs a custom
launcher on the device so that it's
going to work Rock just right for him
how many people know what a launcher is
how many people Wow how many people use
custom launchers okay so you know i've
been using android since 2009 and until
i started working on smarty home i
didn't know what a launcher is so that
you know so clearly in this crowd we
have the group of people who are more
tinkerers than the average user but the
reason I'm talking about Chuck is
there's a lot of people who don't like
to spend as much time customizing and
and part of what our goal in terms of
home automation needs to be to take into
account that we can't really expect
people to spend a whole lot of time
customizing because they're not just the
way that there's tons of people who
never customize their phones there's
they're going to be people that are not
going to want to spend all the time and
home automation so you know we quickly
went over the landscape so you know so
right now it's either you have a
professional installer come in and
install a custom system or it's
complicated and geeky you know right now
we already have service status can be
programmable it at home but ninety
percent of the people never actually
bother to change them they just turn
them on and turn them off when they
he is done uh uh you know I mentioned
Chuck my my friend who likes to tinker
and make changes to everything you know
on the opposite side of the spectrum and
my wife I don't believe has ever
downloaded an app on her phone in three
years that she had a smartphone and I
know a lot of other people that have
downloaded maybe a few apps here and
there but are not you know are not going
to spend a lot of time figure out what's
the best app to solve every single
problem they have part of the reason I
mentioning this is you know a lot of
times we're kind of we're a little bit
in the bubble in terms of you know the
people the people in the Bay Area in the
technology world kind of forget that
there's a whole other world out there of
people who are not as interested in the
technology and in customizing and making
changes
so let's talk about Android at home too
in 2011 Google make the big announcement
about a project called Android at home
that they were going to make big inroads
in terms of providing a home so Android
based solution for the home and so in
2012 when Google i/o rolled around
everybody was kind of waiting to see
what's going to happen and nothing
happened alessandra asked me before I
started talking about this is you know
if I had any knowledge about what
happens and did I try to reach out did
we try to reach out and I actually you
know I have some friends at work at
Google and one of them was saying
they're not talking they're not saying
anything so the it's part of google x
and the people work at Google X usually
tend to be pretty secretive about what's
going on in there and there's no
information coming from that direction
the most likely scenario is that as
google has in the last 12 to 18 months
focused on specific you know retired
some products and focused on some
specific directions they probably retire
the project or maybe they're doing some
really advanced things that we're not
going to see for many years is there
anybody in here that knows more than I
do about Android at home by any chance
ok
so right now what do we have as if today
in terms of home automation in the
Google world you know we have the Google
TV which hasn't been that smashing a
success and is very narrow there's the
Nexus Q that I don't think anybody
thinks it was a great success it's not
clear really in my mind like oh we
launched it and if you go to the if you
go to Google Play and you look for home
automation yeah you'll find a lot of
apps but they're all to talk to
third-party devices that are running
proprietary platforms and it's really
not part of the Google world so this is
the device you see you know we have a
couple of them these are prototypes
you're welcome to come forward later and
play with them we have 21 so this is a
smartie one we call and this is Marty to
the components the Smarty one has the
speakers built-in there's actually good
speakers in there that provide better
sound smarty to we is waitin for its
speakers who should that we should get
in a week or so so
so when we started thinking about
Android for the home you know Neil and I
started thinking about the android for
the home you know in general we were
looking at android and we're saying you
know android is a great solution for the
home it's open source there's a lot of
people use it there's a ton of apps
there's a lot of developers who know how
to use it as a variety of languages
whatever language you used to using
there's probably a development
environment on Android and since
historically there has been a lot of
linux based home automation projects we
can actually leverage that by porting
some of these projects from linux into
android because android is linux for the
most part kind of so you know the first
iteration of smarty so when Neil and I
started talking yeah I I was really
interested in focused on a really low
priced a really cheap device I was
thinking you know we were talking about
$65 I was thinking maybe even fifty
dollars because i was seeing how the
price of Android components was coming
down and part of our vision initially
was this have a device in each room if
it's so inexpensive let's have one in
each room you can monitor things in each
room could use it's a baby monitor you
could use it as a teleconference sorry
you could use it as a video conferencing
you know if you want to check on your
child from outside the house there's one
in the room you could log in remotely
see what they're doing you want to call
the kids to dinner from the kitchen you
can do that you can want to supervise
them while the plane you can do that and
that's you know that's the model that we
came up with so you can tilt it so that
the camera can focus on the specific
areas it's not obvious from this picture
but the screen was meant to be between
four points
in five-inch screen so more of a phone
size screen they're not you know the
then what we have right now so so we you
know we we designed it with the hinge
but we realized after a while that the
qua you know basically competitors baby
monitor or any kind of monitor that is
out there in the market we're not going
to be as good because we're not going to
be able to point it to different points
it's not going to work in the dark the
quality of the components that you can
get for those really inexpensive devices
it would've meant a resistive screen
which how many people here have used the
resistive screen yeah so so resistive
screens you really need to touch them
you know it's like it's pushing it
against it you know in this day and age
you know I don't think anybody would
have gone for it the Wi-Fi was wasn't
strong enough the components in general
would were just too low quality for you
know our expectations and what we sought
our customers would be willing to put up
with and also we realized that in terms
of the we were just biting a little bit
too much in terms of the software we we
knew we wanted to do a home automation
solution but it seemed too aggressive
right out of the box so so this is what
we have right now it's an appliance
that's always on and we're going to talk
more you know I'm going to talk more
about what I what I mean when you know
why it's important that it's always on
it's got a 7 inch screen like most
tablets android 4 and it has built-in
speakers so that you know you don't need
to set up bluetooth or
no so so it has allowed enough I mean
this is a big room but you know in my
kitchen when when I use it it it's
pretty loud loud enough to fill the
kitchen with this USB plug in it becomes
a full home automation solution so this
is an add-on it's not you know it's not
we decided not to built it into the
device but it just plugs into the back
and then you have a homeowner but then
you have a full home automation a
solution so what do we mean when we say
it's an appliance right now that you
know the way if you want to just listen
to me and let's start talking about the
music piece of it if you want to listen
to music at home so if you have an
iPhone or with a darker and ipad with
the docket you doc it and you could use
it that way but then your device is tied
into the dock if you want to use a
bluetooth solution you need to get your
phone if you don't have it with you you
need to unlock it you need to find the
app you need to it's you know it's kind
of you using a special computing device
to do a specific task here
you just walk over and you push the
button and it's on and and that's the
idea of an appliance it's always sit I
always not quite accurate but it usually
sits in the same place and I'll explain
in a minute why I'm talking I'm not
saying oh it's usually sits in the same
place you know where it is you don't
have to look for it like a tablet or
phone it has big buttons so it's easy to
see you know you don't need to kind of
look at it carefully to know what button
to push and you know it's it's much more
like a standard radio or a stereo you
push a button when you're done it plays
so you know when we talk about the other
nation somebody mentioned z-wave we have
several technologies there are
technologies that are based on sending
the signal through the power lines and
technologies that are wireless like your
Wi-Fi so x10 is a power line based
zigbee and z-wave our wireless and I
don't know how to pronounce that there's
somebody know insteon is is both can do
both and and all the wireless solutions
are a mesh network so each nail can talk
to the other nodes which is a big big
advantage in terms of the topology of
your network you don't have one central
location that everybody talks to so if I
have you know a note at the end of the
room then I can have another node that's
as far as that in the other direction
so X 10 is kind of is the grandpa of
home automation it's it's the you know
it's what people use 20 years ago there
are issued because it travels through
the wire lines it there's a lot of
interference but can happen because of
fluctuation in the line zigbee is a new
protocol it's it's it's an open standard
and we would have loved to use igby but
it failed what I call the Amazon test
insteon is also pretty good but has a
limited number of device and we went
with ziva wave so what would I mean when
when I talk about the Amazon test you go
to Amazon and you look at z-wave you
find three or 400 different devices and
we're going to see in a minute where
devices are available you you look at
Insteon and this probably maybe a
hundred devices you do our search on
amazon for zigbee and you come up with
books and maybe boards so you know a big
part of having a good home automation
solution is that you can have cameras
you can have sensors you can have
controllers you can have locks and so on
good
well if you look at you know with so you
know so it depends on so the question is
so the question is which one do we do i
do we think is going to win and and i
said well we went with z-wave but but
it's also a question of time frame so if
you look at the next two or three years
z-wave in our opinion is the right
solution if you look at five or ten
years zigbee looks like it has a lot of
potential and that's part of the reason
we decided to not build in the home
automation protocol into the product but
having have it be a plug in a USB plug
in because then you can decide what it
whichever one you want to use yes yeah
is it just the question is is it just a
radio you know it's mostly yeah it's a I
mean it's more than just the radio it
has there's a protocol of adding devices
removing devices in the parlance of home
automation what this is a controller you
know so think about it a little bit is
like your Wi-Fi router but the
controller does a lot more you know the
software behind that let's do a lot more
in terms of adding devices removing
devices controlling devices figure out
the capabilities of devices and so on so
the smart so the smart meters that we
have at home right now use dig be as the
protocol the only problem with that is
that it's encrypted so you know so it's
not like you could just tap into pjs
info and figure out you know what's your
consumption but but in terms of the big
pictures it's important to keep that in
mind for where we want to go and in the
future okay so these are all higher
level protocols yeah it says you know
it's not so much like tcp/ip and Wi-Fi
you know so these are proprietary
protocols except for zig d
and they're higher level protocols so
from from our perspective when we talk
when we talk to this thing is we
basically just fine you know all we care
about is adding devices removing devices
what information we get from devices
telling devices to turn on and off and
things like that we don't go into the
lower level layer of you know mesh and
having a you know having you know one of
these talk to its neighbors so and I'm
going to talk a lot more about the
devices in a minute but basically from
our perspective we don't go deep into
the protocol the same way as when you
you know you connect to a web server or
you you know send email you know you're
not getting into the lower layers of a
protocol you just use HTTP ok so the
question was can we talk about the
encryption part right now on
specifically on z-wave there's only
encryption for locks there's no
encryption for the other part for the
other so that your sensors and you're
you know switches on and off switches
are not encrypted I don't know about
easily but they could so so there is the
possibility of doing that the other
thing about 2.4 mega the the reason why
it's good that we did that it's using
900 megahertz rather than 2.4 is because
the 2.4 is really busy because of all
the Wi-Fi and nine 900 megahertz has a
lot more you know it is not nearly as
busy so let's look at some of the
devices and you know later if you're
interested you can come up here i have a
few z-wave devices i have a thermostat
a couple of plugs you're welcome to come
and play with them a little bit you know
there when I don't actually have things
set up to turn things on and off but you
can get a look and see what they're like
so so sensors you know sensors you know
before we can do anything or you know a
lot of times before we do things we want
to know you know what's the world like
what's the temperature what's the
humidity light is the door open closed
and so on and so forth and there's a lot
of you know there's a lot of different
products that have on Kickstarter and
other way why's that lets you control
let you collect information via sensors
the what's interesting about this is
that we're going to be able to do this
on Android I'm specifically excited
about this sensor right here because
it's a four-in-one so you put one of
those in one of your rooms and you have
you know it tells you it's a motion
sensor so it knows when people are in
the room temperature humidity and light
so put one of those in every room and
you could start doing some really
interesting things because you can do
things like turn off the lights when
nobody's in the room you could tell
which rooms were heated when nobody was
there and a lot of other scenarios like
that certain word between fifty and
sixty dollars fifty to sixty dollars for
that for the sensor for the foreign one
sensor and and it just came out a couple
months ago so it's still new they're
still working out the kinks
and then in terms so in terms of control
what the plug-in modules are these
things right here so basically you plug
it this into the wall so this is one is
an outside and this one is an inside you
plug it into the wall you plug whatever
you want into it you can turn it on and
you can turn it off very simple very
easy to use and you know you don't need
to change your plumbing you don't need
to you know you don't need to have an
electrician come up come over you don't
need to do anything you know you just
get you know you just use a smarty or
any kind of controller a couple of those
and you're done so so the question is
how do you configure these things so
unlike something like Wi-Fi where you
you know you kind of discover the router
the way it works is you go to the device
you say add device and then you have the
window of time where you push a button
so there's a button right here you push
the button they start talking to each
other it get so each device is going to
give the controller information about
what capabilities it has so it's going
to say you know I'm a I'm a power switch
and I can be on and I can be off that's
it on the other hand was the thermostat
and we'll see some of the UI later but
with the thermostat it's going to say
I'm a thermostat and I'm going to tell
you the temperature the current
temperature I can be on I can be now and
can be off I can cool and i can heat and
you can set up a target heating
temperature in the target cooling
temperature so on the left-hand side you
know we have on the bottom android on
top of Android we have the open z-wave
native library so there's a source
library to talk to z way and that's how
we talk to to the USB dongle
and on top of that what we put is a web
server well it's a c++ compiled web
server I can't be number the name of the
top of my head but and we haven't you
know it's not cast in stone yet because
there's some question but basically the
open z-wave library is c plus plus so we
need we definitely need to talk C++ to
be able to extract the data to extract
data in the data the the web server gets
the data and sends it so at this point
we have a rest-based API so we're going
to send json and we're going to accept
HTTP requests or or JSON now talking to
the rest api we're going to have a html5
web application so the html5 web
application is basically talking to the
web server you know its standard and
we're going to see a screens in a minute
but it's it's a standard web application
but since we have a rest api basically
anything can talk to the server and you
you can run applications on anything
either with html5 or with native
applications and we're launching with
the html5 web application because we can
make it look nice and we can make a
cross platform based on the feedback
that will get well probably well you
know the next step is going to be to
make local you know on iOS and on the
Android make local apps that use a web
view that is still web-based and then
from there there's really a lot of
demand for native applications we can
always do that
okay so I guess this is not as visible
as I was hoping it would be but
basically you know if you want to
complete basically you have buttons you
want to turn on something you want to so
you on top you have your coffee maker
you want to turn it on you go on your
phone you say on off and the third
button is scheduled you push the
schedule button and you know you say
turn you know turn off the front light
at six and turn it turn it on at six in
the evening and turn it off attending at
ten at night and then on the bottom
here's the thermostat I tells you what
the current temperature is so it says 74
on top it's set to cool right now but
you can change it to heat and you could
set target temperatures for heating and
for crawling so that's that's the html5
web application now we're things
starting start to get interesting is
because we have the full you know
because it's Android you know we know
what time zone you're in we know what
location Union we actually know what
when since it is so instead of saying
turn on the light in at six and evening
you can say well turn on the light at
sunset and there's a lot of information
about where you are what you're doing
that and there's a lot of apps that can
take advantage that can you know
basically so this is where Android and
home automation are starting to converge
so the question is how do i update the
state of the UI based based so you know
to make it clear how does he do you I
know that for this thing I should have
it on and off and for this thing I need
to also have a target temperature and
and so you know the target temperature
cooling heating so the device is tell me
so when this so when this device when I
push the button here and it connects to
me it tells me I'm a nun enough to
and my capabilities are boolean on and
off when this device connects it says
I'm going to provide you information
about my temperature but as I'm also
going to let you set me for cooling or
heating or off it's the first so the
question is is there a standard schema
or do you need to write something
specific for every device there is a
schema but there's also me you know so
it's it's not a clean environment in
terms of it just works out of the box
sometimes in the device will come and
you you you do need to update your
software to be able to handle it so you
know this is where you know this is
we're still the pioneers in this field
this field is not completely will define
and well you know fully debug then
handled so for instance when these guys
came I mean it's kind of funny when you
see something like this means and you
need to update the firmware but there's
difference between different you know so
version 1.1 71.1 8 had different
capabilities and and so there's this
work being done in this field in terms
of making everything work correctly so
it's it's not a clear ski mother always
work that yeah
just the first time well that's the
theory just the first time I mean you
know sometimes the that just you're
supposed to just pair them so that they
get to know each other the first time
you know it's a little bit like when you
first connect to your Wi-Fi you connect
and then you could tell it whenever I
come back just we use the same settings
now sometimes you know most of the time
it works and then sometimes you find out
oh wait a minute I can't log in you know
so the API example you know it's pretty
standard race interface you know you
just put in you know you just use our
what I just you just use parameters to a
HTTP request i just realized i used HTTP
which of course is not a good thing
should be using https so and then now
that we've done all the hard work we're
getting to the good stuff so because
we're running on android everything is
scriptable you know you and it's
scriptable right here so you write a
script you put in here and it runs and
it does whatever you wanted to do in
whatever language you you know whatever
language you want to use you don't need
to have a separate server to do anything
you don't need to do I mean if you if
you want to you and you have a remote
server you want you can do it you don't
need to have a lap so some some
solutions that I've seen is people have
old laptops on always on and they use
you know similar solution they use a
z-wave dongle and they run in and it's
always on and you know it's a linux
machine or it's a windows or a mac and
you know with you know here you have a
small box that is always on and this
double duty in terms of as a music
device and
and and as well as you have the screen
always available so you can run the
screw you know you can run the script in
whatever language you want and if you
want you can install Tasker either on
the device or get to ask her to talk to
it remotely how many people know what to
ask our is so for those of you who don't
know what Tasker is tester is an app on
Android it's a it's not a free app and
basically the idea is that you can run
tasks surprisingly enough based on a
variety of things so if I'm in the
office it runs one saying if I haven't
Hamid what it knows that I'm at home it
runs another saying if I take my phone
and I turn it upside down I could set it
to not wing if I get a call so it's a
very powerful device and what would be
really easy to do is to tell tasker when
I'm 10 miles away from home turn on the
heating so that by the time I get home
the heating is on or if I'm five miles
away from home make sure that all the
appliances are off and things like that
so now we're crossing between two
different worlds you're you know we're
getting back into the portable device
talking to your home so the question is
you know why creator you know a full
solution rather than just have the
dongle and some software and I know if
it were correctly so this is few reasons
for one thing is you know one of the
things you know part of our philosophy
is that it's the device that's always on
you know where it is and in terms of the
home automation it's true that you'll
often use it remotely but if you're in
the house and you want to do something
quickly and you you could just go in and
push a button the other thing is you
would need to do a lot of work
your nexus 7 to make sure it doesn't go
to sleep and to make sure you know just
to configure it in the right way so it's
a full home automation solution you know
what one of the things that we had to do
so for instance you can't use usb on the
device that is not 3.0 is not android
3.0 is the first one that really have
the USB handling so you couldn't use it
on any of the earlier devices the other
problem is you need some custom
libraries for this that you don't have
on the nexus 7 the day you would need to
root your Nexus 7 well so the advantage
of having an appliance is that you have
the full ecosystem of Android so on the
device you know rather than relying on
Raspberry Pi and you nexus 7 to talk
together and collaborate you know you
have one solution that is pretty
inexpensive that does all these things
at the same time so one of the things
that we were clear is that we needed an
Android device that we had full control
over so we have a customer you know so
the iOS is customized so that you know
so we can do the updates so we control
which libraries are we set it out out of
the box to be always by default always
on when your plug into the wall so
because you know the alternative you
know it's not it wouldn't be a consumer
device to go with the kind of solution
that you're proposing it would be much
more of a geek style device does that
make sense ok so pretty much all the
devices that I talked to and I and you
know all the solutions that I talked to
are available today one of the things
that I talked about is the 44 in one
sensor which you know in ways that you
could do it with multiple sensors before
but what I really like as I mentioned
before is you could put one in each room
and then all of a sudden it you know
your capabilities explode in terms of
what you can do
there's a japanese company that came up
with a light bulb that led-based light
bulb that you can change the colors
remotely using z-wave so here's another
example of what you were asking say you
have smarty in your bedroom as an alarm
clock next seat next to your bed and you
know it's a smart smart alarm clock it
wakes you up at five to you know it
wakes you up to at seven every morning
and you know you can hitch news or not
and it shows you the weather and you
know everything's great but in addition
to that it starts turning on the lights
at five to seven so that you know you
wake up and the lights are on and it
turns on the coffee maker so by the time
you go downstairs the coffee's on so
that's kind of the kind of integration
between apps the alarm clock the home
automation and Android that you can do
that we would be much more complicated
to do with with a different solution so
then so the question is you know when
are we going to have Star Trek type of
voice recognition where you say do you
know dim the lights you know so so so
the and you know I'm not no expert in
this arena but you know I've got we've
done some research on this you know
there's two ways of handling voice
recognition and I I'm not going to
remember the exact terms but one of them
that we all use or most of us have used
at some point involves pushing a button
and then speaking to the microphone from
a short relatively short distance and
then having the voice recognition work
the other one is when you have the
microphone always on and you have some
kind of keyword Siri or Google say I'm
talking to you please do some kind of
action and actually both sick Siri and
Google now don't do that right now you
still have to push the button and then
you have to give the prompt but so far
you know there is one project on
Kickstarter that that aims for that so
far we don't quite have the technology
you know so one of the things that I was
talking about is how a lot we already
have a lot of the technology available
in that arena we don't really have yet
the technology to have the microphone
that's always on in a distance that can
handle all the background noise and
recognize your voice when you're talking
to it and telling it to do it some kind
of action so there's research in this
arena but there's no commercial
solutions yet so so with this this is
going to be a Kickstarter campaign so
we're launching on Kickstarter and we've
been talking to manufacturers overseas
and we price everything and you know
basically we're going to do the
manufacturing ourselves with those
companies in China smarty is going to be
125 on Kickstarter and 99 for the first
X number of people that doesn't include
does not include the dongle so the
dongle is going to be probably a
thirty-dollar add on to you know any
other you know anybody who's done
Kickstarter know there's going to be
different pack sorry different packages
how many so we're going to launch in
October and you know if you give us you
know will mention it once we launch well
we're going to mention it to the meetup
but if you give us your card I'll be
happy to put you on our list so you get
to get the 99th all deal thank you thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
