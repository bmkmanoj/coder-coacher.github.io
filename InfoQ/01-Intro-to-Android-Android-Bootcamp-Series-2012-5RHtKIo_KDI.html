myself so my name is Marco garganta I am
I developed this course I think it's
been like three years now it's been
awhile it was yeah it's been it's been a
couple of years since we started doing
android boot camp it's gone through many
many different iterations so it's been
changing quite a bit but before I did
enter it into Java I my background is in
I started doing Java back before it was
named Java sort of like mid nineties it
was project at Sun in those days it was
called oak well it was just a final
project and what was look at least you
sort of got me interested in it
initially was that Java was gonna be
this language to program various
machinery right so we were going to
program your stereo your TV your
microwave refrigerator all these things
we're gonna run java that was the
promise right but as we know that never
happened Java kind of went into the
server land and that's where it took off
and most of the next couple years we've
been mostly working on enterprise
systems so most of my background has
been Enterprise Java for the past decade
or something until Android came out and
I kind of saw what I was looking for in
Java originally in Android so that's
kind of what got me interested in
started doing some some poking around
experimenting with it or did Android
bootcamp course started teaching that
just to give you an idea last year I did
over over 175 days of actual teaching so
that's basically the other day almost
did about 200,000 miles and went to like
11 countries 36 cities some crazy crazy
numbers I was probably the most Qualcomm
offices than anyone 12 something
worldwide so I've been all over all over
the place so out of that I actually
wrote a book called learning Android
which is not the best selling Android
book but it's doing all right
it's been translated into Chinese in
German and it's it just came out this
year in March I think and now it's in a
print yeah yeah I know you guys are
going to all get the copy we'll give you
a soft copy if anybody wants a hard copy
I believe we have a bunch too so you
will get that book so as part of the
course so just so you know and but that
book basically emerged as the front from
the class it's basically distilled
version of the boot camp in a book
so that's weighted so that's what we're
going to be using for the class I know
I'll compare what we're at in terms of
how we go to the you know where it's in
relationship to the book
so that's learning Android I frequently
speak at conferences Auslan is the open
source conference I've been there three
times of ACM I Triple E as this sees
both Scandinavian developer conference
as well as the sprint developer
conference book twice and DEF CON I'm a
co-chair of a new conference Android
Open if you get scared of it yes like
one of the speakers so the so we're
going to have it again this this year in
March April spring so I'll let you guys
know but we're working on it we're
planning it so if you go if you know
anybody who is interested in speaking
let me know that's basically what I did
look for speakers so and we also run a
local user group called SF Android which
is a really good resource that you
should know about it's basically a San
Francisco Android users group and we
have some really cool speakers and talks
like the most recent talk was from a
Romanian Chet Haase before the guys from
Google domain wrote the original home
screen application on your phone has
came from I believe Adobe and they're
responsible for for renderscript among
other things so they do a lot of
graphics in such
it's a great group it's all free if
you're local in San Francisco come check
it out
join it if you're not we try to record
everything and make it available so all
the talks eventually make it so you can
watch it on YouTube it's also okay so
that's a little bit about myself and
sort of what I've done in the community
just really briefly what we're going to
do today is we're going to talk about a
little bit about the history of Android
it's going just warm up insurance in the
same page talk about the versions talk
about the stack what what really
comprises the Android operating system
some of the features and then we really
quickly we're going to jump into hello
world the point of kilo world is going
to be to make sure you guys a get the
system set up properly so we're going to
just test if everything works and after
that we're going to dissect it so we're
actually going to look at okay so here's
an application what are the moving parts
what's what they're all the bits and
pieces that go into an application so
we're going to talk about that once we
kind of get that out of the way we're
going to talk about the main building
blocks so this is sort of and I know
from from your assessments that many of
you want to know about how to architect
an application right I'm just going in
and write it so we're going to talk
about the what are the architectural
pieces what are these building blocks
the lines and circles you know that you
would use to design something so we're
going to walk through a design of an
application and in this case it's going
to be an application if you're going to
be later on actually building comparing
so we're going to start with a back of a
napkin lines two circles design
something and then eventually make it
into a code and then eventually run it
and we're going to do that iteratively
so so each iteration you're going to
have some uniforms so so that's
basically what we're going to talk about
this is roughly just today so just so
you know so it's going to be we're going
to be moving to different things
tomorrow and so on
and oh by the way so we likely have some
time to cover other things so not
everything has to be 100% scripted a
safe if you have special interest things
that you would like to know about and so
on just let me know we're going to jot
it down
will create the parking lot of other
topics and then you know time permitting
we're going to pick up from from those
things so feel free to kind of ask for
things that you know maybe your special
interests with respect to analyst
because I need such becoming such a big
platform that you know different people
have different sort of angles that they
are looking at edit from so that's
that's a little bit about the agenda so
just to kind of give you a little
rundown through the history of Android
so basically now and again the goal of
the history is really to kind of give
you an idea of what the future may hold
so you can kind of try to predict the
future at least and you will get the
slides later on when you setup the
sharing so just so you know so basically
in 2005 there was a tiny low company in
Palo Alto called the Android Inc Google
Wallet right in those days it was it was
kind of uh it wasn't typical for Google
to go out and buy companies it's not
like this year they bought one company
every week about 57 companies this year
so but back in 2005 that wasn't the case
so this was kind of off right why is
Google buying this company but
everything kind of went quiet so for a
couple of years we really didn't know
anything about this just they they just
bought his company and started like
doing some work and then in 2007 Google
came out and said that they're going to
announce created this alliance the Open
Handset Alliance that is going to own
this project both and work right so
technically Android is not owned by
Google it's owned by OHA but in practice
Google is the biggest muscle behind that
project in all Open Handset Alliance is
basically an alliance of mobile carriers
such as you know t-mobile Sprint China
Mobile etc etc you have a chip
manufacturers like Qualcomm is part of
the Alliance you have software companies
like Google and so on and so on so it's
about things to believe and 85 members
now or so that the other part of the
Alliance and also OMS or HTC Samsung
Center so into a between 2008 and 10 we
basically saw a whole slew of new
releases come out
we basically saw Android take over the
world in terms of the you know at least
the market share this year what we're
seeing is that so the battlefield has
shifted from the smartphones more to the
other devices so tablets are becoming
mostly means the next mainstream so
battlefield but what we are seeing
emerge as well as our TVs and also
things that are not traditional
computing devices like home automation
think about everything from your
thermostats to your refrigerator to your
alarm system to your car navigation
those are all the things that are sort
of primed for destruction and that's
where Android is sort of you know
perfectly positioned to to you know play
a big role those are some fun things at
the capital um so back in 2005 when
Google bought this company everyone sort
of thought Google's going to come out to
the phone you know there were rumors
that about gee phone those what people
are referring to on in Eric so Eric
Schmidt came out and he basically said
look our goal is not to cab a single
single device we're not I'm ambitious is
not another gizmo right what we want to
do is we want to create a platform
that's going to run on many many
different platform well many different
platforms so we're going to have a
softer platform that runs some different
hardware right so that was their vision
for Android and on it looks like just a
random statement but actually we find
that it trickles down into many
different business decisions that were
made subsequently so that's that's
what's interesting about the statement
I'll point it out later on as we keep
going on
so speaking of versions so these are
some of the versions that we have with
respect to Android most of you probably
know this but this is your standard sort
of a version that we have for any any
piece of software that doesn't really
matter doesn't really tell us anything
you can for the most part ignore that
nickname is somewhat more interesting it
tells us about the family of releases
initially the nicknames were going to be
named after robots
was a for Android but then they kind of
ran out of names and the switch to
desert yeah what would be a be asked
some people say Bishop maybe from Star
Trek service hours yeah so but they they
kind of switched the dynamic scheme
after Android so right now as you guys
know we're at Ice Cream Sandwich and the
the possible possible next name is going
to be gelatin so that's that's people
say in terms of the API level this is
basically the capabilities of the
platform and specific release so this
number is going to matter to us the most
that's how we're going to be referring
to our release that's probably the most
precise right so right now we're at 14
the number just simply increments one
two three four five and so on right so
that's that's part of the the
capabilities of the framework so things
that you can expect the same level does
anybody have any restraints in terms of
or constraints in terms of API levels do
you guys know that I found that given we
think about oh you're out looking around
how far do you how far back you have to
go so it's a good question so let's take
a look at the distribution of the
releases so it's a business decision
right so here is the what we currently
have on the market now this data is
somewhat old on purpose it's about a
month old I believe this is November
first
and so this is the historical
distribution of releases now I wanted to
kind of point out where you can get the
latest data so the the website that your
friend is going to be
developer.android.com that's probably
you know the most important android
website that you want to know about I'm
sure most of you already have heard of
it so under target devices you actually
get the current information so as you
can see the we just crossed the 50
percent mark for 233 for Gingerbread
so gingerbread is now over 50% of the
market share out there there's quite a
few people still running Froyo and then
we have a little bit of Eclair and then
we still have some of the one axis out
there you know people who are stuck with
two-year contracts their contracts still
using those phones and we don't have a
lot of honeycombs it just hasn't been a
lot of adoption yet so that's basically
what the market looks like there was a
this is sort of interesting
in terms of the how quickly a new lease
gets adopted and in a perfect world we
do have the over-the-air set of updates
so basically newly surrender it comes
out like Ice Cream Sandwich for example
you know it should be that my carrier
just pushes the file down to my phone
and bam overnight I update to the latest
greatest alright so how many of you here
Ice Cream Sandwich and nobody right and
that's because that's because it takes a
long long time to to actually propagate
those those changes there are a couple
of good articles I'll share with you
later on on why that is but basically it
has to do with certifications so each
device actually has to go to various
levels of certifications and so forth
it's a quite expensive in time you know
it takes a long time to double process
so that's why we don't get the latest
releases anytime soon um so so that's so
back to you know how how far do you have
to go it really depends on you know what
you what the business case is we want to
support and so forth it's kind of like
if you guys are coming from the web
realm right how far do you have to go in
web support I do have to support you
know I nine or I sorry I six right
that's that's a big costly decision to
make
so maybe just to sit one line of between
the clearance royal is this significant
object from the differences that could
break your app if you don't go to attack
there um yeah so the question is about
the differences for example between
fryer or
and Eclair um each release brings
something new to the to the back to the
mix right everything is backwards
compatible so so your your old app
should run on a new device but your new
app may or may not work well on the old
device so we'll talk about the best
practice later on but but in a nutshell
what you usually want to do is you want
to target the latest greatest but you
want to figure out how far back you're
going to support the old devices so you
may say all right I wanna I want to
target Ice Cream Sandwich because that
gives me the most capabilities and so
forth I'm running against the latest
code but you know 50% of people still
around Gingerbread another 25% for 20%
Froyo I may actually draw a line here
and so basically in that in that case I
may say this is the universe of things
that we want to support okay so now you
got to write the app to gracefully scale
itself down to on the older phones to
the capabilities of that phone right so
for example I use up I you as an example
of you guys know what near-field
communication is NFC it's basically a
way to you know just take your phone and
you can just tap on something and and
you know they can pair up it's kind of
like a wireless communication but with
very low friction because the the
distance the physical distance is a
limit it's theoretically impossible to
go beyond a couple of centimeters right
so that's NFC so such it's it's it's
great for payments right so for example
if I want to go to Starbucks I want to
pay for my coffee coffee I could just do
this just tap on a counter and it's done
I don't have to pair with anything I
don't have to scan anything only have to
type anything I'm just basically tapping
my payments process it's it's very low
friction protocol right so say imagine
that for example I am developing a
wallet application right micro payments
applications and like that so you would
want to certainly target that feature
right because it's such a great
feature it's designed exactly for that
the problem is that only one phone
currently has it right it's the the
Nexus galaxy the Nexus S right the other
phone habit but there's a there's about
16 phones in the pipeline that they're
going to have it any day soon right so
you're kind of like okay I wanna I want
to have this capability today but
reality is that very large chunk of the
market doesn't have that capable so your
app should trace fully skilled cell down
on those devices to not to disable that
capability maybe if I'm running it on an
older phone that doesn't have the chip
NFC chip I would still be able to pay
for my Starbucks but I would take by
like QR code or some other mechanism
like that right so but you as a
developer kept to worry about this and
scale down the maybe gray outed button
or take away that feature so we'll talk
about that as we actually keep it you
know get to the code on so but those are
some business decisions to to be made so
now in addition to official stuff so in
addition to stuff that comes out of
Google or more precisely Open Handset
Alliance or even more precisely Android
Open Source Project AOSP you have other
entities basically customizing Android
so making customizations to the Android
and some of the more popular ones are
HTC with its Sense UI Samsung with
TouchWiz and Motorola has nicole
motoblur HTC Sense is probably the most
sophisticated modification sometimes
people refer to these modifications as
on skins or overlays but they're usually
much deeper than that
so HTC Sense team in up in Taiwan it's
it's thought of thousands of engineers
so these guys are it's almost as big of
a team as and rhetoric and droids
original thing right so they actually
substantially modify the platform all
the layers of the platform not just sort
of like oh we made some graphics look
prettier so they did quite a bit of work
for instance right Motorola is now
focusing more on the enterprise sort of
stuff so they've been doing lots of
sort of make making making the devices
being at the enterprise-grade and
Samsung is in terms of software is not
as sophisticated as the other players
right so we'll talk about that and
select around now there's obviously with
Google so Google has its own sort of
add-on and that's basically all the
google goodies like google maps google
gtalk Gmail etc so most of the consumer
phones out there are Google modified
right so it's you kind of have this like
multi multi dimensional sort of model
way to modify the platform on so what
Google stuff is basically proprietary so
that requires licensing and the terms of
those licensing they also usually not
published publicly so we don't really
know what it entails but it's something
that your carrier or om would sign to
basically get you know Google Maps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
