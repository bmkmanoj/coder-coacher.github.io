for coming out tonight when we talk to
you about power profiling my hope is
that by the end of the night you'll have
a good idea of what your options are if
you need to do some power profiling for
your applications before I get started
and tell you a little bit about myself I
was wanted to get some feedback about
who the audiences so QA and testing an
application development looks like it
covers it all okay good so I think this
tacos fit your needs then so my name is
Frank maker as I said before I'm a PhD
student at UC Davis I'm almost finished
so hopefully I'll be able to say PhD
soon my dis my PhD dissertation is about
how to adapt software on smartphones for
fixed energy constraints and so my all
the papers and all the work that I've
done are focused on the problem of how
do you adapt software to different
energy conditions so in order to do that
a big part of the work has been
profiling apps doing power measurements
things like that and I'm actually not in
the computer science department in the
electrical engineering computer
engineering department so I have some
you know academic background in
electronics and went done so I brought
along a little oscilloscope I'll show
you later but if you have any questions
kind of electrical wise like probably
handle those as well so my background
related to mobile well actually in
general let's see I worked for a motor
alotta motive for a couple years when I
got out of undergrad at the University
of Rhode Island when I was when I was an
undergrad I worked in BMW for a few
summers on engine control units so i've
been working in a bed a software for
about 10 years now and then when I came
out to California I switched over to
mobile so I did an internship at
broadcom working on their android device
and if you have that Roku box the
low-cost one I worked on that getting
Android set up on that and then the
summer after that I worked on the Google
Android team writing an obscure little
networking library that nobody will ever
notice other than a system engineer but
I thought it was fun and it's basically
where I'm at so I if you guys could
you have any questions before I get
started okay all right let's get started
then so I'm going to talk about power
profiling so this is the outline of the
talk first I'm going to talk about why
you want to do power profiling which too
many of you may be redundant otherwise
you wouldn't be here I'm going to talk
about the mobile platform in general and
specifically how it's different than a
regular computer cuz a lot of you
probably went to university and learned
about general purpose computers but
smartphones we're kind of in a very
different animal back then so I'm going
to give you an idea of actually what's
under the hood so you can better
understand our power perspective how
things are different then I'm going to
talk about power profiling and
specifically and how it's done and I'll
go into a few different methods that you
can use and then i'll be doing a demo
with an oscilloscope and also show you
how to read read the current using the
internal current sensor on the phone
okay alright so we'll start at the
motivation so the main problem with
power on smartphones is that the
batteries just can't keep up with the
smartphones and this isn't a problem so
much of research and development time
it's really there's some physical
limitations involved so what this chart
shows you up here from next energy is
that the lithium ions we have which are
in this area right here are roughly in
the middle of the pack in terms of the
the weight for a given watt hour so what
hours a unit of energy so the amount of
energy you get for a given kilogram and
then the dense density how much energy
you get for a given leader of volume
there roughly in the middle so in the
future we might be moving to something
like a zinc air battery lithium air I've
heard a lot about but right now we're
stuck right here and that's why your
battery isn't going to get tremendously
better because they're just limitations
on the chemistry itself and a smartphone
has a fixed volume so it's not like you
can just keep throwing more and more
material in there they what the
manufacturers seem to be doing as far as
I can tell is they make the try to make
the phone smaller and the battery bigger
which is one way to do it but there's
just a limit to how far you can go so
the the reason you can't go much further
is because the smartphone is air-cooled
so there's only so much energy that you
can dissipate inside the device of that
with that volume without having to do
some something like forced air cooling
which is what you would do in a regular
computer so on a regular desktop
computer or even a laptop you have a fan
the fan blows air the air wicks away the
heat and that allows you to dissipate up
to about 80 watts of power on on the CPU
but on a mobile device you don't have a
fan and it's also much smaller and it's
in your pocket and sometimes it's on
your dash so there's a lot of scenarios
where you just you can't get rid of all
that energy so that's the main problem
the batteries are not getting
tremendously better so thirty to forty
percent per year might sound pretty good
to you in terms of battery technology
increases but you have to ask yourself
do you think your smartphone is using
thirty to forty percent more power each
year or more I'll tell you it's quite a
bit more when you go from the old
Symbian phones where you had your web
browser and maybe you could see you know
a few movies that were playing to seeing
youtube high-definition 1080p videos
you're going a little faster than thirty
to forty percent a year so the batteries
just can't keep up and to make things
even more interesting the capacity fades
over time so a lot of the lot of your
customers if you're writing applications
they might have a pretty good size
better to begin with but then a year or
two years later some of us are crazy and
keep our phones longer than two years
you know their batteries is much lower
so now they're going to put even more
premium more of a premium on their
battery life so all around it's it's a
it's a big problem and to give you an
idea of where the power goes I put up
this table from a paper at is sec that's
a major circuits conference which just
gives you a breakdown of roughly where
the power goes inside the device
so this is going to vary between
manufacturers but this was from a man
from Nokia back in 2004 so it should be
reasonably close to what it would be
today and the main one is the cellular
so that would be the baseband so that
means any time you're making phone calls
or doing data with over the cellular
radio so that's the big one the next
biggest one is the application processor
and you'll notice i call the application
processor instead of just the processor
and that's because the cellular is also
known as the baseband processor because
those are both too big processors in the
device but the difference is that you
never program this one you always
program this one if you program this one
you work for a company that licenses the
IP to communicate with the cell phone
towers and if you don't you guard this
like crazy so this is the one you're
always working on the memories actually
take a decent amount of power because
they have to retain state so you have
DRAM inside phones and those d Rams have
little capacitors in them and they have
to be continually refreshed in order to
hold the memory so that takes a decent
amount of power and then there's user
interface which would cover the display
the backlight buttons LEDs that sort of
thing audio can also be kind of a second
order power here and then the rest is
other components like Bluetooth the
power manager chip etc so bluetooth is
actually very power efficient so if you
ever have the option to use Bluetooth
over say Wi-Fi or cellular you
definitely should some real circus miss
it's probably somewhere in to the other
GPS isn't isn't that bad actually gps
was the fifth one thank you but the
other thing with GPS is it's not right
it has a different draw it basically the
power varies quite a bit based on
whether you're receiving a lot of
location updates or just a few because
the Jeep the power for GPS there's like
a baseline just for having GPS on and
then there's a little peek for each time
you receive a location where you have to
do these computations to figure out what
the GPS satellites are telling
so it's kind of a hard thing to give
just one number on because it's going to
vary dramatically whether you're here in
San Francisco or if you're out in
Oklahoma or something here okay so just
to once again drive home the physical
limitations here I just put up some
stats about the difference between a
smart phone and a laptop just to give
you an idea of you know how much
dramatically smaller we're talking so
the power budget for smartphones about 3
watts as I told you and for a laptop
around 60 watts so you can see the size
here and then the volumes about 91 cubic
centimeters versus 1500 ish cubic
centimeter so this is dramatically
bigger than this and you can do forced
air cooling so that's why you only get
through you can only get 3 watts here
but then you get 20 times as much power
here ok so now we'll lift the hood a
little bit give you an idea of what's
inside a smartphone so inside a laptop
you essentially have a big processor may
I don't know if they still have
Northbridge and self bridges separate
chips but there's not that many chips
anymore most of its been sucked right
into the general purpose processor and
the reason is because almost everything
is done in software your audio is done
in software videos done and software
almost everything that can be done
software is done in software but on a
smartphone because you only have this 3
watts to play with they break out some
of the more energy intensive
functionality into asics
application-specific integrated circuits
so basically application-specific chips
and so this is a this is a picture of
what a this phone call Nexus 4 when the
Nexus 4 looks like inside so you can see
the system on a chip this is system on a
chip is the for those 0 for more
familiar with a general purpose computer
it's the main processor plus a bunch of
asics that the SOC vendor bundles in GPU
is usually inside there maybe multimedia
codecs things like that but then you
have some other chips as well the
baseband like I was talking about so
this does all the cellular stuff and
this is actually an this is usually an
arm
core there's some x86 is out there now
as well but this is typically an arm
core maybe anything up to like an arm 9
cortex cortex a9 these tend to be an ARM
processor as well but a little bit
slower because they don't need as much
performance because this chip is running
in ER is a real-time chip so everything
has to be done at a certain time and
there's deadlines that need to be met by
the software that's what real time means
whereas this chip is where your software
goes in the operating system and all
that stuff is just best effort so that's
that's one of the reasons they split it
into two chips and you might have NFC
which is in green in the upper left
there an audio chip and pink the power
manager which is in black I don't see it
is it really implac I think it's I think
it's actually in yellow that might be a
typo but anyways what the power manager
does is it just changes the voltage for
all these different chips in order to
reduce the total power you don't really
not have to know much about that and
then on the other the other board here
you have a flash memory which can be
pretty big gyro and accelerometer those
are reasonably power power heavy
considering you run run them for a long
time power amp for the cell phone and
then the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are usually
bundled into the same into a combo chip
and that one is in pink so as you can
see on a normal computer these all this
functionality be inside the one chip but
on a smartphone they've been spread out
into different chips and that is that
that is basically so that they can go
inside to these chips and custom that
custom build the the transistors inside
the chip to do that one purpose and do
it energy efficiently whereas Intel just
throws it all on one chip they've throw
the fan on and then they do it however
they feel like doing it or they might
throw in some extra instructions to make
it work better you know but they get
they have a lot more head room to work
with
so here's another example I'm not going
to go through this one but this is an
iphone 3g so you can see it's pretty
similar now you can notice the
difference between an apple design and a
Google design well I'm not Google a HTC
so you see on HTC there's some green
there's a lot of green for some green
openings I think the biggest openings
here like this and this and I saw a
picture of the latest iPhone and it was
actually even smaller like they really
don't waste any little bit it's pretty
amazing I mean that this layout is just
ridiculous I would not want to be the
person in charge of this this is the
hard is it hardly up as time goes on the
chips the process technology will scale
it'll go down so every you know year
year and a half you know the the fabs
will will shrink the chips so you get
some savings from that so like if you go
to the next generation you might be able
to recoup like I don't know another
twenty percent just on the chips getting
smaller but in terms of the efficiency
of it I mean it's just a very difficult
design to do because each one of these
especially the big chips you know could
be putting off serious amount of power
and then that heat is going to spread
over to the passive components here and
then you got yourself a modeling
nightmare but you know people it makes
sense because it's got it can only be
that big and if you can squeeze all that
functionality and people are willing to
pay for it so this ends your question
okay okay so now out power profiling so
why would you want to do power profiling
1 i'd say the main reason is for
application design feedback so your
design app and the app you don't want
the app to use more better than it has
to in order to give a good experience to
your customer or your whoever installed
your your application and so you need
feedback on different design decisions
you know does code a take more power or
code be that sort of thing driver
development would be another one so if
you're working for especially if you're
working for one of these platform
companies like Intel or Samsung or one
of these companies that makes the actual
chips you can use power profile to tweak
your drivers and decide what your tail
states are going to look like and things
like that and then run tyne adaptation
is one that I've looked at I haven't
seen much of this
done by people in practice but the idea
is if you can measure the power on the
phone itself you could actually adapt
yourself where at runtime so if you
notice the cellular so say you really
want to use cellular like you were
talking about but you give a you know
you're going to put a limit on how high
you're willing to let the power go if
you're able to measure the power on the
phone you could do that so you could
actually have your device you know maybe
it's sending data back to to to drive
ads or something but then once the power
gets over like 715 milliwatts you decide
ok I'm just going to stop and I'm going
to wait till the power comes down you
know something like that so this is a 3
3 reasons for proper feeling that I
could come up with so now i'm going to
talk up a little bit about what power
and energy are just so we're clear on
our terms before i get to how to
actually do the measurements so feel
free to ask questions because people
find this typically get hung up on this
so power is a rate of electrical energy
so it's it's like how much the electrons
are moving and how fast they're moving
to give you a certain amount of power
energy is actually the work being done
so I like to explain this with a driving
analogy so you can think of power as the
speed that your car is going so if I
tell you I'm going 50 miles an hour that
doesn't tell you how far I've gone that
just tells you how far I was going let's
just tell you how quickly I was moving
but then energy is the distance traveled
so energy is often what people mean when
they say power because energy tells you
what you actually did so if you ask me
how much power does it take to send 50
kilobytes I can give you an average
power but i but i can't tell you how
much energy take a the power can't tell
you how much energy it takes to do that
task because that's an energy
measurement because the energy is going
to look at how the power fluctuates over
time and take that and that is how much
it actually costs and so powers measured
in watts and energy is measured in
joules then i only have two equations
here i'm sorry i'm still in academia so
i have to have some math so a jewel is
just one watt per second listen so it's
the number of watts times the number of
seconds
and so energy and we said energy is
measured in joules you can also look as
the integral of power over time which is
the same thing as saying the average
power times the change in time so in
order for you so if you want to measure
power then you just hook up the you know
the scope or look at the current sensor
on the phone like i'm going to show you
and you have your power but usually what
you want is the energy because the
energy is going to tell you between two
different say you're majorly in two
different ways to do some algorithm it's
going to tell you that if you just look
at the power that's going to tell you
how hard the processor was was pushing
in order to do to run the software but
what if one of those pieces of software
runs a lot more quickly than the other
piece so if they if one uses twice as
much power but takes half as much time
the other one uses half as much power
but takes twice as much time you need to
be able to compare those two they might
be the same you know so time is an
important factor to consider when you're
measuring power is that is that pretty
is it clear okay so the first method I'm
going to talk about to do software
measurements is with a software model
and I would say this is the can you guys
see this little as big as I could make
it this is a copy and paste from a
academic paper so I couldn't make
anything bigger so software mall is
probably the most accessible to everyone
because it doesn't rely on any physical
measurements of the phone you do the
measurements offline so you can use
something like an oscilloscope or a
monsoon and I'll talk about some options
and you can store all those measurements
in the table and then use them use them
to do your calculations either on either
in the software or just by hand to
estimate the power so this is one that
was published by some people at
University of Michigan and what they did
was they looked at this is for an HTC
dream phone which is the the first
google the first android phone remember
the big blocky one so they looked at a
few different components
and they basically came up with
Constance so that's these coefficients
here and then they plug them into a
linear model so it's just the
coefficient times a number and then add
those all up and they're able to
estimate the power so you can actually
download the app that these guys made
it's called power tutor or you can
search for this paper here too so
they'll be posting my presentation
online if you if you want to look this
up so if you download their app from the
market called power tutor you can
actually run this model on your phone
and see how much power your phones using
now it's only going to be reasonably
accurate if you have an HTC dream phone
so if you have another phone you know it
might give you a rough estimate but you
if you really want a good model you'd
have to calculate these power numbers
out yourself but there's other there's
other models that weren't published as
well so if you find someone else's
software model like Google for example
they have a software model built into
android that's how you get your battery
usage screen problem there is they don't
give you the numbers unless you have one
of the Nexus phones because the
manufacturers don't want anybody know
those numbers because they don't want
anybody to know anything that might
potentially cause them a problem so sure
yeah so you can go I can show you after
the presentation if you like but you can
go into the android open source code and
find the xml file that has their their
software model numbers so if you have a
phone who's the source code is in the
android open source project and you can
find the constants otherwise you'd have
to go get them yourself or I suppose you
could you might be able to root your
phone and get it that way too but that's
depending on what the Supreme Court says
that may or may not be legal I think
it's currently legal but we do it's
shady and there's another approach which
is very high accuracy but also very
difficult to do in practice which is
system calls so there was a guy from
Purdue that wrote a paper making a model
just on system call so every time a
system call
was made he assigned a certain amount of
power to that and he would look at the
state that the system call is in so this
is your you know your rolls-royce of
power models right here but that's going
to take a lot of effort so if you're
just one developer it's definitely not
worth your time but if you need
something more precise than a system
call method ma is the best you currently
the best you can do
okay so that's a software model approach
so another approach is to do internal
measurements internal measurement which
uses the battery monitor unit inside the
smartphone so the battery monitor unit
is in charge of controlling charging and
discharging in the device so it's the
the chip that decides how much power to
send to your battery when you plug it in
for example whether it because if it's
full it needs to stop sending energy but
what it also does is it tells the system
your estimated remaining battery life
and so in order to do that it has a
little current sensor inside it which
which measures the current and that
feeds that into the model in order to
give you a good estimate how much
remaining battery life you have because
the system needs to know how much
battery life you have in order to shut
down cleanly if your battery life goes
too low so the picture i have here is
from a nokia app this is for the s60 so
i haven't seen a nap since i haven't
seen any apps for any of the modern
smartphone devices that do this but the
nokia platform did have one and what it
does is it graphs the reading from the
current sensor as it comes in so now
this probably looks pretty good too but
the problem with one of the problems
with these sensors that they have a very
slow update rate so this the the time
difference between any of these two
points is actually 250 milliseconds so a
quarter of a second so in terms of
telling you precisely what the power is
the measurements going to be off by by a
good bit but in but in terms of giving
you quanta qualitative feedback between
where the power is going how much it is
it's probably pretty good for that but
you can't use it unless you're doing
symbian development so sorry but some
some android phones do have these
current sensors specifically the ones
from HTC so i have an HTC nexus one over
here that has one in it and i'm going to
show you how to see the current on here
but you basically have to look at the
particular device you have to see if it
has the current sensor net
but because all the Android devices for
example or run linux it'll be in the
same place as I show you so if it does
have it it'll show up in this a similar
path but for iphone I think I don't know
what they have so is anybody doing any
other platforms like blackberry movie no
windows poor windows mobile no love they
actually came to Davis a couple weeks
ago and they have it gave up pizza and
Microsoft D garb and all that stuff and
they were giving a hundred dollars to
any student that wrote a windows mobile
app while they were there in the class
and I walked by there cuz I had to go
home to pick up my kids there's only
like 10 people in there I felt a vad
alike you know they're giving away money
and like still nobody will come I feel
bad for her because Windows Mobile is
actually a pretty nice phone but it just
doesn't seem to be cat doesn't seem to
be catching on as much as they'd like
okay so the last method which i think is
the most likely for all of you is
external measurement so they'll be using
some sort of benchtop equipment in order
to do that you can either use a monsoon
which is a device is specifically
designed to do this for for smartphones
that's what this picture is here and I
included the URL here in case you want
to buy one I think it's about five
hundred dollars so sorry 800 now okay
used to be 500 okay there make a nice
little profit up there so if you buy a
monsoon that'll that'll definitely fit
your needs if you want to do something a
little more lower costs for example oh
this oscilloscope here i bought costs
three hundred dollars so and it works
just fine so what you need to do is you
need to set up a current sensor resistor
so find find your your friend that likes
to do soldering and get them to solder
resistor for you if you're if you don't
if you're not into that and basically
what you do is you hook the resistor up
between the positive rail coming out of
the battery so the positive side of the
battery you you connect the resistor
between that and the phone
so that way the resistor is sitting in
between the phone and the battery and
then because of Ohm's law some of you
may may be familiar with you can basic
you can basically measure the voltage on
this resistor and it's proportional to
the current going through the resistor
and since the same current is going
through this resistor that's going to
your phone that's your measurement for
your phone so I actually have this set
up here on my phone so if you want to
come take a look at it after you can
feel free but that's really all you have
to do and then you measure you measure
here for voltage because power is
voltage times current so you measure
here for voltage and then you measure
across the resistor for current and if
you multiply those two together you have
your power pretty straightforward so I
just want to give you a couple tips and
then I'll do a demo showing you and how
to read internal current measurement and
then the external with the oscilloscope
so the first tip I found that a hundred
million current sense resistor worked
pretty well so I tried a 10 million and
the signal was really small and it was
hard to pick up on my oscilloscope so as
a rule of thumb i'd recommend the point
one because the higher you go with the
resistance the more less power you're
leaving for the phone so if you make the
resistor too big the phone won't even
turn on so this this this value worked
pretty well for me the resistor itself
you're going to need so package is the
name for the type of resistor because
there's all different types of resistors
based on how much power they're designed
to handle so you need one that's 100
milliwatts or more roughly if you're
using a power supply so in this diagram
I showed the just using the smart phone
battery and you're just putting the
current in the middle but you could take
the smartphone battery out and use some
sort of power meter like not power meter
power supply thank you so you could use
a power supply here as well if you do
that make sure it's at the current limit
that's if you accidentally touch
something you could fry your phone so
when I first started Davis we had this
box of about 50 phones and my first
couple weeks that I fried like five
until I started studying the current
limit so the current limit does is it
tells the power supply don't give any
more current than this because there's
you might you might need to go up to 1
amp maybe if you're doing cellular stuff
because you'll have these little tiny
high amp pulses but certainly not over 1
amp if you're doing more than one anthem
something's broken in the phone I used
copper braid for the connections so any
of these any of you that are done
tinkering with soldering irons copper
braid is this really flat metal wire so
if you go into radio shack and you have
some for copper braid you'll find it and
then the nice thing about copper braid
is since it's so flat but it's
conductive you can squish it in between
the battery and the phone so you don't
have to change you don't have to solder
to anything and that means the setup i
have here is with copper read you can
see the coppery color here that means if
i take everything off take all the
electrical tape off and everything the
phone looks the same as it did before i
started because i used to do before i
knew what the copper braid was i would
soldered directly to the battery which
means now the battery can't be used the
way it was before right because now I've
messed up all the pads you know the the
plastic is melted and things like that
but if used the copper braid then you're
you're good to go tape down the probes
this I you know I surprised it took me
like five years to figure this out but
if you just tape down the probes then
they don't wiggle out and the phone
doesn't get schiller did and your
measurement doesn't get messed up if you
don't tape the probes and you're going
to hit it you're gonna bump it to just
take down the probes and you will have
any trouble yeah just one day I was like
you know I should just tape this down
and then another nice trick is using adb
over Wi-Fi so you can download an app
there's a few of them on the market that
will allow you to run adb over the Wi-Fi
interface instead of USB what that lets
you do is unplug the charger here unplug
the USB from the phone the reason you
want to do that is because the USB is
going to charge the phone so you're
going to get positive current
measurements so you're going to think
that you violated you know some basic
law of the universe because you're
getting more energy out than you put in
but it's really because you have it
plugged into the computer
so if you want negative if you want true
current measurement you have to unplug
it with us V and I found Wi-Fi over 80
be was pretty useful because then you
can load the program that you're going
to test you can get some debugging info
but then you need to turn Wi-Fi off
unless you want to unless you're going
to subtract it out of your measurements
which you can do as well but so that's
another handy tip because if you leave
it plugged into USB you're going to
think that you you I don't know what you
think but your measurements will be
wrong you might even get 0 I've gotten
zero before I was like zero what the
hell so all right so now I'm gonna do a
demo so i'll start with the oscilloscope
okay so this is a cheapy oscilloscope i
got it's a taiwanese company it's called
Rigel and for 300 bucks I think it's a
really good deal for an oscilloscope if
you want one so so what you're seeing
here are the measurements across the
current sensor so if i turn the phone on
i hope you can see this you can see the
now the powers gone up quite a bit and
now it went down because the phone
turned off so let me just turn it on and
i'm going to run i'm going to run this
app i have that runs through some tests
so what's a good one I'm cell phone on
I'll run a cellular test so this test
sends a bunch of UDP packets out over
the cellular radio so you can see how
the power just spiked quite a bit
there's nice scale thing
make it a little smaller so you can see
it better let me run it again
i shouldn'ta fiddle with it now it's
there we go
yeah so you can see the power that's
going through the cellular so cellular
has a lot of funkiness with the power
that's why I decided to run that
benchmark but you could run something
like a CPU where you just run some
software at one hundred percent of the
CPU and that test will just look like a
straight line so you probably can't see
this but basically the power jumps up
and then it stays at a constant power
rate so that's how you do it so you guys
can come take a look closer after the
talk it's probably hard to see
especially if you're over there but
that's that's my setup for the current
measurement thank you that's very
attention
