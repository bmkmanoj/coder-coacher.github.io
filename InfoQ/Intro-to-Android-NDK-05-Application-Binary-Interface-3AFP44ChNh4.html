library goes into the libs directory in
fact we can take a look at it like this
the libs arm lib Marikana as so you'll
actually see that's where the final
product is and if I do a file on this
file which is a UNIX or Mac command
you'll see that this has been compiled
as a 32 bit elf shared library object
specifically for arm now let's see how
we basically can change this or how we
can expand on this so what if for
example we know that we're going to run
our application or applications on non
arm environments or arm environments
with say the seven instruction set
support so how do we essentially control
the application binary interface or the
ABI well there's a couple of ways one is
we could simply go and rerun the NDK
build command like for example I can
type indicate build clean to get rid of
all the bring all the files and now what
I can do is I can say hey I want to
actually run the NDK build but I want
the application abi abi to be for
example x86 peer enter and now it's
going to compile specifically for x86 as
opposed to the are maybe high so I can
show you file libs x86 the file and
you'll see that it's for Intel 386
instruction set so what if I wanted all
of them like another approach would have
been for me to save all hit enter and
what now I would do is it would actually
build or compile this for all the ABI is
that it's currently supports so right
now you'll see that it has arm
ABI our v7 ABI and the x86 you can also
control not not say all but save only
the specific ones for example let's say
that you specifically need the use of
the neon instruction set they
bubble in our mv7 so then what you could
do is you can say I want this one
so you copy this and you paste it and I
want x86 for example maybe because
you're using you know the equivalent
assembly instructions in x86 you just
need to basically pass this as a
essentially a setting you hit enter and
now it's composite specifically just for
these two environments now
specifying the arm or the app ABI on the
command line is all nice and dandy but
what if we actually want this to be
fixed as part of our project so as
opposed to saying it like this we kind
of want to go and configure it in a file
so that anyone who ever goes around NDK
build in our projects directory compiles
the ABI is that we instructed it to so
now we're going to see is another file
that we can optionally create in this
case you'll see it's called application
dot m'kay it is similar to Android @mk
but in the difference being is that
engine MK is specific to how to compile
the code whereas application that I'm K
sets up some Global's properties or
environment variables one of which is
the app API so let's go and create that
file so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go over here into my and my
j'ni directory and create a new file so
a new file and say application dot MK
hit finish and here's the file all I now
need to do is go back over here where I
for example specified the app API and
now what I can do is I can copy this and
go for example into my my application
m'kay and say oh by the way I want to
for example include all of the supported
abis so now that I've done this I can do
an NDK clean so that I'm back to square
box NDK build clean clean I'm back to
square one I'm going to clear the screen
and type NDK build without actually
specifying any additional parameters on
the command line hit enter and as you
see it actually goes
compiles the same code three times for
three different a/b is the RMV 5v7 and
x86 effectively making our application a
fat binary so you'll see under the libs
directory in fact I can just do like
this
find libs you'll see there are three
different sub directories each one
containing the same same essentially a
library of course compiled for the
different instruction set now hopefully
that explains the ABI but one thing I
haven't quite to explain is how does
this work at runtime how do we actually
load this library how do we load the
correct library well one thing we'll see
is that once our application gets
packaged they all of these libraries
that we see here all the different you
know compiled libraries will become part
of our apk but at the installation time
so once our application is actually
installed on the target device the
system because it inherently knows what
is its optimal ABI it will pick one of
these libraries and install it as our
application library going forward so now
how do we actually tell the system to
load the libraries so that we actually
can take advantage of it so we can bind
our Java functions to the libraries
functions so that that's the one step
that we missed
notice that this library is called in
this case where it gets loaded it's
called Lib more we get a call more econo
android fibonacci native fib live dot s
so that happens to be the full name so
and in fact where this name is defined
is inside of this Android m'kay that we
took a look at previously so right here
what I have highlighted so this is the
essentially logical name of our library
the fact that it happens to live in a
particular directory and the fact that
he has prefixes blip and excuse me and
the dot s so is just a side of at a
side-effect of how essentially J and I
in this case NDK work so what I'm really
interested in is this is this name this
is the the name in the middle that's the
name that I assigned to my library so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
back to my java class which this is
where I implemented the two Java methods
and find the two native methods and I'm
going to go over here and say hey when
this class is loaded okay and the way
you can do this is you can create a
static block you can say when this class
is loaded I want the system to help load
a library by a particular name the name
is essentially the name that I gave to
this class at runtime or say sorry the
name that I gave this class in the
Android or MK file so at runtime when
this gets executed the system will
automatically prefix this with Lib and
add the suffix of dot s so and then
search for the library in a well-known
directory that's essentially what NDK
will enable for us and so now we're
essentially done we have created a
library and we've compiled it so to kind
of look at could take a look at our
diagram we have done all of this all of
this is now complete the only remaining
part is to actually use our library and
then through that you know use so use
the Java class which will then use the
new dynamic library and see that
everything works so let's let's actually
try that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
