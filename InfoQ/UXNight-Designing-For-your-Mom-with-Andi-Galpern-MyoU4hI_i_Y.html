thanks for coming out tonight
my name is dandy gal fern I am the
founder of Cascade SF or basically of
health in here
we're an organization dedicated to
teaching the latest tips and tricks and
the web design industry so that would
cover user experience design front-end
development content everything for the
web and usually I am the one who is
introducing other people tonight I'll be
introducing myself so designing for your
mom I want everybody to give me a round
of applause for us getting started yay
there you go my name is Andy gale
Coronas mentioned I'm the founder of
Cascade SF I'm also a UX UI designer I
call myself a strategist because I like
to think of different ways to kind of
get the user engaged and you can find me
on twitter at andy galperin at cascade
SF to keep up with our events tonight is
the first night of UX night we're going
to be having these events continuously
and basically teaching everybody about
user experience and we would like for
any of you guys to volunteer it to be a
speaker if you are interested send me an
email
andy at cascade SF comm so tonight is a
big night tonight is a really big night
guys and the reason that it's a big
night is because tonight I'm gonna
introduce you to somebody very close to
me very near and dear and she's been a
part of my life for my whole life and
tonight you're gonna meet my mom this is
Stacey gal fern this is my mom
yes I guess I'm just gonna cross those
this fine okay she lives in Hollywood
Florida
that's where I'm from she worked as an
elementary school teacher for 25 plus
years just retired last week she adores
her family and that's all of us
she loves to travel and more than
anything she really loves a travel deal
yes so she goes on the Google she types
with two fingers and she looks up the
hotel deals in San Francisco and she
finds this mess Travelocity can any of
you guys actually tell me well first of
all we are gonna talk about design
tonight just so you know not it's not
just about my mom but I'm I'm clicking
the wheel and going very slowly to
trying to not go to many pages but okay
so can any of you guys tell me what is
wrong with this design cluttered okay
yes
so there's no visual hierarchy mm-hmm
the ads are taking precedence over the
content so there's no clear
call-to-action okay my mom would say I'm
not sure where to start okay
so basically I'm going to tell you
basically a trick to creating user
experience design and it's pretty you
know it's so it's simple and this didn't
come with some research but basically if
you apply w3c accessibility guidelines
and Gestalt principles you'll create the
ultimate user experience and I'll show
you where I'm coming from here and
basically good salt principles were
developed in the 20s in Germany and they
include proximity continuity similarity
figure-ground and closure we're only
gonna focus on for them tonight which
are proximity continuity similarity and
figure-ground relationships the slides
will be available yes except for when
you launch them you get really fun music
to listen to in the background all right
so here's proximity proximity is where
items are placed in relationship to one
another now when we look at this this
example right here
I basically zoomed in on the one area
that is the point of the whole message
the proximity is a little odd right
there because we have the headline this
area kind of looks like a button it's
got like a really weird gradient if you
guys are gonna look at it on a decent
screen cuz this one's a little blown out
the headline should behave like a
headline they should connect to each
other if you're gonna give somebody
steps you guide them you don't stack it
left to right and also can anybody else
tell me what's wrong with those design
is it hard to read hmm I hear like
little little they do tell you but they
don't connect it well and the alignment
is kind of strange too because this is
right aligned this is left aligned this
is left aligned it's like make up your
mind people so also the poor use of
gradients if it's a button
no it make it look like a button that is
not a button so why have gradients that
have create separation that doesn't make
sense in between each each table or
whatever they created of this it looks
like a button because there's like
there's a gradient that goes from light
to dark here and it creates it's kind of
a bulge like tummy thingy they're trying
to create separation you know like the
alternate deeper effect but but it
doesn't work for this and that usually
works for long longer lines of content
so basically I just mean it as clear and
as clean as possible and this is really
the message tonight is to simplify and
group related content together so the
user knows exactly what to do where are
you visiting or visiting San Francisco
I'm checking in on this day of checking
out on this date rooms I want one and
then you know have a little bit of fun
with the the button find me a great deal
do something that's that not just search
but what am i doing remind the user what
they're actually doing when they when
they go to click on that call to action
alright and continuity create the
easiest path for the user to follow we
have our eyes everything is aligning to
the left and
that makes it a lot easier to follow I'm
gonna go into this right here and you
guys are all gonna thank me after you
see these next slides because they're
pretty useful all right so there is a
study on UX matters and basically they
had studied how long does it take for
your eye to be able to follow a form and
I know have you guys any of you guys
read mobile first or web design any of
Luke Wu's books no if you haven't you
should he has a book from from rosenthal
that's very very strong and also the
mobile first book is excellent and he
also spoke at a cafe does haven't been
americano had taped it and it's online
as well but here you go it took 500
milliseconds for the user to process a
left online label to the left field of
the input fields there's some kind of
beeping going on back there please turn
it off thank you
alright so there's you see this space
right here when you left align something
it takes longer to connect the label and
the actual input field so this is the
longest time next you have the right
aligned labels to the left of input
fields where it took 240 milliseconds
some of the more advanced people it took
them 170 milliseconds it was a little
quicker cuz they everything knew what to
do and then I think you have a left at
my label above the input field
it only took 15 milliseconds because
they're able to quickly scan the
information and go through very quickly
and that is the winner got a little cut
yeah so what so what does that teach you
guys yes and also they said that it took
a little bit longer for when the label
was folded it actually took longer to
process the information so it's actually
better than not to have it bolded
alright so also of continuity create the
easiest path for the user we're looking
here
um JetBlue which is kind of you know
second runner-up to Virgin America for
me what is the issue here do you guys
see an issue with the design awesome
good job exactly that is where do I pick
the D it's like you know this stuff
eventually the user might fill out but
the idea behind good user experience
design is that they're immediately gonna
figure out because there's one path if
you create you know you don't the person
doesn't have to stop and process
information that's just there and you
know how my mom I type the limit the
reference is not okay so here exactly so
the arrow goes down here and you're
thinking that it's gonna the information
that's gonna be here so you immediately
look here and then you're wait a minute
this is August this is not July and July
is right there so the best way to do
this kind of design is to use a date
picker like that so basically you have
the left and the right to be able to
toggle through the months and it goes
right you know drops down below yes
agreed but if they're gonna but it in
the sense that they're pushing it to the
left where it says July it's it doesn't
work and twice you can always go back
left and right you know if you're on
mobile would they would they make the
screen you know or have it drop down and
give you two months or if they give you
one option give you the user less
options and you'll be able to guide them
closer to your business goals all right
sure if anybody's seen this I know will
you've seen it because I showed this to
you before but similarity similarity
it's another gestalt principle and
basically it used for painting elements
people will know what what they need to
do now does anybody recognize the colors
are little distorted because of the
screen but does anybody recognize where
these buttons or you can pick out
basically with the brand and it's based
on the buttons then we're gonna guess
the first person to guess it correct
gets a book wait hold on wait wait we're
gonna get we're gonna okay first of all
no no travel sites here so they'll just
give that's the only hint you're getting
by the way now wait wait so you know
this is like school you can only talk if
you raise your hand and and you're
already excluded cuz you talk too much
so no okay you know it's okay what were
you gonna say
the first one is no wait we can't talk
unless you raise our hand yes okay you
get a book yes yes thank you for having
good manners
that's okay I do it to nori yes you got
it I'm gonna give you a book but we only
have a few to give away stuff you get
yes you know it's weird because I don't
remember the but I mean now that I'm
thinking about it maybe this sign-in
button on Google was read but it's it's
yeah yep that's why you notice good eye
unless you work do work for Google no
okay yes ah awesome did you look this up
okay anybody else yes nope all right and
you know what the bottom honestly the
bottom left you guys would recognize if
you actually saw it on the screen
it's flicker and this is really pink I
love on the actual Retina display but I
wrote down the here are the answers
Google Twitter Facebook Flickr and
Pinterest these are just five five out
of them we have well there's many many
there's a whole test here and I put the
URL of course I'm gonna have a link to
the slide it's from medium calm and you
basically take the test I think there's
like 15 different design tests and the
idea is just to use consistent buttons
and what was your name yeah what is that
Yang Ming yang blinging and said make
sure like to know do it all the little
details are what makes the brand so try
to have create that in your style guide
and reuse them throughout the site so
people can recognize your brand and easy
to recognize all right
now we're going to talk about
readability actually legibility
legibility is the ability to read to see
something and be able to read it with
your eye as an readability is actually
the ability to process content and how
smooth that it communicates that wasn't
communicated very smoothly okay
this site is awful I don't even know how
it exists in 2013 but it's digital
hollywood.com it's yeah I actually had
to cut out the banner on the top because
because I wanted to show you guys what
the content was um I'm gonna fall asleep
just reading this all the way across
because it's a lot to scan there's a
roll it's um basically do any of you
guys program okay do you use the blank
text editor yeah and they tell you you
can actually set the width of the
columns they say that in according to
the to the w3c they say you say 88
character rule to keep text easily
scannable so basically we just have like
80 characters maximum you don't want it
too short because then your eyes are
jumping all the time but if it's too
wide then you're gonna be like and also
it's real it's kind of hard to read as
well so except for captions and images
of text text can be resized without
assistive technology up to 200% without
the laws of content or functionality and
that makes sense when cuz if you were to
zoom in really close you won't be able
to to where the lighting was really
really long and you don't be able to
process everything alright this you guys
will thank me for if you don't already
know about it this is awesome this is
one of the coolest discoveries that I
have found in a long time
and this is the golden ratio of
typography and there's an actual
mathematical formula to this or you can
just go to the site which is personified
first pure certified typography and
basically you type in the font size use
you know you can use Photoshop or
InDesign or even just like measure it
with a screen capture of whatever the
width of the actual content is so say
that this is 700 pixels and this is size
say 14 or 15 type it will actually tell
you what is the best optimal line height
for this particular circumstance so is
it's awesome it's really good for
readability and especially it's like in
in print design they would tell us to go
you know two to three points letting and
for web design it's a little bit
different because well you know it's
line height and actually there's a
little bit more space in order for
people to read and process content early
long alright and is is anybody a
designer for email blasts are you too
embarrassed to admit it you are okay so
so what are the things what are the
frustrations that you have with
designing for do you have you seen
litmus before so no okay yeah so there's
a tool actually it's called litmus and
you can use it with MailChimp or with
your email client and it will take
screenshots across every browser on
various devices including mobile and
give you a preview of how it's going to
look so you basically instead of you
know having a million devices it gives
you an accurate preview
it's called litmus Li T and the US the
images with with the text as images is
an issue especially now we have Typekit
we have at font that you know
to import functionalities and CSS
there's no reason that that Nordstrom as
beautiful as their products are should
be having type that is as an image
especially for SEO if they want people
to be able to find it on search you can
use an alt tag but there's nothing like
having the real tight in the browser in
the code there we go and and also I was
actually appalled I just went on Macy's
site they must not have a lot of
resources but I was completely appalled
they have this whole thing was an image
except except for the navigation on the
top they actually use image maps I was
really upset yeah is made me cry no um
it's it's kind of ridiculous this should
be you know they I'm guessing they don't
have the resources or they just don't
think that it matters that much or it's
just a really fast sale that they don't
think it's worth it so they're gonna
duplicate I don't know but don't don't
use Texas images it's not good for for
zooming it's not good for content
research ability and somebody is
anything going baby who works at Macy's
because I need to tell them well did you
have a question no oh great and this is
actually so I recently got a MacBook Pro
Retina display and once you get that you
really notice how poor image quality is
if it's not saved correctly but there's
a solution for that I'm trying to make
everything that you can save it as in
css3 or coded in CSS 3 we have gradients
you get shadows there's a lot of ways to
get a quality clear image or just you
know simulate what an image would look
like with css3 so try to use that as
much as possible import font faces font
families and we also have CSS events
because I look CSS
all right so this is kind of funny
going back to my mom separate note we're
going back to fist op principles which
is figure and ground it's probably one
of the most important principles and
they basically teaches you to use
contrast as separate items and that way
you understand what is on the front what
is the next part it helps you separate
hierarchy but my mom actually
understands Netflix really well and
their interface was really easy to use
and so when she was visiting me a couple
months ago she was using Netflix and
suddenly I'm getting the worst
recommendations oh it's like oh man I
don't you know so so basically using
contrast two separate items it does help
and also this is similarity we have a
grid system so all these are the same
size you know that they're movies or TV
shows you know that you can watch them
because you're used to the sizing of
everything next okay this is really cool
um do you guys we use Airbnb just maybe
use Airbnb okay
they have um one of the things about
accessibility that we were talking about
is that it's funny out that all these
these you know they say somebody's blind
or deaf or they can't you know they
can't see something clearly it's we're
all kind of the same we're all kind of
we need to know something this minute we
need to have the information to us right
now or else it's not going to process
and basically when we go to hover on
something Airbnb
does this when you hover they make it
very very very clear and even on the
input selectors when you go to click on
an input they they color it and with the
pink bright glowing shadow and you know
that you're there they're basically
reminding you that you are on this state
they're using strong visual
reinforcement to let you know
what you're doing it's very very helpful
all right so this is taken from the w3c
in this technique when they use their
places focus on an element using the
mouse tab key arrow keys keyboard
shortcuts or any other method the
application makes that focus more
visible using a combination of highly
contrasting color a thick line and other
visual indicators such as a glow
so this is actually an accessibility
guideline to tell people when they're
going to hover over something make sure
they that they know where they are
so always remind the user where they are
given visual feedback and this article
is really really useful
it's a contrasting meaning article it's
by Andy Rutledge he writes a lot of very
useful articles and it's run a list of
heart and so simply put contrast is that
the root of almost everything you'll
accomplish with design so as long as
people know where they are it's gonna
make a big difference all right so
backing up just kind of wrapping things
up going back Gestalt principles we have
proximity continuity similarity figure
and ground closure is kind of like the
FedEx symbol if you guys saw the FedEx
logo and they have the arrow your eye
automatically completes the missing
piece but we wanted to focus on the top
for today and every design choice that
you make needs to serve a clear purpose
if it doesn't serve a purpose get rid of
it because what is the point of it being
there if it's not doing anything it's
just there it's like a pretty you know
pretty girl who's just not saying
anything she's just kind of in the way
but it's like nice to look at it like
okay we're done get out our goal is for
everyone to understand the point of a
site immediately whenever you guys are
going to design a site like the hardest
part is in the beginning of creating a
site is an understanding what is the
point say that to yourself when you're
going to design something what is the
point what
my time to reach here what what am I
trying to communicate if you say that's
yourself before designing anything you'd
be able to instead of just like creating
wireframes sketches you're gonna
actually write everything out and to
just explain content and the actual
writing is gonna turn into visuals but
the visuals are gonna make a lot more
sense because it's all centered around
functionality does that make sense yes
trying to make it as clear as possible
the other thing it was kind of funny
my father he always says to me when
you're you know I said to him one day
dad I can't write I don't know how to
write there I just write and that sounds
like rambling was like the way I talk
and he's like you know writing is
actually very simple
all you have to do is write everything
on paper and then you subtract you edit
it so it makes more sense then you end
it so it makes even more sense and then
you keep editing it and then you show it
to your friend and they're like does
this make sense and I yes but um design
is the same thing we're just creating
something and then you're cutting it
down cutting it down cutting it down so
that way you have the core of the
message and that's the most important
part is just making sure that everything
is clear it's as simple as possible it
makes sense and my mom needs to
understand it as well so it makes sense
for everybody including my mom the one
thing one thing I'm gonna close out with
here is that when we're designing if you
use those accessibility standards and
you take a look at them and see that
they're not only applicable to people
who you know who have disabilities
they're applicable for everybody like
Jeffrey Zalman had said and designing
with web standards designed for the
lowest common denominator and that way
everybody can understand it it's not
that we're just designing specifically
for them on a separate site if we have
everything simple for everybody then
we'll all get the same message
and it will make sense so my mom
essentially if I'm going to be designing
for her I'm going to be designing for me
without the mouse click but yes but see
this this doesn't move and that's all
