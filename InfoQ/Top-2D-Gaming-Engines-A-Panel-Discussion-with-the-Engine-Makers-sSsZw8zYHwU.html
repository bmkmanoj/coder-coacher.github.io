the things that is one of the more
interesting parts of the game industry
right now is that there is no 2d clearly
dominant platform game development while
right now and many of you who were
familiar with it for years there was
there was torque and there was unity and
there's but there were some other so in
3d unity is pretty dominant right now we
don't know how long that will last but
it's definitely the case right now and
2d flash was fairly dominant and now is
undergoing a lot of changes because of
the ability to or lack of ability to be
on on tablets and phones in the web
browser so we're seeing some strong 2d
contenders come out and some of them are
represented here so what I'd like them
to do is go through some slides and then
we'll ask some questions so the first
one up is it's gamesalad hi so my name
is Steve felter I'm the CEO of game
salad for those of you not familiar with
GameSalad we are a visual based game
creation platform we use a drag-and-drop
environment and the first reaction I get
when I say that as well you can't make
very successful games if you're making
drag-and-drop games but we've had so
we're now close to 300,000 developers
added roughly 200,000 developers in the
past year built over 50,000 games of
those 8,000 games are on the iOS App
Store last year about roughly fifteen
and twenty percent of every game in the
iOS App Store was built up our platform
and we've had 60 games over 60 games
reach the top 100 in the iOS App Store
which may not sound like a very very big
feet but it's actually pretty tough to
get there we've had ten games reached
the top 20 and we've had a game reached
number one number two and number five so
it's definitely not the platform don't
hand don't hate the platform we've seen
some great developers on our platform
and you know what ultimately our mission
is to make game creation accessible to
much larger audience and I think
historically game creation has been
limited to those who know how to code
and you know in particularly not with
the Apple platform fairly esoteric
language is required to code there so we
really opening this up to much larger
developer base so we've kind of tapped
in that audience and made it more
accessible and then we've also found
people that are you know X flash
programmer is now getting into mobile
and they really like using our product
because you know it's intuitive and it's
also faster dev times allows them to
iterate faster in the market and then
now that we support Android publishing
native publishing and we also support
html5 publishing so those are the three
big platforms we we think are going to
win out here in the future and that's
what we're getting behind as a company
and then I guess on top of that there's
one more slide here that just shows you
a little development comparison but
again you know you're probably familiar
with this this this environment of the
left here you know some some form of
scripting involved in creating these
games we've really approached it from a
different angle and and try to translate
it into a visual environment that
appeals to designers and creative
professionals and those are really you
know feel comfort on the the adobe
photos dobby creative suite will find
themselves very at home with games salad
and so again we're opening up game
development to a much lower larger
audience and making it accessible to
those that don't know how to code and
we're also allowing those that do know
how to code multi-platform publishing
and much faster times to develop so
that's Kim celled in a nutshell thank
you and congratulations on a very
designer friendly engine so I'm from
anscombe mobile we make Corona SDK we're
also a two-day 2-d game engine or App
Engine because you can't you can make
more than just games with hands cut with
corona um quick rundown on corona we're
also cross-platform mobile development
framework you develop in Lua you write
once one of the great things about
corona is that you you do code but it's
still it's very easy to use and that's
why developers of all skill levels read
like corona you use the language called
Lua that's very easy to learn very easy
to set up and start running with it and
the way we've abstracted out complexity
makes it super easy to build really
complex games if you want to do that so
for example we have a video up on
YouTube that shows that in five lines of
code you can add physics to your game
and it really is that easy easy and you
compare that the hundreds of lines of
code just getting set up an Xcode so
that's you right once you then you know
add all sorts of services physics
monetization platforms we have a couple
of ad networks built-in we have full
Facebook integration we have twitter
integration there's a bunch of things
you can add to your to your game and
then you publish to the major platform
so today we support the iOS app store
apple app store the android market and
then the amazon store for the kindle and
the no caps which are slightly different
flavors of android and our developers
seen great results there and then we had
all sorts of services as well after that
like I said monetization as well as
other things we're adding to the
platform so if you go to the next slide
we have tens of thousands of developers
using Corona worldwide everything
literally everything from small
independent guys that are just doing
this on on their extra time to real game
studios that are now standardizing on
corona to publishers of books to
agencies and so for example there's the
movie The Lorax is coming out next month
their app is done with corona the
Dolphin Tale movie a month ago was done
with corona a year ago we had a nap made
by a fourteen-year-old called bubble
ball that made it to the number one free
app on the App Store shows the power of
anyone to build with corona there's a
map right now called the LA City which
made it to number two in the Amazon
Appstore number one in the UK App Store
his previous appt secretive grisly manor
made it was number one in the Amazon
Appstore recently or one of the app
store so we get all sorts of apps to
make it the top charts every single week
that's that's a quick rundown if you
actually do code but it's very powerful
great performance very easy to use and
applicable across all sorts of apps and
developers
and congratulations on on a successful
engine that is very well respected and
also extremely well supported hi I'm Ben
savage i'm the founder of spaceport
spaceport is a newer addition to the
list of 2d engines we just launched at
the end of last year spaceport is the
engine 4x flash developers we are very
very specifically trying to make flash
developer is able to publish
cross-platform high-performance games
similarly we support publishing to iOS
to Android to flash for web browsers as
well as html5 we already have a
functioning flash to spaceport converter
which is up on our website that you can
try out for free you can continue to use
the same adobe tools that you're used to
using like the flash I de tu aura or
Photoshop and illustrator to create
vector artwork to create bitmap artwork
then run it through our engine which as
you see in this video automatically
converts that into our format which uses
hardware acceleration to do all of the
same vector graphics and animations that
you're able to do in flash and by virtue
of being hardware accelerated our engine
is all built in C++ and OpenGL you get
the best possible performance that you
can on a mobile phone so we expose
pretty much the entire flash API to you
as a developer if you're coding you can
write your games once in JavaScript
which is way more similar to
ActionScript compared to languages like
Lua it's ECMA just like action script is
we have an abstraction for doing classes
and four modules just like you would an
ActionScript and the full flash API if I
things like movie clip and loader and
stage with all the same methods the same
properties that take the same arguments
and do the same thing so if you have an
existing flash game and you'd like to
launch it on iOS and Android spaceport
is the platform of choice you can
continue to use a designer oriented tool
like the flash idea to create you
artwork as well as being able to code
and have those two work together nicely
okay I have some questions for everybody
there and I sent these out beforehand so
it'd be fair and everybody knew what the
questions were asked to the different
people so gamesalad I will start with
you first of all interestingly all three
of these engines although they've all
decided to target the same platforms
Android iOS and typically html5 and then
I'm sure they'll look sport though
they'll also probably check out which
the TVs are working and I wouldn't
surprise me if something if something
becomes popular they support those two
but interestingly they've all got three
different ways of making money and
that's fascinating in some ways and you
as a game developer should probably be
aware of that as you're making as you're
trying to understand this so okay
GameSalad is probably the easiest to
understand because people may maybe not
and then please educate us go ahead and
tell us all right come see me so I think
that similar to others we do have an
annual subscription fee for a pro
version of our software I think
something that's relatively new that may
be in somewhere of is that we we have a
bunch of monetization services as well
that are integrated right into the
platform so particularly in a
drag-and-drop environment and you're
dealing with a you know developer base
that may not be necessarily a
sophisticated to do all the types of
integrations with these with these SDKs
and the monetization services they can
literally drag and drop these integrated
forms of monetization so if you want any
type of AD if we just partnered with a
company called keep which is in-game
achievements and sponsored achievements
we also partner with a company called
play Haven which is a cost per install
referral network that monetizes
extremely well so we're able to go to
these monetization partners and with our
scale were able to negotiate really
aggressive rates with them we still pass
on to our developers the normal rate
that they would have received had they
done a direct deal but we kind of get
wholesale rates and so we're all able to
monetize as well that way and then we're
also well I'm sorry
can you can you go over that really
quickly sure so if you want to just drag
and drop these these monetization
services in there exactly and then we're
able to bring our scale to these
advertising partners in our in our large
developer base and we're able to
negotiate favorable rates and basically
take the spread and then pass the
restaurant or developers and then on top
of that we'll be announcing a kind of a
series of distribution partnerships with
large internet companies and
international partnerships that will
help bring distribution opportunities to
our developer base and we're able to
basically monetize as that so I kind of
stand corrected they do have a model
that people are going to recognize from
unity you know the free or the or the
paid and you get you get more ways to to
make things with the with the paid but
they also have have partnerships with
people like keep and in-game
monetization and folks like that so
there's other ways to make money ok um
corona this to me was fascinating I I
heard this and I thought wow this is the
most this sounds like one of the most
brilliant things I'd ever heard from a
developer standpoint so I was curious to
explore it a little bit more so go ahead
and explain how your company makes its
money and in when I was talking with you
you said that you had a solution based
on rev share with a payment provider
behind the scenes and the developers
it's kind of free to use your platform
but I want to just probe that a little
more and make sure that it really is
free for developers before I go telling
everybody I was free right and and and
please explain that and also it seemed
really brilliant and then at the same
time I'm wondering ok to our
contingencies what about the payment
provider and what happens if the
horrible thing happens that happen like
with facebook where Facebook said all
right you must use our payment provider
and somebody from the mobile scene does
that so go ahead that's a long that's a
long sleep go for it and try to try to
set us straight and educate us sure
uh what we're actually not that
dissimilar from from GameSalad so if
you're a developer and you come to our
website you can download corona for free
and you can build anything you want to
your own device and test it for as long
as you want but but you do have to pay
if you want to publish okay so if you
want to publish the moment you're done
with your app and you think it's ready
and you want to build you want to put it
up on the app store or the android
market or wherever then you have to pay
us a subscription and so it's very
similar in that way and we have two
levels of subscription today there's an
indie which just means iOS or Android
one of the two that's 199 if you want to
do both iOS and Android and Android
brings together amazon and look that's
349 per year and that's it and then if
you want if you build the next Angry
Birds you paid 349 if you didn't do
anything you pay 349 that's the basic
level now that we have a lot more
Studios bigger Studios using us we also
have an enterprise license and that's a
at an order of magnitude more expensive
per seat but it works similarly it's a
subscription uh and then sort of like in
solutions what you were getting too we
do have partnerships with some
modernisation providers and it's the
same thing any we get a revenue share
now however we don't take that away from
the developer the developer gets the
exact same thing they would have gotten
any way by going directly to a mediation
layer or an ad network or in-app
purchases provider and we just get a
share of what the provider gets and
that's it and we were very clear that we
don't want to take anything away from
the developers they shouldn't get less
by going through corona and and we have
all these third parties decided me says
that's that's brilliant well but it's
the same the same as what saying what
they do so they're doing it's not
different yeah all right no it is any
different ways it is and it does allow
us I mean both of us to try to make
money on the up side without taking it
away from the developer okay but then
I'm wrong in thinking that you are free
you are we are not afraid you're paid if
you want to publish you have to pay the
question i think was if what does seat
mean so if you buy a corona sdk pro
subscription for 349 that's for one
developer so
you have five developers in your studio
and each they're all going to use Corona
you'd need five of those as many apps as
you want and as popular as you can make
them into one quick thing which to also
clarify if tomorrow like you're on if
because I think when I talk to you said
the rate one of the arrangements you
have right now is with an independent
provider and if tomorrow they get
stomped on by say let's say google says
you must use you must use that model or
whoever they're using then your whatever
that's happening behind the scenes
probably the developers would not see
you would be making other arrangements
well we can integrate any third party uh
we do it in a very in a way that
abstracts out a lot of the complexity so
in theory it's possible developer I not
even notice all that might be a little
tough but yeah I mean we could integrate
with an apple for example there's no
in-app purchase option but them right
whereas on Android you can use Google
and Google Checkout but also other
options so yeah we try to make that as
transparent as possible to develop but
to yeah the point was it tomorrow Google
may decide oh we can we get y and this
happens I'm going to happen in facebook
where the all of a sudden the the
platform says oh well we can also make
all the money off of off of the
monetization scheme so that can happen I
have a question so if I'm a developer
and I use corona and I build a game and
I put it on iOS and I use in-app
purchases the iOS and app purchases
you're not taking anything it's just
thirty percent yeah that's between you
and apple all right yeah so spaceport
explain how your company makes its money
and go ahead and I'm not gonna try to
paraphrase it for you cuz it might have
changed and I got it wrong on the other
two huh so ours is pretty simple we just
want to do a ten percent rupture of net
revenues so spaceport is free to
download the SDK it's free to build and
test as many things as you want on your
own phones and it's actually free to
publish to so you can stick a game in
the app store in iOS App Store the
Android app store the amazon appstore
and you don't have to pay anything to do
that um
your game never makes ascent of money
you never pay me ascent of money if your
game is tremendously successful good for
you then so let's say that your game
makes a hundred thousand dollars apple
takes thirty thousand to that and then
of the remaining seventy thousand seven
thousand to me 6302 you so just simple
ten percent of net Sorry Sorry 63,000 63
thousands to you seven thousand to me
thank God no I'm just the founder so
pretty simple um and I don't feel so bad
now yeah that's that was those wrong
slip of the tongue um and then the other
thing is I don't want to have my team
going around collecting checks for
fifteen dollars all day so until you owe
me a thousand dollars I don't want to
bother collecting any money from you so
if your game makes ten thousand dollars
of net revenue after apple / google /
amazon takes their cut great then you
owe me a check for a thousand and if
your game never makes ten thousand
dollars of net revenue then you never
have to pay music alright so the
important thing is if you're using
spaceport make it so that on paper you
only lose oh here 9999 dollars in this
free um and uh you know we we also have
plugins to support various third-party
providers if you want if you want to
charge 99 cents for your game that's
fine if you want to do in app purchases
with Google or Apple that's fine if you
want to do ads we're making plug-ins for
various ad providers if you want to use
someone just tell me will make a plugin
for them I don't really want to limit
options on that okay we only have a plug
of like chartboost for doing ads and
we've I've had the best success doing
in-app purchases so that's kind of what
I presume other people might want to do
but if you really want to do something
else let me know okay great well thank
you very much that at least that helped
straighten things out of my head to help
anybody else on understanding the
different ways I'm one for you how do
you verify the good question so we kind
of have to trust you a little bit so we
have a little bit of a trust
relationship so with spaceport you're
writing your game in JavaScript so if
you want to access native functionality
for things like payment integration you
have to go through a plug-in and so we
wrote the payment plug-in and our
payment plug-in just pings our server
and says so-and-so spent this much money
in this game at this time bought this
virtual good so we have a little record
on our server that only available to you
and us that you can log in and see nice
little pretty graphs oh so much money I
made on each day and that gives us a
sense of how much money your game should
have made now of course you have to pay
dat tax there's chargebacks there's
fraudulent transactions so you'll never
going to you're not going to realize a
hundred percent of that is really income
so this sort of like industry standard
metrics that we figure out after
publishing games of what percent on
average of transactions or fraudulent
and whatever so if you tell me I made X
dollars and that looks about like an
industry standard normal oh yeah that's
the right percent of fraudulent then
I'll believe you and if you you tell me
that you had ninety-nine point nine
percent fraudulent transactions I
probably won't believe you the question
was if someone was to try your platform
why would they decide to not use it I'll
jump in so you know being a visual based
software there are some kind of
limitations around that you know part of
our roadmap you know certainly digg
envisage of ours is extending the power
of that but there's certain game types
that we can't support today certain
things you need to get down to the metal
and actually code with so we do see some
people that like hey I wish I could do
this I can't do this with GameSalad but
for the most part again we're seeing
tons of success stories and people
hitting that you know the top 10 top 20
in the App Store so we're targeting that
audience that feels comfortable working
around some of those limitations okay
I'll say quick thing so uh I think
you're gonna ask something about Lua
later so I'll sort of loot to that uh
you are coding with ours you can do
almost anything we'll talk about Lou in
a second but I if you wanted to do
something that needs real-time stuff if
you wanted to do a communications client
we tell you you have to go Naida other
than that you can build almost anything
you want with corona in Lua and many of
the top games out there like Angry Birds
is built using Lua so it's not a
restriction the only other thing is we
do have to enable access to third-party
services so if you come to me and you
say I want to use this very super nichy
Asian ad network
and it's not one of our priorities we're
not going to build it in today we are
coming up with a plug-in framework
relatively soon as that's the problem is
going to go away but there is some
restriction on what third-party services
you might be able to use today for
example okay right all right um love to
hear from all three of you on what you
think the greatest strength of your
platform is in comparison to the other
2d engines do you want me to answer why
people wouldn't use spaceport first oh
all right um we don't support 3d so if
you want to build a 3d game I don't
recommend using spaceport um but we're
on the 2d shootout so I and so right now
you don't have options for languages you
have to use JavaScript some people
really dislike JavaScript it's it's a
dynamic language so if you're not into
dynamic languages then you might not
like that I like JavaScript it takes
some getting used to let's see other
other reasons to not like spaceport um
okay that's right I think those are the
main things all right okay so greatest
strength of your platform in comparison
to other 2d engines guy I just always
seem to kick these off so I would say
you know at the heart of the game salads
about accessibility and it's making you
know complex game smartphone
applications accessible to the 99
percent of the population that doesn't
know how to code so we really appeal to
that market it's a no-brainer and I
think for those that are comfortable
around coding it's really you know the
multi-platform support and the speed of
development and they're able to iterate
quicker on our platform I think the
major strength of spaceport in
comparison to every other game fair work
is the support for hardware accelerated
vector graphics which is very rare
vector graphics are great for a lot of
reasons way smaller download sizes they
use a ton less ram and you can have as
many frames of animation as you want
with very little overhead because each
frame is just a matrix for how
something's scaled on each frame and you
can support any screen resolution no
matter how big you want to make the
thing if you're using sprite sheets you
run out of space really fast you have
tons of RAM using these giant giant
things if you've a lot of animations you
want to put something on a smart TV or
something with enormous screen size or
it tablets and stuff it's really nice to
have hardware accelerated vector
graphics and performance I mean our
thing is just like one call away from
OpenGL drawing your your your vector
graphics is just a single GL draw
command we convert things into vertex
buffers so it's just like really really
close the hard hardware and in your if
you turn on the debug console when
you're running your game you can see the
number of GL draw commands that are
being made the number of vertices the
number of indices so you get pretty low
level debugging you're very close to the
GL although you're nicely abstracted
away into a scripting language of
JavaScript and strengths for us i think
it's the combination of what we're not
drag and drop it is development we have
proof points that show you a 14 year old
kid in utah did Bubble Ball and got the
number one and so it's accessible it's
easy to use we abstract a lot of
complexity out yet we have great
performance and you can build almost
anything we have example of apps that
you would never imagine it's anything
but native there's really no difference
it's a combination of ease of use and
speed of development with still high
performance ok and I'm gonna go through
all the stereotypes quickly with these
these three engines and hopefully
they're going to set up a straight a
little bit so I'm doing a word on the
street greatest weakness I think you've
hit it a little bit already on GameSalad
word on the street is is a fabulous
place to start and definitely the best
for non coders but it's limiting if you
need more advanced features and so you
know the thought is okay fine it's hard
to be both super easy and super detail
controllable where do you see game style
concentrating in the future and is it is
it in that area and just saying hey we
own it or how are you trying to expand
yeah but I mean it's a really tough
problem solve is making something
complex like coding accessible to two
large audience so that was step one and
then now it's moving up the power curve
and providing more powerful features
that will peel tomorrow traditional hard
core developers I would say also
admittedly a weakness of ours today
because we have Lua in our engine is
performance in terms of just low times
and file sizes and things like that so
we have a beta version out now it'll be
released in the next month or so we've
stripped out our Lua
we're compiling down a native so we'll
be able to perform just as fast as you
know the unities of the world so I think
you know come this time of year from now
getting more power features and having
optimal performance of our engine and
we'll definitely be moving up that
curved appeal to more professional
developers okay corona and and some
people will argue this is a strength to
but there are a ton of web developers
out there and so and I'm one of them
okay biased and I run the games jas just
to get that out there a group in in San
Francisco so that I'm obviously not fair
but the word on the street is one word
Lua why did you not use the lingua
franca the web JavaScript oh you know
it's not I won't get a discussion of
which one is better because as you
everyone knows you that you'll argue to
the death I think you know arc our
founders came from Adobe and and they
were the heads of the lead architect and
head engineer of a flashlight and so
they knew the restrictions of working in
a small space like a mobile device and
the performance requirements and and for
example fly adobe lightroom is
three-quarters built in Lua it's what we
like to say it's the language that is
it's the the most used language you've
never heard of because in gaming it's
been used for a long time and as I
mentioned angry birds is built on a
architecture that looks just like corona
does and we enable for any developer so
it's very easy to learn so we never
thought that picking it up would be a
restriction I've already given an
example of 14 year old kid can pick it
up and build a number one game so it's
very easy to learn very fast developing
and it had other architectural benefits
and performances not hasn't been an
issue for us so you know it's just one
versus the other I guess okay all right
spaceport word on the street no easy
graphical entry point to get designers
hooked the sumption is you already know
flash and you know the rev share model
people aren't as familiar with but go
ahead with the the first one on the no
easy graphical entry point and it's sort
of like this as it was explained to me
by somebody in the hackathon it's sort
of like this really fast car that people
can't figure
drive at first well I sort of agree and
sort of disagree about the first point
so like I mentioned earlier we support
use of the flash pro IDE so I mean
that's as far as designers go about the
best tool out there which is why we
decided to support it so if you're just
authoring an animation in flash like we
took all the strong bad email ffs and
ran them through our converter and got
them running on iPads if we took
everything off of you know sort of
something off all kinds of forums of
various funny flash and like albino
black sheep and stuff and those all work
in space port which is kind of cool
those automatically work uh you know if
you're trying to build a game you're
gonna have the code so if you're gonna
if you want to code yeah you're going to
have to to know how to code but if you
want to just get artwork running through
you can use the best designer tool
around which is the flash pro what was
your second point your second point was
yeah but they you know if you're which
which means that there's no easy entry
point unless you already know flash and
you know that ok I'm supposed to use the
flash flash it is so I agree on we we
were very specific in trying to target /
it and almost gamesalad I mean yes so we
we very specifically are trying to
target the flash developer so our API is
one on one identical with the flash API
I kind of assumed that you know
actionscript 3 is a p.i things like
movie clip and display object container
and loader and all those interfaces
which takes some time to learn there's a
lot of great resources on the web for
learning about flash development and
there's lots of great work that's
already out there in terms of games that
have been built on that framework I
think it's a good framework that
leverage is well between being high
enough level that it doesn't spend a ton
of time like writing sound playing
libraries like see but low enough you
know level that you can get get your
hands dirty if you really want to work
well but yes if you're not familiar with
the flash API it's kind of some things
about it are a little bit awkward I'm in
rev share model I guess you know we may
perhaps to some people is a little bit
odd I've always liked that model because
everyone's interests are aligned we are
only making money if you're being
successful so I'd like that together ok
and I think I'm over time
time but I hope that was hope that was
fun and interesting for people and we
had some cross Hall thank you all very
much for being good sports and educating
people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
