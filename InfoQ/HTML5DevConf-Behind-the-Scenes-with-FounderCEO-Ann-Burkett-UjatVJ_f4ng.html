html5 instructor i'm here at the html5
dev conference with the organizer unpack
it thanks for joining thanks for being
here in Marikana has actually been on
with us all the way through from the
first conference and this is our fourth
wonderful was an awesome conference so
first question is what's your secret how
can you fill this out every single time
and sell out well I think we aim for the
highest quality instructors at the
lowest price and that is hard to do in
an expensive place like San Francisco
but we work really really hard to bring
that quick to people great right and
some curious what's the story behind
html5 de compras just wake up and go you
know what it astonished tomb of our
conference well have been known to do
things like that I sort of feel like you
know life is a one-shot deal you've got
to go gopher gopher things when in my
case I was up at the flash developers
conference up in Seattle uh-huh and knew
that flash is coming to an end run I go
back from to web games to the original
games that were with
the shock wave com oh yeah one of the
original you know web game thing so I've
been with on that rhinestone and I
wanted to see it go on so I was looking
around for technologies that I thought
were promising in that area and started
a conference with it as though basically
organizing all of it myself with a
little help on the sponsor side and
that's about it a minute it grew and
we've eventually taken on some wonderful
contractors and want to pull people to
to help out sure so talking about what
what do you think the future is for the
html5 def Comedy planning on doing any
of the cities what's the next agenda I
would rather grow it here then then
worry about going to other cities I
think there's something wonderful about
local organizers who really know the
area nor developers themselves of course
we are starting to get an international
draw and I I think it's this a wonderful
place to build something that people
come from internationally too right
we're doing a great job so far no
question I had is you obviously finger
on the pulse with html5 you're dealing
with a lot of exhibit seasoning with a
lot of people in the industry what you
see is the future based amount bug just
eating any trends is my question well I
think we're we are saying that that
websites are starting to go in
the responsive design the attraction and
I think that that is going to be going
to be large and people are going to have
apps on their websites also will
probably go more in that direction I
totally don't know what as far as the
future is with google I think that we're
all watching as the chrome and Android
teams merge together but I it's hard for
me to envision something that won't be
good for html5 gonna make interesting
times oh yes yes and I think anybody who
says they absolutely no the future
they're lying point all right well I
won't keep you cuz I know how busy you
are running around right now so thanks
very much for joining I think you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
