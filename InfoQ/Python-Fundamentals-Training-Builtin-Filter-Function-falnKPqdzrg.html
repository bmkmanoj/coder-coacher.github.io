again really quickly so hopefully people
are trying to implement the filtering
the way I described and what I was
looking for I saw a couple cases of it
as a filter takes a list and returns a
list and the list contains all the
elements that met some sort of criterion
and I said it with a for loop if I saw
some people with a initial list that's
empty they looped over the rows of
classmates if the roll was equal to the
role of the input these are inputted
then they appended that row to their
results list and then they patch that
results list to a function that prints
off a bunch of rows and that works
Python has a built-in function called
the filter
and let's see how filter works filter is
a function that takes two arguments the
first argument is a function or none and
the second argument is a sequence so we
talked about functions being first class
objects and among other things that
means you can pass functions to
functions that first function is used to
do the filtering the description the doc
string is returned those items of
sequence for which function item is true
so you are going to pass a function that
you're not calling the built-in filter
function will call your function that
you passed for each item in the sequence
and your function should return either
true or false if that item should be
included in the output sequence so let's
try that a little bit
so I give myself a function f 1 it takes
an item if the item is greater than 5 it
returns true otherwise it returns false
I made myself a sequence it's number 0
through 9 and I filter passing my
function how do I pass a function to
another function what should I type now
f1 there's no special syntax it's just a
variable like anything else and there's
no indication when I'm passing it that
it's some different kind of variable no
function pointer is nothing like that
this is just a variable it happens to be
a variable whose type is function and
notice sequence is unmodified filter
returns a new iterable and it's all the
items from the original sequence that
met my functions condition which was if
they're greater than true and it said I
can either pass a function or none this
is sometimes useful notice what it did
in my sequence why did it do that what's
the logical condition that everything
except for zero meets truthiness yep 0
is false ish in a boolean context and
all of the numbers so if you have a list
and you want to remove say blank strings
from it
you can use the filter function with
none that will remove anything that
evaluates to false in Theus empty dicks
blank strange 0 so if we want to use the
filter function to implement our
filtering of our rows in our classmates
pie we have a little bit of a problem we
need to pass a function that's going to
return true or false based on whether
the row meet some criterion what
criterion is it that the row has to meet
whether the row matches the user input
how do we get the the row is passed by
filter to our function as an input
argument how do we get the user input
into our function based on what you know
now you can't but we could make the user
input be a global argument or at least
in the containing namespace of our
function and then we'd be able to see it
inside of our function we don't want to
assign to it we don't need the Global's
keyword we just want to look at its
value and notice I said a second thing
there one peculiarity of function
definitions that we're going to get to
later more extensively but i'll just
show you now
and Python you can declare functions
inside of functions and they have access
to their containing namespace again look
up only by default so it's not just the
rule I explained earlier which is we
look for a variable in our local
namespace and then we look in the global
name space X their online 110 is not in
the global namespace it's in the local
namespace of function foo functions
second has its own local namespace which
is blank when we print X we look for X
in the local main space of functions
second it's not there we look in all the
containing namespaces which is the local
namespace of the containing function in
this case back out to the global
namespace and we actually find it on our
way Python 2 does not have fine-grained
controls to or fine-grain tools to let
you control how these lookups are
performed it's either obey the default
rules or use the global declaration
which forces you out to the outermost
scope not just the containing scope
Python 3 has a few more tools for
managing your name spaces and how your
name spaces or look up up the stack it
yet pops the stack to the containing
context and we will use this fact to
write some truly mind-blowing functions
in a little while when we get the
closures for the moment let's say we get
some input as a global variable define a
function that compares a row to a global
variable and returns true or false so
your next assignment has two variations
on what you've been doing
so for classmates eight dot py if you've
got your filter working go ahead and re
implement it using the built-in filter
function that means you need to specify
your filtering function and we've kind
of got the hint that we've talked about
you're probably going to just access the
global namespace to look at the user
input and then the other thing that I'd
like you to do is also take advantage of
the first class nature of functions in
Python yuly ask me a good question she
asked if python has a case or switch
statement and your main program
execution at this point probably looks
something like this you've got a main
loop that's well true it's printing out
a menu and you say if answer is 5 elsif
answers one else if answers to elsif
answers 3 elsif answers for other
languages have a switch or a case
statement that says hey I'm going to do
something conditionally based on a
single piece of input and here's all the
different cases that it could be and
also have some optimization techniques
like fall through Python doesn't have a
switch or case statement and the common
python idiom to handle this sort of
thing I want to select and some code
that runs along with a value would be to
rewrite my menu as a data structure with
user input pointing to code so how about
this
so I'll do it in order i have it there
and I'll stop right now so I don't have
these functions implemented but quit for
instance now I do and what does my menu
handling loop look like now I can print
the menu I can ask for a selection and I
might even include the menu the menu
text in my data structure here in some
way and then I can say if my answer is
in menu which means is it a valid key
then menu answer what second parentheses
yeah menu answer gives me a value that
value is a function it's a variable and
I'm just calling it and that replaces
this if statement replaces my if Elif
and this might be called the strategy
pattern if you look at design patterns
yeah so this is what may hang you up so
what is menu menu is a dictionary whose
keys are inputs that are many choices
and whose values are function names
they're from their variables whose type
is function so when I say menu answer
here that is accessing a value and that
value is a function and I put open and
closed parenthesis after it I'm calling
that function yep so if menu asst if
answer was five this is saying menu five
which gets me this value that value is
the variable that points to a function
and I put parenthesis after it to call
it the parentheses are the operators to
call a function and the reason is when I
define a function inside of a function
its name is put in the local namespace
of the function and so there's no way to
get to it
there's no standard way to get to it
okay so let me circulate again no super
new concepts here the filter built in
you're going to supply a function to
pass to the filter built in and then
we'd also like to use function variables
and a data structure to handle your menu
selections</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
