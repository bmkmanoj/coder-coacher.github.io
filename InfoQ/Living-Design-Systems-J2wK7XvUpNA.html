okay because that was really loud um
yeah so I'm Gina thanks for having me
here as she mentioned i work at
salesforce in the ux department and you
can follow me or mention me on twitter
at Gina senior product designer on our
design systems team and I'm going to go
into a little bit about what we do I'm
also the lead designer for all the
branding and website stuff for SAS which
is really awesome CSS preprocessor that
I love dearly um and on that same token
I actually run the local sasmita called
the mixin and we're having an event on
March 11th and I would love to see you
there so please sign up and come it's
going to be a lot of fun we have tab
Atkins speaking who's a spec writer for
CSS and HTML as well as Cordelia who
works with me amazing accessibility
specialist so I'm going to start with
one my favorite quotes I always like to
say this quote and think about this
quote and the work that I do so I Paul
Sappho which says it used to be that
designers made an object and walk away
today the emphasis must shift to
designing the entire life cycle so I
think this site applies a lot towards
product design and product design
obviously has very interesting
challenges that are maybe a little more
complex than you know web design or
graphic design obviously some of those
challenges include supporting multiple
platforms and devices and this range is
growing and growing and growing every
day and then like across all these
different devices like maintaining
quality craft and consistency and then
of course designing for scales your
product can grow and maintain be like
maintain maintainability and kind of
but you know what it means um so yeah so
some of the things that you might be
designing for in product design will
include desktop or web UI with iOS you
have the watch phones and tablets
Android watch phones and tablets windows
8 watch our phones and tablets a lot of
different things to think about a lot of
different form factors enterprise
product design is like a whole other
level of challenges on top of all of
that some of the things that you might
be considering the multiple platforms
and devices like I mentioned before you
also might have a lot of different
products and a lot of different features
you may even have a ton of customers and
partners that are building on a platform
that you're building as we do and then
of course the struggle of innovating
while maintaining all this legacy of you
know years of you I and accessibility
requirements are incredibly important
especially like for us we have a lot of
government customers so accessibility is
a hard requirement and of course in a
large organization you're you know
you're dealing with dozens of scrum
teams hundreds of developers may be a
very small team of designers so how do
we communicate design across a really
really large organization so a lot of
the conversations you might hear you
know we've heard in the past it's like
where can I find the icons what color is
the button border where can I find the
icons and it's just kind of keep going
and going and going and going in the
cyclical like site cycle I'm doing a lot
of redundancy today um so a lot of
people use red lines and if you're not
familiar with red lines this is kind of
where you back out your design and you
say like 16 pixels over here 18 over
here but for large-scale applications
these are the worst like the absolute
worse they're terrible and nobody wants
to meet
then especially when your UI has like so
many different variations and states and
different layouts and screens and maybe
there's different versions of those
layouts and screens depending on what
complex like the complex navigation
might like have like all these different
changes and trying to maintain red lines
for like all these different things are
really hard now some of the things we
were doing which was cool when we were
doing a lot of this redlining was we
were using what we kind of call them
tokens or you might think of them as
design properties if you're familiar
with CSS preprocessors they're kind of
like SAS variables so instead of
referring to values and our red lines we
would start referring to variables so
that got us a pretty good step forward
because it meant if we updated the
design and the devs were using those
tokens then you know there's minimal
change but that still wasn't like really
quite enough when you're doing all these
like red lines and all this spec work
for all these different interfaces
you're really just designing pages and
what I product design is more about is
designing systems and so one tool that a
lot of people have like really rallied
around and it gets a lot of talk is
style guides and style guides have come
a really really long way in 2008 I wrote
about writing interface style guides for
a list apart and back then I was still
kind of doing them as either InDesign
files or I was actually even creating
like WordPress websites and documenting
the UI and you know the CSS standards
brand guidelines all that and that was
okay back then I thought style guides
were pretty cool back then but I've
learned over time that sorry I forgot to
mention style guides actually
have kind of become this umbrella term
now for design guidelines you I pattern
library and front-end a front-end
development tool the thing that I found
through trying to maintain style guides
especially if you're having to cover all
of this you have to keep documentation
current useful the moment your style
guide is no longer current it's no
longer useful and so I see a lot of
people I create these like style guides
and they kind of just become these like
dead things that just like cause a lot
of problems and destroy productivity
what you really want to be doing is
creating a living style guide so living
style guide a sort of this trendy term
that people are using and usually when
people say living style guide what
they're talking about is that it's it's
done in the browser and it's using the
same code that your app uses so one
example is you know this style guide
that we have at Salesforce it's you know
products out guide and it uses the same
variables that I mentioned before same
code and I actually fell in love with
the style garnis why I joined the team
because I was like I want to work on
that it's a thing that we found like
that's really important with maintaining
sell guides is you have to make
documentation a regular part of your
workflow um so for example like maybe
you're documenting all your different
components I've found in the past like a
lot of companies kind of don't really
see the value in this documentation is
being priority like we've got a lot of
work to do so it's kind of like this
thing you do at the last minute or like
maybe if you have time but you should
make it part of your regular workflow or
it's not really ever going to happen and
it's going to become a zombie spell
guide so as your of course for making
something new you should document it
right then and there and in my opinion I
like designing in a browser and doing
the sandbox development in the style guy
pissing
killing two birds with one stone I'm
documenting it and I'm building it and
designing it in the browser if you're
revising something like maybe there's a
bit of you I that you're updating and
you like do you redesign and refactor it
and document it just you know make it
part of the workflow so style guides can
cover a lot of different things like
color typography etc and you know when
you're doing things like indesign every
time you update colors and you have to
kind of like go back into your InDesign
file updated and it depends if you're
adding new content you might have to
like reflow the document which is
another reason why living style guides
are so much better so as you're updating
your design how do you keep things like
color and spacing and size it's
consistent which is like really
important obviously but another thing
that I care a lot about is you know
productivity how do we actually make our
future design changes faster and if you
have a lot of different development
teams focus on particular products or
not products but like devices that maybe
you have an Android team and you have an
iOS team and you have a web team they're
probably all using very different of
code snacks or tech yeah stacks so like
how do you create a design system that's
agnostic and allows developers to keep
working in the comfort level that
they're working in and not have to like
change like their stack just to like
conform to your design system so a
phrase that we throw around a lot at
Salesforce and I actually thought
somebody at Salesforce came up with it
till I went to a jay s conference and
heard a lot of people using it there so
as I go I guess we didn't come up with
that but it's single source of truth
which in other words just means don't
repeat yourself so over the last year
we've done a lot of work flow changes
and process changes and where we've kind
of landed now is what we're calling a
living design system so it's kind of
like another level up from living style
guides so you x which is where i live
you know we create and we define the
system and we have these tools that we
build like the style guide the design
properties which are the tokens that i
mentioned before and things like assets
like SVG's and we have these all in
these like central repository and we
update them and then the dev teams like
in the whole ecosystem consume that so a
lot of there's a lot of things to think
about like typography colors gradients
orders metrics facing animations
transitions and usually if you have like
your app on a lot of different devices
you might want to like make your appt
feel like it lives in that devices
ecosystem but there are certain things
you want to carry through globally like
color for example so one of the things
that we've been working on is this thing
called Theo and Theo is a node module
impian module and the way it works is we
have a JSON file that my team and the
prototyping team we work together we
maintain this JSON file and we store all
those tokens that I talked about like a
colors or fonts or spacing and all that
stuff and then Theo basically generates
sass less stylist lightning which is our
internal framework that we build our
production web app on JSON bride from
XML for android HTML for the style guide
and so when we update it we generate all
these days
and then all the different teams pull
them whatever particular piece of it is
that they need so for example here I'm
documenting a color tags and the value
and I'm giving it a comment and then we
generate a sass file full of variables
and even display the comment for iOS you
know we actually I should go back at
show so here we're using hex because
that makes sense for SAS but like an iOS
the way that we've got it set up it
actually makes better sense to do an RGB
a so we might do something we do
something a little different for iOS and
then of course generating the mark-up
needed a style guide so we have this
kind of work in progress new style guide
that we're working on which this is tiny
sneak peek this is a page that is
completely generated from that so as I
add a new color I push it up to our
internal github and then this page just
starts showing the new value so now it
does and designers can come here and
kind of see what color my supposed to
use for this thing the devs don't even
care what color it is they just care
about the name because that's what
they're going to plug in and then if we
change it they don't have to worry which
is very awesome so as I mentioned like
you know we you might have hex or rgba
or maybe with Android or doing eight
digit hex Theo will take that into
account when it's generating these
different files and it also takes things
into account like converting dimensions
like points her SPS or Rams or whatever
it's like most appropriate for what
you're generating for so this has been
really huge for us it means that we tell
both our designers and our developers
that there should be no hard-coded
values and you know like if you're
developing something or your specking
some
thing you should always be referring to
the token because that token could
change tomorrow for whatever reason we
want to keep things consistent not today
and it means secretion kept like no more
proliferation of all these like
inconsistent styles this is a really
huge for enterprise it's also like good
for smaller companies too but like
really huge for enterprise and something
that I care a lot about you know I
mentioned I really care a lot about
productivity I don't have to contact
every single dev team just because I
made a minor color change this is really
important for things like accessibility
like we have to make sure our colors are
contrasted enough and passed tests that
they are high contrasted enough and if
something fails I'm going to need to
update the value of either the
background or the foreground to make it
pass and it used to be that I had to
like file all these bugs against all
these different dev teens to make sure
that they changed the color so it would
pass now I just basically change it on
my end in that JSON file and I push it
up and then you know we have this
automated tool that runs through Jenkins
and then it's pushed up on cell guide
and then when the doves are ready and
they you know do a build they just bring
that in and done it's like really really
awesome we're super super excited about
it and so we open sourced it and if you
are curious or want to try it out please
do because we're in for feedback and we
want to make it cool and we want to like
we built it with our use case in mind
but we wanted to also take care of play
maybe with your use cases so please
check it out give a try and you know
please give us feedback we've had people
actually submitting pull requests and
issues and it's really awesome because
it's making us see like other use cases
of how this could use I even had a
conversation yesterday with a copywriter
is looking to do some sort of tokenized
system for you I text like four buttons
and stuff and dealing with translations
so this is like another thing that we're
going to be looking at soon which is
really kind of fun to think about this
used for a different purpose and then I
mentioned earlier our assets so we have
all our SVG's sort of in the psyche
repository and you know we we just
pushed them up there whenever like if we
tweak them or update them we just keep
them push there and then our assets in
our spell guide generate from this
repository so like all these you know
different icons that display they just
kind of render automatically and we
found that like there were certain
versions of devices and platforms that
couldn't really handle SVG very well so
another tool that we kind of built was
called blender and all it does is like
we store up the SVG in the repository
and it generates all the fall back PNG's
that are needed for like you know the
android sizes for older or like like
older platforms and stuff so kind of
similar to what i was why are you
laughing I think did I say something
wrong yes a similar to Theo blender
basically we store it in one place and
it generates everything that we need for
everything else so this whole like
living design system that we're working
on it's all about like we change it in
one place and it changes every where and
when I say that I don't mean like the
developers working on something and all
of a sudden everything changes from red
to blue like in a flash like it's we've
not built it like that like there's this
whole build process involved so that
they pull it in when they're ready for
it but it does give us a true
see consistency and one really cool
thing that has come out of this there's
a developer that I work with he's
awesome and he said he's worth the sales
force for nine point five years and he
said it's the first time that he's
really felt like us and engineering are
like really like collaborating together
and we're super excited about it I kind
of started like evangelizing I because i
want to see everybody like doing this
kind of stuff and I actually found I
went to staff skunk last year and like I
would say forty percent of the tops that
were given we're like similar to this
like here's what we're doing for like
our design system it's really cool
because I feel like all these different
companies and different teams are kind
of creating their own systems and their
own workflows I'm all to like achieve
true consistency and establishing an
aligned brand across you I and I think
it's really awesome and if any of you
are working on that type of stuff to I
would really love to hear about it if
you'd like to learn a little bit more
about the technical aspect this
developer who's awesome that I work with
sanke wrote this article called living
design system on medium and I see some
people writing down here I'm going to
have the slides up so you can get the
URL is later yeah he go into more detail
on the technical aspect of it you're
interested if you're curious a little
bit more about our team you can follow
us on Twitter excels for sea legs and
we're also in dribble and Salesforce and
I have another really favorite quote
that I like to use which is be regular
and orderly in your life so that excuse
me so that you made me violet and
original in your work and that's my
Gustave Flaubert and it's like one of my
really favorite quotes yeah so this is
the URL for my slides they're actually
up right now if you want to
take a look later and I went a lot
faster than I thought I was but thank
you
yeah questions oh yeah that's a really
good question and it is a of problem
that we deal with and as I mentioned
before we have a lot of different
acquisitions and partners and they all
have their own look and feel but maybe
they want to build like on the platform
so a lot of this stuff that I showed you
is very sales for sustained but we we
have built it in a way where we can
inherit other things so we have like the
core foundation theme that we use that's
like you know like the basic salesforce1
base base thing and then you know if we
have certain companies that may be kind
of want to with the same but maybe the
Blues are red because that's their brand
they can just change that through this
same like token system they just like
update the value or sorry I lost track
of everything um like there are some
things that haven't quite adopted this
yet but we're working with them right
now and talking to them to find out like
what their needs are and we're working
on a version sort of like a b2 of this
that will account for like kind of
having like a skin and bones kind of
thing like the bones is the structure
and the skin is like the theme or the
flavor that you can kind of put on top
so we're exploring that right now and
yeah I hope that answers your question
yeah that's also very good question so
obviously a lot of what I'm talking
about is
like Enterprise I do think a lot of
these these like processes and workflows
can work for small companies too we have
the advantage of actually having a team
like focused on this and dedicated i
know not all companies have the luxury
of having this design assistance team
that does that i do think it's helpful
to like maybe like if you have like a
particular release cycle to maybe
schedule out sometime within that
release cycle to update the systems
maybe your designs and forming the
system and your systems of forming
design so it's sort of like this
cyclical thing so just as you would have
like maybe a period in your release
cycle where you're doing QA and testing
like maybe there's part be the part of
that or you know right before that
there's this whole part of like okay
let's you know make sure that we're
dedicated to like moving the system
along that's my dream world anyway like
I know like um it's hard to kind of like
create all these tools when you're small
that's why I kind of think it's awesome
that everybody's open sourcing this kind
of stuff right now so like maybe our
system isn't right for you but I've been
seeing like a ton of other companies I
think causes has been doing a lot of
stuff around here never like smaller so
maybe like their system is a little more
appropriate for the sides of your
company there's a ton of really awesome
stuff happening hello okay um that's
much better yes so um I think like maybe
it's not that you're using these same
tools or the same stack that we're using
but you know through a sec documenting
my and not just as like all the other
companies that are doing it too
sharing their workload you can maybe
create the system that works for you and
right before i started at salesforce I
you know it's working on the sass
website and it was the first time that I
was open sourcing a website and that
kind of gave me a little designer panic
attack because as like if somebody is
contributing to the design which I
totally encourage I was worrying that
the spell guy would get out of date and
you know like i said i want to keep the
style guide up-to-date and so i think
there's other ways of doing it like what
I had done I built a site on a static
site generator called middleman and
middleman is basically like a ruby mae
static site generator and you can write
art down Hamill sass ER be like whatever
like typical stuff like you would do in
a ruby and rails app and I'm not a
ribbie 'used by any means but I was able
to kind of hack the style guide in a way
where I had these ya moul files where I
was story name and color values for
color and then I changed my sass file to
include the ER be extension and then I
was able to write Ruby in my sass file
so it's actually like generating the
variables looping off of Miami file and
then the style guide was generating the
swatches off of that same yellow file
and so it's sort of like this like quick
little hacky thing that I did and it's
actually like I presented it to my team
at Salesforce and I was like I know we
don't use Ruby and I know you know we
have a very different stack but here's
what I did is there something we could
do and the developer that wrote that
article basically built this site to
land like a day and so I think like you
know the inspirations out there and just
finding a way to work it like into
whatever your stack is um yeah I hope
that answer your question yeah cool
thanks any other questions that's a hard
question um yeah so it's definitely a
struggle
maintaining legacy code and trying to
innovate it's tricky especially with a
lot of a lot of code it's just kind of
been this ongoing refactoring process
like when bugs come up like oh this
accessibility test failed because this
color didn't you know passed it's like
oh well if you used your variable of the
past and some of like as those bugs come
up you know we can like try to attack
the problem then and then occasionally
like maybe there's like revisions and
features or new features happening that
affect others so like that's a good time
to kind of refactor and align it but
yeah it's always and it's not like
you're going to build it once and it's
just perfect and because then I wouldn't
have a job anymore like it's like it's
basically an ongoing thing like you're
constantly refining and fine-tuning it
it's tricky yes um
okay he asked how many people are
working on the team on the US side
versus on the development side so our
design systems team that I'm on with it
like the UX organization is really
really big our design systems team is
currently four people and so we're
hiring but yeah like we have a really
strong visual designer a really strong
CSS architect I'm like the hybrid and
the guy that like leads our team he's
also hybrid and then we have a sister
team which is the UX engineering team
and we were very good sorry we work very
closely with them and they helped us
build all like you know we don't have
the skill level to build these tools but
like we have the ideas and we can like
you know put our design system into it
so they helped us build the tools and
they also do work a lot of work on the
prototyping but that's still all on the
US side and I think they're about five
people on the UX engineering team and
then on the actual like engineering side
hundreds but I I have like a go-to
person the one that I said worked at
those furs for like nine point five
years he's sort of my go-to person I
just ask him all the questions and then
he can you know reach out to whoever
eats me reached out to so any more
questions anyone want a job yeah yes
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
