green sock for complex animation I'm
really excited about being here because
I get to talk about the thing that I
love the most in the world to a bunch
people that is pretty great so there's
my Twitter and code pen but if you guys
want to see that later I can show it on
the last slide yeah like I said I'm a
senior UX engineer at Twitter or at not
destroyed Twitter at Trulia um so today
we're going to have a little bit of fun
we're going to be doing stuff that's a
little bit more like you know a
JavaScript party you know we're going to
make a party or we'll have you know an
event coordinator like a JavaScript
event coordinator to help us with that
party if you don't like these kind of
bad pun jokes I'm sorry they're going to
happen a lot so yeah so one of the
things that's great about all of this
stuff is there's tons of stuff that we
can do and use and a lot is available to
us already and I'm going to talk to you
about some of the stuff that you can use
today on websites so why why are we
animating things to begin with animation
kind of gets a bad rap sometimes
animation is pretty powerful to convey
meaning and that's part of the reason
why it has a bad rap because anything
that's moving grabs your attention the
most
you know you everybody kind of knows
that like a big red button will make you
want to click it and people it drives
leads for our site but nothing your
brain is completely trained to watch
anything in movement because of our
biology and because of evolution so
animation when done poorly is really
really bad and irritating so one of the
things that we're going to talk about
today is the refinement of this
animation it can also guide your users
so if you're showing people where to go
or what to do on a site animation could
be really powerful as a tool and also
because otherwise we're not using the
web to its full potential the web is an
amazing place I you know love the
Internet and otherwise it's kind of a
static troll box there's so much we can
do there's so many opportunities here
and it's also fun um SVG for those of
you who are still kind of concerned with
SVG let's let's go
go over some basics before we go on SPG
is crisp on any display its resolution
independent in our days of multiplying
all of these devices with all of their
different screen resolutions not having
to replace an image for your different
screen resolutions is a huge boon
there's less HTTP requests to handle
this is probably going to be less of a
deal as HTTP 2 comes into play but as
we're not there yet we're still kind of
dealing with those requests aren't we so
it's really easily scalable for
responsive I mean it's in the name
scalable vector graphics this is what it
was built to do this is what it was
meant to do so let's use it to its full
potential it's a really file small file
size if you design prefer for
performance and the key takeaway in this
sentence is actually if you design for
performance we're going to talk a little
bit about that today I'm also going to
show you like exactly how small some
things can be you might be surprised
it's really easy to animate one of the
things that I love about SVG is that it
has a navigable Dom so you can reach in
there you can grab things you can move
them around it's very intuitive if
you've been using HTML and CSS for your
whole life and one of the really great
things about it is like unlike with
canvas if it breaks down there's still
something there to debug so that's kind
of nice for those kind of workflows it's
really easy to make accessible because
of the navigable Dom you can easily put
title and Aria tags in there and
actually make it accessible for screen
readers and blind people even if it is a
complex animation and it's fun for those
of you who think that SVG has poor
support look at all that green this is
definitely a technology that you can use
now you should definitely be checking
your analytics but I'll show you and
I'll show you some ways to like make
fallbacks and things like that but you
might not need them as much as you think
that you do so there's a incredible lot
we can do with just storytelling within
an SVG
so there's a lot we can do in in terms
of telling a story in terms of showing
things in terms of making complex
animations before we get started though
before we kind of get into like the cool
JavaScript II parts we should talk about
some like responsible things to do one
of them is optimizing SVG Oh is a really
really great tool and there's actually a
web-based GUI that Jake ARCT Archibald
mein called SVG oMG if I give you the
slide link later you can just go and
click all of these links that are active
so it gives a lot of toggles so and you
really do need to like kind of refine it
I don't suggest ever optimizing and SVG
without looking at the output you need a
GUI for this because the way that you
optimize it actually does change its
appearance and can actually destroy it
so it's really important that you're
actually looking and seeing what the
output is as you're working with it it
doesn't mean you can't use a terminal
based tool like SVG oh and there is an
SVG Oh GUI that you can also get on
github these are to github links at the
bottom and then there's a peter colin
ridges SVG editor it's kind of like
old-school like really really old-school
I still like it it also has an editing
tab so you can edit it live that's very
experimental but um it's kind of fun to
play with so yet check these tools out
for sure before we get started animation
performance we're going to talk a lot
about responsive today because it's a
scalable graphic we can actually make
complex animations that are responsive
that's super cool um one weird thing
that like as a developer doesn't make
sense
is that people actually expect mobile to
be faster than web they think about it
as like a tiny little website on their
phone so it's going to be faster but if
you're a web developer you know that
that's kind of the opposite right we're
loading a ton of data through a less
secure and less fast connection it's
cool it's not going to be as fast so we
have to kind of preemptive strike
against those kind of troubles a good
resource another good resource for
animation performance not necessarily
responsive is jank-free org
Paul Lewis and Paul Irish from chrome
dev tools made this website all the good
Paul's might work on this site so they
kind of uncover and go through like
timeline recordings and ways that you
can make your animations like visibly
clearer and cleaner when we talk about
jank we're talking about that stutter
that you get sometimes when there's a
lot of repaints so they kind of go
through some of that just off the bat
what I can tell you right now is moving
things with transforms and opacity is
really going to help you that's really
going to be a very performant way of
working SVG is not able to be hardware
accelerated that doesn't mean that it
can't be performant though especially if
you use opacity and transform and you
might think like oh that's two
properties like that's not a lot almost
every single pen I'm going to show you
today only uses those two transforms can
do a ton of things so don't feel like
you're you know in the in the dregs
because you're using those two
properties if you're if you're kind of
like a performance nerd like me and you
want to see some cool performanc things
Paul Irish also did this advanced
performance audit tools with dev tools
where he climbs into the timeline and
sees all of that working it's kind of
good to see how he's doing that so that
you can debug for yourself and I wrote a
CSS tricks article oh I work on staff as
the ED CSS tricks
I wrote a CSS tricks article called
weighing SVG animation techniques with
benchmarks so I did timeline benchmarks
as well as visual benchmarks and a few
good things that I found out was that
green sock actually performed really
well it performed as good as native
technologies I'm going to say that again
because it bears repeating it performed
as well as native technologies that's a
really good library I also did a lot of
testing with smile and CSS and velocity
you can look at the article but one
thing that I will say about this article
is that it was written at a certain time
it was written a year ago and a lot of
things have changed since then so like
sap is updated and you know CSS actually
is reporting differently in Chrome so
even that's not stable so I think really
you should test things for yourself and
find out for yourself how things work
find out for yourself what is going to
be working for what kind of animation
that you're doing and how it affects
your build I also suggest like if you've
worked with CSS animation before write
it in CSS and then write it in
JavaScript and make the comparison for
yourself how does how is your workflow
affected how is the performance affected
I'm going to talk a little bit about
ocss - you know green sock comparison a
little bit later on and we'll go into
more depth on that so fall backs you
might not need them but fall backs can
happen with moderniser um you can it
kind of provides a body class hook that
you can hook into and have a fallback to
a PNG or an equivalent Sarah soit on has
a great article about using the picture
element with a polyfill as a fallback I
would say that that's very verbose so
only do that if you really really need
that backwards-compatible support
recommended look at your analytics find
out who's looking at your site on what
browser before you spend all of that
time cutting all of those picture images
one of the main principles now we're
going to dive more into how to make the
stuff now that we've been responsible
one of the main principles is design
everything first and slowly unveil
things if you're working with a designer
this is something that you can ask them
to do for you so if we're looking at I
made a kind of Easter Egg for CSS tricks
so like it morphs into that was Chris
coiours idea the Z thing um so so it
does all of these like kind of nerdy you
know tech things like the T turns into a
fork and there's like a link and this is
the star is actually our logo so it has
like a Saturn that turns into a bracket
in code yadda yadda but if we look at
this and how I actually designed it
before I started building stuff
it actually is just a jumble of things
I'm just making one thing go into
another and like slowly revealing things
and animating them on the page I'm not
showing everything at first and then
bringing them out so that's one way that
you can get going really easily
ugly storyboards totally save you time
the B is not included in this the CSS
tricks logo thing I spent like two
minutes doodling this out and then I
knew where I was going with everything
um same with you know these terrible
terrible thumbnails I don't even
remember which animation this is for
anymore so bad but it helped me
understand where I was going and what I
was doing and it saved me a lot of time
I think one of the misconceptions with
storyboards is that they have to be
beautiful I feel like when I look at
other people's storyboards I'm like I'm
not going to draw a whole comic and then
animate like that's that's just not
going to happen so I just wanted to you
know dispel the myth that they have to
be good looking just as long as you're
communicating with yourself um we there
are a lot of ways of working with SVG
and green sock that are like more UI
component things but we're not going to
talk about those too much today we're
going to delve more into like a
standalone graphic as an illustration
because the title is complex like we're
not just moving something from here to
here we're going to try to like dig in
there and get super complex so we've got
a view box shift with a sprite so for
this pen we've got this kind of book of
kells illustration and it goes across
like this and then it changes as that
comes forward so you can see that that
all moves right um this whole SVG and
animation and everything was eight
kilobytes gzipped that's it if you
compare that to showing having an
article that has like a picture and text
that's pretty amazing so not only do you
have something that's kind of engaging
for the user you have your like saving
tons of bytes
um just not by not like slapping an
image in there so in order to make this
I mean I did make a sprite I made an SVG
sprite so kind of in the same way that
we're saying like show parts of things
we're actually just going to use the
view box the view box being like in an
SVG you can have a ton of space but the
view box is actually going to be the
window in which you're looking at the
SVG so we can easily just shift that
attribute with JavaScript and move you
know the whole view box down from one
view to another I am originally designed
it with the one on the right but then in
order to reduce repetition I just used
to and kind of collapsed it and put
classes on that I'm using media queries
to kind of show and get rid of so view
box shipped with JavaScript this is kind
of what we were talking about before
you're really just setting the attribute
that's differently for the view box
that's all you're doing you're listening
for that change and then you're just
setting the view box and that's how you
can easily make an SVG sprite but I did
say complex and that's not totally
complex is it so if we want to do really
complex stuff we're definitely going to
use some G's app I think it's important
to say that I don't work for them they
don't pay me I'm not like a marketing
ploy or anything I'm just a developer
that found a tool that I really like so
yeah just to put that out there it
solves a lot of cross browser
inconsistencies one of the kind of big
gripes that people have about working
with SVG especially in animation where
things are moving around is that there
are some really weird browser
inconsistencies across versions and gzip
solves a lot of these things for you I
don't write browser hacks anymore
because I use gzip that's pretty
incredible this bug in Firefox has been
fixed just recently but look at how bad
that is I mean there's other ones that
are like this like marrying it with
opacity also does something like this
like there's tons of like little
headaches especially as you start to
work with responsive that can drive you
absolutely batty
and sometimes just working with gzip to
not have to deal with these especially
on mobile is just it's awesome there's
other browser transform origin issues so
one of the things in the SVG spec that
just kind of doesn't make any sense is
that when you have layers of these
transform origins if you keep switching
transform origins the way that it
actually materializes doesn't it like
make sense on paper but doesn't make
sense when you look at it so if we're
watching the one on the right is
actually like based on the spec and you
can see it flipping around and just like
jumping to that readjustment
jiseop actually has this feature called
smooth origin and it's actually it's the
default so you don't have to do anything
gzip is already like got your back if
you want to switch the transform origin
for some attribute timeline so timeline
is probably also like the along with the
browser and consistency timeline is like
probably the biggest reason I use gzip
and here's why you can stack tween so
rather than in CSS you would have to
like put a delay on each one you just
stack them and they already immediately
follow each other you can set them a
little bit before and after each other
so like you can set them at the same
time or or like say like oh just one
second into that last one do this thing
and I'll show you how that's done in a
second you can change their placement in
time I'll also show you that you can
group them into scenes we you can add
relative labels these are more things
towards keeping your code organized and
easy to follow
you can add relative labels so like if
you need 17 things to happen all at the
same time it's very easy to do so I'll
show you examples of that code and you
can animate your animations so you can
make the whole thing faster or move the
placement of the whole scene you can
nest all without recalculation so what
do I mean with about recalculation if
you are making a complex animation and
CSS and you have many many animations
and you have delays between all of them
and say you need something to fire at
the same time as something else
and for one of them it's at the 66%
keyframe and for the other one it's at a
different keyframe and they're firing
exactly at the same time if someone
comes in and makes you adjust the
animation before one of those things you
then have to go back and recalculate all
of those percentages based on that and
I've never ever made a complex animation
where I didn't adjust the timing so this
is this ends up being a really big deal
for your workflow
so in this pen I have this like initial
kind of like animation that's going on
and you can see things that are firing
at the same time so we're going to look
a little more closely at that that first
one fires a few times in that animation
so that's where it is on the timeline
the second part fires here probably
don't need to narrate the rest you can
look at the screen
so I can adjust the timing of these
animations if they're grouped into
functions right I can just switch them
and have the whole thing go in a
different order I can also just make the
whole thing faster in one line of code
so let's say you get to the end of
making this like really complex
animation you're like oh it's just like
a little too slow your eye does pick up
on those minut movements
this is it is a huge boon and the other
thing about this is it's not just for
like making something a little bit
faster and slower if you need to debug
the timing of animations being able to
set in one line of code
okay go at a snail's pace so I can
really see what's going on that's super
helpful for debugging so other cool
things for complex animation motion
along a path motion along a path is
moving into CSS it is also moving out of
smile smile is getting deprecated and ie
is still not like our edge is still not
sure that they're going to support it
you can go vote to support it and you
should so right now it doesn't have very
good support in anything other than GSM
and this has the longest tail of support
this goes all the way back to ie 9 so it
will soon be in our CSS spec and
supported by browsers but in the
meantime if you need a lot of support
for things like motion along a path
which is important for realism and we're
going to go into that a little bit more
that's the widest support there's
draggable so you might have seen like in
that first animation how I'm twisting a
knob but in order to get things to
happen that's part of draggable you can
drag and drop objects you can tween CSS
properties which means you can make
things look like they're coming through
space right because you can tween
perspective you can treat tweens the
index all of those kind of things
draw SVG that's like when you make the
you know you've seen like the nintendo's
that draw themselves we're going to do a
few fun things with those later you can
of course do that in regular CSS by
kind of like animating that path value
but in G SAP you can just set 0 to true
or 20% to 50% and it figures out that
stuff for you it's very very easy to
work with it's also morph SPG is
probably the thing that hits green sock
out of the park
so that first CSS tricks demo where
everything's changing into each other
green sock is the only animation API
that can tween things that have
different path amounts so even smile
even snap SVG needs the same amount of
paths in order to tween and you don't
have a lot of finite control and I'll
show you how to get finite control in G
set
there's also relative color treating so
you don't have to like find every value
for something you can clean it relative
to where it already is
there's also cycle stager so you can
have things stagger but do two different
values or three so this is probably hard
to see on the screen but this is my
green sock teaching monster so we're
going to build a really simple tween and
then make it more complex so simple
tween we've got the eye and he just
blinks and then we've got two tweens got
the antenna we're adding the antenna so
these tweens will fire at the same time
so you have the antenna and the eye at
the same time a simple timeline so now
that we have one thing and then the next
thing follows it in a timeline now I'm
going to make a master timeline so we
have the function for that and it's just
adding to that so we're just adding it
to master so this helps us to add some
another function which is the wing flap
and we just add it to the bottom of
master so that's kind of like the basics
of what you need to know in order to get
going with with tweens and timelines and
so relative color tweening
let's dig into all of the things I just
said relative color tweening is like you
can adjust the hue based on what you're
doing you can adjust the saturation you
can adjust the brightness so you know I
can keep playing with these turtles
because I like their little
is it weird that I made something that I
liked playing with so we can also use
that to make like whole scenes this is a
city construction site get it website
and we're going to make this whole thing
come on so we can drag it on and then we
can also like adjust the hue and
saturation values and I made them
slightly different so you can kind of
get a different effect every time you
play with this and then you know I mean
this is the perspective those things
change or we can just have the whole
thing draw on by itself but these are
all like cool things you can let the
users control too so if we look at the
code for that it's pretty simple I'm
only showing you well it looks more
simple here because I'm only showing you
one small part but we've got a relic
we've got a kind of standard color value
here right you see the s the bar ch2 is
HSL and then we have the relative color
values the reason why I made it a
variable is because the background needs
background like it's there it's not
going to use the same thing as the SVG
which is using fill so I just want them
to be consistent and then for the other
things we have paused equals true for
the time line which means it's paused
initially so that I can call it later in
a function so you know if there's a got
an event handler on a button or
something then I can restart that
timeline that way so motion along a path
for realism I was going to animate some
fireflies and fireflies have a really
interesting movement I feel like being
an animator makes me watch things a lot
more like I'm always like what is water
do when it comes out of a faucet so you
know fireflies have this like weird way
of jumping around and stuff so this
might like steampunk lighting so we were
talking about motion along a path it's
actually really easy to tween motion
along a path values it's just an array
of XY coordinates that were you can see
in these values here we have auto rotate
true and
show you what that does with like with
like a particular demo and type it
equals soft there's a few different ways
we can work with the type as well so
there's a curviness value that we can
use soft is one or I can have set it to
a numerical value so we have bezzie a
tween with curviness and curviness set
to zero does like pretty much nothing it
just like keeps it as you would think it
just goes from one value to another one
and the curviness set to four start
starts to kind of unravel on itself but
the curviness set to two is probably as
close as you're going to get to like a
loop around basically you can think
about it like this you have an XY
coordinate you have an XY coordinate you
have an XY coordinate and there's like a
rubber band between these two so the
rubber band is taught at zero and then
as it goes to two it gets kind of like
loose and then as we get to the four it
kind of like unravels around so if we go
all the way to eight it's going to be
like the zero
Lulla um which you know might be useful
for some types of motion
I wrote a David Walsh plot a blog
article about this it's a actually a
series about gzip and SVG so if you are
more interested in getting into the
nitty-gritty details of the code you can
check that out too um auto-rotate so you
see that little weird guy I don't know I
don't even know what he is I'm just
making things um okay if I set it to
false he doesn't follow the path right
he's this is just kind of like if you
were tweeting motion along a path with
some other technology that's what you
might expect to happen but with
auto-rotate true he's actually like
moving along with that line so scalable
graphics scalable animation let's do
some fun responsive stuff one thing
that's really cool that's not supported
anywhere else and of course green sock
does really well is percentage-based
transforms on SVG that's pretty exciting
but more exciting than that is you might
not need it so we've
got this animation that's like fully
responsive and scalable in every
direction I'm going to let it play out
first and then I'll show you what that
does so if I replay I can kind of click
to randomly resize and the animation
stays stable no matter what I do so
that's pretty cool and it doesn't
necessarily have to be fluid either like
there's very few times on a website that
you're going to make a animation or a
graphic where you're just going to make
it go like this and squish so let's
actually do some real responsive design
and development so designing
interactions in responsive animations
now we're going to get some like really
fun complex stuff when I designed it and
if you're working with another designer
you can kind of talk about this with
them basically I made it like Legos
though every area of that I'm using
inside this graphic has kind of like a
basic format so if you can see like the
desktop version is the same as this
version but I flipped the magenta box
and stacked it and I made sure that they
had interlocking parts the other part
that you do is like each one of these
boxes is actually a function and each
function calls a different timeline that
way I know exactly where to go for both
design and development my code is really
organized it's super easy to adjust and
manipulate so if we look at this pen
this is a huggy laser Panda Factory um
we you know click here and he gets a
chip put in his head and turns into a
laser guy we click here and he gets
painted like a panda and we click here
and he gets like you know huggy and then
and then as I scale it down you can see
it just like interlocked like that and
it still works and we're just got the
basically those functions are working in
the same way that you'd think
they would on desktop so one of the
things I have you might have seen that
like repeated animation that's going on
for everything we've got like the little
bubbles that are coming out of the top
and that just keeps going so we have
like repeat negative one which just
allows everything to loop so I have one
function that's all the looping things
and that is just set to keep on
repeating itself
we've got other functions like this
paint Panda I'm just showing you a
little little bits of the code so if it
looks kind of confusing to see parts of
it all of these all of my demos are on
code pen and you can just totally you
know scroll through them yell at me
about stuff there's a you know comment
box so I have it paused initially and
then I'm triggering it after so anytime
you're clicking on that it's triggering
the restart we're going to deal with
other like conflict this is more like
theory of animation so atmosphere one of
the things I was thinking about when I
was trying to I started trying to
animate elements like fire and smoke and
stuff and so one of the things I was
finding when I was trying to make those
things work is it's kind of hard to make
those things work if you're just looking
at it straight so here well here's an
example that this is that is neither SVG
nor JavaScript but in this pen what's
important here is that the atmosphere is
actually like the character that the
atmosphere is the most important part so
elemental motion things that are further
away have less contrast and are blurry
things that you have to think about
whether or not the error environment
affects movement reducing precision
allows for understanding so if I look at
smoke like this
then and I reduce the precision of it I
can actually see that there are circles
inside that smoke and like the way that
the air is hitting them I can actually
like then I can start to grok like how
I'm going to animate that so putting
techniques together morph SVG so that's
something that we were talking about
before you point from one ID to another
and we're going to use shape
index so this is a really cool thing
remember I said finite control you can
load this and get this GUI and you can
actually change the way that it morphs
by picking a different value for where
those morphing kind of points are laying
and so then I can make things like smoke
and fire so how did I make this one a
couple of the things that I'm animating
are the kind of flame here I showed I
made them blue so that you can see all
of the different ones and then I made I
just copy them and make them bigger for
the kind of red values I just drew all
of this stuff in Illustrator and I have
like little pieces that are coming up
here but I'm also using this goo filter
I don't know if any of you have seen
Lucas Peppers kind of famous you used
the SVG filter to make this goo
so I'm actually animating the filter
anything that's an integer I can animate
with green sock so that's pretty cool I
can reach right in there and like make
the filter become more and less gooey
through the through the flame because
the flame doesn't stay consistent at all
I can also kind of if I name everything
properly I can just set a for loop to go
through all of these different values in
these different IDs and kind of set it
with that you know label the you know
relative timeline I can just add it
incrementally to the timeline so it's
always kind of firing it's always like
morphing at that next piece so there's
more than one way of working
Blake Bowen is really great he made this
kind of way to work with gzip with a
Catmull ROM spleen I could have also
done it this way so if we're looking at
there's like a article about the history
in computer science
I'm actually almost out of time so I'm
not going to talk about this too much
but you can look at it further and then
you can set different points in these
polylines and it's basically again like
that rubber band we were talking about
it's like making it a little bit more
curvy between these points so you I
could have just adjusted the point
values between these things I didn't
have to draw out every flame in
Illustrator
so I also made things like smoke so
that's also done with kind of like for
loop with these values so like morph SVG
just goes through here and I needed a
slightly different for loop for the
timing so I just add a relative label
and it adds incrementally to that design
and information and animation I have
like not a lot of time but I'm going to
try to power through this last part
really quickly infographics have died
infographics used to have a ton of
conversion you can see like in this tiny
little thing that with a traditional
post got 243 actions a thousand four
things that had infographics I wrote an
article about this if you want to learn
more there's lots of different blogs
with tons of you know addressing how
much leads were affected
there's tons of conversion and increased
traffic to their website lead increase
number of new visitors the site went up
but all of these posts are older than
two years and you really don't see
infographics anymore at all what
happened I really think that the big
problem here is that it's not responsive
infographics on desktop are like this
cool thing that you get to explore and
on mobile are kind of this horrible
pinch and grab affair there was a
tipping point two years ago where mobile
kind of took over desktop and so I think
that for social media in particular this
just wasn't you know viable anymore and
the design was also not updated to the
current context so if we have this pen
we have this responsive animated
infographic and it kind of goes through
all of these global warming values but
then it also works for mobile and you
have a lot of information in just like a
small area rather than having to look
all over the place for all this
different stuff
so change the view box like we did
before we're just changing the view box
from one view to another and we do media
queries for a layout and fall back with
moderniser we can actually make it very
easily accessible by adding an aria
labelled by and a title Doug Lee story
wrote a really great article on how to
do so this is like the last fun thing
that we'll do well before ending it's
just a little bit of interaction in the
animation so I can add you can add
interaction to my SVG so if you see SVG
was kind of built for these things so if
I look at it really I'm just grabbing
the radius and the ccy for that
attribute is just like where that circle
is placed and I'm just updating the
radius and the Cy value through every
time that that's hit and then you can
see that like I start a time line upon
like basically once it gets to a certain
you know big largeness I don't know then
I activate a time line especially for
that and then I attach it to like a you
know a key event social coding sites
help you learn
I love code pen I'm like a huge fan of
them they also don't pay me I made like
a code pen propaganda poster because I'm
a giant nerd and this is what I do but
basically it's just like one of my
favorite places to be because I learn a
ton I can easily see what other people
are doing and learn from them they can
engage with stuff that I'm doing we can
learn from each other I think it's a
great community nothing but good people
on there jsfiddle is great tablet is
great anytime that people are showing
examples with their code that they're
kind of like allowing you to play with
so that you can manipulate it and
what actually happens for yourself I'm
not the kind of person who reads a
technical manual like an SVG spec and
understands how an SVG works without
moving it around and playing with it and
bumping into the problems so for people
like if you're anything like me then a
code pen is a really great place to work
there's some people you should know
about again these are in my slides so
I'm not going to leave this up for too
much longer but you can check them all
out later you should follow them on
Twitter follow them on code bin they're
super awesome
I wrote I have a front-end masters
course coming out in February so if
you're in front-end masters you can
check that out advanced SVG animation
goes into like some of the stuff we
talked today about today but in much
more detail this is not the cover of my
new or I'll ebook my friend was trolling
me that's not my last name but I will
have an O'Reilly book coming out in
pre-release in the next couple of months
and thank you it was really a pleasure
to talk to you guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
