but first you're here to learn some cool
stuff and talk about some cool stuff I
like to think of this as a conversation
so I am Dianne Tate I'm going to talk
about creating a strong geek culture
I've placed a quote on the cover slide
to inspire you about the importance of
building a strong culture especially for
developers so just a quick bit about me
like why in the heck am I talking about
this so I work on some of this stuff at
Mozilla I'm in our internal
communications group and I work on
designing programs to make our staff
happy we have a lot of developers on our
staff I used to do stuff like this at
schwab where I worked in internal
communications as well for schwab
technology so it's Schwab's technology
organization at the time we had about a
thousand people in IT and so I worked on
a lot of employee programs for that so
hopefully I have some some experience
that will be helpful and I'm glad
everyone's here because it means that
you care about culture and that's a good
thing so let's talk about what we're
talking about so creating a strong geek
culture let's parse this out we know
that words have lots of meanings and you
can't make assumptions so I'm going to
reverse the order a little bit so
grammatically it doesn't really make
sense but I think it'll help us to break
down what we're actually looking at here
first of all what's a geek what's
culture what is strong and then I think
the reason you're all here is how do we
create it so first of all a geek I
intentionally chose this word it's very
strategic word and I'm sort of kidding
but you know there's a lot of fun things
out there about what is a geek what is a
nerd what is a dork what is a dweeb and
obviously some of these things are quite
not very positive my point in this slide
is that when we're talking about
designing something for an audience
that's really good to understand your
audience and for the most part if we're
at a developer conference and the
audience is developers there's a few
assumptions you can make about your
audience and you can always validate and
test that's a good idea but it's it's a
safe assumption that your audience is
very committed and very focused around
solving certain problems so if that's
once
of general generalization i would say
about addressing a developer population
it's that developers really care about
what they do and they really want to
solve problems so understanding that
mindsets pretty important so that's what
I'm talking about when I'm talking about
cultures for those types of people what
in the heck is a culture so there's lots
of definitions it's a little bit you
could say it's elusive but there's some
some core things core ingredients to
culture that are pretty important
ultimately it's about the why why are
you doing what you're doing that has a
large influence on what the culture is
so and what the culture is is really
sort of the shared set of values and
protocols that a group of people ascribe
to and sign up for when they're working
on something together or collaborating
together or living together or traveling
together there's lots of different
little subculture type of experiments
but typically the culture is defined by
how do you collaborate how do you
communicate what are sort of the
unwritten rules around how you relate to
one another so feel squishy super super
importance and you can actually start to
codify some of these things for your
organization's so even though if it
might feel a bit ephemeral you can
actually codify capture and actually
make tangible what these values are you
can write put them down and writing so
there is a process that you can go
through and it's extremely helpful and I
highly recommend it and then what's a
strong culture what does that mean
sounds a little odd but I think a strong
culture is where people in in the
organization or in the community that
you're working with feel empowered so
they feel like they are they are a
critical part of that culture and they
can actually be engaged contribute and
participate so a lot of that is around
individual work motivations and so as
much as you can have say autonomy in
your work and contribute to the larger
endeavor the more people that feel that
way and feel like they can contribute
the stronger your kirtle cultural
culture will be so just a few kind of
definitions and I think the reason that
you're all here is really like okay fine
like we know who we're designing for we
checked
about culture but how do you make it how
do you make it good what does that mean
so I'm just going to throw out a few
things based on things in the industry
my own experience in literature there's
lots of literature on this stuff because
again it's super important so I'm really
excited you're all here did you care
about it I'll throw out a few things and
I'm happy to chat afterwards about any
of this stuff but I would say a few key
principles to get on the right foot to
create a culture that you want is to
start early so even if you're a super
small startup I've already talked to
some of you hear that worked at very
small organizations feels like a luxury
to think in word when so much of your
challenge is thinking outward of the
market as it should be but to be
effective in doing what you want to do
it's really important to be intentional
and start early about what kind of
environment do you want to create for
your people and as I was mentioning you
can start to codify some of those things
what are our values what do we care
about so there's lots of companies
intact that have these I mean atlassian
in San Francisco has like five core
values and they're everywhere they've
codified them and they they are visually
available not only in their literature
and on their website but in their office
literally as banners so you can capture
these things even if they aren't
scientific / say they are observable and
you can capture them and don't wait to
do it so even if you're small you're
going to put yourself an advantage the
earlier start to define these things and
then and I would say just share them and
socialize them and agree on them as a
group so that you can replicate that
moving forward so the earlier you do the
better rewarding people for the right
behavior so we talked about how culture
is really a shared set of values and
protocols for how you how you work
together so you might say that your
culture is collaborative you might make
a decision that we want a collaborative
culture and what does that look like
does it mean that we want consensus or
does it mean that we involve specific
stakeholders for specific decisions so
you can put some boundaries on it and
some definitions around that what you
really need to do is that if you put
that stake in the ground and you
articulate what that is you need to
follow through and actually reward
people for the
saviors that you're saying that you care
about those cultural values so it's
important to think about the how how do
people get work done it's super easy to
reward results and obviously businesses
about results we want results but the
how is just as important as the what so
if people achieve extraordinary results
but do it in a way that's completely
counter to everything that you've
decided is important to you as an
organization if they leave awake in in
their work that is not in sync with what
you say you care about you really need
to get that back in line it's super
important to follow through and make
your actions in terms of what you
recognize as a company what you
compensate for and those are all ways of
rewarding certain types of behavior so
it's super important to capture those
and reward those behaviors you want and
I would say there's the carrot of
rewards and then certainly there's
consequences so if people behave in a
way that is counter to what your you're
saying that your culture should be or
what you want it to be and what you're
creating it to be then there should be
consequences for that too it's super
important and you need to think about
the whole organism when you x you
implement some of these rewards and
these consequences because it's not only
about the one person it's about all the
people that they affect and they impact
so it's really the best thing that you
can do is to follow through on that
stuff you know the third one really i
think is particularly important to
cultures with a lot of developers just
the ideas treat your people as the
intelligent problem solving population
that they are and usually when people
want to solve problems they like to
understand how certain decisions were
made it doesn't mean that it's consensus
so transparency is a very frequently
used word now it can mean different
things but I think the one common
denominator would be just making
available sort of the rationale the data
whatever it is that drove into a certain
decision it doesn't mean that you'll get
agreement but at least you're sharing
sort of the approach that you took to
get there the only other thing that I
would say about transparency is that
making things available is not quite the
same thing as transparency so you can
dump a bunch of information out there
but it doesn't mean that it's accessible
per se so the way
that you are transparent is actually
pretty important the whole goal of
transparency is to invite people into
the process to understand the process to
feel like they were a part of it in
whatever way that was so if you just
dump a bunch of stuff out there and say
it's out there we're being transparent
but people can't find it then you're not
really being transparent so think
through how you share information and
make it accessible beyond just being
available and then you know removing
obstacles from getting done right
so people want to solve problems they
want to ship they want to test they want
to get stuff out the door it's
frustrating when you can't do that if
there's bureaucracy or if there's tools
that aren't in place it's super
frustrating and that can be a huge
morale killer so that's just like a very
specific thing that's probably fairly
Universal in terms of building a healthy
vibrant working environment and culture
is just get done make it easy to
get done take out the obstacles to
getting done and then finally
distribute the relationships this might
be more applicable to some of the bigger
companies that you're at but as you put
a stake in the ground and make decisions
about the kinds of culture that you want
as you grow it's very difficult to
replicate that unless you distribute the
responsibility and the great thing is is
that as you distribute that
responsibility to everybody in the
organization everyone's an owner
everyone feels like they're a part of it
because they are a part of it and what
does that look like it could be when you
hire new people into the company instead
of having a centralized orientation
process it might be giving them a buddy
that was just hired a month earlier and
is very sympathetic to what this new
hire is going through and then they can
pass it on to the next new hire so
distribute that don't feel like it's a
commanding control kind of thing it
certainly isn't a healthy culture can be
shared and owned and driven by everybody
there so those are just some some
initial thoughts I think I have some
bonuses so it's very good to know how
you're doing are you creating a good
culture how can you know if you're on
the right track what are some key
indicators these are just a few they're
hardly prescriptive or
exhaustive but it's a good indicator for
example some of your meetings tend to be
Boom Boom Boom super focused very
effective in and out boom you're off to
do your work that might be an indicator
that people are on the same page there
in line there's a shared understanding
of what needs to happen communication is
clear these are all very positive
indicators on the other hand if meetings
are long there's maybe too many people
in the room or there's not that many
people in the room then that's an
indicator that maybe some of these
shared understandings and protocols and
ways to do things aren't really sinking
in or infiltrating in the organization
so that's sort of an indicator another
indicator is technical debt and that's
really sort of the the instantiation of
a culture that isn't effectively sort of
digested by the organization so
technical debt is really a concept that
I'm sure everyone in this room is
familiar with that the whole idea of
when you when you make shortcuts and you
try to get things shipped in a limited
time frame you may not do the the full
amount of technical work that needs to
be done to architect out a solution that
has less dependencies and less bugs for
example so the more you defer doing
implementing the the products the way
that you need to for the technical
architecture the more mess you're gonna
have to clean up later right so everyone
knows that technical debt is and there's
a lot going on right now and that's a
quote from another person Laura
Thompson's a head engineer at Mozilla
and she calls technical debt an energy
vampire for engineers that just sucks
the life out of you as an engineer so
additionally there's a lot of discussion
happening Steve Blank who writes about
lean startups and Kate Huddleston as an
engineer in San Francisco she'd they
talk a lot about team debt so it's the
analogy of if you take on too many team
members and don't properly assimilate
them to use a scary word but if you
don't properly integrate them and share
what those values are and get them
equipped with what the goals of the
organization are then you acquire team
debt your team can slow down even one
member if not properly I'm boarded and
integrated and exposed to what your
culture is and how
work can really drag down the
performance of the entire team so that's
definitely an analogy that is being used
more frequently so again it speaks to
the importance of being explicit about
your values in your culture and sharing
that and transmitting that to other
people hours worked that's another
indicator if people are spilling into
there they just have no work life
boundary then it might be a good idea to
check in and see like is this an
explicit decision that we have made it
to meet a certain goal or things not
quite clear in terms of like what is the
work and the focus and the way that
we're doing the work about so if people
are working crazy hours and feeling
burnt out and stressed out probably
another indicator that you haven't you
have work to do to really reach out and
understand what the understandings are
what the expectations are throughout the
organization and maybe do a check on
that it's certainly if it's not an
explicit decision to do so and then
there's just other metrics that a lot of
organizations do look at things like
churn and retention those are noisy so
that's sort of a like don't necessarily
look at those things because there's a
lot of other factors that can go into
that the external market did you get
funding did you make that big sale so
there's other stuff in there that you
can be doing a fantastic job at really
transmitting the ideas around your
culture and integrating new team members
but if there's an external external
event that can mess up things like
looking at your retention or your churn
rate so I would caution you to not look
at those things but maybe check out the
other things with some indicators and
then really the only thing I would leave
you with and again the stuff is kind of
meaty so I'm happy to talk to people
over lunch but I would just say that as
we talk about indicators and how can you
measure hucking track if you're
effectively building a strong culture
and creating and growing that culture is
just that this stuff is hard and it's
it's not quite the same timeline as
software development and web development
so people people's motivations behaviors
how they work together that stuff a lot
of it's hardwired some of it takes a
while to change so the environment is
certainly formative and influential and
how people work together and how the
culture evolves
but the stuff takes time so you can't
necessarily wire architect a culture in
a couple of months it takes time so I
leave you with this quote that basically
says that in science some of the results
take a generation to see but it doesn't
mean that you shouldn't be vigilant and
you shouldn't care about it and have a
method and an approach to building it
because it is likely one of the most
important things you can be investing
your time and energy if you want to
build a sustainable organization over
time so I think that's it that's all I
got I finished early so hey oh yeah
there's some goodies for you and I will
post these on SlideShare and tweet it
out as well but there's some links for
better understanding drill downs of some
of the stuff that I shared as well so
thanks a lot Sims I'm down for that yeah
we got three minutes go for it
yeah last at the last forward Jas I gave
a talk on working remotely yeah I can
toot it up again is there a specific
question that you have or right so the
question is can you build a strong
culture with remote teams what are the
risks so simply yes you can and there
are risks and it can be harder so so you
need to be even more intentional i think
when your team is very distributed about
how you communicate and how you set up
expectations about how the teams
collaborate and work together you can be
extremely explicit about like listen I'm
gonna be available on this channel from
these hours to these hours and come to
certain agreements but it takes more
work if you just bump into someone and
visually see them there's visual cues
you don't have to work on when you're
going to grab that person when your
remote obviously you don't have the same
kinds of cues so you need to be
extremely intentional and think through
that and there's nothing that really
quite replaces a face-to-face meeting so
just using the example of Mozilla
Mozilla is a very distributed
organization we have over a thousand
staff across I think 11 offices and at
least those many time zones because a
lot of people work in their homes so
we're a great example and we bring
together regularly face to face we think
that's super important to do as an
organization WordPress some of the other
buffer some other very remote
distributed organizations also believe
in the value of face to face and so I
think the analogy there is sort of like
you can build a room machine and put few
on the machine through all your
communications channels whether it's
slack or IRC but you got to jumpstart
that relationship that foundation of
trust through the face-to-face
interactions it's really critical yes no
i mean like face-to-face so mozilla we
do video calls all the time but then
when we get together so we're looking at
each other remotely but it's extremely
different when you're in person because
there's a lot of ancillary conversations
and things just come up outside of the
confines of a 30 minute face-to-face
stare at the camera where you feel like
you need to stick to an agenda or you're
being disrespectful the person's time or
whatever that looks like so it's amazing
how much more information can be gleaned
in just relationship building
and Trust building anyone else all right
