talk about mix-ins so what is a mix in
so luckily Wikipedia to the rescue they
have a pretty good definition and a
pretty good page on it but it's
basically a class that's not meant for
direct instantiation and where you're
not using the inheritance for
specializing classes but rather using it
to basically collect different
functionality and you typically use
multiple inheritance to combine your
mix-ins together and so this is useful
when you want to have multiple
orthogonal features that you you're
going to combine in arbitrary ways so
here's a little example so let's say
you're building an adventure game and
you want to create a bunch of different
kinds of doors for your maze so we'll
have a base class door who have locked
doors short doors magic doors so then we
can if these are considered mix-ins we
can kind of combine them together as a
lock short magic door using multiple
inheritance and so great this is
something you couldn't do in Java
so what kind of language support is
there for mixing so in some other
language is they do have direct language
support Python does not but that's okay
because we have multiple inheritance and
direct access to the Dometic object
protocol so we can do all kinds of
things that it will allow us to
implement various mixing styles so
there's some so you're typically going
to use multiple inheritance to implement
these mix-ins and this can cause some
issues first one is method resolution
order
the second is conflicts with internal
states between the classes and the third
is being able to compose methods across
mix-ins so method resolution order is
about basically figuring out what
methods you're going to call and who
overrides who when you're using and it's
very straight if you have just single
inheritance then you have a linear
sequence of classes and it's pretty
straightforward but as soon as you have
multiple inheritance you're gonna start
running into problems where you have
multiple base classes you have multiple
base classes that may have common
subclasses and so it gets complicated
and they changed how this worked in
Python 2 3 and basically there's a
restriction that if your subclass
hierarchy cannot be linearized you'll
get an error from Python and in addition
just having this it can get complicated
to reason about right to try to figure
out where which method is actually
implementing the particular method
you're trying to call and so this can
occur if you compose mix-ins that
inherit from other mix-ins you can run
into this problem so one thing I
recommend to this page on the Python
website actually goes into detail on how
this method resolution thing works and
will also later on I'll talk about a way
to avoid this problem altogether so this
is actually an example where I ran into
this problem in my own code to going to
give you an idea so I'm building a
system for doing deployment automation
and have this class of resource that
represents something I'm going to
install and I have various mix-ins to
describe that the properties of that
resource so I have one mixing and I'm
obviously ignoring all the details of
all the methods of the classes right but
just for the example so this one is
where I need to I need as you do access
to to do the installation so there's a
particular mixin that has clot methods
defined for doing that and if I'm using
something that's going to use the apt
package manager there's a mixin for that
and and to use that I actually need to
ask you to access so I'm inheriting from
the other mixin then I have some mixin
for doing file level backups and that
also requires as you do access so it's
inheriting from that so now when I'm
creating my little installer for Apache
I ran into this problem because I'm
basically taking from this mixin in this
mix in which inherit from this other
mixin and when I do this I actually get
the air and you can by changing the
orders of the this sequence you can you
can avoid that error but it gets to be
very complicated in there situations
where there's no way you can actually
subclass from a given class and if you
read that one one page you can see
examples but this was a real example I
ran into it my own coding so this can
get complicated so I'll kind of go into
later an example of how to avoid this
issue all together with mix-ins so
another issue is that you may have
multiple mix-ins and so here again the
idea is we're trying to combine
independent code and they may define
some some state fields and they may
define like a private state fields let's
say status and so these two mixings are
defining the status field but they have
different meanings that so this mixin is
assuming that it basically is defining
it and using it internally
but for the locked door class so this is
going back to our example of our our
adventure game for the locked door class
basically is saying what the status
field is thing whether it's locked or
not and for the magic door is basically
telling you whether there's a spell
activated for the door so now we want to
combine them in locked magic door and
what happens and when we do this is one
of these is going to override the other
and and the other class is basically
going to have its values overridden so
that's not what you want and the thing
is if you're just composing these
classes and you don't look at the
internal implementation you won't be
aware of that so this is something to be
careful of with make sense so the final
issue is basically let's say us a method
and many of the different mixings
implement this method and you want some
way to aggregate the results so you can
do that so here we want to say whether
the door can be opened you can do that
but ideally you don't want to be using a
style we're directly referring to your
base classes because you're kind of hard
coding that inheritance and
implementation into the thing so you'd
like a more elegant solution so here's
kind of my recommendations on how to get
around these issues so the first one is
you can basically avoid having any state
all together in your mix-ins and
basically just call methods or if you
need to maintain some internal state
there are some truly private fields that
are available in Python specifically
created for this feature and you can
read about it in the Python tutorial and
basically if you put a double underscore
in front of the field name it's going to
mangle the field and put the class name
append it to the field name internally
and then you can basically avoid these
issues and you have a truly private
member so the other thing is to avoid
this inheritance in your mix-ins and
then you don't have all these positive
method resolution order and that also
that example of combining methods gets
simpler
so to avoid inheritance what you can do
is basically directly inherit from
object or some other base class and then
basically if there are some methods that
you're expecting you can basically check
for them in your init function and
basically here's some code that we'll
look through basically the attributes so
you basically tell it here's my object
here's the methods I need and it's
basically gonna check that the rata find
by some class in your composition and
then you can just document it in your
your class doc string saying I need this
method but when you actually try to
instantiate the class it will actually
it'll check that it's there so if you do
this then you can kind of combine these
mixings in any order and you don't have
problems so if we look at this this
installer deployment tool example so
here's where I kind of solved my method
resolution order by using this this
pattern so basically my su du mixin is
defining this get password method and so
these other two subclasses need it and
so rather than sub classing from su du
mixing they basically just declare they
need this get password method and then
if you try to instantiate this class
without including it in your inheritance
then basically these will give you an
error so then in my Apache resource I
can just mix these arbitrarily and I
don't care what the order is and
everything will work fine so I guess in
conclusion mix-ins are a great way that
you can basically combine orthogonal
functionality and in Python kind of the
standard way to do it is using multiple
inheritance but multiple inheritance can
get a little tricky so my recommendation
is to kind of use some of these
techniques and you can basically have a
singer' implementation of mix-ins okay
