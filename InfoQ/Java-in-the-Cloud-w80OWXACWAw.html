very happy so I have about 200 slides no
slightly less but quite a few so let's
try to keep it interactive so if you
have questions please interrupt me any
time first of all I'm really sorry
you'll have to handle my accents I know
it's painful but you know that's the way
it is I'm sorry
so I was born in Switzerland and that's
where I live so in case you had any
doubt this country indeed exists and I I
was born actually at JBoss pretty much
first as a as a developer when I still
knew what it meant to to to code then as
a GM for Europe than CTO then I joined a
company called Red Hat well you actually
read had acquired us so Red Hat is not
ladies in red actually if you if you
have a Google Alert for red hats you'll
have plenty of alerts about a group of
ladies wearing red hats so it's a bit
confusing at first and in 2010 we
started cloudBees and we're about 30
bees now in six countries and in the US
were in six states so we try to be as
proud as possible
I guess it's maybe it's related to the
way bees behave but you know so we're a
relatively distributed team so tonight I
want to go and tell you a story
backwards then talk a bit about cloud
computing what does it mean to
developers because we hear a lot about
cloud but you know it cloud means
different things to different people and
then I'll I'll speak also about why it's
useful to have the cloud and why it's
useful for you as a developer and I'll
do some weather forecasts by Xion first
of all who is using the cloud in some
way shape or form today for example on
Amazon okay
who knows about cloud bees
okay that's all of the club is employees
that's great so that's good
who knows about Jenkins okay great okay
so you know that kohsuke is at the back
so so let's start with with the story
backwards so we're pretty good typically
at predicting what's predictable that's
what I figure out in the last few years
so you know if we see a blue line like
that and I ask you what do you think
we're gonna do next quarter I suspect
you're gonna tell me B except if you're
pessimistic or optimistic but you know
typically when when we see things like
that we're pretty good at predicting
when we have something what that we call
a paradigm shift it's very difficult to
predict what could be ahead because it's
hard to project yourself in the future
and guess what kind of new things you
could do with that with that change so
but but conversely once you're on the
other side of that paradigm shift it
seems very obvious where you sit and you
wonder how you were doing things back in
the days before it existed so like today
you're all using mobile phones it seems
pretty natural and so on and probably
some kids already asked you why in the
past did you have those strange phones
with cords why did you need that right
well yeah it seems obvious today but it
wasn't that obvious back in the days so
let's see how we can make some
comparisons between what we have lived
in the past what we went through in the
past and what IT is like today so let's
speak about electricity so at the end of
the 19th century we've seen the first
electricity generator electrical
generators so there were you know big
machines sophisticated it was really a
high-end IT back then but they were very
fragile very costly so that's not the
kind of thing you would have in your in
your flat typically so city started to
understand that this would really be a
competitive advantage in terms of
productivity that you could get
electricity for manufacturing and so on
so they understood that that's typically
the kind of investment they would need
to do
after at a bigger level than just a
single company or single individual it
would make sense to have a community on
this those equipments and and then have
everybody consume this electricity so in
1878 there was a an exposition in in
Paris and it was I think one of the
great exposition that took place because
you have for example the head of the
Statue of Liberty that's now in New York
so it was being built so you just had in
somewhere in the garden just ahead of
that so you had lots of technologies
that we use on a daily basis today being
exposed for the first time and and and
that included electricity and in the
year after this this even took place we
could see a bunch of cities around the
world start implementing the first
electrical generators so you can see all
of them well so so you have to realize
that that for the for the 19th century
or early 20th century those were really
the Googleplex of the 19th century so
this was I hand you know looks like an
old building but I can tell you this was
high-end but it was not as simple as it
seems you know today were used to have a
few plugs but beyond that it's pretty ok
you know you can take your laptop travel
around the world and it's gonna work but
back then it was not as simple there was
no standard was it a CDC should it be 50
60 Hertz or you know whatever what
voltage what type of plug what type of
SLA would you get it was all over the
map speaking about a map here is Paris
in 1902 so you can see a simplified map
of Paris and you probably can't read
what's written there but in each color
you have a different electrical system
so the green one is AC an a/c network
with one phase the yellow one has five
plugs or whatever that's that's called
and so on so depending on where you
where you would have a totally different
electrical system so I can tell you that
this was not bugs and the key word was
not mobility right so you would create
equipment electrical equipment just to
sit in a specific region and there is no
way you would move around to plug it in
in a different region so if we fast
forward now where we do we land well you
are a consumer like me you have a plug
it's very much defined what you will get
in that plug you know in terms of
voltage in terms of current and so on
then you have a local distributor that
plugs into a grid and you don't care how
this energy is being produced it could
be hydraulic it could be nuclear it
could be solar whatever and if one of
those go down well that's fine another
one will will pick up and you'll be fine
so we've really reached a level of
sophistication in in terms of
electricity production and consumption
that is that is pretty amazing so what
is the state of IT today you know I told
you the story about electricity it's not
just to look smart we can try to make
some comparisons with what we do in IT
today so my feeling is that this is
about the same as this right we are at
this stage pretty much in terms of IT
and if you wondered the thing on the
right is actually the first data center
the first Google Data Center so when
Google started they had a bunch of
machines and if you are lucky enough to
do a Google search back then that's what
you would be running on so the question
is could IT evolve in a similar fashion
as what the electricity went through so
you know if you I'm sure you've all seen
pictures like like that you know I saw
that from time to time when I was doing
consulting sometimes you see quite a
quite a few cables right sometimes it's
a it's a mess and yet it moves so I
think today we're still treating IT as
something extremely custom as owed to
you you know do done specially
quickly for one use kids everybody
everybody has its own little stack
because they think it's a better stack
it's very costly there is a high
overhead you get very little agility
with that type of up setup and that's
where the cloud comes in and the cloud
is all about standardization how can we
consume IT not in a highly specialized
fashion just because we think we know
better but in a standardized fashion
because it could allow us to be much
more mobile much more agile and and and
and to do things at a much lower cost
and so the cloud revolution as a started
we can thanks Jeff for that many people
had the idea of cloud obviously for a
long long time you know the kind of
analogy I'm doing here is not new but
the problem is how do you do that
factually right you need to have a
critical mass for at some point somebody
to step up and say well not only do we
have the ID but we have the critical
mass hardware wise to do it and we have
smart people to actually implement it
and so you know it's a bit like life you
need water you need oxygen you need a
bunch of things but sometimes it happens
sometimes it doesn't happen well it took
place this time and so now we see a lot
of the IT being clarified we see a lot
of the vendors you know the software
vendors reshaping their offering into
SAS offering we see the hardware vendors
reshaping their business into gas
business so infrastructure has a service
so all of this is being changed and
morph to adapt to this new cloud model
so a few of you interesting pictures
this is on this graph you can see in
blue the consumption in terms of
bandwidth from Amazon for their shop for
their core business that's that's a band
whose days a consume and it start in
2001 and goes up to 2008 at the extreme
right here and in red that's a bandwidth
consumption of AWS so the cloud at
Amazon so what you would consume if you
were to rent machines and so on
at Amazon and you see that it's you know
this graph probably ends sometimes in
the mid 2007 now you can expect a WS to
be slightly beer and the blue line would
most probably be like a flat line right
so it just shows the interest for AWS
today so maybe you were too far to see
some of the stuff on those pictures but
those are typical data centers this one
is slightly bigger you can see a guy was
actually a bike in there so my my my
belief is that the cloud will do to IT
wireless electricity has done to to the
industry so we're gonna go through
exactly the same steps so same
standardization the same regulation of
cloud providers and so on and so on so
it's it's I think a very big a very big
shift I'm actually gonna publish a
series of blog that goes like e more in
in in in into that topic and explain the
various phases and the various impact
you know that's just my my guess so you
can agree with me or disagree but I
strongly believe that's that's the way
it's gonna happen if you disagree III
suggest that we meet in - in 2020 and we
look at what happened over a year and I
you know I'm not the type of guy that
likes to quote generals typically but I
really like that code so I think it's a
very good one so to finish this with
this analogy I think that the power
plants are the cloud providers that's
really what's probably providing the
compute capacity the grid is internet
that's at the generic medium by which we
can distribute this compute and then the
electrical plug this mechanism by which
you can hook to that standardized grid
is the router obviously you have plenty
of operating system you have an Android
you have iOS and so on my belief is that
over time as a browser will become more
and more unified access to to this grid
you know that's for another topic I
guess so that's great so the cloud is is
great is is there and it's gonna grow
and it's gonna be as a new electricity
but what does it mean to me as a
developer I understand what it means to
IT people for example it means that all
of the things are gonna be much more
standardized and maybe we're not going
to own hardware in the future that's
fine but as a software developer what
does it mean to me so let's go through a
cloud 101 for the not-so dummies to
explain what it could mean for the
developers so this is what developers
are used to which is you're used to
build stacks in your enterprise probably
so you define what server you want to
use maybe you're gonna use some
vectorization layer some Java lifting
machine application server load balancer
your application and so on so we're used
to build those stacks to maintain those
stacks and you know the science is in
how to make sure that you can maintain
that stack at the lower cost that it's
extremely stable how do you do when you
migrate from one stacked with the other
so you'll find plenty of books on that
that's relatively known not science I
would say unknown art but how do we map
that art into the cloud do we simply
take those existing stack and and throw
them in in the cloud and and do
everything as is not quite so what you
will hear typically when you start using
the cloud is you will start hearing
about yes paths and sass who has not
heard about those things don't don't be
shy by the way you know okay so and by
the way that's a big problem with a
cloud which is depending on the audience
you'll typically have one part of the
audience that are part of the cloud
arathi so you know everything about the
cloud
and one part of the audience that
doesn't know anything about the audience
so doing a presentation on the cloud is
great because it's it's it's a pretty
sure way to upset about half of the
audience either you're too technical or
not enough technical so so let's go
through those layers so let's decrypt
what those layers mean for for
developers so the first layer is called
yes infrastructure has a service and
those are really the Lego blocks of IT
so that's really the smallest block you
can consuming in terms of IT it would be
like a virtual machine or a computer
storage I want an IP address I want set
up that that networking role and and so
on
and if you were a developer what that
would mean to you is you would say
things like well give me a server
give me an operating system put those
together I'm gonna set up a firewall and
so on so it's truly you know Lego block
by Lego block it's a good thing is that
you can do pretty much everything you
want right because it's just a machine
so just build your machine and you're
done
but it's very complicated so typically
what you will why you will use this if
you want to build a specific system so
it's not so much about application as it
is about system if you have an exchange
system maybe you have a specific
database you want to set up or whatever
so what you care about is not so much
just about an application but a specific
stack working on on a server so the the
good news about that is you've now
become responsible for your data center
right you used to have somebody a team
of people doing IT now all of that has
disappeared now you can do everything
from the common line you can say okay
mr. Amazon give me five servers I want
that much storage and so on and it looks
all great right but guess what you don't
need to carry that anymore
but you're just doing the work that IT
used to do right so you can use a bunch
of tools for that you will have heard
about chef but that and many others
those are just tools that help you
automate those various process to build
configuration in the cloud or on-premise
but you know really the cloud is where
this is very useful so speaking about
Lego that's the kind of things you could
do with yes right do whatever you want
you know even if it doesn't really make
sense you can do it if that's what you
want to do so that's extremely flexible
so the consequences of using an
infrastructure as a service directly is
that you end up benefiting from the
cloud in terms of elasticity or capex
meaning you don't have to prepay for
those resources if you want one and then
you want five you'll get that so that's
a great aspect about infrastructure has
a service you don't need to spend six
months waiting for the PIO to reach the
good department and IT guys to set up
those machines that's going to take
place directly but once you have those
machines the type of work you have to do
is probably actually higher than what
you would need to do on-premise the
cloud is very you know it moves so
sometimes you receive an email from
Amazon saying oh by the way this machine
has an issue we'll shut it down for you
okay and well you have to rebuild it
right but if you receive that email at
night and there is a reason emergency
you're not going to rebuild your stuff
at night right so you need to automate
you end up having to automate a lot of
things you need to backup all of that
you need to make sure you do garbage
collection we have a system at cloud
these that just do Amazon garbage
collection because it's so easy to
snapshot to backup to do plenty of
things you end up with stuff left and
right and you're like who owns this
machine everybody's like I don't know
not me well you know what let's not kill
it because maybe it's useful so when we
had too much of that we said we're gonna
invent a robot that's gonna check that
every machine is associated with a
business a real business if it's not
let's kill it right and if we killed
some things that made sense well we had
a bug in the algorithm but other than
that it's pretty good so you have to
automate a lot of thing and believe me
you should use Amazon you should try it
if you haven't done so it it's really
magic how
can really create machines and set up
things and so on it's great but you're
very quickly discover that if you want
to use this in production directly it's
gonna be a lot of work to automate all
of those situations so that was the
lower layer infrastructure had the
service if you look now at the very top
of this layer you have software as a
service so typically when people ask you
what is SAS you'll say yeah it's
companies like Salesforce and Salesforce
you know so Salesforce is definitely the
best-known company for for for this but
you have plenty of others company
you could Arctic email obviously is one
Zendesk that's sweet
well plenty of those so and so what does
it mean it means that if you are looking
for a solution and there is a SAS that
solve that problem that's great
you know it means that in very little
time you will be able to have a solution
that fits your needs no work needed no
setup no configuration or nothing well
obviously you might want to configure it
a bit but you know it's not like you had
to setup that too typically with the SAS
the time it takes to get started with
the base set up that has some good
defaults it's pretty quick it's at least
if you compare it to the time it would
take when you receive a DVD or USB key
to set that up configure installs a good
operating system and blah blah blah you
know no comparison SAS is going to be
extremely quick so problem is that as a
developer you will typically find that
it's pretty rigid right if you don't fit
in the canvas there is no real way you
can go out so some SAS have a way to
extend programmatically that's kind of a
corner case that's not the true
definition of obsess which is just the
software so typically if you want to go
beyond you will probably quickly find
that you're limited in what you can
achieve so that's the Lego view of SAS
right it's you know it looks great it's
well polished and so on but if you want
to extend that that's gonna be a
slightly awkward
and this led me to pass the middle layer
so pass is platform as a service and and
so pass is really speaking to developers
it's not so much about give me a server
give me some storage it speaks with the
level of abstractions that makes sense
to developers things like give me an
application or I'd like a code
repository I want to do some tests
I want a database that that means
something to developers right but give
me a server with some storage you know
that's because we've been forced to
think about IT as we do development but
frankly it's just necessarily bad
because if we could avoid thinking about
those concept we would be fine you know
it's like we like as developer to think
about servers and clustering and load
balancers you know I was crazy about it
because you know when I was JBoss I I i
created the first implementation of
clustering I loved it you know as a as a
geek it was great to do and so on but
let's say we could have a single machine
on earth that could work and that could
run all of the possible workload of all
application on earth would I be would I
be fine with this yeah I wouldn't need a
load balancer I would not need the
clustering I would not need you know it
would work but it doesn't quite exist so
we're forced to think about those
concept those annoyances but but clearly
we shouldn't be dealing with this as
developers so let's go back to our lego
analogy that would be a platform
as-a-service so typically you would run
on top of an infrastructure has a
service it's not strictly required
companies like Google for example with
Google App Engine which is a path run on
top of their own infrastructure which
you cannot directly access and you know
and build systems on top it's really
it's really not visible and then you
have the path with the services that the
pass providers will will provide and
that in green is really the abstraction
that makes you not see the
infrastructure
don't see servers and so on but we'll
speak to you with verbs with concept
that makes sense to you and then in in
red you're gonna have your application
you're a java application or Grails or
whatever you want to do and the pass is
gonna do the load balancing it's going
to be the failover session replication
it's going to auto scale if it detects
that you need more more resources at
some point in time you can configure it
to say okay automatically scale to take
that load and then scale down once the
load is not there anymore and so on so
all of that hard work that is very hard
to implement if you want to do it right
is going to be handled by the Past
automatically and prepackaged in a way
that you're not going to see those
concepts so when you use a pass
applications data that's really what's
going to be at the center of your world
it's not going to be again backup
storage and whatever you know don't
think about IT so and this is a service
that's a very important point you know I
spoke about past yeah sass and the last
s is for service platform as a service
infrastructure as a service what does it
mean is you are not going to be the one
that's going to install that software
maintain it patch it make sure it's
stable and doesn't doesn't go down
you're outsourcing all of that and the
only thing you see is an API and you
consume it as a service and so that
radically changes the type of
interaction you have with IT or with
your middleware because you're not
maintaining that software anymore right
and that can be a bit confusing because
many vendors are trying to pitch for
example the private cloud or the private
solutions and even private pass and what
that is is actually platform as a
software right and your team your IT
team is going to be the one that makes
it a service but your team is going to
be responsible for running that for
operating that and making sure it's up
and running so you don't really you
don't really benefit from the same kind
of
economy of scale so first decision is as
a developer do you want to use yes and
you can do whatever you want with it
it's very flexible but it's complicated
sass very fast you'll get what you want
extremely good but constraint if you
want to go beyond or a pass is very
flexible so the past is really the new
platform for the developers that's a
cloud platform for developers so again
this word of caution could I get a
private pass so don't get me wrong it
might make sense in some in some
situation but most of the time it's not
gonna make sense right it's like can I
get a private jet sure you can write the
better be rich the better be big
whatever but it doesn't make sense for a
lot of people right because the idea
behind a pass and cloud is that a vendor
is gonna have a completely standardized
infrastructure with a u Jack with a huge
scale and you will be able to benefit
from top class setup top class
engineering much like a big customer but
you can be a one-man one-dog company
right that you will still benefit from
this top class behavior and as soon as
you start implementing this in-house
you're gonna be the one in charge right
so you as a developer might perceive
this as a service but behind the wheel
you'll get your IT guys making sure that
the pass is running and so on so if you
have five thousand servers or twenty
thousand servers yeah maybe you're a
cloud but if you have twenty servers or
fifty servers or 100 servers I don't
think it makes sense and and also
remember that the fact that you have a
distinct vendor to handle that is very
healthy because if you try to call Jeff
at Amazon and tell him look Jeff I want
to a project here it's pretty cool but
for one machine and we need some kind of
custom stuff because you know I'm kind
of different as a customer it will not
pick up the phone I suspect right and
that's good because if you want the
cloud to be efficient and scale you want
this to be a standard you don't want any
exception
right and as soon as you start having
this as part of the same team you know
how it works right forget you'll get two
guys near the water cooler and say eh
Bob can you just do that for me just a
favor you know for one server I need
this stuff and then you start having IT
guys that do exceptions left and right
and that just kills generous cities that
just kills your economy of scale so it's
a bit like to go back to my good
electricity example it's like if you
were going to your electricity provider
saying you know could I get the 160
volts plug just for my toaster because I
think I'd get a better use of it you
know that's when things start breaking
so in summary the cloud is great that's
really going to be a revolution for for
the IT industry it's going to reshape
the landscape all vendors are going to
be heavily impacted by that or software
vendors or hardware vendors think about
it right you were selling hardware to
companies now companies if they starts
if they stop buying hardware who is
gonna buy it
oh cloud providers maybe I should become
a cloud provider you know so HP is gonna
make some announcement tomorrow
guess what it's probably related to some
of that so so this is gonna be a massive
impact on on this industry okay so
that's great we're going to be much more
efficient you're not you're not gonna
have to worry much about IT but why do
you need it yeah maybe we were good now
right well if you look at what's going
on now we have a flurry of different
movement taking place of new needs
Mobile is huge social big data
consumerization of IT all of that is
generating new needs you know how many
people you know when they how many
people in development team suddenly they
come on Monday morning and the question
is like okay so the boss said that we
needed to have a mobile app for
everything we do right because we've
seen the ratio of users
accessing our website it used to be one
person now it's 30% of the users
accessing our website through our buyer
so we need to get ready right so we see
all kind of new apps pop up left and
right
so some numbers for example so that's
the number of desktop and and laptops
versus so that's a column on the Left
versus smartphones and tablets on the
right and as you can see in 2011 it's
estimated that well that's slightly also
it happened but essentially you have
more mobile devices then you have good
old desktop just look at Apple's revenue
right how much is a good old Macintosh
versus iPad iPhones and the like right
it's almost sad to have a Macintosh
these days you look at how much it sells
out and like them so it was me buying it
this is the smartphone shipments
compared to the dumb phones right so how
many that's so if you go above this red
line it means that you you are above 50%
of smart phones compared to the dumb
phones so in Europe it happens sometimes
in 2010 early 2010 in America it happens
in 2011 Japan
is not even on that slide because it
happened in 2008 that's an the
percentage of traffic coming from mobile
devices for example but for Pandora in
green for Twitter in in Brown and
Facebook in blue so in 2011 you had
Facebook at 33% Twitter 55 Pandora 60
persons right coming from pretty much
nothing in 2008 so that's creating you
know a world new range of needs of
applications that need to be adapted to
that new form factor and if we look at
also the audience the load that needs to
be captured
if we go from the mainframe
mini-computers pc desktop internet
mobile internet the number of units that
will potentially access your services
and generate heat in data centers to
compute your request is increasing right
we go from a few millions unit with mini
computers hundreds of millions of units
for PCs one billions units and plus for
desktops and 10 billions units you know
10 as a order of magnitude right for the
mobile internet and those are all units
that they might be small but they
generate as much traffic as the big ones
right so you need to have things on the
other hand to handle that load so how
can we handle that massive increase in
new applications in traffic right well
let's say we're going to have 10 times
more new applications to implement in
the next few years how do we do that so
one option is to hire ten times more
developers right you might want to
suggest that to your CIO we'll see if
that flies another option is to pay
smaller salaries like you know ten times
seems fair we'll see if that flies with
the Union and you can try to be 10 times
more productive right so you might need
to learn to type slightly faster and
we'll see but those seems like great ID
but that might not be enough so today
like to offer two solutions might not be
enough but I think they're a big part of
what we need to do we need to value
failure and we need to increase
productivity so when I say we need to
value failure it's always seems strange
right because we've been used to know
that failing is not quite good right if
we could avoid failing that's fine so we
know that about 25% of the project fail
don't worry this doesn't mean that 75%
of the project do not fail right you
still have a good chunk that we say well
they don't quite fail because we want to
be nice but they're just a failure as
well so a failure is bad that's we all
agree so
what we see that we try to force success
you know it's not quite that so let's
increase the budget we put more people
to it and and then we extend the
deadline and we reduce the scope so that
it's easier and we reduce expectations
you know boss it's it's a tough problem
to solve and what we've done is pretty
good actually right so at the end of the
process we feel like we've succeeded did
we really solve a problem I'm not sure
but let's call it a success and let's
have a beer so I think we actually need
to increase the failure rate of our
project because if we have to deliver
ten times more applications the question
you might ask yourself is will all of
those project be good ID
well you might do some sophisticated
research and check if it's good you know
what I'm sure that for most of the time
you won't be able to do proper research
so let's try it right and can you always
know that beforehand no sometimes you
just don't know you can do as much
research as you want sometimes it
doesn't work and that's it
so it's it's very hard so if something
is a bad idea
we'd better know that fast that way we
can stop it fail and move on so that's
typically how we do things on the Left
you have what I don't have ten ID here I
have eight but that's good enough and
you push that to the development team
and then the development team works and
produce application one application to
applications three application for we
can see that application for fail
application two and three where yeah so
so application one is a great success
took a long time to get there not
efficient another way to do it is to say
okay that's fine let's have our eight ID
let's work on them with much smaller
teams and let's not work on a
sophisticated project let's try to solve
the simplest problem we can as fast as
possible and I can I can tell you if
it's a good idea I'm sure even the
smallest crappiest software will get
some level of success and recognition
but I can tell you if it's not a if it's
not a good ID if it's a crappy and small
application it's really not going to get
any success and then very quickly you
can say well you know what fail fail
fail fail fail we keep those two very
good and so you know I might be stating
the obvious here but I really think we
need to to be much more aggressive in
how you reject ID and how we try if you
want to be able to handle the massive
lot of new applications we will have to
implement so failing fast with fewer
resources is good it's failing long
after with lots of resources that is bad
so let us now speak about the second
thing how to increase productivity
because you know it's it's great for me
to come and say you know what let's be
much more aggressive let's develop
things fast and so on yeah but if you
have a lot of friction between your
development team and IT and each time
you want to start a new project you have
to wait two months to get your
environment set up you know you're not
going to be much more reactive so we
must drop friction between development
and IT we really need to reduce that so
how do we do that how do we reduce that
friction use a pass easy right you could
see me coming so before we had a pass
how did we interact with IT we would
tell IT could you please provision a
server for me could I get X Y and Zed
installed on that server
could you please patch my server could I
get a database dump because I need to do
some tests could I get a new git
repository so that's a kind of thing you
would ask right and then behind the
topology would be setup to accommodate
your needs after a few months with the
pass you will not speak to IT anymore
you'll say create a new account give me
a new git repository I'm gonna create my
Jenkins test suite I'm gonna create my
app build my test deploy it to
production and I'm done right so it's
not so much about requesting steps
requesting intermediary steps so that
you can start getting your job done it's
do it right
you want to get repo get it you want to
test to it do it you want to deploy an
app on the fully clustered environment
and go do it a snap that's what it
should take so so that's for example the
cloud this platform you will find lots
of similarities among path vendors so
I'm not going to just start yet doing
the cloud is propaganda what you will
see most of the time is what you can see
on the right here so that's what most
platform as-a-service will offer so
that's a way to deploy your application
you can scale them you can have failover
you can leverage some of the core
services from the platform in terms of
monitoring in terms of management in
terms of databases and so on and then
some of the vendors will offer a number
of plugins extensions that you can
enable as part of your platform to get
more features right because a pass
providers will never be the best company
to offer you a no sequel database or you
know a sophisticated solution like app
dynamics so you need to have partners to
do that so the way it worked back in the
days which means now you would actually
buy software and start integrating that
software with your JBoss or WebLogic
server and make sure that it all works
and so on that would take you weeks to
get it done here with a pass you just go
say ok enable app dynamics done it's
full integrated fully managed dynamics
provide the service best-of-breed
we provide the past Best of Breed you
don't have to spend any time trying to
hook those two environments together
that's a huge value of pass it's not
just running things but it's integrating
things you need much faster than you
ever did
and what's pretty specific to cloud is
is at Club is we think that software
doesn't fall from the sky so before you
can end up with an application you need
to actually code it and if you think
that things will take place in the cloud
well that includes development as well
so what cloud is you will be able to
store your code you're maven artifacts
you will have a gem
as a service available you will be able
to do your build your test and then and
I'd like you to watch this slide
carefully because it took me a long time
to do this fancy animation so well thank
you so you what you were able to do then
is continuous deployment so you're able
to commit some new code online to the
repository a notification will be sent
to Jenkins Jenkins will do the buildin
test if you so wish at the end of the
test step it's going to dynamically
deploy your application to production or
to a test environment and nothing will
be impacted so your develop your your
users will still see the shopping cart
with their books and others in there but
the new application will show up right
that's the type of things that if your
goldman-sachs I'm sure you could set up
but typically IT shops do not provide
that level of sophistication
so does it even work right because it
sounds all very cute but does it work so
let me tell you about a small company
called lose it
who knows lose it nobody heard about
lose it
Thanks I know very we all about lose it
so it's a mobile application where you
can track how much you're eating you
know and and how much weight you're
going to lose and so on they have 12
millions users they they say handle up
to 25,000
transaction per minute on the cloud this
platform they do real-time monitoring of
what people do to make sure they can
react very quickly so they do micro
releases and and so they can check in
real time whether a new feature is
actually improving behavior or not
improving behavior if it's not improving
roll back move on so you know very agile
behavior well lose it is for people to
in marketing to in development right
so zero IT is your operation they wake
up in the morning one half of the brain
is about how to mark
that's product in the second half of the
brain is how to develop the best
solution ever right that's the love
that's a level of efficiency you
wouldn't be able to have five years ago
right who was able to do that kind of of
things get that kind of success with
just four guys so what you hear what I
hear regularly is yeah but you know I'm
not too much of a cloud guy I think the
cloud is interesting but is it safe is
it secure
is it stable I'm not so sure
well it's it I always find that pretty
funny because when you hear those guys
and and why they criticize the cloud and
I'm sure the cloud has many things to
improve don't get me wrong right but
typically when you hear them let's talk
about security right they will typically
take a book on security the nine hundred
pages book on how to do security well
look at the cloud and say see page 264
I'm not sure you do that well right but
what they don't do is to compare their
IT to the 900 pages book and what they
should be doing is to compare their IT
to the cloud and I'm pretty sure that
security safety stability and so on is
much much much better in the cloud than
in most companies I was able to visit
plus a good thing about the cloud is if
your cloud provider goes down you
typically hear about it on CNN so and
and so the real question for me is not
so much whether it's stable should we
convert people or not the wave is gonna
come and if you don't go to the cloud
you're gonna have plenty of lucid calm
in your field be a competitor in your
field do you think it's it's great to be
to have an application like a wait wait
sure these days when you have a bunch of
tanks for banks with 12 million users
and just four guys you know whatever
your field is once you're going to have
that level of efficiency go after your
market you might change your mind so
just as an ID you might want to be that
lucid first
so anyway my conclusion but I have
multiple conclusions that's French genes
in me we can stop talking so we have
multiple conclusions so the number of
application is just going to explode
because we have new needs mobile is
pushing there and so on so you need to
change the way you do things you need to
be much more aggressive in recognizing
failure you need to have tools that
allows you to be much more proactive you
have to stop having to you have to
reduce and kill the friction you have
with IT that's not useful just get rid
of it and and so you know a past is
really the best solution I found to do
that if you found other ways they might
be good but I know that a pass is a
great solution and also everybody knows
that pass is pretty early but you know
we I could tell you about some of the
customers we have you know lose it is
one but it you could argue to small
start-up we just released an application
in France with AXA Bank a big bank where
they provide an API so you can access to
the bank account you can start
implementing applications that access
the bank account information that
directing the backend you know and so
the type of sophistication and type of
applications moving to the cloud is
really real and Forex our bank for
example between the time it took them to
start the project to go to production it
was three months they've never seen that
level of efficiency within the bank so
everybody in the bank is like how do you
do that can we do the same you know so
it's really uh it's really impressive
the pace at which this is taking place
so I just wanted to say a few things
about cloud bees so that the propaganda
part we are a pass we're a pass first
and foremost focused on Java that's
where we come from that our DNA will see
a plenty of fast some of them tried to
exhibit a bit the notion of servers and
IT others try to abstract that away we
add Lobby things that even so the pass
that shows the servers and try to show
the httpd configuration and so on
might be good initially because we will
feel at home right it's not too far from
what your
doing it's actually not the right way to
do it because you don't need that so you
know take a deep breath and move to a
real pass that will talk to you like a
real developer speaking about
application and so on and not about load
balancers we have Deb at cloud we have
run at cloud so if you just have a
browser or a PC that's enough create a
create an account it's free and you can
create your detour subversion repository
it you can have your your Jenkins with
your bill taking place in the cloud you
can deploy your application your
databases you can create your next
startup just with a laptop we are about
30 persons you can see some of the
people on that slide in in this room you
have n truly you have a stephen heiress
who was leading Java server at Oracle
for quite a few years kohsuke at the
back obviously Harpreet and we all come
you know when I said we have Java DNA
you will find on that slide people
coming from JBoss Red Hat GlassFish
WebLogic WebSphere a layer micro media
bluestone and so on so words you you
don't even hear anymore yeah we're in
Woburn Massachusetts as you have seen we
were kind of kind of distributed and so
if I had one slide you need to remember
it would be this right this on the left
which you probably can't read is kind of
the steps you need to go through if you
want to deploy a new application you
need to set up your environment set up
your load balancers or firewall and so
on and it's a lot of steps some of them
are recurring steps making sure that you
keep things up to date patched and so on
and it's not only a lot of work but most
of those steps are actually things you
need to do between development and IT
it's high friction steps and what a pass
is about is the view on the right so
cloudBees in two minutes actually we
could do that together but there is this
common here that is
pretty good I'm not tall enough that's
surprising here so you have this comment
because we have an SD case and showed
you a command line tool we have tool
integration with maven and Eclipse and
whatever but a lot of developer like to
work from the common line and so in that
slide what you can see that we're
cloning a git repository then we're
saying create an application - - we CD
which means we c-can't in use deployment
- TJ bus the type of the container I
want this to be J bus and call it
kitchen sink this is going to create git
repository this is going to create a
Jenkins build and this is going to
create a JBoss container and all of
those are going to be nicely and tightly
integrated which means that once you're
going to do a push a git push it's going
to send a notification to Jenkins
Jenkins is gonna do the build and test
if you have any test setup and then it's
going to push the resulting binary to
production in a transparent fashion just
with one line
so let's go through some weather
forecasts by 2020 well it could be 2025
it could be 2018 you know don't be too
sensitive on that I think things will be
either about sass or pass why well let's
say you have a new need in your company
the question is going to be can I find a
solution that is pre-built
that satisfies my need if the answer is
yes use it don't you birth don't even
think about it just use it you're going
to get ready in a snap let's go and if
it doesn't exist use a pass because you
need to do some custom development to
get what you need right sass pass done
operating systems won't matter to IT
consumers that's huge that's me right
why well if you ask any past provider
they will tell you that they're trying
to get the smallest operating system
they can what we can adjust enough
operating system they don't need all
sophisticated behavior right
they just need a tiny core so just do
what they need and you as a user of that
pass you will care about Ruby Java
that's gonna be your API but frankly to
know that it's BSD Solaris Linux or
Windows yeah if I was to tell you you
know what I have my pass in two versions
one of them run Linux at one bucks an
hour and one of them run Windows at 2
bucks an hour which one do you want to
take no would I see anything nah just
the same okay give me the cheapest right
and so operating systems are going to
slowly disappear as we know them today
we don't need those fat operating system
anymore right and that's gonna have a
big impact again on the ecosystem as we
know it think about Microsoft a lot of
the ecosystem that has been built by
Microsoft is huge success comes also
from the strength of window
and all of those partners around it and
then you know you have office and you
have Microsoft sequel server so you
build upon this but once you nuke this
core and you start from scratch using
API developers API that radically
changes the game
so things that's gonna have a big impact
on the industry middleware well that one
is a bit sensitive you remember when
then you have Sarah when he was selling
when he was promoting salesforce.com he
was have had this logos that says
software no software right well people
were like I'm sure you're doing software
to do salesforce.com yeah sure but what
we do doesn't matter it's what you do
that matters and when you're using
Salesforce you don't see any software
you're just consuming a service the same
is true is going to be it's going to be
true about middleware when you're
consuming a pass
you're not seeing middle where you're
seeing API you're seeing containers you
focus on your application you throw it
on the pass it's going to take care of
it
but patching an application server
making sure that your message cueing is
nicely integrated that the transaction
are properly configured so the pool is
okay blabber this is middleware this is
legacy you won't hear about that and the
economy of middleware as we've known it
is just gonna reshape entirely and last
but not least just as you thought that
yes was hip I think it won't matter
anymore don't get me wrong it's gonna
matter a lot to us past providers right
because we need to tell you where do you
want to run you want to run in Europe in
Asia on the East Coast and the west
coast sometimes because of legal reasons
because you want your data to be in a
specific country sometimes because of
Latin see you know even so we're smart
we can't accelerate the speed of a
flight even so we tried in Geneva
recently with neutrinos but we've been
unlucky on that one so you will care
about that you will care about SLA is
this cloud provider good or not
but frankly as an end user you will care
about SLA about location but that's it
you won't use a gas anymore you will ask
your past providers can you run this in
Asia
do you provide that type of SLA yes okay
let's go but chances are high that you
will possibly not even be directly
contracting with some of those yes
providers so they are extremely
important is they are electriss--
electrical producer of the future but
you won't directly plug your toaster in
a nuclear plant you will you will plug
it in into a pass so join the light side
of the force just try it you know I've
spent five hundred slide now telling you
all about cloud and all about pass and
it's very hard to pitch why it's so
great we even brought we helped write a
book called pass for the dummies you can
go on the website and download it it's a
PDF and even when you read it you know
kind of like yeah looks cool not sure
that works anyway so the only way you
can be convinced or not convinced about
pass is to try it just go online if you
want to use actually you should use
competitive pass as well you know try
towards free pass and get a feel of what
you like what you don't like and that's
really how you're going to discover the
power of pass and to me it's a bit like
when you change a laptop you buy a new
laptop you know initially you're like
yeah sounds cool
yeah okay and then you try your all
laptop and you're like damn what
happened to that all laptop it's super
slow it's gonna be the same thing right
it's going to be a very smooth ride
towards the pass and don't don't try to
look back because it's gonna be painful
so it's free you get all features if you
want to try so you should try thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
