but I'm actually focused in mobile here
so you might argue with me or you might
ask me why I'm talking about just mobile
like why I'm separating mobile from
their desktop web of course you know i'm
not trying to separate them i'm just try
to you know talk about something more
mobile specific what was their mobile
equipping Eddie and form factors but
when you have a mobile phones or any
touch screens and they have a different
use cases different user scenarios so
that something you know I don't like the
focus on why mobile or why you know what
makes the mobile more special and here
in the tagline is a half full or half
empty so um actually so I've actually
have given my top last year so I'm
recycling some of the material I used
last year because I want to compare and
how things get better so basically I am
mostly talking about this web app the
web app project i have done with w3c and
at that time when i started an end of
2012 a lot of things are really not
useful well more like usable because
what seemed quite folded by browsers so
but now it's a 2014 so many things have
changed and although the browser vendors
are really pushing in everything forward
so let's a lot of improvement so yeah
i'm going to talk about how things being
changed in over here so a little bit
about myself so my name is tomo me tamam
Imahara and some of you might already
have no me in my social media I'm
usually going with a girl in Mac that's
some silly handle name I name myself
long long time ago when I was a huge
apple fan girl anyway that's a long time
ago so i'm an open web advocate so I
love web and i also love mobile so much
so i consider myself a total mobile geek
and i've been working a mobile industry
for a long time so i was working out who
yahoo mobile team actually what's before
iphone came
back in the time like no Americans ever
browse web on mobile phones unless your
total total geek like I was that was up
around two thousand nine ish I think I
run 2009 i joined pong to develop web OS
and i was doing in a UI in the u.s.
development over at a team and it was
quite interesting time you know then
later on I joined nokia because palm was
destroyed by HP then now nokia well you
know what happens microsoft have
acquired with mobile divisions and
laying off bunch of people so basically
it's really i've been through a lot of
interesting time you know witnessing all
that mobile manufacturers being trashed
by corporates and that was crazy and it
some people joking it's because I join
like where am i showing the company goes
wrong so people like hey can you join
samsung sorry someone were you working
Sam so I'm gonna try to talk shit about
it but a lot of people see ya joins
awesome anyways so here so this is a
mobile browser new release table i have
created so that might be not might not
be the super accurate but anyways that
actually tells you what i have happened
since when i started my project which
was in the end of 2012 and now it's a
2014 and you know the july already time
flies so there was a lot of interesting
things happen actually for mobile
browser world 2013 was really they like
just chaotic time for mobile browsers so
um chrome chrome 18 was the first mobile
I mean the yeah i would say mobile
chrome for android so we didn't have
cuts back in the time if you remember um
not just back in time we still have
android stock browser right for an
android phones so when google starting
an android phone
Andrew stock browser what's that the
browser the standard brother but then
they have sweet oh I don't say switch
actually didn't switch they have
released a crumpled Android and
sometimes 2012 so a team of the first
version then they haven't released
anything stable the next stable version
was 25 what's until favor alee so I was
actually really frustrated because I've
been working a mobile project and chrome
wait team was buggy in a while and I
could have so much better items it's so
much better but the better browser full
desktop right and the bugs being fixed
performance is better but I couldn't
have it for android phones so let's kind
of stressed up and I've I kept begging
Google guys when you're going to have
android I mean the Chrome for Android
but anyways so after version 25 we have
us a better and stable release
constantly important now so now 36 seats
ladies stable we have cannery it's which
is 38 it's available in desktop but you
know mobile doesn't have I mean they
don't release diversion and canary for
more phones so actually 37 which is
better it's the latest basin latest now
the Firefox has started out the same
versioning so 18 was the first one I saw
last year i believe i might be wrong and
that was not the first I mean the first
ever for firefox because mozilla guides
being working on mobile for a long time
even before firefox OS they had minimal
ahead of Enoch you know there are so
many more browsers before the firefox OS
happen and of course you know important
things what happened in 2013 for mozilla
guys were yeah firebox always formed so
now its latest probably 30 could be 31
not quite sure and they be making stable
progress and i think they have been
really pushing the web for it because
what you know they are really focus on
mobile now
them opera opera is a really interesting
ones because they have switched the
rendering engine right so they used to
be on a presto and jump a while but they
have decided to switch to WebKit so I
didn't include it over there but
actually a upper 14 is on the web get a
rendering engine but that was only one
version because last April google have
announced the black you know so they'd
fork WebKit to make the blink engine
then opera have joined the force so now
they have switched in a blink engine as
well so the version 15 it's on blink and
there they are now you know constantly
releasing the stable versions and latest
one available I checked the yesterday
was 22 that was for Android and that is
using chromium 35 so it's slightly
behind at a google chrome the other two
are slow I mean it slow releasing
brothers so iOS Safari yeah i'm not
talking about so far in general here i'm
only talking about mobile so it's a
mobile safari so seven iOS 7 it's the
first seven would stay pretty much only
major release last year and now they
have it better i haven't used yet
actually so the beta preview versions of
sugar Belle I think and lastly in the
discharge IE internet explorer 10 that
was for windows phone so yeah we did not
have any major release and last year but
the finally this yoga I 11 I was quite a
happy about it it's a lot of improvement
so this chart so I just got discharged
from statcounter so that's pretty
intelligent so I didn't really talk
about much of a stock browser I mean the
Android stop person previous slide but I
included here because it's actually
most popular browser was I would say but
the interesting thing is which it's just
helps just happening in I don't get the
hair anyway this month a lot of things
going on here it looks like iPhones
passing Android soft browsers because
users number stepping while on chrome is
going up but I think that's what a
Google guys that try to achieve so I
think it's working and let's see maybe
in the next month graph it's probably
from its passing those guys or maybe not
oh I think my clicker just died all
right so that that feature suppose that
so it's a from this is a screenshot from
can i use calm and i believe if your
front-end engineers you probably already
know have known this site so if you
don't you should definitely check can i
use so yeah you see all those supports
HTML feature sports here and red to
green which is good good progress you
see some orange I think it really died
yep the orange out there it's the upper
meaning but that upper meaning is a
proxy browser you know that actually
forces everything the server site so
that's not like the regular process I
don't worry too much about it so as a
web developer I'm pretty sick of hearing
people saying oh natives better you know
why don't you develop for native you
know in a native apps so much better we
have app stores okay cool yeah right so
yeah I'm not so of course in native has
a day I own advantage but here I'm going
to talk a little bit about why we school
I mean with the other one page is a
distracting app store so well app store
is nothing more than just a directory
right it's kind of like a portal web
portal like yahoo in 90s kind of so-so
flappy bird was quite popular when it's
released as a native
app but the Creator decided to pull it
up for whatever reasons now after that
people like freaky nuts oh my gosh we're
going to get flappy bird I'm gonna play
flappy bird so somebody wrote the web
app and you don't have to have a Peugeot
from Apple right Apple you know doesn't
approve your app if it's an ugly or
something but yeah so this is somebody
made a floppy bird in a web version and
it just released its go you can play in
a browser you don't need to buy you're
just you know download anything just
launched in a browser you can play and
another good example it's 2048 or 2048
whatever that is so somebody but the
fungi really stood on github is open
source and you know and again you don't
have to get this app from App Store Oh
actually if you go to nap store you can
find like gazillions of 20-40 clones but
anyways this brands and brother just
fine you know works on touchscreen as
well and it's pretty cool and even
cooler when you have really in when you
release your web app at open source well
the fellow developers out there can fuck
them right so this this is what I
happened sleppy dodge and judge 2048
that was awesome and sometimes you know
you wanna play now only have so much
time to play with so maybe you want to
just practice coding or whatever oh you
guys you want to just simply have the
best of the worst world so you want to
have something like a floppy to it about
a
yeah I suck I know so okay here's a
project that I about talked about
earlier so that's the project i started
out in late two thousand twelve which
w3c so this is called cuomo camera a
cool move means that was actually a
community group name cool mobile
platform community group or something
like that now we change the name the web
mode because we want we didn't want to
focus only on mobile we're going to just
have web and mobile so the name is
changed but anyways so it's called
qualms of camera the basically what it
is if i try to make Instagram like
happen run in a browser by using html5
new features so it's pretty experimental
was so the goal of project was first a
showcasing the capabilities of web
platform and educating web developers
out there because we want to show
showcase you know each new HTML features
use cases how we use them we want to
educate and lastly help improve browsers
so i don't personally not personal i
don't make browsers I mean I'm not
working for browser vendors but what
happened was so by working on this
project we can show them you know we can
show the browser vendors how things
should be improved of course in a bugs
to be fixed actually this works up
pretty well because I the full certain
things I was really befriended with some
guys in IE team and I complained hell up
with so many things they fix that now
it's happy about so this is a oh it's
going ok alright thanks for working
right so this camera yes is cameras
launched from browser yeah
and applying filters just like Instagram
and saving this in a browser so for the
experiment of oil the demo purpose we
just decided to save locally in a
browser instead of saving a server
yes the free compass legal department
they work it right next to my office and
using touch touch events for this cover
so you I and also you can save extra
sending it to the server using xhr to
over course so I'm going to talk a
little more about the technical details
here so for the app just use you so I
use those html5 api's so first user take
a picture that was everything's done in
browser you know so you could take a
picture by using HTML media capture here
then this picture was returned as the
object by using a file reader then used
in a canvas so throw an image within a
canvas and get the pixel data here from
the campus to alter the pixel to you
know make a filter effect then I stood
blog so stir the blood locally actually
using index DB and finally uploading the
photo by using xhr to so meeting a
capture it's actually really simple so
it looks like it's a big deal because
you open in a camera you know so you
know yes this action delegate the native
camera from the browser by using this in
empathy element here it's just HTML just
like a file upload right input type file
yeah just like while upload but the
difference is we have this except
attribute and value is an image so
that's pretty much everything you need
to do easy so this is being supported by
those browsers it's pretty good instead
an opera 50 BL means the blink opera so
the previous opera you know the presto
engine one did not work so that was a
big difference since the last year and
then I e died 10
I put a dimmed icon there because these
features have been implemented and I
Internet Explorer 10 but it's disabled
that's what I was complain to them a lot
so no I 11 came out and there yes they
enable the future so they working just
fine beautifully and another things i
should mention is a capture here so this
the by using a capture what it does is
it opens up the camera directly
otherwise it's going to be just like in
a showing and die on dialogue so you
user can choose where you'll get in the
image from so actually the correct
behavior for this particular case is
that one in the left the cap picture
doesn't come with its Mike at Sandy so
but that's a expected behavior and but
you know with work only some browsers so
those other browsers need to implement
it because that captures what it's
actually specified and I mean w3c
specifications but of course you know
you might think you know having a
diagram so much better for user
experience wise yeah I agree I just
wanted to make sure if the browser have
implemented correctly so I just did that
way if you want to have a diagram you
just don't need to capture attribute
here and then and once you take a
picture using a file API so you know
once you take a photo at this change
event is fired then basically you
instantiate this file reader and get
that you know the image as a file object
here and in this example I have
previewed at sources so basically you
can just insert this image a tribute
without uploading anywhere and you can
have it's a base64 where and the WR 0
element but for this case extra for this
particular app i actually just straight
dumped that image object into canvas
so yeah so you can draw image so you can
just dump the whole jpg into the canvas
and get that use the get image data
method to get the information of each
pixel you know information of each pixel
means rgba I didn't use alpha for this
particular case because all I need it's
alternating colors right so based I
tweaked RGB value to make a filter
effect and you may ask why i didn't use
css3 css3 comes with like really fancy
filters right you don't need to write
extra algorithm and such right I mean I
wish oh maybe I would say not a wish so
so it's not like I didn't use because
browser doesn't support what's true
actually what's true but wasn't
supported at that time but a CSS doesn't
alter the information or pixel itself I
mean that's an altered image it's just a
visual representation right so it looks
like you know like grayscale step here
and such this but doesn't change the
original image so if you try to save the
folder I mean this even if you look
there is still you know you're safe in
the original photos but by using canvas
it's actually altering your original
image here anyway enough not campus so
can we see it canvas is really well
supported by modern browsers I didn't
see much difference in last year and
this year only difference I see is a
performance so now you know minimal
devices using hardware acceleration so
canvas actual works pretty fast and I
test it on a windows phone with internet
explorer 11 and it was really snappy
fast I was impressed so the index DB so
once you alter an image you save this
into the browser so i use index DB
because that was proposed web standard
right but that gave me a huge pain when
i was working on this bro
act because well it's not just because
many browsers don't support the
specification was unstable back in the
time so some browsers using old specs
some using new its own mix it was a mess
but anyways so this is how you you know
the future detective indexdb supported
and if it's supported or just open up
whatever the DB you name it and the
whole operations done asynchronously in
the supported browser now those browsers
so changes from the last time I was
talking about this on I gave this talk
was more browser support which is great
so now Android stock browser under a 4.4
supports and at WWDC and a few month ago
Apple have announced indexdb support
inspiring eight who food because I
really didn't expect it happens so I was
happy to hear about that so that y and
again that was last year so support was
pretty poor operas personal Android
stock browser Safari didn't support at
all and pull this case I'm going to say
blob right because I have an image jpg I
wanted it in saving a blob and the
Firefox was the only browser I supported
so fold the other unsupported browsers I
had to use a data URL string so i would
say been duckin long string into the
index DB and this is this year now Oh
yep so I'm so happy now it's all major
browsers support in this Oh will support
which is great and I feel like it's
finally index DB something maybe we can
use because currently well it's not
ready i mean we probably need polyfill
my you know using help of web cycle as
well web Siegel used to be in a web
standard which was supported by apple
mostly but it no longer arms duplicated
and a blow of support and great news
worse on Chrome 37 start sporting blow
up which is great so now if you'll find
on the Firefox is not the only browser
support plop so now two browsers and
Oprah currently on the latest opera from
Android is 22 which is an unused in
chromium 35 means you know it's a two
versions behind but that means they can
support it pretty soon I'm really happy
about this and so far yet I haven't used
yet so I don't know I hope it does kind
of doubt it oh I wouldn't say another
great thing is yeah you can inspect and
the index DB in a chrome using a divot
tool which I find it's quite useful
because you can visualize what you have
in the dev tools right so I don't know I
don't my clicker stopped working but
it's basically this part here is a blob
so yeah I finally supporting oh it's not
related but this is a new feature to
this device mode it just came in cannery
so we have to use up from 39 I think
that's new so it looks like it works
great when I was you're working on you
know responsive designs and such fun
it's useful an xhr too so you know XD
job pull the age XD stuff is happening
by using next HR but it's too now we
have foam that are so you can
instantiate a phone daughter you can a
pin in this case a blob directly just
like in a painting stuff in a phone you
don't have actual phone but you can
paint it whatever and that's pretty
great support even last year I find most
browsers do support this just right and
I was happy about and there's some extra
events like progress you can use so you
can show some uploading status just like
that I find it's quite useful
and of course so yeah a traditionally
when we talk about Ajax you know we're
talking about you have to be this you
know a request has to be done the same
domain right but now we can its course
so we can just get the data in and out
in outside of your domain so this is
actually example how you doing an Apache
so it's not like what front-end
engineers can do in our code it's more
like you know service providers have to
set it let's say like you have a api's
right so you know like rest api and if
you have course 30 except from extra
domains you don't have to use something
like a JSONP and kind of knowing stuff
like that and i find something like
Foursquare api's yeah foursquare allows
this so I can just use it or like a
Google Maps API does that too so it's
pretty useful and attach your beds here
so let's touch it it's really touchy
subject for a while because well
actually so basically try i mean i was
using these touch events for the
carousel of you I many people don't like
Harris or you guys but I well I use it
because I was making this for mobile
right for mostly touchscreen so I find
it's kind of useful so anyway so I just
decided to use it so anyway so I use
this touchstart touchmove in patchy an
event but then well it's annoying
because this doesn't work on a desktop
my name testing because a touch event
doesn't trigger like a mall sequence
right so I have the implement must
unmask moving myself yeah and the reason
I say it's touchy subject is because
well when we're talking about web
standard like open web standard oh if
somebody tried to patent something it
cannot be really open tray
so this version one touch events was
actually done by Apple and they are
talking about some patent stuff so and
we want sure if we could make it as a
web standards so so there are a lot of
issues about this event but so sometimes
in the end of I believe it 2012
Microsoft came up with this idea about
point events so this is going to be
completely open and not just that I mean
this takes care of all the user input
including touch and a mouse and stylus
and connect to oh my gosh I don't know
if I really works i haven't tried that
yet but it's supposedly working with any
user input so ideally if this is
supported you don't have to write a must
in touch events you can just use pointer
point it down quite a move point up
ideally the thing is because only
currently only supported by internet
explorer and i've heard it's going to be
supported by chromium you know the
chrome and opera and sooner or later I'm
not honestly sure but then I don't know
any the detail of other browsers so so
basically until this is happening I
don't know if it does we still have to
implement everything it touch mouse and
pointer events because okay again I just
don't support touch events so you have
to write everything a messy code
because probably polyfill is just
implementation everything so I think
it's the same thing if you write by
yourself not but I believe so yeah hmm
Ohama jury is yeah can't touch this yeah
and so okay so that was what I've done
for this project last year and now I
would be nice to add more features like
offline support so I didn't make this
app support an offline because app cache
was a douche bag right that's what Jake
Archibald stay it wasn't quite working
so I just designed not to even bother so
now is the service workers available so
not just offline support maybe you can
have some network in a background
operation and such maybe it's possible I
haven't tried that yes I can't talk much
about and a web components that's one of
the new things so might be able to
create a custom element using like
shadow Dom see tweet data you know the
pre-made domes or using HTML templates
and such i play with polymer and it's
quite interesting so I like the idea
about making you I modular so I might
want to do that later on so this is
gonna get hub and I know no one use a QR
code but anyway this QR code takes the
app directly I love QR code on I am the
only person what's up no I think I have
a little time so I'm gonna quickly talk
some other project not project I mean
the stuff coming to an H as a html5
standard here's a hardware access is so
this is something I love about so this
is really what makes the mobile unique
because your mobile phones you know
those bones come with a lot of hard
words and sensors and such right so you
can use html5 and JavaScript access
those sensors and such so there they are
on the hard way access and device
appears you can suck a GPS by using
geolocation and camera video and
microphone accessed by using media
capture and streams which I will join
oral
that you know just the input element or
web actors who have artisans and other
things that you can use use a median
such an audio hardware by using audio
api and vibration a pia is available on
firefox and chrome as well and by the
api so by using by the API you can tell
how much juice get left and Eve device
or if it device is charging Bonham you
can tell and we will NFC I don't think
it's available now but that it's just
the proposal i believe and sensors and
next elevator magnetometer and
accelerometers can be accessed by using
device orientation events and light you
can get the level like by using ambient
light events which i believe is only and
working in a firefox in this moment and
proximal events I don't think it's
supported yet but approximately bends so
basically you can tell the proximity of
the object to that form maybe like an
approximate do you do home that's the
idea i don't think it's implemented and
a pressure sensors as well so you know
of course whenever we talk about new API
time always x so what's the use cases so
this is my new focus or some iOS native
app called a pizza compass it's kind of
silly but well the basically it detects
away you are at and just tells you in
the nearest pizza shops so I'm like yeah
I think I can totally recreate this with
using hm5 it's no big deal so I did
sushi compass
yeah so using comp ass here I mean
geolocation and comp ass I don't know
it's kind of dark i'm not sure if you
can see i actually found this in my
neighborhood haha first of all it's a
really good sushi place it's always have
long line a whole bunch of people so
they actually watching me doing that new
filming so that's kind of burst so yeah
i use a confessor device orientation
event and geolocation and i also use
foursquare api's fold app you know the
sushi shop information here so anyway I
was so many things I want to talk about
especially for like a device EP it's not
such but I'm kind of running out of time
so keep up to date so well I'm talk I
was talking about a lotta api's already
have their oh it's just proposed maybe
have a employment in some browsers but
not all so what you want to know what's
going on like a status so there's a
website actually there are some websites
you can go so one is a chrome status
calm / features so that's well obvious
is done by Google so you can check the
status if things the implementer or nine
plum in a while we're going to indy
point such such and on the Microsoft
asset is status the modern de IE so they
are fanatical orders and they are
telling you if the things they implement
or not and it's nice things about this
use not just ie you can actually see the
old studies in other browsers as well
it's pretty neat
so well glass is half full what what you
decided so thank you very much and if
