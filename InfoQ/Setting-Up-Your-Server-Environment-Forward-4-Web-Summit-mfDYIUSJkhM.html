from the community advocate with linode
today I'll be talking about setting up
your server environment just how you
want it so being here at four Jas has
been a great experience so far and a lot
of people that have come up to our
sponsor table I've noticed a lot of you
are more coders rather than like kind of
server administrators out there so I
want to take this short talk to rather
than kind of delving in headfirst into
server administration going in the ins
and outs of it which can be cold other
entire conference on the children really
want to talk about a different way to
kind of go about to name your own server
the crisis to spark your minds about it
hopefully you guys can take away some of
this and think about like maybe I could
set up my server that way we're working
with others and community building so
that's what I'll be talking about so
we'll be talking about a technology that
linode has called stack scripts so sex
ribs our approach is like
infrastructures of code which basically
means you're taking your infrastructure
of servers and making it basically a
code so instead of kind of clicking
around on your manager dashboard on
creating servers deploying distributions
you're doing it all where you more feel
comfortable so basically I don't know
about any of you but this is where I
feel comfortable is basically command
line so rather than kind of clicking
around I just want to kind of get right
in there have control over what I'm
making and pulling things more like in
kind of text base and just I just feel
more comfortable like that so it's what
I'm used to and anyway so we'll talk
about what makes a sack trip so while
you can deploy server on its own
deploying a server would be kind of
giving a linux distribution like coupon
to is sent OS a sec trip instead is an
alternate way of deploying a server
where when it creates your server it's
going to run through a script called a
stack script which is something that you
right ahead of time and space you're
going to say that one your server is
created run through this trip to London
and do these actions so basically you
don't have to go into your server login
via SSH and do these command step by
step instead the script is going to run
every single time you create a new
server from that stack script and all of
a sudden that hour of work is now
reduced to about a minute or so so a
stack stripped can be made in any kind
of language most often that you'll see
in Britain and bash however you can
write them anything like say PHP maybe
even
as well and they have a modular
structure in the fact that while you
could just make a stack strip be just
one long script you can make the modular
and such that you can create some many
smaller stack scripts and have all like
once a trip that reference e to the
other one so I'll show you an example
that in just a moment and since they can
be modular in how they're made you can
collaborate with others so instead of
one person making a stack scripts you
can have two different people each make
their own stack scripts and then one
that references both of them so say you
create like how your servers when i'll
be updating all the top lakay shins when
it's deployed you create pulling
offering for information from our master
server so preparing it basically for
your own websites and applications and
tutorials on making stacks scripts can
be found on our documents website at
lindo com / docs some community building
is basically that when you make your
stacks trip on our site it's going to
store offers private but you can make it
public and we need to get public all of
a sudden now every lindo customer can
both see your sex script I can see like
how it's written basically they actually
get to see the entire source code see
what kind distributions you've made it
to work with and they can deploy it on
their own so so you can make like Linda
has a couple of sacre cour selves for
our customers to use such as a lamp
stack trip or a wordpress tax script but
now of a sudden like somebody else could
say I like their stacks trip but I wanna
make a little bit different so you can
take our little lamp stack strip make
some tweaks to it and then make your own
and deploy that out to the public and
then you can see how many different
downloads and deployments it has its
kind almost taking like a community and
social media approach to server building
in a sense now hours I've mentioned like
with a different kind of modular
approach to it it's almost kind of like
seen as recipes for servers so for those
of you don't know a different stack when
you run a web server is like a lamp
stack or a lamp stack which basically
means lamp is linux apache mysql and PHP
they're all very simple technologies
that you would see on most web servers
so instead of making one stack script
that just goes through and does
everything for a lamp server you could
have a stack script that installs apache
stacks repented installs mysql and
instead script in Souls PHP and then
your lamp stack script
and basically just say include Apache
stack script include mysql stack script
and include PHP stack script and that's
it so all of a sudden your lamp stack
script there is not only basically three
lines of code and then you can have
three different people each make those
three sec trips up there but then a lamp
stack script is similar to lamp except
they swap out apache web server for
engine X so it's actually going to be
using the same exact satraps as mysql
and PHP but it's not going to pull over
the apache stack trip and there include
file and said it's going to say include
the engine x.x trip so it's a way that
you're getting to reuse your different
codes and saks trips working with other
people all community are all
contributing their own kind of parts of
the server administration here and
creating a different like recipe at the
end of it and then once you do have your
stack strips you can then deploy them
automatically through our API I have an
example of our creating a linode from
stack up here on the right here and then
also arlindo command-line interface so
if you're more interesting people in
code you can actually use our entire
control panel via code itself so that
way you only have to go to our manager
he can actually just set up your account
and then just use our api user a
command-line interface and you never
have to leave where you're most
comfortable is code so it's a little bit
of a short talk here but that's want to
let you know that thanks for coming and
if you are interested in kind of more
server administration then come down to
our deaths down in the sponsor area I
believe it's in the social hall and then
we're getting out 50 hours of free
credits you guys and try some servers on
your own and get looking at some scripts
at lynda.com / tack strips check our
tutorials and hopefully like think of
what you want to make on a server that
can be deployed over and over again and
who you want to share that with and
maybe people will see your stack trip as
well and make some suggestions to it and
implement in their own as well thanks
any questions yes it's so it's a similar
idea concept that might have been done
like other ways like with ansible with
another like infrastructures of code
servers but strips itself r is a linda
proprietary thing but technically it's
all commands that you can run on a
server by hand over and over so you
could probably mimic it in other things
but the actual name is tak stripped and
the platform is made on is all handmade
on what I was infrastructure now I
haven't used up up in chef too much but
I say like one of the biggest advantages
even SAT tripped is uh it's really easy
to jump into so a lot of the other like
server command interfaces we're going to
need like a master server to deploy out
to your different slave servers where
satraps are literally can just be typed
into a web browser to get it going and
then the community aspect rican search
thousands of sacre pair and use them
yourself so i used as a way to kind of
help give shortcuts the new people to
windows so for instance i'm going out to
a hackathon i might prepare my own
snacks trip to like cut tailor it to
like say the technologies i know that
they're going to be using so i can go
type up a quick stack strip and then
wonder saying I don't know thats that
money server I can just make this quick
text document right my web browser on
Windows website and then give them a
link to that and so I say the biggest
advantage of that is the barrier of
entry is next to zero and the community
aspects is are really easy to do and it
works right within our manager yes it's
a little bit different so dr. is kind of
like encapsulating your entire virtual
machine and then fanned deploying it
where stat trips are almost more like
like instructions for a nice from your
virtual machine so you're not actually
having to store that image anywhere
instead you're just storing the
directions on what to do to your virtual
machine so there's no need to kind of
store anywhere first like dr. anybody
else yes
yeah so when you actually deploy a sack
strip so like for instance Leonard's
wordpress tack strip when you run it
after you go to your manager deploy new
server deploy this tack strip deploy it
to WordPress tack strip it's going to
ask you like your site name while mysql
password and all that and are actually
fields that are defined in your sex rip
file so you actually say like before
it's created ask the user that's
deploying this what they want their
domain names to be so how to create a
folder structure for their engine X
configuration so you can actually prompt
the user for different feeling at
various fields to help them customize it
further so that way you kind of just
providing the bone structure for it but
they make you kind of tailor it to their
own based on what inputs needed for that
script mm-hmm so it's most oftenly
written in bash however as long as your
machine can run it you can write it in
any language so you could actually start
off a stat trip by saying install PHP
and then run this PHP code so you can
get with any kind of programming
language and you actually run
conditionals in there too like so saying
if you run a an odd version of Linux
that for some reason doesn't have a PHP
in their library it'll just kind of skip
that PHP code and there's all kinds of
logic built in one sector to see you can
kind of output to the console or to a
log file saying like had to skip this
part of the code you did not be
incompatible with this distribution or
be can actually set in the secretary
settings as well what's distributions
it's compatible with to kind of give
some like the user some kind of like
where like notices to have a gif they
can use your not so bachelor run fine by
default just like it's on an operating
systems but uh you can define you can
install any kind of package manager or
I'm sorry use the package manager to
install any kind of services you need to
run different code and then run that
code all in the same script and you can
get from an external file or by writing
it right in a sec trip itself um yeah it
needs to be written in that but you can
kind of trick in some ways to actually
like have the stack strip create a file
like something dot PHP fill it all in
there so you're typing it in the sack
script and then run that file so it's
like a way to kind of trick it by using
batch to kind of encapsulate a different
language as well so I've actually have
some examples of that exact kind of way
to go about it in our Docs and tutorials
on one
I'm / stocks anyway else great thank you
very much for having me here at for Jess
and I'll be down here the sponsor booth
gave me out free shirts and server
