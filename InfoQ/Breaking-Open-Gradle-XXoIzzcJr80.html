today we are breaking open Gradle
witkin's dr the founder of the project
welcome thank you
thanks for invitation before we get
started on Gradle itself and kind of the
behind the scenes of Gradle why don't
you tell us a little bit about yourself
what are you passionate about
what are you doing your day to day life
you know that hopefully is gonna lead
into why Gradle yeah so were ya
my name is hands doctor I'm based in
Berlin Germany and I'm passionate about
automating the software delivery process
in the enterprise right and and that's
what I also do for living
so that's that's why I found it Gradle
and and the company behind Gradle okay
so tell us a little bit about Gradle
itself what is it
how differs from a you know essentially
it's alternatives cool Gradle is first
of all an open-source build system
general purpose platform agnostic and
with with extensions for Java C++
scholar Android etc etc and basically we
see we see good automation as an enabler
for efficient software development in
the enterprise in any in it with any
larger software stack and in the
requirements for for those automation
processors have tremendously increased
over the last years so and and the tools
that way around let's say for quite a
while
we're we're doing a good job with the
requirements ten years ago hey I want my
archive I want to copy some stuff I want
to compile but now looking at a whole
you know modeling of the continuous
delivery process there there are a new
new requirements and terms of you know
performance flexibility yeah
modeling those processes can be very
challenging and you need you need to
have a tool that is it is up to the job
basically and then that's the vision of
creator to be up to the job for doing
that ok so
kind of to double-click on that and this
is obviously one of the questions that I
first had when I learned of Gradle how
does it compare to some of the actual
tools like for example maven and you
know builder even if one of the other
ones and and specifically in in the
context of that question what were their
actual pain points that you had that led
you to actually create yeah good
question one one way to answer it there
is a famous quote from Moshe Feldenkrais
has nothing to do with software
development but you can apply it he was
saying what he's trying to achieve with
his staff is to make the impossible
possible the possible easy and the easy
elegant and when you apply those
requirements to may even an and you get
you get pretty different answers about
the strengths of those tools and
weaknesses none of those tools scores
high point in all of those areas right
so maven very often makes the possible
easy and easy elegant well that can be
can be discussed but it definitely
doesn't make the impossible possible
sometimes make the possible impossible
right because the automation remain as
it is nowadays has a lot of
unanticipated requirements and if you
just if you do a frameworks which has
too many expectations of how the world
looks like you you're you're sooner or
later bound to run into issues and on
the other hand makes if you liked
impossible possible it's very flexible
on the other hand it has a very very
simple model and makes it very hard to
add any abstractions so you have a lot
of maintainability issues with and and
and and bills that are in a nightmare
state state nobody knows what the bill
is doing anymore nobody dares to touch
it which is which is a big problem ok so
if you had to summarize this in an
elevator pitch you know to sell someone
who today as invested in two days built
system and you know what is why should
they switch the Grail well it depends on
a pain points the pain points might be
mostly maintainability the pain point
might be performance the pain point
might be usability the pain point might
be extend ability and I think
in all the payment might be
standardization and in all of those
areas
I think Radel does a already a
tremendous job better than in any of the
competitors so and then the question is
what is your actual pain points which
might be quite different depending on on
who's on who's using it is it this
single project with 500 developers
working on one year or is it this
enterprise with many many different
projects where they want to have a kind
of standardized ways of building
software so it's a different challenge
right and and great let's answers
different answers to to both of those
challenges okay sensor I mean it does I
mean I kind of picture Gradle as you
know in between like a sweet spot in
between ant and the flexibility of ants
but also the anarchy around and and the
rigidity of maven yes like kind of
somewhere in the middle of that yes but
the question that I have in my mind is
are these pain points real enough for
people to invest into essentially a new
build system like so we know maven an
ant are not perfect but are they just
good enough is this a hurdle that you
and the project in store become or are
the is the project essentially you know
the benefits of the project speak for
themselves enough that people who are
seeing real acceptance yes
so we seeing massive acceptance we're
seeing massive pain traumatic pain
really we we are involved with some big
projects that ship software for living
as a companies so it's not just some
internal software right for the for the
greater good of the company it's what
they're selling and they have build
times of 10 hours they have developers
come to work they do an esky an update
it takes 20 minutes they do an eclipse
refresh takes another 40 minutes and
then the bills take 6 hours they work in
Northern America and Italy and in India
when should they do their commits you
know what I mean it's a it's a day they
have the builders always read they don't
manage to ship regularly features to QA
for testing you're trying to do scrum
but time to scrum because the feedback
cycles are not there there are seriously
endangered in their capability of
delivering software to their clients so
the so the quality is really bad of
their software so now the clients are
saying hey guys we don't want a new
version we don't trust you anymore
but we want some of the features of the
new version or they have 15 branches and
it's a 10 year old legacy
they they are so afraid to doing
anything ambitious with it paying back
any technical depth they're on an estate
in serious serious trouble so and an
enabler for getting out of that the
requirement is improving the automation
improving the feedback cycles so I mean
not every company is in such a bad shape
but I think every company with a large
software deck has Sirians serious
challenges and serious potential I mean
imagine you have a build with 500
developers and you make them three
percent more efficient you get you do
some math right and the other thing I
find very interesting is when you are
work at a shop where you let's say are
forced to be so unproductive and in a
big part of that is the automation some
people like it right you can hide behind
that other people get experiment
frustrated so so basically you're losing
the wrong people because of that people
that are productive can show that they
are productive and people that don't
like to be productive don't have to be
so that's our so it is a pretty di think
it's a pretty a pretty fundamental thing
you need to get right but what about
what about smaller things like so what
you mentioned is essentially large
companies large projects throughout
large teams what about you know say
startups both folks and open-source
well actually open-source so obviously
can get very large yes but you know even
a project like Gradle itself okay
exactly
you obviously dog for your own system
but you know what is the what's in it
for them yes so it's a it's a very good
question because I mean there are
projects which are so small so let's
take comments logging I mean I never had
a look at the build at Commons login but
I think their project success won't be
too large decree determine by the
automation tools they are using right
but look at cradle right it's a it's a
fairly small project compared to any
enterprise project but it's pretty
complex we it's a platform after all
right to be used on IBM you know JDK 7
Sun
JDK five on this platform on that
platform in a critical infrastructure
space with requirement of high quality
we release every six weeks so we're
really trying to you know not trying
we're practicing what we breathe with
continuous delivery you know getting the
features out very soon to our users so
and and if you look at our automation
it's pretty it's pretty nifty stuff what
we're doing right all the other matrix
testing we have to do and enter
one-click releases which which means you
know not just building the code within
the distributions it also means building
the documentation with you know with the
correct version numbers in every every
snippet in the documentation is life
code it would say 99% so it's
integration tested and then the output
gets captured and also inserted into the
user guide so we have a high quality of
the user guide we wouldn't have to
resources to pay a copy editor for every
every release you know every six weeks
to go to go through all the examples so
basically for us as a company with
limited resources automation helps us
with the with in a very efficient way to
to stay lean to stay agile and and
maintain our high quality so yeah so
which begs another question how do you
is there is there any data to back this
up like have you has anyone done any
sort of studies the way for example to
zero turnaround folks have done studies
to show how their product enables people
to be more productive by you know having
it more rapid a bill deploy test cycle
have you guys done anything like that or
I seen any of your clients report some
actual numbers to say hey we've actually
been able to improve a productivity as a
result of real yes very good question we
would love to have something populate we
don't have anything pocket public we
only know about to private studies one
from a very big financial institute
which has roll it out to thousands of
developers so so it's something that is
on our list to to come up with because I
think it's a I think investing into
automation regardless of the tool is has
a high leverage so is it there's an easy
to make business case I
for that and and yeah it would be good
to to have some some actually case
studies to to make that that more
explicit right the business case okay
cool so let's uh roll back the film a
little bit I'll go back to the beginning
of Gradle can you just tell us how did
you get started what was the what was
the moment where you kind of thought hey
I'm onto something this is better this
is worth pursuing this is worth creating
an open-source project around and then
later on even for him in a company
around this what did that look like yeah
good question so I quit basically the
last project where I was involved as a
freelancer for number of reasons and was
thinking hey what to do next I wanted to
have a little prick right I was
considering completely different things
to do and at that point dynamic
languages were all hype so an ahead
while you know I I had my yeah I had my
little experiments but I withdrew never
yeah never did anything serious right so
I said okay I got really frustrated with
the build system in the last project I
was involved I also took on the
responsibility as a bit master you know
and was pretty ambitious regarding
automation we were doing and I got
extremely frustrated deeply frustrated
the last time I was so frustrated was
with HIV to container management right
so that was kind of said hey I'm too old
for that stuff you know and so I thought
hey let's try a build system experiment
with groovy because you know I can get
my hands really dirty with groovy get a
get now in our own opinion about dynamic
languages use in a serious way and and
yeah I can do it in a domain I'm
passionate about and after just after
two months I had a feeling hey I'm I'm
on to something right and then it was
then it was clear that that's what I'm
going to do right and I think
immediately it was clear for me well if
I do this full time and it was necessary
to do it full time it's just the domain
is just to to standardize people just
expect too much at once because they are
spoiled with the other tools you can't
have you know you have to
you have to you know it's not good
enough to offer some interesting idea
you have to mean you need a tool that
does the job so it was clear I have to
do this full-time so so after those
couple of months it was also clear I
wanted to have a business model at one
point behind that SpringSource was
always a company I looked at for
inspiration of how to do you know also
open source business but but first it
was the de passion you know to solve to
solve that domain and then the necessity
to earn something for a living if you
want to do that okay so in terms of this
is a timeline what did it look like when
was the first idea formed in your mind
to do something with autumn 2007 oh yeah
and then two months after that you said
okay we I'm on to something yes you did
at that point you come kind of set it
out as a real yes project yes oh yeah
and then how so how long after that did
you kind of see okay I'm gonna do this
full-time let's build an actual company
or a business model around that yeah
that's a good question so when I started
I thought after one year there will be
one all and everything will be like it
is today right so um and it took much
much longer I mean the good thing was
from day one
there was interest so we released or I
released at that point created 0.1 and
that many lives was busy and I got
invited for con to conferences and so
that day gave me a lot of energy right
to continue I had no idea that time what
a steep road it is actually to really
you know
enter such a crucial area of software
development right like like like like
build systems and trying to become a new
standard there right so and then what
really helped was that what what
basically is an essential part of the
create cradle story is that after a
couple of months I got this patch in
JIRA from some guy I've never heard
about and it was pitching something in a
very core so I thought I can't bother
looking at it I have other stuff to do
right and then I've had a couple of
weeks I said I have to apply to this guy
right i mean if he he sends a patch and
I looked at his passion said wow this is
amazing stuff right so and I was at a
Murdoch who who then was basically the
co-founder of cradle and I immediately
asked him
you want to join and he said yes and and
and both of us then drove the project
and pushed the project forward over the
next couple of years so and then in 2009
we thought well now it's time to to set
something up for the business I mean it
was before that it was too early we
always had to be aware of we don't want
to we don't want to over promise
something right it was okay for some
early adaptors but we knew the
deficiency starting with the integration
and other stuff so we III I was I was
happy about the growth but I was also I
also was aware too much growth can be
coming out so very dangerous because
people you know can be disappointed and
we don't want to disappoint people so I
was always very anxious about not
raising wrong expectations about what
what face we're in as a project
currently and then yeah we found it a
company middle of 2009 and and then we
got the first big enterprise users right
so Wow
so tell us about the business model
we'll come back to the initial seeds
again yeah but the business model so is
it like traditional what what J Bose did
back in the day the professional open
source which spring source is doing them
now part of being where you know the
professional business is the same sort
of approach yes so it's the same sort of
approach it's a with some subtleties
right so basically I mean a build system
on the whole the whole purpose of cradle
is that the developers shouldn't be
bother about the build system right so
only the built masters need to really
deep dive into it so that means for
SpringSource every developer had to have
a deep dive into spring sauce into the
spring framework right for for cradle
that that's a little bit different so on
the other hand crane is not just a
developer tool we often get involved
with companies not because the
developers are complaining they often
over here that's my impression because
QA and release management is very
unhappy so in a certain way not in a
certain way Grail as a technology is
closer to the production of the software
and the delivery of the software then
pure development tools so that that that
gives us a pretty high ranking in terms
of business priorities which is which is
good for
for end up what our business model but
yeah as you said it's a it's a it's a
service model its support subscription
training on-site consulting remote
consulting prioritised open source
development custom development and kind
of stuff you also help companies to
establish processes around the business
essentially practices are release
practices yes very good point so that's
the other thing we're not just the
company behind cradle we also have a lot
of experience in the whole continuous
delivery domain and it's a complex
domain so first of all you don't have a
tooling challenge first of all you have
a process challenge and yeah really to
know what you want to do yes and we we
help a lot with that and supporting
other sorts of platforms in the context
of that including you know continuous
integration platforms or other build
systems absolutely I mean let's say if
your role is out for a whole enterprise
you know this project has end-of-life in
two years and has a nightmare and bilked
we really do you really want to natively
migrate testing great this to cradle or
what Gradle is really good at it can you
know great the ideas be like water right
so we can we can we can say okay this is
the build this is one aspect of your
continuous delivery thing that does end
build so let's integrate it created
choreo crafts everything but the native
the native building is not happening by
cradle that's that's that's perfectly
fine right with Gradle and in fact I
know the Gradle integrates really well
with Anton maven kind of it lends itself
with that really well
yes now let's go back if you have MS
build or you you know some make files
you don't want to migrate to native
Gradle you know then okay we do the
binary management of your C++ problems
but to compile we just integrate with
what you have
so I think that's a necessity you can't
expect from a large enterprise you know
to to migrate everything understood many
of us are blessed with greenfield
project so let's go back again to the
beginning or actually just after the
beginning how did you how did you kind
of you know you said there was a
discussion going on in this mailing list
how did you spark up this discussion
what was your way of getting people to
know of Gradle what was the how did you
spread the word around yeah good
question so first of all going to
conferences
that was very important is this because
you consciously made a choice I'm gonna
go and tell the world about this because
this is such a big problem and they need
to know about it or you kind of did
people you know stumbles upon Gradle and
start inviting you both okay but it
works great for me it's it's a perfect
venue you know to engage people to learn
about people to make I mean after at the
end of the day even software development
is its face to face it's so important
and we often had you know often had
people that were considering doing
Gradle you know for quite a while but
never the last spark was missing and you
meet with them you discuss with them
share your wisdom and haunts the vision
and moon next week they were going
full-steam so so face to face is so
important specially that's the other
thing if you're working from your home
office I mean it's a great privilege to
some degree on the other hand it's a I
did this then at one point also for the
company I was working for before for a
couple of years and and going out and
you know talking you know face to face
not just where Skype is also very
important for me to get to get some
energy back and not just you know
sticking at home and it's yeah otherwise
when you just work from home it's kind
of interesting you you you will very
focus on seeing the problems this is not
done yet this is not done yet on the
mailing list it usually only people that
have problems right and when you're
going out you you have two people saying
oh thank you so much for you two doing a
great job so you easily forget about the
stuff you have already shieff right when
you when you just stay at home and don't
talk with the road yes yes and yeah we
we are software developers has a
tendency to go back in a cave and focus
on one thing and forget about the rest
yes so tell me about your your team so I
saw on your website you have quite a few
you know well known and respected people
in the industry working with you on
title you know the founder of mojito
pocket and whatnot so how do you go
about building or in vandalizing Gradle
not just for the end users but also for
the folks do you want to bring in to
help with a project as contributors or
even folks that would join yeah you know
Gradle where and help with the company
good question very good question there
is some okay so first of all
I mean if those guys I was lucky that I
that I came to knew them before cradle
or so and and then it just been our dad
I know that the first one he don't need
a visa I was thinking of who should we
hire and I had a big jet black you know
from so much reveling so I was laying in
bed at night without a computer I said I
have to learn to sleep so no restriction
I'm a computer but I couldn't sleep so I
was laying there awake for hours and
then I said oh damn yeah you have to ask
Peter right so I called him the next day
and yeah he joined so the funny thing is
we so far we never we never had a note
basically so people are pretty excited
of what we're doing and and so far it
was mostly out of my personal network or
the network then of the of the other
guys that have joined which is which is
you know a very good way to get good
people so the danger we have as a now
professional open source company there's
no kind of disc or team right having you
know private mailing news having you
know having hip shared you know for for
communicating so it's easy to kind of
become too inward looking and then not
listening to what the other guys are
saying or not a little listening for for
outside help
right because so that is this one of the
it just happens easily and you have to
be very dissimilar about saying hey this
is not a topic for the private mailing
list why you know this is a topic for
the death list right so so we pay a lot
of attention that we're if we stay a
very open project for everyone and and
the good thing is that most of the guys
that have joined us came from a non
professional open source context so
they'd a it's basically also in a DNA
but it's a it's something you have to be
very disciplined about if you if you
don't watch it you easily fall into this
inward trap and become you you're an
open source project to some degree
license wise but but not not cultural
wise okay right so so that brings us
couple a couple questions I'm actually
gonna ask you about open source in a
moment but actually let's go back to the
team you said you you invited these
folks so obviously you know one of those
they're one of the stories I'm hearing
here is that you're you know you're
making these conscious decisions which
is great which is also some
when I get to but these folks they're
invited to join the project they they
join because of who you are and what you
were presented you know in their eyes as
a developer or because they immediately
identified with the Gradle as a project
so so basically I'm trying to get to
what degree your personal relationships
played a role in you your ability to
bring these folks on rather than the
Gradle itself yeah very very good
question and I don't I can only guess
right it's not I mean I've never
analyzed it with them so that I that I
really know I would say it's both right
so if you look at the background of
those guys you know they're selenium
Spock mojito they're all very passionate
about testing and those people usually
have an affinity to to automating right
I mean that's that's that just those are
twins right so they all had an affinity
to the domain that definitely want thing
so in that respect it was cradle and not
whatever some word processor right and
the other thing yeah Tiffany had also to
do with the culture of the project of
which of course I'm an important part so
it's I think it's a credibility it's an
openness I mean it's quite a big
decision to leave you leave your job and
then say hey I do this open source thing
right no idea what was going to happen
they had good jobs before that so I
think then that it's a credibility thing
right that that you know that they
believe the vision we have for for
cradle and cradle where and like that so
I think both both is equally important I
would say mm-hm
what about other contributors do you
have folks that are not part of
guerrilla we're but our product of the
Dead list or this contributor project
and how do you go about recruiting those
yeah good question so when a few
especially from from enterprise clients
that that needed to solve certain
problems so and I think we grew pretty
rapidly right from basically you know
Adam and me to now you know 13 people so
and I think during that time we did
to the best job to engage external
contributors we didn't offer a clear
road for them to walk on and and that's
one of the things I'm refocusing on
because we really want to be open one
contribute contributors we have external
ones but I think we could have we could
have more right if we make if we are if
we make a little bit easier to tell them
hey this is the vision this is the most
important stuff we would like to be
solved and and reach out to them and
talk with them so that's what I picked
up in the last couple of month - and and
yeah and we some people are now working
on exciting stuff so it's extremely
important to us to get contributors on
the other hand I mean everybody is
probably saying this but we are yeah I
would say we're pretty picky but
regarding certain certain hmm certain
aspects of software development so I
think all of us up at least me and Adam
we're deeply inspired by domain-driven
design so we really want to model the
domain and we really we want to deepen
the model with every release and we
don't allow any shortcuts just to
provide some quick and dirty solution so
and we had people that were involved
with Gradle a were more interested in
algorithmic path right let's do
something parallel and the API and the
DSL it's the easy bit and we would say
no that's the hardest bit the
engineering stuff I mean it's a
challenge but the hardest bit is the
model and if you don't care about a deep
model then you're in the wrong project
right so and and another project they
have different priorities so that that's
that's one thing that is important to us
the other is is to quality I mean we
have 8,000 unit tests we release every
six weeks so if you're not passionate
about that so if you if you if you
provide a patch without serious testing
then yeah we want we're not so
interested in that cool so you
definitely have standards that you
expect the others to follow and you kind
of have to be on the same technical
level you have to be sync yes there's a
what's important to you and I completely
agree with you by the way on the model
thing so in terms of users you know you
said you speak at conferences you know
you have people write books on this
subject how do you take feedback from
the community how do you incorporate
where the community sees you know
greater length where they want to take
it how do you how do you essentially you
know drive the project forward yes so
the the letter question is a little bit
different then it's part of the
community is part of driving the project
forward right so so I mean we invested a
lot in the infrastructure for our
community I think we were really really
cool forum which is not just a forum it
is it's also it it is also it's not just
you know kind of question answer forum
it tries to also to model our domain
right you know it also serves as the
issue tracker
it's the block of cradle and stuff like
that so so we we did a lot of cool stuff
that this is really you know nice to use
so that's uh that's one one requirement
the other is and that's a cultural thing
be open I mean the thing is another
dangerous when you invert looking you
don't like any bad news right you can
you can ever a bad feedback cycle that
you that you think oh we're doing we're
the craters we're the best right and and
the inner team is just you know
amplifying us to the other and you kind
of try to avoid all the stuff that is
not good or the pain points you you know
what I mean you can easily try to ignore
that and don't openly enter such a
discussion so I think we don't do that
so we try to be really open and if
people raise issues they they are heard
and and stuff is discussed I think
that's probably the most important
aspect of it to engage users and to
learn from them the other thing would be
to you know to have better wording
schemes and so that they that they have
more explicit say what we're also trying
to do which is a hard job is being very
transparent about the roadmap so that we
can get feedback but it's hard to to
have a road map that is that it's not
getting stale too soon so we're still
working on making on making that better
and that's kind of what I'm hearing from
you you know a lot of people use open
source to describe a lot of things but
you know to you it seems the first and
foremost open means transparent like I
know of a lot of projects look example I
do a lot of Android
and Android is open source but it's far
from transparent worse to you that is
something that's important yeah all
right now what about the open source
itself like so so you obviously chose to
make this open source what inspired you
you know why did you choose a particular
license the what do you sort of expect
to see from the community I also see
right on the website you say pork it
right yeah
what do you what I do you know what are
the goals of open sourcing this and why
is this valuable to you yeah
outside of does this transparent point
yes so no good quest I mean I think the
build is such a critical piece of
infrastructure so I would say it's a
requirement for adoption in that space
that's that's so so that's a very sober
argument but nonetheless a very very
important one right I mean yeah and the
other thing is I mean one really fun
aspect of it is to get involved with so
many people all over the world basically
right so there's this for us open source
works right it's not just a license
model it's also something that is that
that needs to certain culture to do an
exchange meeting many people sharing
ideas with many people and there would
be very different if it if greater where
we are close close sauce product
definitely of course affect people's
ability but what about like you know
working like you expect him on someone
to fork it and say we were gonna create
you know especially given how many build
systems they are the batch alone has
three build systems yes you know for if
you come five years kind of enabler for
you and but you know what if somebody
were to say hey I you know I like Gradle
but I'm not really on the same
wavelength as cons and then in team I'm
gonna go and work it and build something
out right so is that a possibility do
you care about that I mean the idea of
focus hey fork it right to have a
feature branch and contribute some right
that's I mean that's it's that's why we
have it on the website right but I mean
if someone were to do it we don't we
don't care so it's not a concern for us
and and but it's also nothing I'm
looking forward to I mean
would defragmentation is not necessarily
a good thing so but I yeah let's see if
that is going to happen while we are we
deal with that whether this will be a
friendly relationship or or rather not I
don't know okay cool so a couple more
questions and we would need to be
wrapping up soon in terms of the issues
you're currently facing whether it a
company or with the project itself what
are some of the biggest concerns you
have the biggest things you want to
tackle as there is the problems yes in
the community with the project or the
company so yeah good question I could
talk very long about that I mean one one
challenge is also personal one you know
you live in this so if people are you
know interested in doing something right
you you live in this open-source world
completely distributed 24 hours a day
activity and finding work/life balance
in three kids and you know in a company
behind that being a CEO so that so there
is not much external structure that
gives structure to your life right it is
you have to have you need to be or
hopefully you have enough inner strength
right to impose some inner structure
right for that comes from inside to this
committee structuralist external world
you're working in if you know what I
mean
otherwise it's can be very very training
in the long run - - yeah to do to do
this job basically so that's one of my
one of the challenges we have to learn a
lot how to how to deal with that and
it's it's still a constant learning
process so there's nothing to
underestimate which which leads me to
the other the biggest challenge where
although I think it's important to
mention although I think we know I think
we we basically passed that cliff so you
are you have you're involved with a
successful project you're making your
first serious business right and then
you start to hire great tech people so
where everything is live where
everything is looking cool right do your
thing almost that's we did it right but
then you figure out that this is no
longer - freelancers basically you know
I have a corporation right
a lot of problems to solve and first of
all very time-consuming you know you
have a booth at JavaOne and III had to
organize the first one so how long how
big are the tables right and just
organizing a booth for conference it's a
hell of a lot of work and then driving
the project talking with the community
understanding the text system in the
United States which is big fun right
additional to the fun one in Germany so
and this is an intense this growth
together with not having a professional
business operation going is a very
fragile face for a company and the other
thing is you have a good network in a
tech world but you don't have a good
network in the business world so whom to
hire right so and fortunately we found
really really good people that that are
now you know adding the professionality
we have in a technical area to to our
business area and we we passed that live
and I'm very very happy but that is that
is a very important step and and it and
it's it's like you know you you might
think hey I'm I'm smart enough I can do
it all myself but it's a craft you know
business you know accounting controlling
it's a craft we need a lot of experience
and the earlier you can afford to have
someone it does a really good way the
better so that's my recommendation get
get a real professional in that area as
as soon as you can afford it so is the
last question actually on that note you
know looking back you know everything
just just looking through what you said
you know you have this itch to scratch
you form this you know create this
product from a language you probably
just acquired you know you engage the
you know the community early on you
spoke of these conferences you talk to
the developers in your network you
created a company around this you know
community around this a pretty
awesome-looking website infrastructure
to support all of this you know you're
now growing this hiring people you know
it seems like you have the skills in all
these different areas to essentially
make this happen right it almost makes
it you make it look easy for someone
from the outside obviously this took
here's
you know of previous work life and you
know it experiences but if somebody were
to try to replicate what you did what
you did and what you're still doing
right in another area what are the what
are kind of the life lessons or what are
the sort of things you know the do's and
don'ts they use recommend you know how
do you how do people go about launching
successful project it's a there another
very good question so I think a couple
of dangers along the road so first I
mean you have to be passionate about
what you're doing otherwise it wouldn't
stop it right so and this passion is it
tender bland so once you especially for
me and when you when you start getting
sucked into all the business stuff right
you know which is from my point of view
pretty sober stuff that's not what I'm
passionate about but I I you know you
have to do it yeah so if you are
organically growing you know then you
can't hire from day one a good CEO so
and then you and then this is kind of
dangerous because you're getting
detached from the technology and and and
that also that you pay a price for that
with your passion for the domain because
if you no longer thinking about it
living it you you kind of it kind of
leaves you a heart a little bit and then
you are more driven by kind of you know
business perspectives and that's a and
that's one thing we are trying to
preserve right is passion for solving
this domain must be must be number one
value of our company not not the revenue
that that will follow and that's that's
easier set and done but I think we're
doing a good job but but preserving this
passion for solving the domain and not
at one point saying okay cool let's just
you know make a successful business and
you know whatever you know don't don't
give the tone don't give up the passion
right because the economic requirements
they they're tough force right there you
have to you have to face them you have
to say all this this ocean right I mean
there's a lot of pressure when you have
to have to pay 30 people every month
right but so it can easily easily affect
your values right and you gotta have to
see past the technology I mean you know
are you building this business you're
enabling the technology to spread and
reach more people in effect more lie
then hopefully make yes ella purrs
productive I think it's great I mean
yeah so but so passion passion is the
key ingredient I for us it is I mean it
might be projects where it works
differently so but yes but if that is an
important ingredient for you nurture it
right so that's yeah fantastic so thank
you so much for coming we are gonna have
you back tonight actually at the San
Francisco Java user group event
happening actually in a couple of hours
so we're gonna go over the technology
itself behind Gradle and hopefully we
get to talk a little more about you know
the intricacies of the Gradle system
itself so thanks a lot
cool thank you so much appreciate it
