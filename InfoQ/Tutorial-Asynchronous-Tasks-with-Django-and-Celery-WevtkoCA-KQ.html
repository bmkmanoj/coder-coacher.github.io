instructor from Arcana and I'm coming to
you from our headquarters in San
Francisco today I'd like to talk about
Jango and asynchronous tasks a common
solution to web application performance
issues is to take some of our code roll
it up into a task put it on a queue and
let some other process run it
some time later let's get started
writing our own asynchronous tasks with
Jango and celery so let's tackle writing
a simple asynchronous task ourselves a
popular piece of software to run a task
queue is celery celery is written in
Python celery talks to a queue provider
and runs jobs so we can talk to a
variety of queues the default queue it
supports as RabbitMQ but it also has
support for some other queues it calls
ghetto queue solutions some of them are
really well supported and my personal
favorite is Redis actually but for
development work we can actually store
our queue in our database and this isn't
meant for production it isn't the best
storage solution but does let us kind of
easily get started writing asynchronous
tasks the nice thing about celery is
that there's a project called Django
celery that handles configuration of
celery and integration into your Django
project pretty easily had to do a little
bit of digging to get the easiest use
case set up so I'd like to walk you
through that installation so I have a
sample project that I just created with
the start project command and added just
a little bit of code I installed to
Python modules I just use the easy
install command to install into my
virtual M the celery module and the
Django celery module and again celery is
actually the distributed task queue and
Django celery is a django app that
handles integration so i have both those
things installed already to get them
into my Django project of course I have
to add them to my settings file in my
installed apps and provide just a little
bit of specific configuration I'm adding
the DJ celery application to my
installed apps tuple DJ celery is the
django app that's actually provided by
django
celery package I'm also adding kombu
transport Jango which is the package
that provides a queue implementation
based on the Django arm and then all the
configuration that I need to do is the
next reliance in my settings file and
you can do this a variety of places but
it's important to do it early so I just
dropped it in my settings file I
imported DJ celery and I ran DJ celery
setup loader and I believe this is
similar to the admins autodiscover
functionality this is going to look in
all of my install apps for a tasks dot
py file the defines tasks that can be
run asynchronously
I also specified the broker URL and the
simplest broker URL is simply Jango as
the URL and that says that I'm going to
use Django's arm database tables that
kombu creates in my django database to
store my tasks having DJ celery
installed means I've got some new
management commands and I'm going to use
celery D and I'm running at log level
info so the command again is celery D -
L info running celery D in the
foreground and you can see what this
does it starts up a pool of worker
processes the work of processes look in
the queue to see if tassa been placed on
the queue take tasks off the queue and
execute them let's a for our development
purposes we'll leave celery D running to
handle jobs in a moment but let's go
ahead and see what the process is for
creating a job so I created a sample
application with start app and I created
a tasks py file and startup and this is
a really simple task I imported a module
called sample count look at my models
file really quickly which is merely a
database table that will contain a
single column called num that stores an
integer from celery decorators I
imported the task decorator and I wrote
a normal Python function called add to
count that attempts
to get a sample count object an existing
sample account object whose ID is one if
it doesn't it creates a new sample count
object it increments it's numb field and
it calls save so from the Django
interactive console I can import my mod
models with from sample dot models
import and I'll say import star I'd also
like to import my tasks and I notice
that's recently the place that celery
stores its decorators is changing so go
ahead and read the deprecation notice
but this this works for the moment so
sample choice sorry sample count objects
doll reveals that I do have a sample
count object let's look at its num field
currently has a num field equal to 8 and
from my tasks I have a function called
add to count and I can call it and
notice that my num field got incremented
so so far it's just simple Python
nothing unusual but add to count the
function add to count now has a bunch of
extra functionality this all comes from
the decorator that's supplied by celery
and we're not going to look at all of it
but we'll look at the delay method the
delay method basically means call this
function asynchronously so don't
actually run it package it up as a task
and put it on the queue and depend on
queue clients to run it so I'm going to
say add to count and call delay and
you'll notice it returns an async result
I could check to see if the job is
actually run by looking at the async
result just notice it hasn't actually
run because I don't have any clients
running so I'm going to go and start up
my celery daemon process and again with
a log level info so I can see everything
that's happening and you'll notice when
it starts up the first thing it says is
got a task from broker sample task add
to count so it successfully ran our task
and yeah we can indeed see that the
number has changed so that's the basic
functionality we want but how can we
integrate that into views and again if
you think about the point of this our
web application takes requests and
returns HTTP responses I want that to
happen as fast as possible so if there
are units of work that we don't really
have to wait until they're done to tell
the user that they're done things like
emails being sent or maybe calculations
being made we'd like to bundle those off
to run asynchronously so all I need to
do in my view is go ahead and import my
tasks instead of calling it normally
call it with delay and I could pass
arguments to delay as if it were a
normal function that means when this
view actually runs add the count will
run asynchronously so I use the manage
dot P wise run server command to start
up the development run sir web server
and then I can switch over to my web
browser and run my simple view my simple
view just outputs the text test but each
time it runs it should be firing off an
asynchronous task so let's go and look
in our console and actually let's go and
look at our celery daemon yeah our
celery daemon says every so often I got
a task from broker and again to
emphasize that code has been packaged as
a task but I get an HTTP response before
it's actually run
start up my web server again here so
there's celery Damon and it got a task I
can reload my page and see that it got a
task so that's it for a simple
asynchronous view obviously running
distributed tasks ease in production is
a little bit more complicated you need
to setup a worthwhile production cute
like RabbitMQ or Redis but I encourage
you to think about using the Django arm
as your cue server kind of like run
server it's good for rapid application
development thanks for watching be sure
to check out Maracana comm for more
great content I hope to see you in a
Django class sometime soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
