we're gonna look and we're gonna dissect
this application we're just gonna look
at what file so we haven't written a
single file but we got a bunch of files
written for us so I just want to explain
what what is what right I'm kind of if
you expand the project they're a bunch
of files I just want to kind of explain
the big picture what's what
so roughly these files here are your
Java files right everything under source
and under Jen that's your Java files
right
roughly everything under our es folder
is your resources right so these are
your resources remember how we said an
app APK an application is your dalvik
code ie Java Java slash dalvik right
because Java gets compiled into dalek
plus your resources and that's how you
get your apk right that's how you make
your application that's what we said
earlier on that slide right so that's
that this is your Java this is your
everything that's not called a resource
and we we glue them together we zip them
up together and we get the apk there's a
third file here called the manifest file
which is also going to be important
which sort of is the meta information
the high-level big picture about your
application it's an XML file that
explains what's what in the app ok so
far so good so and that's that our file
that you guys are carrying problems for
now all you need to know is the our file
is basically the glow from the world of
Java to the world of resources so in all
explain call that glow works ok so let
me do this I'm gonna open up these files
I'm gonna open them I'm just gonna open
up the ones that are significant that we
care about and then we're gonna talk
about them so you know what
what so I'm gonna start with that the
top file the manifest file so basically
what we have here is we have the the
manifest file is it's an XML file like I
said it outlines the entire app what may
be confusing here's that I said it's an
XML file but it doesn't look like an XML
file right that's because the club does
this thing where it tries to sort of
give you a friendly view of XML files
sometimes that's useful sometimes it's
not right some people just like to dive
into XML and don't need all the
hand-holding but sometimes people pay
for it so as you can see there are
various tabs at the bottom of that file
you can click through the tabs and you
can like adjust various parts of it but
ultimately the last tab at the bottom
will open up the XML view so so this is
the actual raw XML of that file and you
know that's what it looks like you don't
need to worry too much about it right
now you know roughly we have something
called the manifest but it starts and
stops there and then we have something
called an application inside of it and
within an application we have something
called activity that's all you kind of
care about for now and some of the bits
and pieces that we entered in our dialog
box when we create a new project this is
what they are so remember we entered the
package name that's where it goes
remember we entered the activity name
that's where it goes hello cisqua
remember we entered the minimum SDK
version that's where it goes okay so
those are some bits and pieces okay so
so that's the manifest file now the next
one that we care is another XML file
which is called strings so the idea
behind strengths XML is that you put all
the code on code English into that file
so it's under values so it's right here
yeah resources values yeah so that's
that file
so basically strengths is where you put
all the string values I knew English
right so the the and as I like I said
before the idea is you don't want a
hard-coded in Java that's like not a
good practice like for example if you
have an application name you don't want
to hard code it in Java because that
doesn't it makes it hard to change stuff
you would rather keep all the language
stuff separate and that's what that
separate thing is on what the clips also
does not eclipse with Android also does
is it gives you an easy way to provide
alternate resources in other words you
may want to translate your app into a
different language so that makes it
really easy to just take this one single
file give it to the translator you have
something translated and then you have
an alternative version of that file for
that language okay I'm just gonna really
briefly show you how that works but
we're gonna not gonna actually do the
actual translation because make any
sense first but for example I may have a
button and so I'm gonna add a new string
and I'm gonna create a button and I'll
give it its a name value pair so I'm
gonna give it the name button update for
example it's gonna be my update button
and the valley is gonna be just an
English name update yeah you don't have
to do this this is more just kind of to
demonstrate so you know this you may
notice that this doesn't quite work like
for example there's no button to to
click on and there's no apply button you
get a ctrl s to save it so it's kind of
quirky these tools you know a lot of
Eclipse tools are quirky and buggy but
the way I see the price is right you
know so if you if you want to complain
there's really no 1-800 number to call
anyway so you know such is life
but that's why you know often we're just
gonna dive into a xml because you're
gonna hit limitations with this sort of
kent coding tools
yeah you would provide to support
multiple languages you would provide the
multiple copies of strings.xml file so
let me show you so so this the scope is
the entire application
yes so now if I wanted to provide an
alternative version of strings for
example for another language all it is
is creating another directory to put
this file now you may not know the
convention for creating those
directories so that's where Eclipse is
kind of useful you can go file new and
then Android XML file and don't worry
we'll be doing this quite a few times
you you don't need to memorize it to
write it down or I think like that but
we'll be using this dialog quite a bit
so for example if I say I want to create
another strings strings XML file it says
well the destination for this father
Eddie exists which it does however this
time around what I can do is I can I can
put certain qualifiers in that file so
for example I can say oh but I want to
specify a language right and under
languages I can for example go and I can
now put a specific language code and
it's a two-two letter to letter language
code so for example if I put Mandarin is
that Z age I think it's the age right no
I'm just kind of asked let's go let's
let's use es for espanol for Spanish
okay like you know I traveled the world
so I always try to use something that's
I just got back from last week I was in
Taipei in Tokyo so if I'm a little
jet-lagged that's that's why so anyway
let's see it's Spanish you know so I
basically just assigned I'm creating a
Spanish version of strings.xml now you
may say
you know what Spanish is spoken in
multiple places it's not like Spanish is
the same everywhere so we can say oh I
want to quantify or qualify the region
as well so I'm gonna put em X for Mexico
right so what that does is it basically
puts this direct created directory
called resources directory button its
values and then - language - our region
right so basically if if I was gonna
click OK finish that would create a new
strings.xml in this folder which would
be applicable if the user had it set to
Mexican Spanish in Mexico right and but
it will not apply to Spanish in Spain
yeah it automatically so Android is
automatically going to pick the best
matching resource so if you have
alternate resources and your device is
set to use a specific you know somehow
you tell the user tells the system hey I
am referring Mexican version of Spanish
then this would apply right so this was
the example of language you can you see
that there's a whole bunch of other
qualifiers for there's no time zone but
there's country code which actually
refers to three-digit country code which
I don't the mobile country code I think
it may be the the dot area code so zero
zero one would be for US Canada
Caribbean right and so on and so on yeah
but the timezone is not something people
localized Marchon because the timezone
is sort of the vertical planet slice
right
right but but you know if I know that I
mean a - eight times and do I really
know what locale to use because that's
what Canada us have South America and so
on and so on right so that may be a
little harder but you know you can use
any of this qualifier so for example I
can say I can do a certain different
type of text for different orientation
now that doesn't really make sense
orientation is the screen orientation
like vertical versus horizontal right so
that may not make sense however if I was
making not strings.xml but for example
name dot XML which is a layout then this
may not make sense right like why would
it be different layout for different
language unless sometimes for Asian
languages because the form factor is
different right the radicals are more
square versus like flat and so on so
then actual layout of the screen doesn't
make sense to be different because the
button is gonna be square e not like
boxing right however its more common for
like layout stuff to do orientation so I
may have a different layout in case the
screen is landscape which is pretty
common or you may have different layout
in case the screen it doesn't have
touchscreen it so it's a stylus or it's
you know keyboard is not supported and
so on and so on so the point is we can
you can apply multiple versions of
resources and we're not gonna do it but
they just wanted to demonstrate that so
that's that's my button that's my
strings the next one we have is the
under layouts it's the new layout on
this case there's a file called main.xml
so i'm just going to show you what that
looks like so as you can see it's just a
big black box I'm gonna typically turn
these boxes from white on black to black
on white just because it's really hard
for you guys to see what it says right
there yes it's it's a projector thing I
told you no the same thing here so I'm
gonna switch it to theme lie
now this doesn't really do anything when
we run it but for development it shows
you it flips the colors so I usually do
that to make it easier for you to see
but this is basically layout of my
screen so you can see I can have like
for example I can find a button here you
can drag and drop the button here and
then I could for example you know change
its text to something called for example
that button updates thing that we have
so but not date damn you don't worry
about doing this because you guys said
we're gonna be doing quite a bit of this
so don't worry about do anything this
example this is more just to kind of FYI
to demonstrate it and then I save this
file control us now this so far what
you've seen is couple of resource files
okay now we're moving into Java round
right so the first of all to take up
here is a file called our that some of
you are missing all right so our is in
auto-generated folder in a generated
code folder it's right there under gen
right so our is automatically generated
do not modify so the system worries
about this fall and makes it for us so
something is watching everything in here
and as anything in here changes this
fall automatically gets changed and I
just realized that the term you have to
move everything a little bit because the
screen is cut off there we go that's
better okay so so as I change anything
in resources are gets updated so
remember how I added the button update
string see there's the information about
that right here okay so it's a purpose
of our so our is basically a set of
pointers that points from the world of
Java Sevilla are to the world of
resources so R is just there to kind of
help Java
specific research okay and as such this
file is automatically updated all the
time and you do not need to ever look at
its file directly it's just an ugly file
with a bunch of pointers so you never
actually open it up and look at it again
okay so I'll show you how you use it
we're gonna use it quite a bit but we're
not gonna be staring at it okay now let
me show you really quickly how we use it
so finally we have our Java file and as
I said Java is sort of the top dog right
this is what ultimately gets converted
into dalvik in RAM and runs right so
this is our Java file remember we said
we were gonna have an activity called
Cisco hello Cisco so that's that
activity okay and we you override one of
its methods and when we override the
method we get a call super for that
method so basically we're now back at
square one we haven't done anything in
this file right except you align eleven
so a line in eleven is where we do we do
the first stuff and that stuff here what
we're saying is we're saying set the
content view in other words set the view
of that remember activity is roughly a
scream so the content of that screen to
something called our layout main and
this is how we're using our to point to
a resource so our layout main maps to
resource layout main.xml ok so that's
what that is right so see how we're
using the our class to glue the world of
Java to the world of resources our dot
layout domain so that our refers to
resource layout main.xml yeah so that's
what we're gonna be doing quite a bit
like that
okay so so far so good so now what
happens what they call
does for you is Eclipse automatically
compiles your code whenever you hit
control s whenever you save a file so a
moment you know if I type a single new
line in hit ctrl s or hit save
everything got recompiled and repackaged
and rebuilt and it's ready to ship okay
the reason why that happens is because
we have this enabled build automatically
if you don't you should have it enabled
by default is enabled that's why I
haven't talked about before okay so
that's what tells Eclipse build
automatically now once in a while and
some some of you computers when you
initially you have a little red X here
right something was missing like you
guys scared the little red X I think
here and then it goes into here and then
ultimately goes into here and so on
right so that's because your R was
missing or something else went wrong one
of the easiest if things don't make
sense why it's missing one of the
easiest first fix is to do is to go
project clean and tell Eclipse to delete
everything that it built and that's
gonna cause the built automatically to
kick in again and rebuild it so that's
essentially doing make clean make okay
so you would say clean BAM in just three
cleans and recreates it and it does
everything so that try that is the first
easiest fix if the error doesn't make a
lot of sense so far so good
yeah so so what we're gonna do next is
we're gonna run this we're going to run
this app before we run it I just want to
show you what this lapse look at looks
like on a file system so if I go into my
file system and in this case it's in so
hello Cisco and I go into so this is
what my my my project looks on the file
system and the directories are mostly
the same you've seen most of them
there's one directory that you haven't
seen
clips and that's the bin directory
because eclipse keeps bin directory
hidden from us right but what I just
wanted to point out is kind of
demystified the magic right so what
happens when you hit ctrl s is all our
Java gets compiled so here's our Java
compiled so calm Cisco hello and then
here's our hello Cisco class and all the
our class and inner classes right so
this is basically our Java compiled
right now the Java that got compiled
right gets remember recompiled once
again into the Dex file or dalvik
executable and that file is right here
it's this file called classes the Dex
so basically this gets recompiled using
DX compiler into classes with Dex
ok so this was compiled using Java C
right now all the resources everything
that we had in the our es folder so
everything that we had in this folder
got quote unquote compiled into this
file here called resources dot
underscore ap underscore yeah so
resource is a piano score is essentially
a zip file of all your resources ok so
that's why R is essentially a pointer to
a location in that file so remember what
we said is you take dalvik executable
and you take your resources and you plus
them and that's how you get the apk file
right so apk is your final shippable it
is what you put on the device right
that's what we that's what you put in a
store and you know charge 9 19 cents for
whatever right right well well well work
on jacking up the price higher but you
know but that's basically that's the
ultimate shippable for for the app so
far so good
yes the Java file is not yeah yeah okay
so now when we have all that we were
ready to run it so to run it we need a
device to run it on now did you guys
bring your phones where various CSS so
we can run it on a physical device or we
can run it on an emulator so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna use an emulator
but I'll explain the differences and all
that so before before we I do that let's
start the emulator first because I want
to explain it while it's booting so to
create the emulator click on tool here
it looks like hello Android with I'm
sorry maven for if you don't want to use
Eclipse ok so let me do that let's sure
let's talk about that very briefly so if
you do not want to use Eclipse like you
don't like clips you know for many of
many reasons so you open up your
terminal you go into your code you know
where your your project is and let me
adjust the projector so I'm gonna CD
into hello Cisco okay in that project
now I can use a tool called Android
which is basically it's funny it's the
same tool that we're going to start by
clicking on this button later on okay
but it's a command-line tool called
Android so I can type Android and by the
way you can only type it if you added
your tools directory to your path if you
didn't then you need to type in the full
path to your tools directory
and I can say Android create project etc
cetera but in this case already hallo
project that I created using eclipse
I would rather want to update it so it
works for something like ant
specifically we're not gonna use maven
but aunt right so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say an Android update project
and then I say the name of the project
is hello Cisco and the path is the
current working directory right and you
go ahead with that and what does this is
it analyzes the project and it figures
what's missing in the project to make it
command-line able to make it to work on
a command line and the only thing that's
missing is the build.xml that's for
apache ant okay so you guys familiar
with the patch end it's like the make
fall for what make fall is to make
that's what build at XML is to end ok
and now I can see and install for
example and what this does is it builds
my entire project creates it and compile
it and pushes down to the device and
everything right well I have an error
device not found which is because we
don't have a device yet but but that's
you know I can just say and debug that
we'll just build it and debug means
build a deep pluggable release meaning
signing with the debug keep so now the
build was successful so that's that's
how I would do it on command line and
then you don't need experts at all it
was this Android update project so let
me show you where you would find it ok
so if you go to everything Android
starts at DDOT and recom that's the most
important place for you to memorize
developer.android.com/design three.com
and if you go under is a dev guide tab
guide oh by the way did you guys see
that 2.3 just got released
don't worry I guess ago yeah cool so
that's uh just just got released like
literally just now so cool something to
look no it's gonna be nine right so it's
gonna be API a lot of mine and I'll show
you how we can download it as well so
but def guide has developing another IDs
and that gives you all those steps how
to create a project command-line how to
update a project you know and so on and
so on but it's right there and in other
IDs under D and read comm depth guide
okay so it's easy to find in other words
so back to back to this so what we want
to do now is we want to create an AV d
Android virtual device in which to run
okay so I could type in Android on a
command line type enter that would pop
up the same window as if I'm going to
eclipse and click on the little Android
here okay I'm gonna delete the one that
already have so far so good
alright so you guys get the window I
click I click on the little a little guy
right here
so now under virtual devices you
probably you guys were using virtual
machine you have a phone called my phone
right if you don't have it if you don't
have a device you will click on new and
we're creating an AV D or Android
virtual device so put a name my phone
for it and then I pick a target in other
words I'm saying what is installed on
this device okay so I'm gonna say it's
Android 2.2 and again the target is the
union of my platform sanada's right yeah
good so I'm gonna I'm gonna type in
Android 2.2 and then it's asking me for
size of the SD card it's expected that
this device is Kevin SD card so I'm
gonna put a some size like ten megabytes
minimum is 8 so you just want to have
some external storage and then it's
asking for the skin remember the skin is
what is the look and feel of the device
how big is it is a keV a keyboard yadda
yadda so I'm going to go with what
stones I usually use W hmm yeah yeah
we're 20 the q or the missy is it q WQ
vga 400 no it's not the one this way o
HVGA that's 160 dpi
let me I'm gonna use this one because it
gets pretty big it's pretty dense so
WVGA 800 but you know you can also
specify your own resolution and adjust
it right so whatever works for you it's
gonna be for this particular device in
other words for the virtual machine
right which the emulator runs on
no-no-no so this we are creating a
virtual device here yeah so for a
physical phone you would just order an
SD card on Amazon and then open up the
phone and plug it in right it'd be a
physical card in other words but here
we're faking it by putting a same size
in there every device on a market should
come with an SD card it does it may not
and you certainly don't have to have an
SD card however you're gonna have a
mount point for the SD card so it's
highly expecting the device case and as
the card it just that there could be
nothing mounted on it or equivalent of
having a fall as the card yeah it could
be just that it's built-in it doesn't
really matter but we're expecting to
have a mass storage on a mount point
called slash as the car I'll talk about
the file systems but the SD card is
basically a free-for-all mass storage so
it's really it's not very it's not very
organized you don't have to have it but
if you are creating a virtual device and
it's an opportunity for us to say it
doesn't have an external memory and how
big is it maybe your app is or is not
gonna need it yes it doesn't really
matter we're creating a device on which
we're testing our app so you know yes I
mean you can say oh I have a phone but
do you really need to go out of your way
and actually yank out a card not really
yeah so might as well put some something
because we may or may not want to put
something on it and our app is not going
to need it but we're gonna be doing for
example some
profiling of our app and those tools are
going to need to output a bunch of data
so that's why I usually you know do
include some size there are when you
could choose a file then you can you can
browse to a file to make it an SD card
how would I then create a file that
represents an SD card there's a tool
that again comes with your with your
tools directory
it's called MK SD card and you can
specify the I think it goes like you
know the panel to SD card oMG and then
the size 10 M that would create an
equivalent image for that that's also
when has occurred and then I can point
to it so the usefulness of pointing to a
file versus building it into the AVD
is maybe I have five six different
phones on which I'm testing my app and
maybe my test data is on the same shared
as the card that's one example where I
would for example use that as opposed to
just building it into it yeah exactly
yeah exactly
it would it would still have the mount
point the mount point is always there
just nothing is mounted on it it's kind
of equivalent of having a full card with
no space on it now a physical device is
going to point to a physical card yeah
yeah yeah on you can also specify some
other hardware constraints you can for
example specify if as the card is
supported or not d-pad support is not
accelerometer trackball camera battery
GPS setter setter so you can put some
constraints on the hardware right so
when you're done you click create in
you have a device and then what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna start it I'm gonna
scale mine to 11 inches so that actually
fits on the screen so you start it and
now what that's it's creating the
emulator for this device so this is what
that is in the way this looks and feels
is driven by the skin that we picked so
you guys may have no keyboard have
keyboard large screen rectangular square
screen it doesn't really matter it's
gonna be driven by whatever you chose as
the skin okay so while this is happening
let me kind of talk a little bit about
the emulator so first of all do you guys
get a difference between an emulator and
a simulator what's the difference
between an emulator on a simulator yeah
essentially simulator simulates behavior
of some code but emulator actually
emulates the virtual machine the machine
so it's a much lower level it actually
emulates the low love a hot Hardware in
other words what we are running on this
emulator is exactly the same code base
as we are running on the physical device
which compiled for arm it's arm code
it's designed for ARM chips etc so it's
not like we're simulating it's behavior
like certain platforms do like I think
black but it does that right we're
actually emulating it and introduces a
third-party system called
qemu which is basically a virtualization
machine open source project and that's
what you are being used for for
emulating the actual it can use it can
use different form is a good example but
it can be I believe it can virtualize
different
different stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah so
that's why it's a much closer
approximation of actual physical device
so that's why for the most part we're
agnostic to if fact we are running on
the emulator a physical phone okay so by
now it should be loaded so there's my
device what do you mean by it doesn't
show up does it just keep looping in
that animation yeah that there could be
a problem
why don't you delete that AVD and create
a new one when I started I have the
opportunity to scale it up because the
size of this is slightly bigger than my
resolution to take out with this
projector so I just scaled it down a
little bit I think it's gonna be about
13 inches or whatever it doesn't fit on
my screen in partially why doesn't fit
is the density of the screen is very
different so this is DM we are using 240
dpi on on this particular screen versus
72 or on my monitor okay so so does
everyone have the emulator up and
running yes
so let me show you where emulator stuff
is stored so I'm gonna see the oops
Amy make this fit on a screen again so
if you go to your home directory you can
see the to a folder called dot Android
so it's you know it's a hidden folder
it's gonna be dot Android button Windows
and Mac and Linux right so it's in you
off of your home directory inside of
this folder there's another folder
called dot AV d stands for hundred
virtual device and inside of there
there's my phone alright so if I cat the
the my phone nine I file
you basically just it tells you what
target it was flashed with right and it
tells you about the actual data is right
there so now if I see D into my phone
abd this is where the actual files are
can't remember that SD card image that
we created there it is the 10 megabyte
image right remember the user data that
they set is very specific to each user
that's where that is okay
then there's some cache directory but
where's the system I'm J
remember I said system energy is one of
the most important ones where is it yeah
exactly because it's its it doesn't
change its read on me actually so that's
a reference bye-bye in this config file
and this is where the data is for that
particular emulator so yes you can
change data here you can change the
thrown notepad it clicks doesn't well
does Eclipse give you a nice way no it
just says the details you can view it
yeah I don't know but it doesn't allow
me to require yeah so but it's just a
you can you can basically open it that
time by the way this is the same tool as
Android as I said so if I click on
available packages let's see if if
version 9 is available
more anything stole anyway there's some
I need to you need to install something
else first before I can even see nine
but as I still don't see the D SDK the
Android 92.5 no honey but I was I was
trying to show you but it's not it
doesn't seem to show yet so don't worry
about that I don't even know quite
what's new in two point three Allah or
what take care so it just got released
it depends it depends I mean I have so I
have a very consumer device it's just a
t-mobile running on a samsung galaxy and
I still don't have to point to so it's
still they haven't pushed it out yet
know that they think so that's sort of
that sort of car that works
unfortunately well it depends yes so
Korea there I think a lot of them have
to point to right it depends for
development moving we tend to know most
about HTC one spell specifically the
ones that Google or uses for development
such as Nexus One and dev one so that
one dev - Nexus One right so this is
depth to phone I don't have the next
book the Nexus One with me but yeah
those tend to be the best document in
the most open in some yeah okay so now
when we have all this ready you
you can run it let me see it does it
show its assist if the API level 9 still
doesn't show for me right although it
says that it's available oh I'm sorry
that's installed available see
yeah that's not yeah I doesn't seem to
be in this positive fun oh yeah so I
just found 8 but anyway not as big of a
deal so let's click now we want to run
this so to run it I can right click on
my project and say run as Android
application ok
and this now pushes it to the device and
ultimately it should start on the device
there's this yellow Cisco and it's got a
little button and you can click on it it
doesn't do anything so you can right
click and say run as Android application
or you can also just click on the Run
button here and see Rana has an
application and that actually runs
starts it's an answer
so far so good go ahead yeah adb stands
for Android device bridge and that's
what we use to bridge between the actual
physical your development environment
and the actual device now ADB is
agnostic also to a fact if it's physical
or emulated device so let me just kind
of show you really briefly so if I go on
a command line and I type adb shell okay
what this does is it now bridges my Mac
to my
adb shell so what just happened to my as
the Kato see how the directory right
uh-huh
well well that's why I don't do updates
in the class so adb just went missing I
saw a scene which turbine saw
this one so so but I suddenly I don't
need third party right yeah I need third
party and it's interesting that Samsung
actually put is pushed up for for our
tab out that's the first time I see some
of the others in Google actually pushing
something out
we're just gonna cool and as the Kate
tools so this is the one I I need but I
don't really need the other platforms so
I'm gonna kind of in the interest of
time I'm gonna disable all this and that
documentation I'm just gonna display
install this but basically what
something changed in terms of how ADB is
packaged so it's yeah it just
disappeared I mean so anyway it's kind
of looks like it's gonna take some time
to to install you know but if you type
adb shell it connects to the show and
Android device bridge yeah so it's the
bridge the bridges multiple your new
your device and this or what would you
do from all command-line so and ADB does
a lot of stuff it lets you access your
device in different ways so you can
think of it as both telnet SSH FTP and
blah blah blah for your device so you
can install new software using ATP you
can you can log into the shell of use of
the device using ADB you can move files
between your device and your laptop
using ADB so there's a lot of that stuff
right so all of those all of us
was confuse on there we try to break it
yep so you know I mean third-party
manufacturers ticking you know you can
do whatever you want to the derivative
of Android right so you can derive the
platform and you can then make changes
so you know like for example see us may
not allow third-party to install
anything so they can just like yank out
the part of the system or chain modify
called works the part of the system that
allows installation of applications DoD
for example may yank out the radio
replace it with the encrypted version of
ready or something I work with companies
that take out a lot of features just
because they don't want to make it
available at all so the question is
really then is it
kanan become is it an Android compatible
device or not motorola specifically had
that issue with they released a device
which was basically a scaled-down
version of android in the market is an
android device and then sort of
backfired with the user community yeah
yeah that's usually you usually can then
update it but but yeah that's that's
what they do to prevent it
so let me see if I have the way to be
okay so I can say DB keel server
succeeded is the UK Mac I lost a pulse
LS so let's see really briefly what
changed what we have now in the SDK
platforms 9 so tools
uh-huh that's where it is so there's a
new directory called platform tools okay
I guess that's interesting so there's
two those directory is still there but
then there's platforms platform tools
and that's where ADB is and I'm not
quite sure why but what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna VI my background my my mate my
dash dot dash RC or profile and that's
my path and that's where my tools are so
basically I need to add this directory
so like this and then it becomes plot
form - tools right but don't don't do
this I mean don't update to nine it I
did change more than it--and I hope they
would so if I kill this kill this
control C kill'uh
restarted path so the me and V so now my
path does have platinum schools ADB is
there adb shell works okay so let me
readjust the window size so you can
actually see but now yes we change the
locations and I I wasn't aware of this
so but now I'm when I do adb shell and
you guys don't do update to nine and you
have a DB she'll just working fine you
can now do for example PS and I can look
at what's what's running inside the
devices on Thanks
so so that is that's that in terms of
the what yes so the shell that I'm in
right now is the shuttle device it's a
it's it's a linux shell but in terms of
the commands that you have it's very
scaled-down so you only yeah it's it's
it's something called toolbox so it's
not it's not like busy box it's very
scaled down for example I don't have you
know you have your CH Mart LS and cater
that sort of stuff but you do not have
VI you do not have crap you do not have
less and things like that yes yeah you
can yes yeah I can do a lot of dirts and
running in the background and son yes
just keep in mind that right now I am
logged in in the shell of an emulator
and I happen to run as a super user as
root user if I wanted to connect and I
said we are pretty much agnostic to
physical versus emulator so this is just
a stock phone with the stock and er this
is running just regular Android stuff
from open source project so if I connect
it into my USB and I now do adb shell
it's gonna say more than one impossible
device so it doesn't know which one to
connect to so you can you can do one of
the two things you can do well through
adb devices and it shows me all the
available devices so this is my emulator
and this is my physical phone so I can
do adb - s and specify the serial number
of the phone which is this right
okay but you can't enter shell that will
that would work but if you too lazy to
do that easier is just to do adb - deep
for device or - II for emulator that's
if you have one of each serial number
only matters if you have actually
multiple emulators for multiple physical
phones which you may so then you can but
you can have a universal for a lot of
different devices connected all at once
so I'll just do - deep shell and now I'm
in the shell of my physical phone I can
see PS and dessert for example processes
running on this thing right now no you
do not need to jailbreak it so this one
is a consumer phone so it's just a
regular phone and now however my shell
is running as an underprivileged user so
you can only do so much to it so let me
see if I do adb devices first of all you
don't see it the reason why I don't see
it is because they haven't enabled the
device to be seen so what you need to do
what I'm gonna do I'm gonna show you
what to do on a phone on an emulator
because you can see it but the same
stuff does I'm gonna do a device so you
would go to your system your system
settings right and then you would go
into applications okay and then you
would go into development and then you
need to enable USB debugging so I'm
gonna do that here on this phone now so
settings of applications debugging
development and then enable USB
debugging I actually have to enable it
while it's not connected so now now I am
basically connected to that phone so
under devices
notice that my Galaxy shows up as well
and now what I can do is I can store a
DB - s and so ok and now I'm connected
to galaxy totally different
vacations oh so okay yeah sure so you go
into settings first go into applications
you got it
you're running instead of a virtual
machine yeah and then you go under
development so application development
and then USB debugging
guys so that's what you need to do to
enable it so now you know now for
example if I was gonna click on Braun
notice that it asked me ok on which
phone so I have three different devices
are now on my list so is that run pretty
good now everyone get it running you
have the little application it doesn't
do much but it runs right so we talked
about what how to start a new project
what things what important things are we
talked a little bit about what in an
atom you out of an app is like we
dissected it right so same things for
any any other application it's you're
gonna have the same bits and pieces just
more of those right we talked about
briefly about the manifest file about
what the layout research looks like or
what the Java file looks like we ran it
and that's about it right in terms of
the amulet all that so far so good so
let's then do a lunch and then we're
gonna continue with this new section
