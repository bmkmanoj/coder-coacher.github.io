and thanks for coming I'm going to be
talking about web application
architecture as it's related to adobe
brackets the open source project on
github that's created by Adobe so before
I could talk about that stuff talk a
little bit about myself so for those who
don't know me I'm the content community
manager at Adobe we have a publication
called the adobe developer connection
where we publish well we published lots
of articles as tutorials by both
developers outside adobe and developers
inside Adobe and myself and Julie
sitting over there we manage that the
HTML CSS JavaScript mobile content
that's published on that site and the
cool thing just you know in case those
of you who don't know that as a resource
which I should have put the URL up there
some silly that I didn't because that
URL is actually my blog but anyway um
the adobe developer connection we don't
actually just publish stuff that's
specifically about adobe like a lot of
the articles we publish our about
technologies and things that aren't
necessarily connect to adobe at all so
anyway that is my blog remote synthesis
com I also do a weekly like roundup of
the best links and things in JavaScript
CSS HTML so if you want to follow that
blog keep up with what's going on and
then that's my Twitter of course I don't
mention I'm actually so adobe has big
offices right here but I'm actually from
Boston so I you know fly out here a lot
but i get i get to be lucky enough to
work at a boston but i am actually you
can find me easily in Boston who some of
you might notice I'm wearing my Miami
gear I'm the guy walking around Boston
and dolphins miami heat in miami
hurricanes gear so that's pretty easily
recognizable around
Boston it's not a lot of those they're
passionate about their sports there but
I grew up in Miami so you know I stick
with my teams all right so enough about
me so how many of you have already heard
of brackets good mostly audience the
last I presented this last week and that
only its most of them I not heard of it
so for those of you that haven't
brackets is an open source code editor
basically it's a desktop application I
have it open here I let me close this
thing this is what brackets looks like
it looks similar with other code editors
you've probably seen but it is actually
open source and it's out there on github
there's a github project that you can ex
get it the code clone do whatever you
want with it it is um under the MIT
license i believe so the interesting
thing though about brackets not only you
know there are some cool features and
I'll show you some little bit of that
before we move on just to kind of give
you an idea what it what it does and
what makes it special but the really
cool thing about brackets is that it's
it is built with web technologies as
well as editing those web technologies
so let me just kind of give you a quick
tour this also for let me more there's
also some of you may have heard of edge
code an edge code is a distribution of
brackets basically with the adobe logo
on it it looks and feels much the same
but that's actually available via
Creative Cloud so brackets is available
on github and edge code is available on
the via the adobe creative cloud they're
both free there was some I've talked to
some people there were some confusion
sometimes about edge code it is actually
free there's a free version of the
Creative Cloud that you can get edge
code get edge animate you get edge
inspect with some limitations like most
single device at a time but but those
are all free it's not like a trial it's
a free version of the Creative Cloud so
edge code is free as well as brackets
the difference is look there's not a
huge difference right now I'll tell you
a little bit about the differences but
i'll show you but
the big difference is going forward this
edge code will have more integration we
create a crowd cloud services and other
Adobe services well brackets will still
be out there in github and kind of those
those pieces won't be built in so let me
show you so this this as i said is
brackets actually i'm going to show you
here in edge code a little bit better
because i've got different things open
so one of the cool things about brackets
one of the unique features you can see
that it comes with built-in jslint and
errors and stuff like that but the neat
thing is if i go here like this div here
and it's just keep control e and there's
a lot of styles associated with this one
so it's a bit kludgy on the screen here
but you'll see that a bunch of styles
open up in that little window there it
shows me all the Styles associated with
this particular div across a number of
style sheets so I can actually switch
the style sheets and see these are the
styles that it found in my project that
are associated with either a div or a
div with that class slides so it allows
me to go in there and edit those in line
without needing to move between file you
know I'm going to move from my HTML file
to my javascript file to my CSS file you
can actually edit javascript and edit
CSS that way in line so that's one of
the really cool features it's also got
extensibility so like some of the got
some plugins built in here let me just
gonna hide jslint for right now like
this is a phonegap build plugin that was
built this one actually the phonegap
build plugin is actually available also
on github so it's totally open source as
well
see if I remember my password uh of
course seem to forgot my password or
hold on so I wanted to show you this
feature probably just mistyped it
yeah yeah I don't know I you know I just
did this last week I know my password we
go it might be something wonky with
internet connection that might be what's
going on and it's just yeah anyway wait
assuming your work right you can imagine
let's all imagine close your eyes and
I'll paint a picture where that bottom
portion of their shows all my phone gap
build projects and I can actually
rebuild them right there I can just
click to have the those you know do you
know where phonegap build is all of you
know okay phone get billed as a service
I'm gonna give you the two second pitch
fungi bill is a service where i can
actually push my files out in the cloud
and it will build the do the different
builds for the different devices
for me so it'll build like for iOS and
Android and Windows Phone and and
whatever else you might want to support
so that's all in the cloud so in this
case it would show me all my projects
out there they'll show me the different
builds for the different devices like
android/ios so on I could actually click
them and it would show me the that it
basically you just scan a little QR code
and it will install it on your phone so
it'll show me the QR code I can scan it
right here and install it on my phone I
could rebuild it I can actually connect
it to the files on my project push those
files out have it rebuild and all this
within never leaving the brackets code
editor so that's some of the stuff
that's like the integration that we're
trying to work on there's also adobe
edge web fonts which he announced a
couple weeks ago what that one would
allows allows you to do is it's kind of
like Google web fonts if you guys are
most of you are probably familiar with
Google web fonts but I would come in
here and let's say I'm going font family
and then you see the list me a bunch of
fonts I can go here and click browse web
fonts and all these are available via
google for via the adobe web fonts adobe
edge web fonts and i could just pick
this one you know
and include it there for me there's
different things it'll do but basically
it'll go out there and look at what's
available via the edge web fonts and I
can pull it in so that's the kind of
integration that they're trying to do
with edge code specifically so like that
web fonts comes with edge code but
doesn't isn't built into brackets the
phonegap build one is out there on
github as well so if you want that one
you can easily add it into two two
brackets rather than chest edge code but
so what what makes brackets really
interesting as I was mentioning before
is it's built with web technology so
it's built with HTML Javascript and CSS
even though it runs natively on your
Windows or Mac and they're working on
Linux but not linux yet but it runs
natively on your desktop like a regular
native application but it's built with
those technologies it's also built using
a project called cool mirror which is
open source as well I don't know those
of you have heard of code mayor it's
basically a web-based code editor and so
that's a big part of what brackets uses
to display an edit code I know we
actually supported the project and
everything to help get some of this
stuff done but that obviously plays a
big role in brackets it also runs on the
bracket shell is basically it's built
with the chromium embedded framework and
that's what allows it to run on your
desktop the interesting thing if you're
curious about that is that is a separate
open source project the bracket shell so
if you go to brackets the brackets a
github project so if you if you were to
go let's see if I my internet access
working yeah it is so if you go here
this is all the JH tml JavaScript CSS
code that makes up brackets but there is
actually a separate project that's that
is called bracket shell that is the
innate the shell that it runs in on the
desktop so if you were curious about how
that's built you can look into that the
other funny thing about that is that
since it is built with HTML CSS and
JavaScript but is designed to edit HTML
CSS and JavaScript is that you can
edit brackets in brackets so I'm
actually looking at the brackets code in
brackets by default when you open it you
get the brackets code showing here so
it's kind of a very meta kind of thing
you know editing brackets with brackets
it's just but anyway in fact that's how
the team built it they are they are the
used brackets to build brackets so it's
kind of interesting so the idea this
this presentation was well let's say I
don't I don't want to build another
brackets I just want to learn some what
can I go I want to dig into the code and
see what what adobe is doing and what
other open source developers is because
we've got a lot of contributors for
contributing to it what they're doing
what's going on in the code I want to
learn some some techniques and things
from the code well what could I learn
right that was that's the basically what
I'm going to present to you here but you
also have to think well I can take some
lessons out of it but there are a number
of things that brackets is what would
make it different from anything I'd
likely build because you know I'm
typically you know if I'm working for my
company building project most of the
time I'm not building an Oakland source
projects expecting a large number of
contributors but there are things that
brackets does specifically they geared
towards like you know handling
contributions and making it easier for
people to contribute that if you're
building your project you don't
necessarily have to consider brackets
doesn't run in the browser right now it
only runs in this desktop shell and more
than likely your application isn't going
to run in the desktop shell you're
targeting the browser so there's things
that they didn't need to consider that
you you would need to consider and vice
versa when you're doing that it's purely
optimized for displaying an encode this
is not like a typical web page so you
know the thing is is this is the view
for brackets there's not a lot to it you
have the basically your your file picker
here in your code over here you have
some pop-up menus and things and
navigation that but but this this isn't
you know there's not a lot of portions
to a little
going on in the view portion of the of
the code so because it's purely about
displaying an editing code so more
unlikely your application isn't going to
do that and well this is something you
you might be strive for in your outlook
in whatever your building is that you
want to be able to be extensible by
third parties that's a key part of what
makes brackets cool is that you can
write extensions for it you know but in
your applications you may or may not
ever be worried about making your code
extensible so there's some things that
I'll cover here that you know you may
say well okay I can learn a little bit
from that but it doesn't fit exactly
because they're they're a bit of a
different target they also don't use any
mvvm MVC whatever framework there's none
I asked the team why that was they said
basically because there's not a lot as I
said there's not a lot of you I there's
not a lot of fine grain you I there's
just this text editor menu products
panel so they didn't feel like it was
necessary I think early on when I talked
to them they also felt like this might
be a barrier towards people contributing
I think they there seems to be less of
an argument on that right now in the
when I talked to the team recently they
actually said that they are as they add
more complex you I they are thinking
about whether to consider adding a
framework or not but as of right now
they don't have a framework so one of
the things when I started I should
preface this by saying I didn't write
brackets I left that too much smarter
engineer send me basically this is me
like just I went through and I dug
through the code in like okay what if I
was learning from from this code what
would I want to learn so that's the best
one I'm go through here where there's a
lot in there and I'm going to kind of
cover a lot of topics I can't go into
depth about every single one because
there's a lot of stuff but i'll give you
resources that you can follow like if
you want to learn more about that
particular topic one of the things that
i felt for thought was interesting I
mean I came into I done JavaScript on
and off for a long time
for a while I was doing flash and then I
kind of came back and one of the things
that was difficult when when you kind of
moving from an object-oriented script 3
back to javascript is that there was a
lot of solutions for dealing with
classes and inheritance and stuff and I
kept reading articles about how people
different people solved it some people
wrote frameworks to deal with this and
other people did you know other
solutions so I always I'm always very
curious about well how somebody solve
like how they're writing that portion of
it so this is kind of how there's a lot
of classes inside the brackets actually
if we go into the code I'll show you
almost all of it is JavaScript there are
a few HTML pages like this index.html
and I think in the views there's maybe
one or two I think it was here no it's
not even there there's a oh yeah here
HTML content there's this main view
other than that everything else is
pretty much JavaScript files every one
of these things is you'll find lots of
different extensions a bit weird so lots
of different classes basically there
that make up brackets and it's all
JavaScript and a lot of it looks kind of
like this when you start digging into
the initial code basically have the
constructor for the for the class and
then they deal with any any inheritance
that's going on like this this one is a
multi range in line text editor that
actually in inherits from the inline
text editor you see they set the
prototype and the constructor and then
down there you'll see a couple of
methods they're adding to the prototype
of the multi range in line text editor
anything with an underscore which I'll
talk about a little bit later is is is
either an internal or private method
anything that doesn't is a public method
that's available so that's how they kind
of they use this convention to basically
handle private and public methods so
it's a pretty straightforward like
there's no frame work going on or
anything to handle the inheritance in
the classes here
it's pretty clean and easy to understand
it gets pretty complex because as I said
there's a lot of different classes
throughout brackets but it as you go
through the code I actually found it to
be very very simple the other thing that
they do is they use requirejs I'm sure
at this audience last conference I they
didn't nobody heard of required this how
many you already using require chance in
your project okay good number of you how
many of you don't know what require JS
is only a few of you okay so i won't do
a lot of introduction to require a
chance but basically they're using
require JS throughout to handle all the
dependencies so requirejs is like is AMD
complaint for him handling modules
loading of modules asynchronously and
they're using it throb to do that the
interesting thing though I'll show you
some of the code so if you were to dig
in and say okay well let's see how
they're using requirejs you'll notice
that they do it here they're loading all
their they define the actual module up
top right and then they load all the
dependent modules but some of you who've
you required to ask may say well that's
not how I did it right you don't always
calling this require method and that's
because they actually are using these
let me show you they're using these
common J's basic wrappers or to the use
of Andy compliant kind of common jayus
so they basically the modules are common
jas modules that they kind of make AMD
compliant so that's how that's why
they're using that to load all the
models they're using this part of
require j/s to load it so so this would
be they're using their loading up all
the dependencies for for this particular
I think this is also the multi range in
line text editor they were loading in
that you can see they're loading and the
inline text editor manager the commands
and so on for those of you who haven't
used a prior test this is this is
actually really it's really interesting
to see how they use it but it's a
because there are so many dependencies
throughout brackets
but it's also you can I couldn't imagine
them actually building this without
using it because there's so many because
of the extent of the dependencies
managing those manually would be a
nightmare so you have to use something
like require JS to actually load up to
all these dependencies for you the other
interesting thing about how they use
required is is that as I said it's
extensible so what they do is that in
order that you don't load up a module in
your extension that overwrite something
that they have within brackets already
they actually give you a separate
instance so you can see the top part
here after your defining your module up
top you see the first modules are using
the same require method there right so
this is you're actually loading up the
dependencies of your specific extension
then down below you're actually loading
up the dependencies that you have with
within bracket that you require for your
particular extension so they do that so
that there's not any conflicts which I
guess like this is one of those cases
where it's like you know it's actually I
thought found it interesting but it's
probably not necessarily unless you're
planning on some kind of extensibility
that's not necessarily something you'd
need to consider but but it is
interesting to see how they did that how
they get around the fact that we don't
know what is in your extension when you
load in that extension right so we have
to kind of be careful you're not
overriding what's going on already in
brackets so for testing they use jslint
those of you don't know Jay Atlanta was
created by Douglas Crockford probably
most of you have heard of Douglas
Crockford but it scans your JavaScript
code searches for errors and gives you
back a list of potential problems jslint
can be varied by nature by very strict
and I actually asked the team why
because I was asked by somebody why they
chose jeaious linton not JS hint and
they so a lot of the team on brackets
was not initially JavaScript developers
they were developers from different
other projects that were brought
together on this that didn't necessarily
allow them were new to java script and
they said they wanted something to be
very strict initially
so that's why they chose jslint but
they're actually talking about right now
so as I as I noted jslint is built into
the project here in two brackets sorry
so I'm going to open here let's see
where was that geous lint so I'm going
to enable jslint it's going to show me a
bunch of errors on this one this is this
is because we're looking at my well come
on where is it so it says it's there so
you know this does say experimental
build up there so when I run into these
problems like keep in mind it's still a
very new project I'm gonna reopen it and
see if I can get it back just want to
show you so it uses it with throughout
the code but it also has it built into
the editor and this is not showing it at
all come on Jace lint oh thank you thank
you yeah so it's not experimental build
it was a brain fart okay so yeah in the
HTML file there we go so you'll see
right here it's got a bunch of room down
at the bottom the interesting thing
because it's built in you can actually
use some of like I'll talk about some of
these jslint like configuration things
but if I take these out you'll see a
bunch more I'll talk about those a
little bit more so you can understand
that what that's what's going on but if
you open up any of these files you'll
see that every single one of them
basically starts with has a bunch of
jslint configuration up here so let me
actually talk a little bit about how you
use chase link so Jason Lane has a bunch
of option you can set a bunch of options
for configuring it so I've got a that
snippet there below is actually taken
out of brackets and what it's saying is
the first one is saying like okay you
can actually have multiple VAR
statements because by default it
actually will doesn't like multiple of
our statements as I said it's very
strict by difficult
it has I may be strict or opinionated
some might call it so then and secondly
it says okay you you're allowed to use
plus plus and minus minus you can the
the devel true is basically saying
things like browser Global's are defined
so as you can see actually from my
example here if you notice when I took
out the configuration it's going to give
me a part of the reason it gives me a
bunch more errors here is because
they're saying things like document was
used before it was defined so when I add
in that basically the piece of that that
developed rue it takes things like those
errors away then because it assumes that
things like document are defined and
then it's saying okay okay don't don't
kick we don't care about initial
underscores we indent for spaces and the
maximum number of errors were going to
report back is 50 but you can also
another thing you can do in jslint is
you can tell it what Global's you have
in that file they may not necessarily be
inside that file so you like maybe
there's something else you're loading in
like in this case you see we're loading
in the brackets is a class that's
available throughout brackets the
obviously the dollar sign is jQuery and
then I don't talk about that but
brackets uses jQuery of its kind of
assumed nowadays right so it uses jQuery
as well it uses mustache unless and you
see all of those classes are already
predefined so they won't tell you things
like like oh you know mustache is not
defined or brackets is not defined
report those errors because I've
configured it to say these things exist
in this file so that those are some of
the ways you'd use jslint to configure
it so that it's a little less
opinionated but it still gives you back
useful errors and I found it to be to be
very helpful even though like I said it
can be very picky but it picks up a lot
of things that you might have missed so
a lot of times these jslint errors will
actually give me things and they'll show
up if there's an error it'll actually
the code will show up red and you can
even click it and go straight jump
straight
error in the code so they also use
jasmine how many you're familiar with
jasmine anybody a lot of people okay so
jasmine is a behavior driven development
testing framework for JavaScript so
basically they use jasmine not for you
won't if you dig into the brackets code
when it opens up you won't see this
initially you actually have to go either
to the github project and pull down the
tests or you can you can find it in if
you dig through the the rest of the code
that's sitting under the brackets folder
in your program files but there are a
bunch of tests runners in there so if
you configure brackets for development
let's say you want to be able to edit
brackets you'd actually there's a on the
wiki there's a lot of instructions it's
very the wiki has a lot of really good
information for brackets but is
instructions on how to configure it for
development mine is not but if it were
configured for development I could run
these tests basically they use Jasmine
to make sure that whatever when you
submit any code you if as long as you
run these tests at least they can
guarantee that it needs a certain
standard of functionality right so so
your spoke before you use submit any
code you're supposed to run these
Jasmine test test runners and make sure
that those all pass those are pre
written for you so like this is one of
them so I pulled this off their github
project so this one one of the
interesting things about jasmine it
tries to write it in a very readable
manner so as you can see in this one as
that before each is going to have
obvious it's pretty self-explanatory
this is going to happen before each test
this run so i can do like some setup and
things like that and then the test is
actually that function that says it and
then should not find a tribute hints in
an empty editor so that's that's
actually okay that's what i'm testing
for and then the code inside of there is
what's going to do the testing right so
that's that's how you it is really easy
to to read and understand what the tests
are supposed to do which is the nice
thing about jasmine for those of you
don't know jasmine
I've got it open here this is a Jasmine
open source site that we've also got an
article on the ADC that that walks you
through a little bit more in detail on
the tutorials on how to use Jasmine I
also skipped or we've got a nice one
that require JS for those of you who
don't know required to ask by Erin Hardy
it's really good anyway so they've got a
whole bunch of these tests if you that
you obviously run before you submit any
code they also do templating using
mustache so if any of you had checked it
out before for the longest time they
weren't using any templating language or
sorry framework but they decided only
recently they added in mustache in part
of it is because as you see in this
snippet here there so mustache it's
pretty simple to understand you can see
that the little mustache is there and
like the Save Changes it's going to
replace out that stuff a lot of this in
brackets is actually done for localizing
so that's why I like things like the
Save Changes don't save save and cancel
are there but but then you see like
message goes here isn't actually using
that so so they use mustache for for a
lot of their modal dialogues and things
like that to swap out button text and
things and so on so it's all like
there's there's a whole bunch of
localization files here so they haven't
localized it to a ton of languages a lot
of that is based on like people
contributing it's not that one here you
go so you can see a lot of these
localizing so it's loading in these
whole bunch of strings here for this one
is german i believe yep so so a lot of
that would replace out these save
changes and so on text on the buttons
and that's what they're using mustache
for it's pretty it's pretty easy to
understand how my stash works it's got
this is where we're basically setting
the different variables that are going
to get replaced out like about
Khan is is getting replaced by eight
loads in this strings and all those
strings are in that brackets config and
so on so then we're placing on a bad
icon replacing on version name and so on
and then we're rendering it out so
that's that's mustache another thing it
uses throughout is it uses less for CSS
it's probably for those of you do CSS
it's something you might use already
yourself the interesting thing it also
you can edit less files within brackets
of course it understands that but it
does use it um basically it is built
using it so for those you haven't done
any any less one of the things that
allows it allows you to import other
files so this one is actually they have
a bracket shared less CSS file that it's
importing in that's used throughout but
then you can also do things like
variables this variables is like one
look it's powerful but it's really easy
with unless so you'll see in that
sidebar there I'm setting this that
piece of code right there is actually
broken up obviously you wouldn't
normally set the variable and then use
it right away but so I took two pieces
and kind of combine them there but I'm
setting a variable named sidebar with to
200 pixels in them within my sidebar I'm
using that variable sidebar with to set
the width now you can also do there's an
there's a concept of scoping within less
so I can actually set a variable outside
so that sidebar with could be set there
but I could I could then set it inside
my sidebar and that would be scoped
differently so be scoped within this
particular sidebar block while these the
other one would be scoped outside of it
so that's one of the neat things you can
you normally use variables but you have
different different scoping there's also
nesting that that's it less handles so
this is not a particularly easy to
understand example
and I did take it out of all these
examples are taken straight out of code
the nesting thing is really really cool
because it save it makes a little bit
more straightforward to understand how
different CSS rules are nested for those
of you who've done a lot of CSS
obviously you usually have like you you
might have your body and then you have
your body a and then you have your body
a hover and your but you know so you
have a bunch of classes that are all
related but they're not they're all
separate so you have body and then you
have body a and your body a hover so on
right so what nesting allows you to do
is is do that in a little bit more
straightforward way so in this case we
actually have body and then a class body
re-sizing and then body dad resizing
then this div project a so on so forth
all these are nested under body and
that's what's going on here so it's
actually saying like all of these are
body dot resizing body and so on and so
forth and all those have this cursor
call resize it's not the clearest
example there they have a lot of nesting
going on so it was hard to find an
example that was that made it a little
bit easier to understand but but what it
does is prevent you from having to do a
different block for each of these right
so it's one of the it less makes it
really easy to kind of shorthand things
but it's also really powerful with
things like variables there's a lot more
to it I'm only kind of glossing over
some of the stuff that you can see going
on inside brackets but but it allows you
to write through your CSS and a much
kind of much cleaner more
straightforward way as well as add
things like variables and stuff like
that you can even do calculations and
things like that so that you don't have
to X you know things can be calculated
for you automatically within less and so
on so those are kind of some of the the
more the frameworks and other tools that
they use within brackets I want to kind
of talk a little bit about their code
conventions because I thought it was
really interesting you know I've been a
part of development teams in my past and
like I have to say you know I always
regret the fact that we didn't set a lot
of these conventions up in advance like
we didn't
you those of you work on big development
teams you can usually like open a file
and say like oh you know this is this
Joe edit this file because he always
does this crap and I hate the way he
writes and he uses spaces instead of
tabs and he doesn't do such and such and
you know he camel cases instead of them
underscoring and so on so they're very
explicit about this because they have a
lot of contributors who are you know
they want you basically to go contribute
so they want to be able to make sure
that you you know I can't go out there
and say like okay this this file looks
completely different than this and
they're doing things a very different
way so they they're fairly explicit
about the code conventions none of these
are like anything you necessarily like
you know you know that I have to use
that but they're all kind of good ideas
that maybe you think well within our
development team way we will steal some
of those the ones we like and we don't
there's maybe ones we don't so all their
variable and function names use camel
case I think it's pretty standard but
there are a lot of people who do the
underscores and things like that I
notice they didn't specifically say
lower camel case but that's what they're
using I guess so anyway but they say you
know no no underscores 444 variables and
function names I kind of like this one I
mean it seems stupid and it's just the
teams i was on we never bothered to use
it some people i talked to some people
who really hate this convention here but
other people love it which is that any
variables that refer to a jquery object
have to have that little dollar sign in
front of it so that sidebar is obviously
referring to a div of or yeah with the
night let's say Dave I don't know what
it is but a div with an ID of sidebar
right so it's a jquery option I have to
prefix it with that little dollar sign
that way you can easily look through the
code and say oh okay this this
particular variable is a jquery object
and and be clear of like what what you
can do with it right so you know rather
than just using it with with a with
nothing in front of it as i said before
they prefix anything that's supposed to
be private with underscore i know
there's some you know this was one of
the ones I
to ask them about this because I know
there are some patterns and things to
help you protect things make them more
private but in this case they kind of
rely on convention where everything
underscore is supposed to be understood
that is private it's not really private
as we all know but it's that's supposed
to be like okay you're supposed to
assume that is private so another thing
was was and this is another one I kind
of like I don't really think it's that
key but they I like the fact that they
use whereas variables use the camel
casing they actually all their IDs and
classes have to use dashes this may not
make a big difference to you but there
are cases out were like you might
actually find them in your code and get
a little you it's a little easier to
tell what is it what is a class or an ID
and what is actually referencing a
variable this was an interesting one
because I had some people ask me because
there's a bit like okay we there's not a
particular reason for this other than
stylistics in some respects like I asked
why because why they chose to do this
they ask you to use array for each
instead of using either a for loop or
using jQuery each looping and so
somebody came up to me after I presented
this last week and they said well you
know in their tests actually the for
loop was faster and blah blah I'm you
know and I asked the team and they said
well first of all they they did while
they did find like certain ones were
faster when you when you were iterating
over maybe thousands of items that they
didn't feel like this was a big deal I
do think and in fact I didn't
specifically question on this but but
you know you got to remember they are
also dealing with a desktop application
so some of the stuff some of their
performance and things like that they're
little bit less concern than you might
be on your website because they're not
running within the confines of the
browser particularly when they're
loading files and things like this is
much it all that stuff is going to be
much faster so they just what the reason
they did this was partly not for
performance reasons they just have a
preference throughout that things you
can do without jquery you that you can
do in straight JavaScript they prefer
you just use the straight JavaScript and
not use jQuery which you know I think
makes sense i mean there's but obviously
it's up to you and your in your
particular project whether that makes
sense to you but i actually like that
reasoning you know kind of made sense to
me because it's clean enough in the ray
for each they felt like it was a clean
easy way to write it and without the
jquery and that's that doesn't apply
just to this in general they prefer if
you can do it without jquery do it
without jquery so another interesting
thing that they do they use and i'm not
going to go through a lot of examples of
it because there aren't a ton but those
of you who who know bootstrap I'm sorry
I rushed through this presentation I
apologize but so those are you who know
bootstrap can pretty much tell that
things like the the UI is done using
bootstrap like like this button and the
modal dialog you can tell our bootstrap
if you're interested in how they used it
I mean there's not a lot of it going on
yet but the UI is getting more complex
as they add more more dialogues and more
windows and things like that and so it's
becoming a bigger part of the project
but you can dig into the code and see it
so maybe I do so there's a whole bunch
of other stuff going on inside the code
so and I didn't cover those here so they
have a whole sense of document and file
management they have these document
classes in these file classes that
abstract the way you interact with files
on the file system and so on and so
forth so it's actually you know it's
really interesting and there's a great
article by a guy David to rape that goes
a lot through
how how that works so he kind of digs
into the document classes and I won't
let's show you the article too much here
but he digs into how that works and how
how it actually abstracts out the the
accessing of files it also abstracts out
on the editor as well so they have a
class for the editor I my understanding
is is this they didn't want to create
these like tight dependency so even
though they're relying on code mirror
they didn't want to build in like you
know where they it was tightly coupled
with code mirror so they have this
editor class where you anything you want
to interact with the editor you don't
call anything directly on code mirror
you're actually calling this editor
class that then talks to code mirror and
they do that throughout the project on a
number of things like I said they when I
talk to them about JS lint they were
like you know well we're we're fairly
happy with jslint right now what our
idea is is to make it pluggable so you
can unless a you want to use JS hint or
whatever other you know project for that
purpose that you have well you can just
plug it in so the goal is down the road
you'll be able to plug these things in
its it's very you know because they
haven't tightly coupled any any of the
pieces with these external dependencies
so much they also use the jQuery promise
object for handling asynchronous
operations they have there's a whole
article on this they have about why
about reference counting versus weak
references they have on the wiki it's
it's pretty interesting obviously there
are no weak references and JavaScript so
they're using this reference counting to
manage all the list of of the different
classes that they've already pulled in
an object you know and then they that
way when you closed something they make
sure that they eliminate all the
references to it and so on it's kind of
interesting because because of the
scalar project and because of how much
code is going on there to see how they
manage that throughout the users command
pattern for for handling user input so
like
so every time you you you know your type
you click something or whatever it turns
out of command that that's passed and
well sorry but it's a bit late in the
day so it's beer o'clock already and I'm
clearly showing they also use they also
encapsulate state in these different
commands and things like that so so that
they can manage the state of the UI
another really really interesting thing
and it's probably like way above my head
to really get into it that's just why I
don't but so one of the really cool
features of brackets is that it has this
it has this live preview so you need
chrome for the live preview to work but
what it does is it actually when I can
type CSS I can modify CSS even if I'm in
the HTML file and let's say I'm editing
the CSS using that shortcut that I was
showing you earlier so i can edit that
CSS and in my browser it will actually
change it as i type so you'll be able to
see the changes as you type and that
actually uses a WebSocket connection to
communicate with chrome to send those
changes over so that they're immediately
pre viewable it's really nice to be able
to like say you know you can have your
your browser open and in one screen and
you're in brackets open another and
you're just typing your editing your CSS
and seeing how that actually shows up on
the browser as you type so it's a really
nice feature kind of designed to prevent
so one of the key things about brackets
that they're trying to do both with the
inline editing of CSS and javascript in
with this feature is to prevent you from
constantly having to kind of switch
context like okay I'm in my HTML file
now I'm in my CSS file them in my
javascript file now let me go over here
now I've edited all those three files
let me go over here and refresh the
browser the idea is you can do it all in
one file and those changes are
immediately shown in the browser so the
so there's a whole series I recommend
checking out the wiki that's on
on the bracket site because the
developers are very very open about what
they're doing obviously it's on github
that's the point right and they post a
lot of details about about what their
how these things work and have you know
their investigations of different
technologies and stuff like that so it's
really useful resource for that stuff
