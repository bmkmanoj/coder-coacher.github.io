okay so like Taylor mentioned I'm Scott
tremper I'm the director of marketing at
trade-off I and today I'm going to talk
to you about personality so you notice
right away I have this really goofy
image on my front of my slide and that
is just about 48 hours ago from the top
of the Eiffel Tower so I'm a little
jet-lagged out up here let's do to that
and you also notice that my font might
look a little familiar as well as the
title I'll warn you ahead of time that I
probably go a little bit overboard with
Star Wars references Batman references
Indiana Jones references marvel comic
references but that's kind of
intentional and I'd really tried to put
as much of me and so this talk as
possible and so helping you understand
me is a great place to get started when
we're looking at the path of
personalization on the internet to start
we really need to look back at how
people sold to people in stores
traditional sort of marketing to people
traditionally people businesses knew
their customers not just whether they
were male or female or how old they were
but they knew them they talked to them
about their lives where they worked how
many kids they have how their family was
doing and then along came the internet
where you thought you kind of new people
but by knowing someone you really didn't
know much about them at all so that
brings us to the first section of my
talk you'll notice that they're
conveniently labeled as episodes so this
is episode 1 the phantom user here we
have big data cookies behavioral
tracking things that sold us on the
principle that using the internet as a
means of selling would generate for us a
more substantial user understanding in a
way it did it taught us more that we
could about our users than ever before
without some serious number crunching we
would know when someone buy something
how frequently they would buy it and we
might even know their name age and
potentially gender but we really don't
know who they are we began to think of
it as a great
to lump together every person that was
18 to 35 and mail into one category and
target to them but if we look at that a
little more in depth we soon realize how
archaic that method is so for example we
have two users the visit your site in
this case we're looking at obi-wan
Kenobi and Darth Maul we all know their
differences their physical appearance is
pretty obvious but as an online company
can you easily identify what makes each
unique both men are in their mid to late
20s they come from similar backgrounds
and they have the same position in the
fields with the same type of education
but if we look at their buying history
I'm sure we'll see a clear distinction
right so it looks like ob1 bought a
lightsaber and Darth Maul bought a
lightsaber they bought them for the same
price and the only difference was that
they came from different places so we
have two people with similar buying
behaviors age gender and occupation and
you can start to see how this
information really isn't enough to
separate them that we know these two
people are vastly different so this is
the kind of data we're looking for right
in our users well not at all we know
that they're different and that people
are unique with qualities about them
that separate them from others in their
same age gender and socioeconomic status
so in order to understand a user we have
to really get to know them and this
brings us to our next episode the attack
of social and this is where we start to
look at how social media has had an
impact within personalization it's one
of the first breeding grounds of data
for us to harvest about our users you
have sites like Facebook and Twitter
where we're able to understand depth and
information about people's location
occupation friends family relationship
status things that they like things that
they don't like it's real information so
it must be perfect for recommendations
right not exactly so if we look at a
young Anakin Skywalker he's been busy on
social media we have a lot of
information about them we can see his
family history we can see those friends
are r2d2 and obi-wan Kenobi and he's in
a complicated relationship he's
originally from Tatooine but lives on
Coruscant and his into podracing
lightsabers flying
doesn't like sand Tusken Raiders and
rules so based on this information what
kind of AD might we be able to target to
him the Corellia 500 on CBS an upcoming
pod racing event well we wouldn't really
be wrong with this based on his love of
pod racing his age his interest in
physical activities he'd probably enjoy
watching this event and this is where
social media kind of works it gives us
good targeting enough that the customer
isn't unhappy but not really enough to
understand them on a deeper level if we
actually knew Anakin Skywalker at age 19
and went to target on based on
personality we'd probably send them
something more like this start your free
apprenticeship today now if he'd seen
this we probably would have been able to
least eliminate least one or two of the
lousy prequels so social media gives us
a new dimension to understand but also
contains a large number of superficial
information how many people have liked
random things on Facebook because
someone asked them to or sent them an
invite I grew up in LA so I had a lot of
friends and bands so I've liked so many
band pages on Facebook and I probably
haven't listened to the music for like
ninety percent of them people behave
differently on social media than they do
as regular individuals so even with
collecting a large amount of data we
really understand what you do and how
you do it but we're just too far away
from understanding why you do it which
brings us to the next episode episode 3
revenge of the same so over the last few
years is we've been playing with and
understanding more about this wealth of
data and information a new phrase
emerged which is the era of
personalization and it came with nothing
but really some of the same old stuff
for many years personalization carried
with it a litany of definitions and
understandings for users which was a
constant sense of being let down by your
expectations but the episode 3 was
probably the best of the prequels so
there are some good things that popped
up in there that we can look at what
grew out of this personalization mode
momentum was a catalyst for things to
come we now an abundance of
recommendation engines out there and
services that try to interpret your
behavioral data and social data to
provide predictions for what you best
want things like entertain
mini Commerce are probably the best
sites out there that push for
personalized content and personalized
home pages things like amazon has done a
great job of differentiating between
when you're signed out verse when you're
signed in what content they present to
you here you can see shows that i watch
on hulu are you know nerdy things again
like flash agent Carter and Gotham and
then the things that are recommended for
me on netflix are arrow and the walking
dead and agents of shield but the
problem is now users have tasted things
like this and they want more of it they
want more of their experience but not in
the sense of more of the same thing they
don't need for lightsabers when they
already have one that's just a little
bit too flashy what we want to do is
back up these recommendations with fresh
new content that shows that we care
about them understand them as a customer
and can give them the best experience as
possible which brings us to the next
episode episode for a new hope now I was
going to put a pun with this but I
couldn't really think of one that went
with it so I kind of just left it as it
is but it does also lead directly into
trade off I and what we do and so I say
that we we've reached a point in
customer engagement where we realized
that the original way of getting to know
one someone is essential to bringing us
the next level of recommendations
personalization and engagement the store
clerk that's down the road let's take
the time to know you and generate brand
loyalty and Trust we need to be able to
do that with our customers online so the
more we let that sink into our head and
embrace that idea we begin to modify our
entire outlook on how we do things so
for what we do at trade off I is is
basically that we become a personality
API where what our intention is is too
quickly and immediately assess a user's
personality and dive deep into who they
are it's a visual personality
measurement tool the learns about the
traits and intrinsic motivations behind
each people each person and this is the
kind of information that you get to know
and understand from knowing someone from
a long time what motivates them what
drives in crazy what makes them tick so
we do this by showing users a series of
images and give them a simple
choice of me or not me and through their
responses were able to garner
information about their personality
we've developed this through a team of
psychology and technology experts who've
created this unique and engaging way to
talk to your users and learn about them
so as Taylor mentioned we have Ford j/s
calm / trade-off I you can take it now
if you want and try it out we have a fun
assessment that's tied to that it's
based around sort of what type of
Avenger you are and will also be giving
away a drone to someone who takes it so
that'll be fun but behind every image is
personality traits so our psychology
team is pairing 5 to 10 images or five
to ten personality traits behind every
image and then as you go through an
assessment it typically takes around 90
seconds that data is collected to create
a personality profile which then can be
used for the personalization my result
through the the assessment that is
listed is a detective innovator so the
detectives are the investigative types
they're they're always seeking
information they're always out to learn
more the innovators are the creative
types and so if you were to combine
those together you'd essentially have a
bit of a Batman and Iron Man and so when
I was googling that it came across this
really cool image so I thought I'd show
it just goes pretty fun although if
anyone's seen the Batman vs Superman
trailer kind of looks like Batman and
that so that's pretty sweet so now we've
got here we have this cool image and
you're thinking alright this is cool
this was fun it was quick and easy and
we have this interesting data set but
what do we do with this like what is the
actual intention of it so that brings us
to Episode five on our journey it's the
best of the movie so it's obviously the
most fun section personalization strikes
back so you have the source of data what
do you do with it well first and
foremost you have the means now to
better understand your customers you can
see what makes them tick what makes them
unique this allows you to communicate
with them better you can create market
segmentation through personality to
target content to different people so
for instance if I was trying to target
caps in America I might want to talk
about the greater good
the compassion behind our brand and the
ability of brings but if I was going
after spider-man I'd want to be a little
more funny in the way in comical the way
I market to them and probably a little
egocentric when i'm trying to sell stuff
to them every effort you can make to
personalize the experience truly and
deeply for the user the more connected
they're going to feel to your brand and
the more loyal they're going to become
we're currently working with one of the
daily deal sites out there and they
literally are adjusting their marketing
emails based on the personality of their
users so they can actually cater to them
directly with things that they've
actually be interested in to now earlier
I talked about recommendation engines
and personalized home pages and although
they've improved a lot over the last few
years there's still room for improvement
with personality we believe there's a
new and quick in far deeper way to match
people the relative content and it's
something that we like to call people
like you so we all have friends that
recommend us a movie and every time they
recommend you a movie you know that
you're going to love it and if you have
other friends that recommend you a TV
show or movie to watch and you're like
sure like I'll check it out knowing that
you're never going to go and look at it
that concept is kind of what we've
created here taking people and
personalities that are similar to you
and using that to create the the
recommendation correlation engine rather
than just previous viewing behavior on
soda walkies do that we're going to take
an example featuring Indiana Jones so
indiana here has taken our movies
assessment it's another one of our
personality assessments we have a wide
variety of different assessments and
this could be used for something like
Netflix HBO Hulu Plus and he came up as
a believer stunt double so believer is a
sci-fi fan and stunt double is the
action piece so I guess that makes
pretty perfect sense considering
harrison ford also was Han Solo we
all.we then take all the users in a data
set and look at the personality so this
will be a massive data set so we'll need
to start segmenting them into their
personality types so here you can see
they've been aligned into their various
buckets of the different personality
types for the success
and I'm oversimplifying this for the
sake of this short talk but in reality
you'd be able to filter these across
many data points the traits i was
mentioning the behind every image those
are scored on a scale of 0 to 100 so
you'd be able to take that full scale of
personality traits with every user and
get really granular when you're
segmenting your users but so here we
know that he was a believer in stunt
double so we can immediately pull out
the personality types that he wouldn't
fall into and that leaves us with the
believers and the stunt doubles so from
here we can look at exactly the most
similar personalities within these data
sets and analyze their viewing behavior
to create the recommendations for for
dr. Jones there so in this example we're
pulling the two strongest matches as
recommendations that would be Star Wars
and The Dark Knight so you can see how
instead of just matching people to
things we're matching people to people
and then using that data to correlate
the recommendations the best part about
this is that you can do all of this
within our API and around 100
milliseconds which makes it easier for
you and let you target people based on
massive amounts of information and so
we've arrived at the final chapter of
the original trilogy three years of
discovery and understanding we've been
able to turn the online experience into
that of the original offline experience
you have your store clerk down the
street or are farmers market in your
neighborhood it's all about
relationships and understanding and
getting to know your users not only just
to increase revenue but to give them
experience that they want and turn them
into brand followers and loyal customers
who will not only return for years but
will bring more adoption and increase
your revenue so we really want to be
like this dude the dude behind the
counter communicating with all of his
customers learning about them and using
their personality to create a better
experience but then of course the
question is how do you do that so a
trade off I we offer a personality API
that allows you to plug in personality
into any of your applications you can
simply go to developer trade if I calm
and sign up for a free developer account
and get an API key it's free to play
with in San
vox environments and this gives you
access to all of our different
assessments JavaScript widgets github
libraries for whatever language you're
wanting to use if your startup today
we're actually launching a deal where
you can go live and the discount is
around eighty percent of what
traditionally we charge to sort of
larger comes customers and so these
assessments are used in a variety of
different things we have career
assessments that were part of monster
com they use it for career matching for
students and and job seekers we have a
few groups are using it for dating
applications entertain a patient's
ecommerce applications and we offer a
variety of different javascript widget
so you can drop in to your application
so you can start understanding your
users quickly and allow them to match to
your relevant content and products and
of course this is all mobile friendly so
the data you're getting back so they've
taken this assessment what are you
actually getting back to you can use to
look at so we're giving you back not
only their information about their
personality type in some cases we
present as a blend so you have a custom
description that goes with their top two
personality types but we're also giving
you back the trait data so this is sort
of what we see is the core of building
these personality types and building a
user these get really intricate from you
know prefers improvement change in
reform to people they're fearless people
are aggressive it gets really detailed
on the nearly two well over 150 traits
that we're measuring so the idea behind
all of this is that we offer you a way
to build a stronger bond and a deeper
relationship with our customers
providing that in-store experience and
and making it more personal so by now
we've reached the end which can bring us
to the future which is episode 7 the
personality awakens and the future is
really you all you know engaging in this
and taking personality and utilizing
personalization I might encourage you
all to think deeply about the people are
using your products and how you can
better understand them and provide them
with richer targeted content to to go
and awaken the personality within your
customers and in your applications and
yourselves
and that's it so I think we have some
time for questions maybe anyone has any
so we have I guess it's was that so oh
yes so his question was how do we deal
with personality changing over time so
we have a variety of I guess different
verticals that people use the assessment
in so it really depends on that for for
certain ecommerce platforms they might
just want to be have it done once and
then use that for recommendations but
with with like students for example we
know that students personalities change
so we are building in ways that they can
retake the assessment and then they can
look at the history of their assessment
and some of that's entirely up to our
clients whether they want to do that and
that it would cause another API call so
they'd have to sort of pay for someone
to retake the assessment and get their
day the old data back if they hadn't
saved it so it's entirely up to them but
we do encourage people to to retake a
testament tests over time if they if
they feel that it's necessary yep sure
sure so his question was that when you
take the assessment you do have to spend
time to actually complete the assessment
so as their ways for users to spread
that out across their experience and
that's another one where it's up to the
client most of our current clients just
have it as part of the onboarding
process or a marketing piece that they
send out later and they have them do it
in one shot but there are other people
or people of the creative products or
we've seen that they have them fill out
initial information and then they say
you know these questions are about a
certain part of your personality and
they go through that and then they can
fill out you know additional ports of
their profile and then complete the
assessment later but typically we find
that people do it in one shot and if you
compare this to similar assessments that
are traditional there might take 45
minutes or even like two hours it's a
lot quicker it's a lot easier and we
found around over a ninety-five percent
completion rate which is far higher than
traditional assessments and then our
accuracy has been
going to be higher to traditional
assessments have they use a scale called
chrome Beck's alpha that they fall into
around 2.7 to 2.85 a lot of that is that
you have these long assessments so you
hit a TD in point where people just
start filling in bubbles or don't really
care and then also because we use a
binary they have a wider scale so you
know a five might be a four to you so
how do you really you know accurately
compare that so we found to be test
higher than as well we've been testing
at a point 92 on those scale so we found
that we've had such a high completion
rate as well as accuracy rate that it
hasn't proven to be an issue but in
things like hackathons we've seen people
that break it up throughout or that you
take a section of it and then they
provide your recommendations and then
they say hey you want to improve these
you can you know finish the assessment
and increase your your accuracy yep sure
so his question was when I showed like
Netflix and Hulu that they're already
using your viewing history to provide
recommendations so sort of what makes us
different or why do we we sort of do I
would be be used there and it is that
you can use that and they're doing it
well but if you talk to a lot of people
that work in netflix or hulu they have a
huge portion of people dedicated to
things like personalization increasing
that they're they're doing a good job
they're not doing a like a bad job by
any stretch but they are finding that
people are unsatisfied or the
recommendations get skewed because you
watch one thing so it's really sort of
taking what they have and it does
require an extra step for the user but
then the long-term gain for the user
would be better recommendations and then
Netflix can also have a better
understanding of their audience when you
know adding new content or or adding new
recommendations yep sure sure so his
question is that if you have this
assessment or one of the trader fight
assessments at various websites would
you have to take it again when you go to
New a new application that's using it
currently you would have to
we're looking into different solutions
that would have that sort of like a
facebook login or LinkedIn connect where
you'd have it all tied we don't use the
information that's collected so we let
the businesses keep that so it's sort of
finding that and working around that of
well you know someone a data was
collected initially and paid for by this
group and this other groups going to pay
for it but it's was originally collected
by the other group so it's finding that
and working around that but ideally yes
we're looking into some universal
solution yep sure so I think what you're
saying is using personality and then
combining it with their behaviors
they're buying behavior and viewing
behavior yeah so so that's we're doing
is providing the the personality element
but we definitely encourage different
platforms so if they already have data
you might as well use it and use it to
supplement the personality element which
is going to provide a stronger result in
the end anyways all right I think that
might be it all right thank you everyone
have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
