that can come up with this and we've
seen that this binding depends on how a
function is called and not how a
function is defined let's dive into how
the JavaScript runtime or the browser
decides what that this binding should be
so if we're calling a function with a
dot then this is going to be bound to
the thing before the dot so let's take a
look at that part is function being
invoked with a dot if the answer to this
question is yes then this inside of that
function will evaluate to whatever is
before the dot so if the call was X dot
F this would evaluate to X if the answer
to this question is no it's the very
same function object being invoked
without a dot in that case this will
evaluate to the global object
and in the browser the global object is
called window so that would be something
like saying F 2 equals X dot F and then
invoking F 2 without a dot same function
object as we had over here but in this
case there's no dot and so this will be
the global it turns out that there are a
couple of other edge cases we won't talk
about all of those here they're in the
spec but one other one to be aware of
actually happens above this decision
point in the tree and that's is the
function being invoked with the new
operator so the new operator is involved
in the original syntax for inheritance
and it has a number of effects on the
function that we're running for our
purposes here today we're going to be
interested in one particular effect if
the answer to this question is no then
we proceed to the decision we already
looked at but if the answer is yes in
that case regardless of how the function
is being invoked this will be bound to a
new empty object
so these three cases is the function
being invoked vocht with new yes or no
and if not is the function being invoked
with a dot yes or no covers the three
main cases for how the JavaScript
runtime will decide by itself what this
should be bound to in subsequent
sections we'll look at how to work
around some of these issues and how to
tell the browser exactly what we'd like
this to be in the next section we'll
look at a common workaround that solves
the problem we saw and we'll discuss the
pros and cons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
