currently looking for a new UI framework
okay good how many of you are familiar
with accessibility good okay
how many of you use actually use
assistive technology throughout your day
okay good perfect these these are
actually mine right here I can't see
without peace so anyone wearing glasses
you you're using assistive technology to
although very low-tech so i'll go ahead
and introduce myself my name is Gerard
Cohen I am the friend front-end UX
architect and senior accessibility lead
at wells fargo sure
my contact information is up on the
screen there I want to thank you for
coming up to the dark dungeons of the
third floor up in the corner to to sit
with me today I know you could have
picked any other track to sit in some
very thankful that you're here so we're
going to talk a lot about UI frameworks
everyone has their own criteria for
picking UI framework it's a very big
decision you know it's not something
normally you take lightly it's something
you're going to be married to for a good
amount of time so you want to take your
time trying to figure it out everyone
has their own set of criteria for
picking a UI framework whether its ease
of use so you know community popularity
any other you know number of criteria to
pick but uh for for how many of you is
accessibility like one of those criteria
okay I guess that's why you're here
right good
so how do you know which ones accessible
right hopefully today what we're going
to do is we're going to talk about just
some very basic checks this is not meant
to be an exhaustive accessibility audit
of these frameworks hopefully you'll
leave here today with some you know
simple easy things that you can do to
have a really big impact on your
projects so these are the frameworks
we'll be talking about today I know the
schedule had listed something different
that was you know the landscape changes
so fast that I decided to do something a
little more relevant and this is my OC d
alphabetical list so we'll be talking
about bootstrap foundation which is a
really good responsive framework we have
ionic for a mobile flavor and we'll talk
a little bit about material design light
I'm not here to bash these frameworks at
all I'm very understand it's hard to
build a framework especially something
that's going to be used by a lot of
people and I'm greatly appreciative of
these frameworks for putting in the hard
works to make our jobs easier so I'm not
here to batch them I'm just here to help
you guys maneuver your way around when
you're picking these hopefully some of
you have experience with these hopefully
some of you are interested in using
these and I'll give you some more
insight on how to make them fully
accessible
some of the things that we'll be looking
at today our forms tabs basically at
your basic tab widget will be talking
about dialogues and tooltips we want to
take a look at some actual code that
comes from the documentation of these
frameworks we want to see do they have
any documentation for accessibility what
are their intentions for accessibility
do their examples exhibit good
accessible you know habits and best
practices
some of the criteria that we'll be
looking at our proper labels and
descriptions this is very important
especially when we're talking about
forms but just for anything in general
we talk a lot about semantics it's not
just something that like old cranky
developers argue about semantics have a
really big part in accessibility because
the semantics when you define something
what it is you're also implying what the
interaction for that thing is as well so
semantics are very important we'll talk
about keyboard navigation can users that
don't use a mouse are they able to
navigate through your website and you
know go through flows and tasks this is
actually really important because there
are people that don't use keyboards they
have motor disabilities and they have to
rely on very basic like methods of
navigating so things like mouth sticks
where it's really just a stick in their
mouth that they use to like tap and poke
at the screen also head wands that do
the same thing so they're navigating
with their head and maybe something as
basic it's just a switch so these are
just binary controls there's also
there's they're people that their only
ability to navigate us through a machine
called a sip and puff our sip and puff
so literally inhaling is one action that
exhaling is another some you know motor
disabilities include muscular dystrophy
Parkinson's or even just plain arthritis
which i'm pretty sure in 20 years from
now i'm going to have from being on the
keyboard most of my life so it's not
just about motor disabilities as well
there's also power users involve you
think about us as developers we live in
the command line so we type a lot more
than we use a mouse so again there's a
power user not necessarily motor
disabilities but they feel more
comfortable navigating their day to day
tasks with the keyboard
we'll also be talking along with that as
a focus indication as well we'll be
talking about color contrast which is
actually something that usually your
designers should handle for you but it's
something you need to be aware of color
contrast actually assists colorblind or
people with low vision so again like
myself who glasses on considered low
vision user if I'm not wearing them and
color contrast is actually it's for
colorblind people it's actually the
color blind they're not they don't see
in black and white it's really a color
deficiency so they can't see certain
colors to the full spectrum that they
should be able to and actually 10% of
men are color blind or have some kind of
color deficiency so there's probably
some people some men in here that have
some level of color deficiency women
there's only a point five percent of
women are colorblind and unfortunately
the chromosome just goes along with the
men so we we're in most cases of the
color deficiency and ninety-nine percent
of people that are colorblind or having
a color deficiency have a deficiency in
the red green area and this is something
that's really important we'll talk about
it a little bit later but this plays a
really big part on on our UI red and
green lastly for complex widgets will be
talking about Aria and will be using the
why aria one point o authoring practices
as our guide when we're talking about
these widgets and patterns now it's
important to note that these are not you
know this is not the rule of how you
should do it they're just guidelines so
you can start with these as a basis to
get along the way and then depending on
your particular use case you may have to
modify it to make it usable for users
and this particular aspect there's
there's some dispute on whether it's too
complicated widgets are too complicated
because they include not only roles and
states and properties but also very
specific keyboard interactions again
earlier I talked about semantics and how
they imply keyboard interaction or just
in general interaction rules
a lot of people feel there may be too
complicated just for a normal normal
user but maybe I don't have any kind of
disabilities but I'm not exactly
familiar with how these these
interactions sort of work so my
recommendation if you're struggling with
this kind of dichotomy of which way to
go is if you're just doing a plain
website just kind of for the most part
static you're okay with just using good
semantic markup you probably don't need
re too much if you're doing a web
application then you're probably going
to need Aria Aria and the roles and the
properties and the keyboard interactions
are meant to bring up parody with what a
user's experiences with their operating
system so the way they interact with
their operating system interface that
you're expected to be able to provide
that same interface for web widgets and
components so all right we'll spend a
little bit of time talking about Aria
so first I want to talk about forms this
is really really big especially for
working in the banking industry
basically every page has some level of
form they're so ubiquitous they're
really easy to get right but they're
really easy to get wrong too and we're
going to talk about some some basic
things that you can do to improve
accessibility of your forms and we'll
look at some examples it's really just
about you know just again good markup
very basic now when we're talking about
semantics and we're talking about proper
labels and grouping this is something
that's actually really important for
screenreader users to make sure that
your input your elements are properly
labeled and to understand why I know a
lot of people when when especially when
we're doing like interviews we ask them
so why is it important for this to you
know programmatically associated label
with the input element the number one
answer i always get is it's good for
exist ability because if you click on
the label then the input element gets
focused which is true that's very you
know that's a very good thing to provide
to your users but that's actually not
really the reason why we do it so just
to explain the way keep screen reader
users interact with the page think about
when you get to a web page that you're
not familiar with the first thing you do
is you're going to scan all over the
place very rarely do we read from left
to right top to bottom you're going to
look at particular headings that pop out
at you you're probably going to skip
over the ads you're going to look for
any kind of content that's relevant to
you screen reader users actually
navigate the page in the same way and
the way they do that is the screen
readers will provide them special
keyboard shortcuts so for example jaws
you know pressing the B key will
essentially start reading out each
button on the page in order or they can
do something like insert be to get a
list of all the buttons on a page and
they can navigate to a particular one
they're interested in and just about
every element on the on the page will
have some kind of keyboard shortcut and
the screen reader does is by us they
literally hijack or intercept keyboard
keyboard strokes for the user now when
we're talking about forms we're using
our keyboard in a completely different
context right now we're
actually typing inputting information so
now bead no longer means button it's
actually the character be right H is no
longer header it's actually the letter H
down arrow which for screenreader users
means read line by line you know down or
up arrow read the previous line now it's
actually selecting you know radio
buttons in a group or a native select or
something like that so now it's no
longer able to provide those keyboard
shortcuts that are used to navigate and
read the items on the page so if the
form if the input elements are not
associated with labeled and they have no
idea what that input is for right
because there's no way for them to get
to that information so this is this is
the secret to why forms getting forms
right is so important the screen reader
users will be completely lost if the
labels aren't properly associated of
course along with a keyboard usage is
focus indication we'll talk about color
contrast you'll see this pattern as we
go through all these widgets it's the
same thing that will be going through
for the most part for forums will talk
about error validation most of the
frameworks that we're going to go over
today don't provide actual validation
mechanism they may provide some styles
who you know describe error states but
they don't actually provide the
mechanisms to do the validation so
that's something that's usually cuts
them and we'll have to do a certain
level of aria for that next we'll talk
about tabs so tab I'm sure you all are
familiars is basically a tab interface
that allows dynamic switching of content
again something very very heavily used
on the Internet
of course so our checklist is a keyboard
interaction there's a very definite
keyboard interaction pattern that's used
for tabs we have a focus indication
color contrast and some Aria roles
our keyboard interaction rules this tab
would actually focus the active tab we
should be able to use a left and up
arrows to navigate and arrow should
cycle
and roles that we're expecting our tab
panel tab lists tab states of our
selected in aria controls dialogues this
is actually a favorite topic of mine but
we're all familiar with dialogues
they're essentially you know overlays
that prompt for a response or some type
of you know additional information from
from a user again our criteria keep
keyboard interaction focus indication
color contrast in aria there's a very
specific rules for a dialogue so tab
should basically be limited to the
dialogue itself shift and shift tab so
it should cycle escapes you escape key
should close the panel as well and enter
if there's a form should submit the form
roles that are necessary our dialogue
and alert dialog so a lot of people are
confused by these alert dialog is
actually basically a replacement for
your javascript alert so it's a very
quick message with like an okay some
kind of confirmation dialog is for
bigger pieces of information or it
actually contains other controls in
widgets or a form last widget will look
at our tool tips and these are actual
again these are meant to replace the
title attribute which is not sure if
you're aware is horribly inaccessible
title attribute that we use on just
about anything is only available to
sighted users that use a mouse meaning
it only displays on hover screenreader
users don't usually get that information
keyboard users don't get that
information so we'll title attribute the
little tool tip that comes up does not
appear on focus
excuse me
for the button
so there's actually better ways to do it
again the user won't get the most users
won't get that title attribute so you
can either use of some visually hidden
text which we'll talk about or you can
use an aria-label that's title just
don't use it there's there's very few
cases where title works but it's so few
that it's just the rulers just don't
even bother all right I think we're
going to get to the the good parts now
actually we start fixing these things
so solutions for some days we're going
to go back again and we're going to
quickly fix these again the goal is to
do some very quick simple things that
will greatly impact accessibility so for
forms we're going to jump back into
are we're going to jump back into our
ionic example we're going to make sure
that we explicitly associate labels with
the inputs we're going to group related
fields with field set which is really
important and we're going to make sure
we convey any kind of error state and
description so let's go ahead and take a
look at this button now the accessible
content is it's actually going to read
out menu right and all we did there was
we added text label this very funny we
added a span with the class of hidden
visually and I'll share that code with
you in a second but we just added some
text there and we hid it from visual
users but made it available to screen
reader users so now the screen reader
user will know what that button is for
neck / 10 / q wame w source HTTP
exponent still aren't even know where
that's coming from school
no wow what a day huh let's let's go
into these form elements by the way this
code is going to be available to get on
github I'm trying to speed through this
there was a lot of information to fit
into 40 minutes so here one will notice
something very interesting is now we
have a first name is properly described
again we use the same technique we added
the text with the hidden visually and
now we have some proper roles are
invalid aria required and tabindex so
the secret to that was because ionic is
based on angular they actually have a
module specifically for accessibility
and it's called ng Aria all I had to do
was add that module to my requires and
those properties automatically got got
added so they've done a really good job
for fixing that particular problem
other thing is I'm actually using a
fieldset with the legend to describe the
grouping of these uh field elements
there
so for keyboarding Wow
okay so you've noticed here now I have a
proper focus indication
and error indication I've given a nice
border so there's two things about air
validation when you're trying to
describe it to visual users is colors
not enough right because again there's
color blind or color deficiency and if
you remember the ninety-nine percent of
people are color deficient in red and
green and those are the two colors that
we use to describe error or you know
good state right so it's very important
that you don't rely on just those colors
alright so
the visually hidden content that I was
talking about bootstrap and foundation
actually provide classes already for you
for bootstrap it's a sr only and for
foundation it's show for sr in any case
this is the the CSS that i use this is
standard for hiding content visually
pretty much everyone that needs to do
this we'll use these exact properties
so we'll talk about tabs let's go back
to let's go back to our
tab solution we're just going to
implement our keyboard that was the only
thing that was missing and actually this
is really really easy to do you just use
the paypal bootstrap accessibility
plugin so PayPal has taken the time to
make there with bootstrap widgets
accessible it's an additional dependency
that you do have to add but they did a
pretty good job especially with the tabs
so we'll take a look at that
again all I did was I took the same
example I just added the accessibility
plugin and now keyboard interaction
works the way it's supposed to they
cycle i'm using arrow keys to navigate
and i don't have to hit enter to
activate the actual tab now the only
weird thing is now the actual focus
indication is actually worse now so
you'll still have to fix that but that's
the easiest way to get bootstrap
accessible
excuse me yes
dialogue so dialogues our foundation
dialogue actually takes a lot of work
I'm just going to show you how it works
with the fixes and then you guys can
look at the code later on we're running
out of time when I want you guys to get
to lunch
so first thing you'll notice is the the
close button is is focused immediately
so one of the rules is that the first
focus will item in the dialogue needs to
be focused actually change the markup to
a button and that's why it looks bigger
I didn't bother with the styling for it
but I changed it to a button and added
some essential classes another important
thing that I had to do here is
add this this extra text here which is a
closed dialogue because screen reader
will actually be reading the X they
would say multiplication when a screen
reader navigates to that so in order to
you know make it make sense I had to add
Aria hidden to the X so that it's not
visible to screen readers and then add
this visually hidden sex so that when
it's focused by a screen reader to
actually say closed dialogue and so
you'll see now that tabs and shift tab
properly cycle there and hitting escape
closes and the trigger that popped up
the dialogue is now focused and that was
actually a quite a bit of work to get
that taken care of and that codes
available and github which i'll give you
the link at the end lastly tooltips what
we need to do is we need to take care of
that make sure that the proper roles are
used and we need to make sure that
keyboard works now if you're looking at
any kind of examples for tooltips
usually they'll recommend to use Aria
described by I chose to use Aria labeled
by because chromevox actually doesn't
read it it doesn't support well there's
a bug right now that doesn't properly
read re described by safari and
voiceover actually we'll wait seven
seconds before it reads the additional
content which basically means to a user
it's never read because no one's going
to know that they have to wait seven
seconds nor if they did would they
actually wait seven seconds to get that
additional content
alright so we're getting to the end I
know accessibility it's kind of crazy
but I actually got a chance to speak to
some of these frameworks and ask them
what their goals were for supporting
accessibility I was able to speak to
Marcie Sutton who was a very pivotal in
making angular which ionic is based on
accessible what she told me was that the
RNG Aria module will actually be
included as part of version 2 point 0 it
will no longer be you know a dependency
it automatically be included as well the
material design of patterns and widgets
will be fully accessible she has said
that they've committed to not release
anything unless it's fully accessible
foundation nice folks are the guys that
foundation really good guys they know
they have a lot of work to do but
they've said the next version which i
believe is version 6 is being rewritten
specifically for accessibility and as
well they're not going to release
anything unless it's accessible
bootstrap is a little bit more difficult
because they don't have such a day
basically only rely on volunteers to
make their widgets accessible although
Patrick over there did tell me that
version 4 which is the next version is
being refactored with accessibility in
mind and same thing they're not going to
be releasing anything unless there's you
know they're fully accessible
so conclusion for today basically
there's no silver bullet you're going to
need to fill in the gaps the framework
can't do everything for you but they
should be able to give you the tools to
do what you need to do for your
particular users one thing that i would
highly recommend is be careful when you
start to nest widgets because keyboard
interactions may may you know conflict
so for example if i had a tooltip which
requires escape to hide but i have that
inside of the dialogue which also hides
an escape on escape you want to make
sure that if i hit escape to hide the
tooltip i'm not also hiding my panel and
all the frameworks that i talked to said
they're very much so open a contribution
so if you guys actually fix anything
they would love to have it just be a
good citizen and help everyone else out
for it and that's basically it thank you
for sticking around sorry for the
technical difficulties i'm here if you
guys have any questions and actually
I'll sweet I'm sorry I'll tweet out the
github it's but it's basically github
com / Gerard k koen I'll tweet that out
in a little bit if anyone wants to get
the actual code but I'm here for
questions if you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
