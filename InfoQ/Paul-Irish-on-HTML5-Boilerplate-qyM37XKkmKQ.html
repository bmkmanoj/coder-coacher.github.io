look at the html5 boilerplate I hope you
can read my ASCII text in the back ooh
that looks good all right
oh I like that okay you can read that
yeah yeah that's good sometimes like it
doesn't work with projectors and you
have to switch it over to other color
schemes but cobalt is clearly the best
textmate color scheme so I'm not
changing it okay good let's start there
we go
so Peter said a little bit of my deal
that's my blog that's cool that's my
twitter with an underscore the guy
without an underscore gets a lot of
accidental tweets a lot of times but
he's a good sport the old guy there was
another Paul Irish and he also had heat
he had that name before and he had to
switch off of it because he just he
didn't like he didn't like the
accidental tweets which I don't
understand because I like Twitter love
even if it's not intentional I work on
the chrome team do developer relations
talking about html5 also if you have any
thing that you don't like about Chrome
or about the chrome developer tools let
me know because I would love to get
those addressed for you guys there's a
lot that bugs me about the tools but
we're working on fixing those I do work
on the Jake Burton machine mentioned I
also hosted and will be hosting again a
jQuery podcast called yay query about
front-end development in general it's a
good time a little bit of that I will
lead dev on and modernize there we just
added a new builder all I'm going to
show this in a little bit it's really
badass yeah it's good css3 please if you
don't like writing all those vendor
prefixes copy to clipboard boom it's
good mother I'm a text shadow yeah okay
okay let's get to the real thing we're
going to talk about html5 boilerplate
html5 boilerplate what is it it's I
think I originally had it called like
front end starting template and that's
really
it is it's it's a starting template of
HTML CSS JavaScript in a way that I've
just been kind of collecting best
practices from from around for the past
few years and decided I was sharing them
with my teams internally and then I was
like well we just like put it online and
get a lot of input from everyone I try
and make something really cool that that
everyone can use and learn from and so
that's kind of what it is it's just a
collection of best practices regard in
regards to front-end development and
performance that makes fast apps and
gets you often going in your project
really quickly let's see is it html5
there's a lot of things in here that
have to do with html5 and it's a really
good starting point to doing html5 work
but a lot of the things are just like
you know straight-up front-end
development good things you can be using
them in HTML 4 and XHTML the browser
doesn't really care either way like you
can actually have an XHTML strict page
and put in like canvas and html5 video
and all sorts of html5 features and the
browser doesn't care it's like totally
I'll make that work browsers don't care
about doc types really except that there
should be a doctor and the other goal
was that we wanted it to be cross
browser a lot of html5 can totally work
work cross browser and when I say cross
browser I basically mean it can work in
ie6 a lot of people don't support ie6
nowadays and that's totally fine I
commend you I think that's like we kind
of have to go in that direction and I
think you for taking that step but I
sevens not a lot better i8 doesn't have
anything that we want really so we're
kind of stuck with these crappy browsers
for a while but one of the things html5
boilerplate is tries to help you have a
little bit control in those older
browsers so that you can target them and
fix things with with a lot of control
who uses it over on me so the site is
it's all on github there's a lot of
activity in the project right now and we
have a really large wiki where there's
all the documentation of the project and
on one of the pages is basically just a
collection of sites that currently use
the boy look like people like Unilever
use it I was pretty pumped about that
being simple these guys are in San
Francisco I think it's really cool you
can usually tell when you select and you
get a custom selection color that's
usually decent indication that it's
using boilerplate bend the body guard
you guys might have seen this site this
is badass the guys the little guy doing
the thing and there's that guy who such
as the purse oh so rad
boilerplate site Elijah Wood looking
dapper
I suppose Janelle Monae it's like sure
in here it's a it's a very good
fundraiser Nokia and Belgium yeah look
at this so this is this is this is the
hot pink selection color this ships with
boiler plate this is kind of like my
Easter egg that I fit inside of it and I
love it but it works really well on
Nokia because like it matches the color
scheme so they didn't have to change
it's beautiful Nike Skateboarding this
one just launched a little bit ago a
beautiful site I mean it's a it's a
whole proper site with e-commerce store
you can browse shoes shirts it's quite
lovely and I think they went with blue
little tan over here this I'm super
psyched this is tapped this launched I
think today the government
oh yeah yeah they're using it pretty
sweet beautiful site they went with a
blue which looks subtle yes it's very
nice it's regal I love it this wasn't
problem probably my favorite though the
grocery manufacturers of Association
Association of America or someone like
that also in Washington DC I'm pretty
sure that these are like the guys on
behalf of coca-cola and PepsiCo that
tell the government
- you know that like soft drinks should
stay in elementary schools I think I
mean I don't know but so like really
professional looking site rights you
know pretty like collar buttoned up kind
of thing oh yeah
hot pink everywhere love it love it I
don't I don't know if they know but I
know it I love it it's good alright so
as people using it so yeah so let's like
a look at what's in it yeah here we go
okay so here I have I'm today I'm going
to be showing um the what's in currently
currently in development it's not that
not that one that you'll download if you
go to html5 boilerplate calm but it's
what's in github right now which is
always sexier and better so you should
always use that one
so this is a the look of things that
they stand right now so we have our our
plain old HTML inside CSS we got a we
have a handheld guy and then our regular
styles for everyone inside JavaScript it
gets a little crazier scripts is where
your app scripts go I like to put jQuery
plugins in here there's some jQuery and
a pink fix and modernize are all kind of
sit in there and if you're using other
things that can go in there yeah and
there are some other things in here that
I'll get to in a moment but you kind of
get set up with a with all the things
that you're going to get to anyways the
robots.txt which all it just says is yes
please crawl me I love robots and humans
dot text I don't know if you guys saw
this humans text org these guys like
just last week they were like would it
be great if we got a humans text in the
root of every site that just like you
want to know who made this site and the
human text was gonna be like I I was the
designer and this is my name this is my
Twitter and like I'm checking me out
oh yeah that's it's pretty cool it's
just like for us to like find out who
worked on what maybe it's a bad idea but
I think it's really clever
all right so there's a lot of stuff
going on in here and probably the the
most uninteresting things are in the
HTML and the CSS so I kind of want to
break down what we have in the
boilerplate into ten things I like 10
things 10 things about the boilerplate
that are pretty cool and you should
definitely know all right let's do 5 6 5
the IE conditional comments this is this
is right up at the top of the HTML this
is another way to basically see oh this
site uses html5 boilerplate right up at
the top we have these conditional
comments for IE that go around the HTML
tag and all they're basically doing is
setting the class of I 6 I 7 or 8 if
you're in one of those on the HTML tag
otherwise or if you're in i9 which is
essentially a good enough modern browser
that we don't need to like throw a stamp
on it or like what is that like a cattle
iron we don't need to like brand it as
terrible these ones definitely are so so
they're cool they're cool they're not
gonna get called out here so as a result
we had those classes and I like those
classes because basically we can now
target in our CSS hey I've tried
everything I can do but I just can't
make the style work without like
targeted specifically ie6 and ie7 and so
I'm just gonna gonna do it and like you
could use like the the underscore hack
or the star hack but it's a bit nicer to
basically just say hey legends if you're
in ie6 or in your i7 we actually got it
like tweak you a little bit because you
just don't act right and so we have this
really nice maintainable way to call out
in our Styles these browsers
so that's up there on the HTML tag this
HTML tag is also going to get a lot more
styles as soon as moderniser runs you
can see right now it says no js' it's
kind of like a nice hook you know
sometimes you you might have done
something like this where you're you're
you writing some styles and you're like
you learned that document bodied class
name and you might use a little snippet
like this and you're like yeah so I want
to know if I have j/s and then if I have
Jace I'm gonna write styles like this
and I have this widget thing and now
that it's there I'm going to do
something with it and for me I like that
but I actually like to style based on
the know JavaScript approach instead
because most of my sites are very
JavaScript heavy but I want to like have
control when there's not so with no js'
I'm like ah yeah if it's no JavaScript
and I have this crazy cool I'm gonna be
not an accordion but some cool widget
thing you're like you know what you're
not even gonna see it it's just go away
so you have a little bit of control
there all right the next thing this
starts to get into like really kind of
really kind of fun markup areas the xua
compatible I consider this one of the
most important things about the markup
here the extra weight compatible does
two things it says first let's do this
one first
if Chrome Frame if the Chrome Frame
plug-in is installed on the machine and
someone tries and tries to view it and
ie
use the Chrome Frame plug-in this
doesn't say throw up prompts to install
it it just says if you're there I want
to use you because chrome the chrome
rendering engine is probably going to be
a lot better than i7 which i think is a
fair fair assumption so that's what that
does the IE equals edge is little
trickier so basically says hey I ate 99
please use I ate and I in
to view my site and like doesn't that
make sense I mean shouldn't it just be
like that always turns out that it's not
for instance in I eight if if your site
is on an intranet ie8 will actually fall
back to i7s rendering mode like is Evans
browser and view the site with that and
so you won't get any of the features
that are in ie8 except for some of them
they kind of leak over it's kind of like
this Frankenstein of a browser that you
now have viewing your internet site and
it's just messy but like I 9 i9 we have
canvas we have an SVG and we have all
css3 goodness like you definitely want
the i9 rendering engine to be viewing
your site and if someone in IE went up
and you know how i it has like a little
um up up in the top it has this little
compatibility view icon like if someone
hits that accidentally they're gonna be
viewing your site in IE 7 essentially
instead of i9 for the rest of time but
this guy protects against that and says
no no no no I'm I'm opting into the
future I know that you know my stuff's
gonna look good on great browsers so
please use great browsers there's one
little caveat here which is that this
does not validate people don't like that
I don't mind it
some people don't like it I might bring
some of the validator this is the the
new beta alpha beta validator at the w3c
it's pretty sweet so oops I'm gonna just
chuck it in here throw validate it's
gonna be like woo bad I hate you you're
no good it doesn't like X you a
compatible even though X to specify a
vendor level extension for a meta tag
it's kind of the blessed way but yet it
isn't conforming syntax so if there was
an error that error doesn't mean
anything browsers have no problem with
this whatsoever it's just the validator
doesn't like it so I think it's ok you
know it you can justify
it should be there it does a good job
and the validator doesn't like it but
who cares because browsers don't have a
problem the other thing though is that
this extubate compatible you can
actually send this as an HTTP header and
if you send it as a header you don't
need the meta and so boilerplate comes
with a sample HT access for Apache it
also has we have light httpd nginx iis
and one other one I think and here it is
if your IE send the headers do the exact
same thing and so if you're using this
you don't need to actually send the meta
tag and that takes care of your
validation problem if you really care
that's good to know the next thing I
want to go into is the meta car set
which is a weird weird beast okay so
this meta car set is a new short one and
it's great it's beautiful and you can
remember it you can just type it out
because I love it it's just like the
doctype right like the html5 doctype is
a short thing it's not this big long
hated it all right lovely so it's funny
because the doctype and the meta car
said are not really like they're not
exactly designed the way that a lot of a
lot of the html5 spec worked was just
standardizing what browsers already did
so it turns out like this is kind of
what they used to look like right whoops
they had this http-equiv content-type'
consum of a car set okay really weird
but it turned this is actually a an
improper way of specifying it like there
should be quotes and things like that
but it turns out that browsers already
were we're parsing this very very
loosely because the people leave off
quotes and things like that so really
all that they ended up looking for was
the meta here the car set and what the
car set is actually equal to and they
basically ignored everything between
there so what that means is that this is
all that's required to do that and this
works the exact same in all browsers
just like the doctype does that so it's
really just standardizing the fact that
browsers were already pretty flexible to
begin with and saying guys we don't
really need the rest of that we can just
like use this short thing so that's
pretty cool
there's one other really weird thing
about the car set sometimes you have
this happens a lot if if you're doing
facebook's fffb ml which requires to to
put some like weird like xml notice if
be equal I don't know it's really gross
and it all goes up there as an XML
namespace and your HTML and it's just it
blows things up and what happens then
you send it through the validator and
the validator then says the car set has
to be in the first 512 bytes of the
document and you're like what - why what
does that matter
it matters for ie and so sure you saw
that coming
so the Val so basically they put in the
spec the fact that ie has this weird bug
where it needs the car set in the first
512 because okay you tf7 weirdest
weirdest weirdest stuff excuse me
okay
you see this right here is a + ad -
script or whatever this is a script tag
in ut f7 so yeah it's really weird
why that's interesting is that it's
basically a cross site scripting vector
and so the reason why car set has to be
in the first 5 12 is because if I E
reads something like this in your HTML
and it hasn't already gotten a directive
about what the car set should be it's
going to assume the rest of the pages in
UT f7 and it's going to treat that like
a script tag
which means someone could have entered
something in the form that input now
goes into the title tag the title tag
then actually runs script and then you
have a cross-site scripting problem on
your hands but as long as the car set is
defined in first five twelve and it
doesn't find one of those you're all set
so not that you ever really need to know
these facts but that is why the
validator yells at you about the first
five twelve so anyways this has to be
defined up top near the top happy before
the title okay I mean is like really
really meta stuff okay
I'm gonna move on I'm gonna scroll down
the file quite a bit all right this is
pretty pretty pretty cool so this is the
the jQuery include here get that on one
line so we're grabbing jQuery off the
Google CDN and we're grabbing the
full-size one I like the full-size one
because I'd like to develop with the
uncompressed because if I'll get back an
error that like B dot a is undefined and
that really doesn't help me at all so I
I really like to have the full one but
you notice that the front I just have
double slash you're like ah the typo I
think you meant to have one of these I
know I didn't
so this is what's called I don't know I
called it this the a protocol relative
URL you can also call it a scheme las'
uri if you want to be really specific
and technical the protocol relative URL
the cool trick here is that with this
request it's going to request this in
the protocol that you're currently
viewing the page in right and so this is
like oh great because we've run into
this problem where in you in like a
checkout flow in an IE 6 you
accidentally referenced this file that's
on HTTP and you get this dialog that
pops up and you're like oh to secure non
secure and you're like oh where is it
gotta find it this solves that if you're
in HTTPS if you're in an SSL environment
it's
grab this using HTTP and it just works
and it works in every browser it's crazy
so we're going to do that when we
request jQuery because we want to get
the secure one when we're in a secure
environment and not when we're not and
then the second thing we're gonna do
right after that is we have a little
fall back here so I basically have if
jQuery is not there right after this
runs then there's a problem and we're
actually going to create we're gonna
write out our own jQuery and we have
this one defined locally here but we
prefer to use the CDN one because it's
probably gonna look faster so we just we
prefer that one this helps a lot not if
like Google goes down a CDN doesn't
really go down hope okay it has it has
like once it hasn't since then okay but
well in addition to the worst times in
your life if you're developing locally
or you're offline or something you're
not gonna get jQuery and so we're just
gonna use the local one so we can kind
of like have best of both worlds here
yes yeah better have this problem where
you're in a page yeah you have like a
full proper site and your home page is
short and then then you navigate to the
next page and it's a longer page and it
shifts to the left like 16 pixels you
probably your client realizes this and
they're like why is my page shifting a
little bit you're like well the size of
the page is growing and a scrollbar
appears on the right-hand side and the
scrollbar pushes everything over and
they're like I hate that and you're like
that's how scroll bars work you can deal
with it and they're like no you fix it
you're like so we have a fix for that
it's it's really just this easy
ie actually always has a disabled
scrollbar if it's short content so ie
doesn't have this from it's only been a
problem everywhere else
so HTML overflow I scroll that's it
some people do I am I've seen this one
before height equals 101 percent you
could but this does exactly what you're
asking it to do overflow why isn't
supported in ie6 and I don't know about
i7 but it doesn't matter because we
don't care about I because they already
do they're the right thing so anyways
that's taken care of the ie6 background
cache you remember like yeah background
images and they always like Flickr and
ie6 in your life I already give you the
file already how the file why are you
flickering and then you like you google
it and let's see background image of
course I know it I'm searching for it
and you go it has this really weird URL
well I can't find it now
it's a messy thing so anyways ah yes
eric has it here so anyways that is
taken care of for you as well it's
actually fixed in the DD belated pink
fix and my experience is the best pink
fix for i6 much better than the twin
helix pink fix HTC that is a lot more
popular ones bad bad it's really bad for
performance dd belated pink fix is much
much much better and so actually down at
the bottom of DD bladed ping yeah here's
some minified source code for you it's
right here try it's in a try-catch
document exact background anyways
ethics is it so thank you i 6 i really
enjoyed fixing all those bugs on your
behalf ok question for the audience yes
we're halfway through our ten things
eleven other and it's a few things
question for the audience
let's see raise your hand
if you use Chrome as your default
browser before developing because
because a lot of people like Firebug and
that's cool it's cool a lot of people
made the switch you write people with
your hands raised other people that
raise their hands
raise your hand again if you have been
using jQuery 1.4 point for the latest
major release of jQuery yes yes okay of
the people that just raised their hands
you please tell me the name of the
method of the canvas 2d context that you
use if you want to you have an image and
you want to put an image onto the canvas
what is the name of the method that you
use maybe you want to draw the image
what is the name of the method a what is
it
no no draw image who said that Oh
congratulations you just won a Japanese
AUSA so oh no no no sorry it's not
Japanese it's Chinese um Google Chrome a
little happy sleeve for your copy
machine if you could pass that back to
the man with the five five very well
very finely done oh I think it's so cool
I really I'm jealous all right okay
let's get back to some some real good
stuff
okay so there's a few more things that
are pretty pretty odd so in in the CSS
it's kind of starts off we have a reset
up top are our reset is it was based off
the original Eric Meyer reset reloaded
and then html5 doctor took that in kind
of html5 a sized it and so we took that
and we were used it for a while and then
we worked with those guys on fixing some
accessibility problems
with that the outline around the a tag
in particular now Eric Meyer has
released a new version of his and is
very much in tune with what we have here
so we're all kind of like agreeing now
which I'm very happy about so after that
reset we have some font normalization
stuff and this kind of stuff comes from
the ye y UI libraries fonts dot CSS
which does an amazing job of normals
normalizing font sizes like if you've
ever done like font size is 75% and then
you look in IE and then you look in
Firefox and they're totally different
this little guy fixes that and so we've
kind of made adjustments and originally
it was something like this Arial
Helvetica clean I believe that's for
Linux and when we first released the
boilerplate this was like a big problem
because what actually happens is people
on Macs might have Arial installed and
then I think at some point it was it was
kind of like this yeah I think I was
like this because Helvetica it looks
better than Arial of course right the
straight terminal isn't beautiful but PC
users have a Helvetica but it just
doesn't look good as Arial so you kind
of want Arial and PC but then you go on
Helvetica on Mac and and there's really
no way to like structure it and then
someone was like what if we just get rid
of those and just go with sans-serif and
we're like ah everyone gets like the
most good-looking sans-serif font on
their system and it turns out is exactly
what we all want
so that's anyways that's where you start
and yeah inside the style after a lot of
fixes for some some cross browser stuff
and the hot pink
oh yeah the hot pink you have to do - is
this a weird thing you have this Moz
selection and then you have the real
selection and you would think that you
wouldn't have to duplicate and you could
just do a comma here yeah it doesn't
work with pseudo
with vendor prefixed pseudo selectors
you can't select multiple of them and so
you actually have to duplicate the role
it's a big bummer just how it works it's
not a no it's I mean the spec is the
spec treats says that vendor prefix
server selectors basically if if they're
not recognized the user agent should
nullify the so the following spec it's
just really a pain for us to work around
so then we have some media queries and
then down here is some print styles and
so we have print styles in this sheet we
don't have a like an extra print style
sheet and that's a little different and
so the way that that works is is our the
the style sheet here is there's no media
attribute on this right
I'm not saying media equals screen and
when there's no media it basically
implies immediate equals all so this
will go to screen projection print and
TV Google TV yeah yes
ah and so that's usually pretty good and
then you're like media print I mean that
looks kind of fancy does that work
everywhere and it does this it's not it
it's not actually a media query
technically but this works in ia6 so we
can just define this and one reason why
this is really useful is because print
style sheets like let's say I had one
defined up here you would think that
it's a print style sheet and therefore
it should be downloaded when you want to
print something does that make sense no
a print style sheet is downloaded the
second that the browser reads this
little bit right here and it reads that
it's like oh I'm gonna grab that in case
like you know the my new chance that
someone's actually gonna print this page
who prints stupid
so anyways so if they're going to
download anyway and it's going to be an
HTTP roundtrip
in lining that inside the file is
actually going to be a lot faster than
causing another HTTP call so it just
goes in here with the media print it
works everywhere and users get the con
to the content of their page faster so
it's kind of optimized for speed right
there also in style we have a few helper
classes which just kind of emerged as
you know common things that we all kind
of end up doing one for image
replacement you know you have like a
little your customize button and you're
gonna have a background image come in
but semantically it's beautiful and that
we got to like throw the text indent way
over to the side so that we don't see
that text and we only see the background
image so that's what this does has a
little fixing here if you've done this
like so the text indent approach is
pretty popular text indent negative
stuff actually becomes a problem in a
right-to-left layout instead of going
way to the left it actually goes to the
right and then it causes a scrollbar so
that's bad so anyways if forces left to
right direction on that to get around
that edge case things like hidden just
like hides it from screen readers from
users visually hidden which keeps it
available for screen readers this is
nice to have this like who wants to
actually test one of these for
themselves but this has been tested on
all major screen readers and it works
invisible is just a shorthand for
visibly hidden and the clear fix who who
uses a clear fix class to clear their
floats who uses overflow:hidden or auto
to clear their floats who uses like a br
br clear all or a div class clear
afterwards yes okay people have
different opinions on clear fixes they
do different things and my experience
this is the best way and also the most
popular one uses a period
and it was found that that actually
causes extra space and the bottom margin
of the page and someone once found that
we can actually use this escape to
unicode which i think is some sort of
whitespace character and it gets around
that bun so there's that yeah i'm gonna
show one quick thing and then we're
gonna get into some other stuff we have
a viewport at the meta viewport so the
meta viewport is for mobile devices on
iOS and Android Palm Pre the Windows
Phone they all read the viewport so
basically what we say here is that we
want
if someone rotates their phone we kind
of want the sides to be the same size
when they rotate it which i think is
probably the way that you want to treat
your users we also don't we say that
they can zoom in they can pinch and zoom
out if they want so it's pretty flexible
and then of course inside the the styles
we have media queries where you can
target your mobile devices and say yeah
I'm gonna kill that third column on a
squish everything down so the
boilerplate kind of has some things that
would make your normal site flexible it
like gives you some some hooks to to
customize it for mobile and but it's you
know in general it's for for desktop
sites that you know you might just tweak
a little bit so there's some control
here and viewports a really interesting
one and there hasn't been a lot of
research on like what's the best thing
and so we've kind of developed that with
with a lot of trial and error and
talking to two mobile experts and I was
really happy because this just happened
this was like yesterday or no and this
was last week just last week we a
researcher at Yahoo was actually digging
into it and basically his findings
validated the viewport settings that we
have here so I'm pretty pretty happy
with the way
that we treat the mobile experience all
right so I showed I don't know eight
things in there in addition to those
eight things there's a lot more going on
in the Styles too you know normalize how
a label goes next to the the radio
button and you want them to be kind of
like lined up and look the consistent
across all browsers we have a fix for
them or like you always want the the
cursor hand on a clickable button or a
label if it's going to click the
checkbox associated with and so that's
in there and we want text wrapping on
pre tag so your code example doesn't
cause a huge enormous scrollbar and
instead you kind of all see it so
there's a lot in there and all in
addition to walking through the source
which you can do because there's plenty
of comments and references if you go to
the site and just click on read the docs
you end up in the wiki where there's
walkthroughs of the markup the style and
some of the other aspects and then kind
of dig into things see some of the
rationale for some of the choices in
case something is just like a WTF to you
you can figure out what's going on all
right I want to show a few things that
people often shy away from and those are
the htaccess so like I said it comes
with an Apache config so Apache is is
the most popular and and so that's what
we ship but we have a bunch of others
over in this repo so this is actually
just great just to like kind of pick up
some best practices on ways to optimize
your site for performance and get the
syntax to just chuck in to what you got
going but we do some nice things in here
specifically around performance oh man
if you've ever done web fonts and and
your web fonts you have your fonts or
your CSS on a subdomain maybe it's like
a cookie list a toad
static domain because your
really smart but then like all of a
sudden they don't load and Firefox or ie
9 any like wants their work everywhere
else yeah so you need to like set this
access control origin header on that
thing so that the browser oh my god it's
such anyways that's just sitting there
and then we set up some mime types
that's good
yes gzip a bunch of good quality gzip
and this was really good
if you've read Steve Souders I think it
was even a faster website it's the
second one they talked about turbo
Stoppers which is like antivirus and
other programs that actually modify the
accept-encoding header that gets sent
out in their quest header and it
basically tricks the web server is like
oh that does not look like an exception
coding here you probably can't accept
gzip but they can and so some guys at
Yahoo did some really good research
around this and found a nice way to
detect when that's happening when that
header is being mangled and then say oh
we know that you can't actually accept
gzip even though you're trying to lie
about it and so what we're gonna force
it so you can target this effects like
like I think they said like 20 I'm sorry
not 20 like 10 to 15 percent of users so
it's actually pretty quite significant
and then we have our expires headers to
make sure that this stays this stuff C
is cached locally and then a few more
but like since this is not shipped to
the client we can afford to you know be
pretty verbose in our comments so it's
definitely a good good walk through to
kind of learn some tricks for serving
and it really optimized way who would
call themselves if you had to title
yourself you would title yourself a
JavaScript developer and if you're a
JavaScript developer you've heard that
unit testing is good and you should unit
test and you just haven't got around to
it yeah
I'll do it it's best practice so we made
that a little bit easier and harder for
you to make up excuses so bundled along
with the boilerplate is open what open
test yeah
q unit q unit is the test suite from
that ships is jQuery and so it comes
with the boilerplate and it already has
the script files already associated with
this so you have no excuses the files
are waiting for you to just jump into
test dot J s and start writing unit
tests and you'll be good so yeah I I
mean I put this in because I need the
kick in the butt really yeah
and then the build script the build
script is probably one of my most my my
favorite parts about the html5
boilerplate the build script is is based
on ant and we chose ant because it has
wide support on Windows I means Java
based so it's Windows Linux and Mac so
does a few things if you read a Steve
Souders book you know that these are
things that you should be doing and you
hope you're doing them combines
administer pies javascript combines and
minify CSS it optimizes your pings your
JPEGs it removes console logs that you
forgot to remove yourself removes the
test suite we don't need people to see
that you can minify your HTML even from
a little bit to a bunch and then if
you've seen you put like expired headers
in your in your config but then you have
your stylesheet and so you actually have
to end up doing something like this
where you're like sheets CSS and then
you like do it the cache bus technique
and
I updated it and then update it again
just like forces to get the new one
turns out that this is not best practice
and it actually hampers the ability for
proxies like squid proxy to correctly
cash that at a proxy level so the much
more preferred way is to put your
gobbledygook right here in the file name
and not as a query string and so the
build script does that so every time you
build it increments so you can go out
guns blazing with heavy heavy expires
headers because you have control over
the file file name and then you know
updates your HTML to have all these
references to these things and then
switches HTML to use that mattified
jQuery because I like to develop with
the uncompressed one right so it does
all that for you in about 10 seconds
it's great and so I'm going to know do
that in 10 seconds
okay well more than 10 seconds tabs to
close we're gonna use a site I made a
little bit ago mother-effing HSL oh yeah
this is good ah HSL colors so I think HS
all kind of gets slighted a little bit
we all I grew up with hex colors and so
we kind of gravitate towards RGB because
I mean now we have the Alpha Channel but
like picking orange out of art with RGB
really hard I don't know how to like
combine red and green and blue to get
orange but HSL is really really really
easy to just pick colors out of thin air
so anyways I made this site to make it
easier here's the hue the saturation
goes from there to there and then we
have lightness and alpha down here so
anyway so we can get like a ooh that's
nice and then go now I'm like yeah and
then
okay good mother-effing HSL it's so easy
anyways so what I want to do is use the
build script onto this and kind of see
what we get out of it I'm going to load
up Firefox to do a little bit of
benchmarking here so this I mean it's a
few weeks ago it's a boiler plate site
you can see that the conditional
comments my comment talking about it
some good stuff down here we're using
them yep nope which is a conditional
script loader so this is pretty cool
see these sliders down here we're just
using input type range html5 input type
to get this nice slider but you know
Firefox doesn't support it just kind of
a downer upper notes Opera House forever
so what we do is we're gonna use the up
note we're gonna use modernizr to say
hey moderniser does this browser support
input types range if it doesn't nope dan
we're going to load these files we're
going to load in a slider so as a result
yeah as a result we got these
javascript-based sliders that do the
exact same thing and we only had to load
that code for the the browser that
didn't support it and so WebKit and
opera never needed to load that code
we're just covered it pretty nice all
right so what I'm gonna do is we're
gonna use the build tool on this site
because it's probably it's probably not
too optimized
I don't know I want to run yslow on and
see what we go be overall performance
score is eighty all right there's a
pretty minimal page page speed 78 out of
100 yeah lots are red
not too good all right see I'm gonna
take the builds folder from that guy go
over here here's our HSL site just
dropped in the build folder there I'm
gonna do all right here we go it's
pretty good a few updates to make here
yeah yep nope it was pretty sweet but
there's a brand new way to do yep note
and that is with the moderniser custom
build maker boom boom boom this is this
was released like this week I believe so
you can create a custom built to
modernize you don't like wanna test for
all these things you just want to test
for these five things you can do that so
here I just actually want to test for
input types and so I'm going to do that
guy and I want and I can actually have
yep no bundled into it and available as
moderniser download boom generate yes
awesome here's the code here it is
minified already for me
and click this download build button and
I get it right here this all runs
client-side by the way pretty sweet
alright so now I have it downloaded I'm
gonna open that up here it is
yes now I'm going to take that and
replace the old modernizer so old a new
one new hotness all right now back in
the markup
here's our reference to the moderniser
looks good
we don't need yep nope anymore and I'm
gonna get fancy and use our new
moderniser dot load basically we merged
all right
my syntax highlighting is a little off
not my fault alright that looks good
okay yeah I think that's that's probably
working so I'm gonna go into yeah we can
see that let's go into builds CD builds
what's going on here uh-huh
okay yeah that's fine ant build you know
what ant minify I'm gonna go straight in
the only difference between those is
that we're going to minify javascript or
we're gonna we had a few images in there
that were compressing that's what all
that stuff is we commented it out any
console that logs yeah that looks good
and as a results this little folder
publish was created so this guy has the
you built version see if that yeah okay
I think that's good
now cyberduck I don't I honestly I
haven't learned a cooler way to upload
via SFTP than cyberduck might look a
little noobish apologize okay
so we have our published version and i'm
going to chuck it up on the domain yeah
open boom delete all that yeah
all right so it's deleting all right I
sorry it's uploading um so it's pretty
alright I'm just gonna hope that it
works yeah okay so we have a page speed
of 78 this is a yslow of 80 nasty and
yes okay we got our sliders loaded they
loaded dynamically via via yep nope I'm
gonna open up yslow run that 84 it's
okay
what that's not at all true
oh I know I know I know okay okay I feel
okay I forgot the most important part
which is the HD access this is I didn't
upload it cuz like course like I drag it
from finder and finder doesn't show dot
files and I'm a noob clearly okay it's
fine it's fine I'm gonna go over here to
get hub and grab the HD access and grab
the raw get this guy and then what's up
mother afine HS so what is it W get yeah
oh you're kidding me so remember when
github switched to SSL for everything
and everyone's like oh no it's great
github is SSO and that it's like the
first SSL all only SSL site and it's so
cool except for when you're trying to W
get stuff off of it
oh let's do this again I'm unsatisfied
run it again score of 92 PageSpeed
refresh score of 89
what I minified that's crazy view source
we got minified everything looking good
I got a minified then
you know that's what I get for using the
development version anyways this is a
kind of what we're aiming at is that
we've kind of learned all these best
practices of like performance and it
should be easy to do it and so comboing
the build script which is still in beta
and the Apache config or the other
webserver configs we can kind of get to
the destination the performance
destination that we want in a really
reasonable way so how how do you as a
user use the boilerplate should be
pretty obvious by now but there's one
thing to consider which is we offer a
stripped version and the stripped
version is essentially just has all the
comments removed and so it looks a
little cleaner it feels better so if
you're familiar with the pieces feel
free to download the stripped diversion
if you want you could just grab pieces
out of it
and it's fine like I think it can be
treated as kind of a collection of good
practices that you can copy/paste out if
you just want the hot pink eye
understands you can use that can use it
with a CMS yeah and a lot of people have
a lot of people have already integrated
it into things like nodejs has a really
nice set up with node express and socket
IO and then boilerplate there's Grails
there's a bunch of WordPress action
Django templates and then a bunch of
other CMS's that you can kind of like
absorb all of the the pieces of
boilerplate but already in a and a stack
waiting for CMS integration the other
thing that people sometimes ask is about
upgrading like I've already done I've
done a version but you just put out a
new one what do I do like is there a way
to upgrade it's not really that
important there's never been there's no
like critical bugs that we fixed
so it's really not a big deal if the new
version comes out you're not probably
not gonna be missing out on anything
huge the the Apache config and the build
scripts might be a lot better and it
would be worth checking those out and
those are like the HDX is pretty drop-in
it's kind of designed to be a drop-in
thing and not break any stuff and I want
to give if you do mobile development
we've started a I mean it's started a
few months ago a mobile html5
boilerplate and this is designed
specifically for mobile web apps like
this is not going to be viewed on a
desktop browser and so it's a bit more
aggressive as far as some of its
approaches to be mobile specific so
there's a big summary of all the things
that it does here it's designed to be
extremely device friendly and so it's
not just your edge mobile web kits and
there's a lot of really good stuff
inside inside the docs on that one so if
you're specializing in mobile I
definitely recommend to check that out
I'll be doing a proper release of it
soon but right now it's just the github
repo I would love to get any any and on
in involvement in the development it all
takes place on on github so the the
easiest thing that you can do is just
come over to the page and hit the watch
button kind of get a sense of what's
going on when issues your reporter you
can check it out we use the issue
tracker to kind of like is the humans
text a good idea ya know people liked it
so we put it in this is good I'd love to
get your feedback on that we also have a
mailing list that's on Google Groups
that you can join in right here and we
kind of toss around ideas we had a
really nice discussion recently about is
it too big and decided that it's not too
big but some people like other stuff and
so we're actually some community members
have already created a builder like you
want to uncheck that you don't you don't
want the Google Analytics and you don't
want jQuery and we can make a script for
that and we we're going to be putting
that out soon my mailing list is really
good
I definitely love any pull requests if
you have any ideas for what should go in
here I'm totally open to to talking
about like what should actually go in
here because I want this to be you know
a good collection of best practices that
everyone can make their sites better and
faster together so I'm totally into that
I guess that's it
I'd love to take any questions now if
you have any where is the mobile html5
boilerplate let's try searching mobile
nope yes
what github knows me the developers name
he's a Singapore develop Singaporean
developer his name is Chi Chuan and so
it's under his repo shi C hua N and I'm
really really excited about this project
so we're gonna be doing a proper release
of it soon it does not use jQuery Mobile
but it's very very friendly to jQuery
Mobile if you want to use it for browser
support the plan with html5 boilerplate
is that the critical the important stuff
is going to work in ie6 it's gonna work
in i7 8 and everywhere else and so we're
not going to add things like there was a
recommendation a little bit ago around
some style and someone in and it what it
required is basically like an attribute
selector I don't know if it was an input
type equals password I don't know but
like the fixed was to normalize things
across browsers and like an attribute
selectors not going to work in ie6 and
we're like this project is designed to
be consistent everywhere so that didn't
make it in
I plan on on making sure that that
everything goes in here works well in
ie6 going forward for a while because
I'm fine with it
but I don't have problem with other
people changing we have a few ways to
basically test to make sure that we're
doing things ok
and we have this little demo folder the
demo folder first this file just has a
bunch of HTML in it like every single
tag available and we can kind of just
see all these tags and how they line up
across browsers and see that it actually
looks consistent and then we also have
this test file we've kind of created
like unit tests for the browsers so this
is the the pre wrapping that I talked
about before to wrap things inside of a
pre tag so we can toggle on and off the
boilerplate CSS and see what happens and
and the the scroll bar that shows up by
default in text areas in IE we can make
sure that that it's still doing the good
job so we're kind of using this and
going back and forth with it to make
sure that as we augment and as we grow
the library or the framework or it's not
a framework it's just a bunch of files
that we're still staying true to our the
the browser support that we want to be
targeting cool okay well thank you guys
very much and if you have any questions
afterwards please come on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
