partners of a new Scala partnership
called underscore I really wish that it
had been actually me that thought of
that name because I think it's brilliant
apart from being a kind of a scarlet pun
okay so what I'm going to do today is
I'm going to I'm going to talk about
shapeless quick outline we're gonna talk
about a tiny tiny teensy mute a bit of
history then I'm gonna talk and
basically the history is going to just
set the scene for why why I started
working on on on shapeless and the
initial motivating problem that I had
and I'm going to work us through that
and hopefully I'll give you a flavor if
I can do it in half an hour of of
exactly what kind of techniques were
involved in actually getting something
really that almost seems like it
shouldn't be possible to be possible and
that's that's that's the aim for the aim
for my talk this morning so initial goal
was to do something with an ageless so
we start off with what was an H list
then I'm going to talk about the kinds
of things we're going to need to do with
them for which we will need something
called polymorphic function values and
then I'm going to talk a little bit
about type level functions which are
going to crop up as part of as part of
what we're going to be trying to do then
I'm going to show you something to do
with the way in which kind of operations
on H lists are going to involve a kind
of type and value level recursion
operating in tandem which is going to be
kind of enough fun and interesting sort
of general technique and then I'm going
to put the pieces together and finally
show you the the really cool thing that
I'm going to show you at the end okay
and then if anybody incidentally and
it's just wants to crap that's too fast
I know
I know I know and okay if anyone's crap
Freddie wants just just grab the code of
github while we're looking at it if you
want to if you if you want if you want
if you want the source world work that's
it kind of play along then please do
credit okay so let's go
so some history so I started off about a
year ago I volunteered to do a talk at I
need a mic I started off about a year
ago I volunteered to do it to do a talk
at sort of a little sort of one-day mini
functional programming conference in
London called functional programming the
exchange and I kind of put up a sort of
a floated an idea for it for it talked I
was going to do I'm going to take some
paint and Jones and roughly Mel's scrap
your boiler plates with class stuff in
Haskell and I'm going to show that you
can do it in Haskell in Scala
and and I put up the talk without
actually having worked out how the hell
I was going to do it and so I left
myself with a couple of weeks to try and
work out is it even possible it turned
out that it was but in the process of
doing it I kind of discovered that there
were there are lots and lots of
interesting little wrinkles and lots of
really quite exciting new techniques
which really could do with a bit of
generalization one of them that cropped
up was in the process of doing this so
scrap your boiler plate is is basically
it's a way of eliminating a loss of the
the repetitive boiler plate type code
involved in doing traversals across
Composite nest of data structures this
these problems which which correct show
up that you know they're not unique to
to to imperative languages that they're
things which are shared by by functional
programming languages interests in ear
in languages like Haskell which have
very very rich type systems there are
things that you can do about them and
the scrap your boilerplate series of
papers is something which explains that
kind of stuff so in the process so so if
you're if what you're doing is you're
traversing a data structure obviously
you want to do something with the
elements of the data structure as you
traverse them you might want to compute
some single running value you might want
to effectively fold over your composite
data structure or you might want to
transform the data structure in one way
or another now either way if your data
structure
elements are of different types then you
need to be able to express the idea of I
want to chase this function which is
able to consume values of different
types and produce some other some some
result value of some type which is maybe
the same type as the type I started with
or maybe it's some other type but
whatever it whatever it is I need to
have a function value which is
applicable at multiple argument types
and it turns out that this isn't
particularly easy to express in Scala
there another a number of ways of sort
of approximating it but it turns out to
do things in in in in in the full
generality required to implement scrap
your boilerplate you need to do
something quite a bit more sophisticated
so that was that was the first kind of
sidetrack I went down the next one was I
just discovered in the process of
working on some of this stuff but a lot
of the techniques I ended up using
looked like they're mapped very very
directly onto something called
functional dependencies which you find
in it's it's a glasgow haskell compiler
extension i think it's a GHC extension
it is right to to standard haskell which
basically allows you to express at the
level of at the level of type
constraints for type classes essentially
the idea of functional relationships
between types so you can express the
idea that to two or more types have
stand in a particular kind of relation
you can do this in a way which is is
verifiable by the compiler at compile
time in the process of doing that I I
think I got a slightly deeper
understanding of how we can use some of
these techniques in in Scala so pulling
all of these things together that that
was that was pretty much what what led
what led to shapeless and I've been kind
of exploring that kind of stuff ever
since so the initiative the main goal is
is a place as a library is as an
experiment to explore models of
abstraction over data types which are
richer than the ones that you would
typically expect to be able to capture
by traditional oo subtyping or
traditional F
parametric polymorphism and that's even
when we're talking about parametric
polymer polymorphism with with with
higher kind of types involved so
something of the order of scrap your
boilerplate that that kind of that kind
of sophistication is what I'm planning
to exploit as things have moved on I'm
kind of finding myself cranking on more
and more of Scala's dependent types
facilities and these these are kind of
cropping up in the implementation
initially I thought there was sort of
kind of implementation details there are
kind of like sort of conveniences which
which which would just helping they get
helping me get get get the job done in
practice I'm actually beginning to think
that that maybe maybe exploring the
dependent types is more of is more of a
point but it's anyway it's getting to be
very interesting stuff so the initial
objective that I had with shapeless
though was simply to put together
something which it's hopefully not
relatively simple is is is an H list and
H lists a heterogeneous list which
supports a map operation and this is
this is something that I at least in
Scala hadn't been hadn't been done
before it's very closely related to
describe your boiler plate so it's kind
of a special case of that but I wanted
to do it in a way which was really
really very clean and simple and
understandable and in a way that would
sort of shed some light on the kind of
techniques involved so that's that's
that's the context for what we're
talking about
so first up what's an H list so H lists
they combine characteristics of both
lists and tuples so tuples are fixed
length sequences of elements of distinct
types once you once you fix the arity of
a tuple you're stuck with it on the
other hand each each element of a tuple
can be of a different type on the other
hand lists are variable length sequences
of elements but all of the elements have
to have the same type so there's an
interesting kind of like sort of duality
between between these two two types
obviously when I say variable there I
mean it's not really variable that we're
talking about variable in the sense of
we're talking about immutable data
structures so so it's in the sense of
the type is capable of the the list type
is capable of being inhabited by list
values of diff
from different lengths is what I'm
trying to capture with that but if
anyone knows a good good word for that
then I'd like to know so anyway H lists
are a hybrid of those two in a sense in
as much as they they capture variable
length sequences of elements each of
which can be of distinct types and this
is something which the compiler will
track for us and let's have a quick look
so I'm just going to show you on the
repple what an H list looks like so we
can
ah
right sorry
that's yes that one probably okay thank
you oh cool I actually didn't know that
you could do that that's that's good
that's that's really helpful okay so
this is an H list with three elements
the elements are initially an integer
then a string and a boolean and H nil to
kind of terminate a list and if you look
at the the signature that the the the
record has come back with you can see
that the that the type of that value
that value L is is reflecting the types
of every single element in in in the age
list now if on the other hand we were to
do that with a vanilla list let's call
it V and just do this so the same
essentially the same initializer this
time terminated with nil rather than H
nil you'll see that well we get back a
list it contains all the values but
you'll notice that the the the type
parameter of our list type has been
unified to to to to to the the greatest
common super type of the three elements
in there so basically we've completely
lost precision we no longer have any any
idea at least no the compiler no longer
has any idea and the interesting idea
about what the types of the individual
elements are and just to sort of
illustrate that the compiler really is
keeping track of what these types are if
we were to take that original list and
then do take it ahead you can see that
the compiler knows that the type of the
head is an int if we were to do tail
ahead it knows that the type of the
second element is a string so the
compiler is keeping track of all the
types it's able to track types through
through various operations applied to it
so so that's an H list any any quick
questions about that I mean this is so
far this is nothing particularly novel
this is
is all funny hopefully who's seen an H
less like this before
most people okay any questions or should
I just skip on a skip on right and okay
so now one of the things that you can
you can you can very fairly fairly
obviously do with with an ordinary for
know that list is you can you can map
over it
so let's just just say something silly
like just string
and I'll get back now a list of strings
now it's not so obvious how you go about
doing that with a with with an exit okay
actually in the case of in the case of
the two string method actually about
that
you might think that should work just
fine but in general if I were to take a
function which I can map across a list
it's not obvious how you're going to map
across an H list because obviously each
of the elements in the H list is of a
different type so unless your function
has an argument type of type any you've
got no guarantee in general that you're
going to be able to do anything with it
and so one of the things that that it's
interesting to look at and it's a fairly
natural thing to ask is can can we
generalize the idea of function to allow
us to generalize the idea of map in a
way that allows it to be applied to an H
list
now one of the things that dropped out
if this actually turns out to be a
special case of the Haskell scrappy
boilerplate stuff and so I knew because
I'd already implement this crap people
to pay it must be possible to do this
somehow so the real question was can I
can I work out a nice reasonably
convenient way to do that and so it's
the first piece of the picture kind of
getting us getting us to our to our to
our mapping function so I think so one
of the one of the natural things that
you no pun intended you might look at is
something which has been it's been
reasonably well known it's been around
for quite some time the idea of a
natural and natural transformation so
the reason the reason that that scholars
function values are monomorphic rather
than polymorphic is is that they don't
actually have a type parameter on their
apply method there's no room for the
type parameter associated with with with
with a function value is associated with
the whole the whole function value
itself rather than rather than
rather than its supply method and that
means that it is it's essentially you've
you you used up your polymorphism in the
definition of a function value kind of
too early you sort of want to defer it
until the point at which the function is
actually actually applied now there's
one fairly common approach to kind of
sort of relaxing some of that some of
the some of that restriction somewhat is
to define a form of I don't actually
have an example here but a form of let's
see if I can just quickly do one so it
would be something like sorry so this is
this is going to be a function one like
trait
so so it's basically it's a very similar
shape to to to a function one except
what we've done is we've added a type
parameter to the apply method and we've
also at the at the sort of the enclosing
sort of whole whole function or value
level we've added a pair of type
constructors and what what this this
values of this type can do is they can
in a function like way they can take
values of type ft on to values of type
GT where the T part it's it is if you
like it's variable it's it's deferred
until until you actually apply the
function like value but the F and G
parts are kind of fixed okay so and
that's that's that's something you'll
find that in if you look at the mark
Hara and and RunAs apocalypse blog
there's a very nice article on doing
this kind of stuff you'll fight you'll
find this kind of function like thing in
Scala said somewhere I think I seem you
must do but there are some problems for
and actually you taking that approach in
a sort of fully general form with with
with HLS I mean the real problem is that
for that to work every element of your H
list has to share a common outer type
constructor the F part has to be fixed
and there are there are many cases where
that's just fine and there is a special
case of a kind of ageless type structure
called Kahless I think I think mark
called them in the Apocalypse blog I
think something similar to that has but
just be recently been imported to the
scholar said seven branch I think it's
called a TC list for type constructor
list in scarlet said seven and it's fine
and if that's if that's if that's kind
of what what you need in a particular in
a particular circumstance then then that
works perfectly well and but it's not
going to be something that can map you
allow you to map over a completely
arbitrary sequence of values over a
completely arbitrary sequence of types
because because you don't have any nests
and any guarantee that that those types
will share a common outer type
constructor and similarly you you might
not
I really want to have to be restricted
to having a common outer type
constructor for the result type I that
you might want more flexibility and
obviously applications are going to help
but anyway the scrap your boilerplate
stuff in terms of implementation
techniques is going to give us a bit of
a clue
so the key innovation that some Simon
paint and Jones from Ralph lamelle came
up with was the idea of representing
polymorphic function values via type
classes so basically what a type class
is going to do is it's going to give you
a general a general signature a general
shape and allow you to provide instances
on a per type basis which provide
implementations corresponding to those
to those different corresponding to
those different types and if you think
about it if I'm trying to apply if I'm
if I want a generic function which what
I want to do is apply to each of a
number of different element types it
makes sense to think of the generic
function as being like a type class and
the definitions of that function at the
various different types are one to apply
it to as being equivalent to a type
class instances for for that generic
type class and that that was that was
kind of a key insight that gave them the
scrappy boilerplate with class
implementation and so what I have done
is bring that back into Scala and do it
in a way which kind of gives it a
relatively Scala esque
kind of function like feel and I think
at this point I need to show you
something so
so
so I'll just show you some examples of
kind of definitions of functions added
let's just get to find something sort of
nice and simple to start with okay
so anyone who has read the the
apocalypse Mark Harris article will
probably find this kind of syntax come
fairly fairly familiar looking it looks
it looks very similar to what you'll
have seen before but actually the
implementation is a thoroughly different
so this is representing a polymorphic
identity function so this is a case
where okay so here's so this is this is
a polymorphic choose function what the
choose function is going to do it's
going to take an arbitrary set onto an
option at the same type and basically
definition is it from a set of T it'll
give you an option of T so if there's if
the set has an element it will give you
it back otherwise it'll give you back
nothing none now this is this is a
function which falls into the natural
transformation model that we saw so
that's that is consistent with the the
natural transformation traits that I
showed you before but in this framework
we can do some other things as well and
here's another example which is maybe a
little bit more interesting so here is
an example of a polymorphic function
value of two argument types and what's
going on here is that we are defining it
by cases so we have a collection of
cases for here we have plus defined over
integers so we're taking two integer
arguments our type our result type is
going to be inferred to be an int we can
define plus four four
for for doubles for Strings for lists in
terms of additional doubles a dish
concatenation of strings and
concatenation on lists so this is this
is a polymorphic function value which
can be applied to values of any of those
types and it will give you back results
of the appropriate type this is actually
a little bit more complicated than I
really need to show you in a sense
because because obviously it's a
function of two arguments whereas for
actually mapping over over an H list we
only really need one argument but it's
kind of a reasonably good reason so
let's let's just see that doing
something if possible import so I can
use that
that plus method on a now that's an
interesting type signature and so that's
demonstrate is actually an int whoops
but we'll come back to what exactly that
type signature means shortly okay so we
can and we can add integers we can have
doubles we can add strings and and we
get back all of the right results of the
right types and again if I just verify
that I can do
okay so so that's things which look like
things which look like functions but
which are and they are values so they
are values they can be passed as values
to higher-order functions and this is
going to be what's going to allow us to
actually perform IMAP but we still need
another another bit of the picture
because if we go back to our age list
that we had before so let's go one yes
right so suppose I have a finite suppose
I'm trying to map something over over
over that H list let's suppose I'm
trying to map a function which is going
to do a generic sort of size computation
on the values so from perhaps we could
define it to the size of an integer is
the integer itself the size of the
strings that length is its length maybe
the size of true is one maybe the size
of a list is one now in that case we map
that function across that H list we are
going to get back we'll get back an H
list again but it's going to be an H
list whose type is completely different
from the one we start with it's not
going to be an H list of int string and
boolean it's going to be in that case of
an H list of of int int + int so how do
we know how do we write the signatures
how do we write the signatures of the
methods we're trying to define on an H
list and so there's another bit of the
picture involved here and this maybe
hopefully reminds you of some stuff I
was talking about functional
dependencies at the outset so let's
let's take a look at a simple ish kind
of example of a way in which we can kind
of we can use the type system to compute
a result type for a method is
essentially what's going on here so
let's have a look at the
so the last method on an H list is let's
just show you what it does so so I'll
last right so L last it's gonna give you
the last element and this just just as
you'd expect you to do an ordinary list
but it's somehow our other gotta work
out what the right type is for that for
that result value to be so it's got to
have somehow or other at the type level
have traversed the type to compute that
the result type of the last method is
actually boolean okay so let's see how
does that work then so here is the
here's the definition of the last method
that so this is on the on the H list
class it's not very much there it's that
it's kind of interesting so what's going
on here so yeah and it has an argument
which is interesting because because the
the last method that I just typed well
the last the the method sorry the
argument for the last method is its is
an implicit so what's going on here so L
here is actually the type of the whole
behold traits that were actually in the
moment so L is effectively the type of
this so what happens then is if I invoke
last on on a list of type L I'm asking
for an implicit value of type last and
I'm going to give back a result of the
type oh well this is kind of interesting
isn't it it's a dependent type it's a
type which has been essentially computed
in the process of resolving the implicit
which we're going to use to actually
compute the last value so I'm going to
come back to this so there's a
parallelism going along here in terms of
at the value and the type level which
I'm going to come back to in a moment
but I'll just mention it now and just
let me move on so let's actually have a
look at the implementation
so so here as eras are our last type
class so it's a it's a trait it has a
type parameter which is an H so this is
this is this is the valid the type that
we're operating on we have an abstract
type out so this is the the type that
we're going to be producing and and then
it had to find an apply methods that
this is just how we're going to make it
work which takes the value of h LS type
in and we give back a value of type out
okay so now for various reasons to do
with some slight limitations in the way
that dependent types and implicit values
can interact in parameter lists we're
actually not going to work directly with
this we're going to work with a slightly
tweaked version which is what at what
i've done here is i've taken the thing
which was previously a type member and
I've sort of turned it into a to an
additional type parameter in terms of
the the interface we soar above we don't
need to work with this but in terms of
actually understanding with other
mechanics it actually makes more sense
to think in terms of this this auxiliary
type and here again it's exactly the
same kind of process we hope this is our
this is our actual type class the the
tricky thing here is that when you
express it in this form it kind of feels
like all I have to know what the answer
is before I can actually start asking
the question whereas in this form
because I'm eventually then going to be
referring to a member type of this value
it kind of feels right I know what L is
I don't know what out is yet so that
kind of feels sensible but we can we
kind of assume that the scholar compiler
is going to is going to square things up
for us and we'll see in any moment that
it it will do okay so with this this
kind of slightly tweaked form of the of
the the type class we can we can proceed
really very very simply we basically got
two cases to continue to consider we've
got the case of where we are asking for
the last element of a single element age
list so what we need to do is provide a
type class instance for that so for any
type H if we're looking for the last
instance for H :
H nil we're going to get back an H as
our result type and the implementation
of the apply method is trivial it's just
it's just ahead of that one element list
that's just fine so that's our base case
for a recursion and again kind of like
you to notice we've got some sort of
parallelism is going on here between
between we're kind of recursing down the
type and we're kind of recursing down
the values in tandem so that's that's
something to look at now this is this is
the main recursion step so we've got a
an H list of so we're trying to compute
the last type class for an H list of
type th : : T so this is a head and a
tail of an H list H is an arbitrary type
T is some other age list to do that we
need to have the type class instance for
the tail and but once we've got that
then it's trivial to compute because we
just throw away the head and we return
the the type class instead the result of
applying tail to that's a bit of the
remainder of the list so again what
we're doing is we are recursing at the
type level and in tandem we're cursing
at the value level and that's going to
give us our result and the net result
okay so this is the magic of scarlet
implicit resolution it's gonna is gonna
make sure all of this stuff works out in
terms of what I did with that magic
member type in fact I can just I can
just use a another implicit to convert
the the orcs the auxiliary instances
into the ones with the sort of the
embedded the embedded abstract type so
this is just another abstract I sorry
another implicit definition which given
a last orcs instance will give me my
last instance the one with the embedded
being one with the embedded member type
so that's the mechanism for using
implicit and dependent types for
computing type level functions okay is
it is it clear to everyone that that was
actually a tight level computation going
on there cashed out in terms of
dependent types and implicit I I'm
getting nods nods of heads which is good
who's it has anyone seen that kind of
trick before but in Scala
No okay cool that's good
okay so I've kind of covered most of
this we've got type level recursion
competing result type fairly level
recursion computing result let me do
them together let's not do that now we
can do that over the weekend or later if
anyone's interested so let's put the
pieces together and so we're going to
have a tight level recursion to do a map
the tide level will confirm recursion
will compute the result type for us and
but it'll do something else as well so
you remember we saw those type specific
cases for polymorphic function value so
what I mean I didn't quite show you
enough of the details of how the the
cases themselves are actually captured
effectively as type classes too but if
you think about the way in which that
recursion pulled out a type class
instance for the tail what we're also
going to do is at the same time we're
going to pull out a polymorphic function
value instance for the head and so
basically you can think of the
polymorphic function values as being as
sort of collections of type indexed
implementations of of the function value
and we can we can do that at the same
time and I'm actually going to show you
the code rather than show it running but
because possibly at this point the code
is more is more illuminating so so
here's a map function as defined
directly on the on the the H this trade
so it takes a function value so H f4
actually should probably be something
else that it was it was it was initially
H F for higher-ranked function but
basically it's a polymorphic function
value so that that is a type parameter
and we're going to ask the compiler to
give us a mapper which is going to map
this polymorphic function value across
of this list L and the result type of
that function is going to be the output
type of that mapper type so let's find
the definition of the mapper
- okay so mapper so the mapper is it has
the function type it has the Ageless
type as its input its output this time
isn't ageless so we have a bound on it
we can say it's an age list and apply
it's just into out so we've done the
same trick as I showed you before we've
kind of folded out the the the member
type into into a an additional type
argument again it's a technical thing to
worry about it too much now here that I
again are just merely two cases we have
an H nil case if we're mapping a
function across an empty H list then we
get back an mth list no matter what and
if we're mapping a a function across a
composite H list then we're going to
have okay looks a bit scary but it's
actually not that hard so this is this
is our polymorphic function so captured
by its type we've got an input head
we've got an output head we've got an
input tail and we've got an output tail
and so a pull pull back category theory
jargon it just basically means that all
of our instances for this function are
going to produce the same output result
type so that they're whatever whatever
whatever whatever in H is out H is
always going to be a single fixed type
so that's that's that's it doesn't
matter what it's called so okay so we've
got two things that we're pulling in
from our implicit environment we're
pulling in a the function instance for
our input head producing the output head
so implicit resolution will have worked
out all of these types for us and then
we also need to have a mapper for the
tail so it's the same function and we've
got the input tail and the output tail
and then the implementation is
completely trivial we are just applying
the type specific case for of our
function to the head and then we're
prepending that to the mapping of the
tail and that gives us our result all
types line up all the types have been
computed for us by by by by implicit
resolution
essentially and and that's it I can show
you doing it but I'd have to faff around
for and Nathan is scouring at me
suggesting I've I've run out of time so
I come and come and ask me and I will
prove that it works but for kit mailing
list I will be writing I've got a big
backlog of articles that I should be
writing about this kind of stuff and
talk to me about underscore sometime
over the weekend as well but we'll be
cool thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
