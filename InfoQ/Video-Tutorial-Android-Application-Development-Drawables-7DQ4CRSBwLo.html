styles for now so so we did all this
stuff to update for example the title
you know we we set up this title to be a
certain size we set up this text area to
be certain size we set up the background
to be certain style sides right so when
you look at it like this where's my
Eclipse when I look at my status like
this and look in the in the XML code we
did a bunch of settings and a whole
bunch of different things right so as
opposed to doing it over and over and
over again what we could do is we could
define a style in which we can kind of
put this these properties in a common
style and then have this properties
property be used in other places as well
right so for example next thing that
we're going to be doing is we're going
to be doing another activity so other
one I have to go and remember to set all
these 15 properties and everything over
and over again right so to create a
style what kind of file do you think a
style is gonna be yeah it's gonna be an
XML file and what's a good way of
creating any XML in andra in eclipse
yeah there's a helper thing called file
new Android XML that helps you figure
out the names right so I'm gonna say the
file is gonna be style dot XML and it
goes into values right
and that will create a new file called
style dot XML and now inside of this
file see it opens it up in this editor
because Eclipse knows of style so if you
click on add you can say I want to add a
new style slash team alright and I can I
can say let's create a style for for
example for title right and forth and
you can specify if it's good if it's got
the parent style as well so I can create
one for for title so I can click on save
now I can go and add an item to that
style and the item is gonna be one of
these things that we're moving from here
so for example so from here for example
what we had in the title here was that
the Android text size was 30 DP and that
the gravity was Center so I basically
need to remember that
so to copy this and I would say the name
of the item is Android stack size the
value is 30 dpph damn yeah
so I click on add and then I'm adding an
item to it
yeah so I'm gonna click that again
because now I'm adding another item and
this one is gonna be Android gravity and
I'll say Center right
you can but yeah you can copy it from
here so you know I can I can copy it
from here I can for example take even
further I can take layout mom's all
right wait does I mean you got to
specify each name/value pair so you
can't I mean what do I you're thinking
like copied this whole thing
yeah but put it into what it doesn't
work that way we're kind of outsourcing
what we're doing is we're moving some of
these stuff so for example now that I
have title text size and gravity defined
in this other file I can refer to that
file and the way I'm gonna refer to it
is by basically saying Android column
style equals at style / title right
exactly so now this is defined elsewhere
this is defined elsewhere right and if I
look at it like this she doesn't hear it
doesn't seem to work oh I know I did I
said them all
it didn't doesn't seem to there was an
hour oh let me see no reason first time
package Android or you know there's a
problem with the style see it's a
control shift I know there's no formula
style one is
okay so in in here it's not Android
style it's just style yeah so it's like
that
it's a I remember now not very intuitive
because everything else is Android
column okay so but it's just style and
we can take a look and see it takes till
takes effect here so I can outsource all
these properties that I'm currently
holding here for example even layout
within layout height now I'm not sure
this didn't use to work item name equals
layout word and then what is the worth
the wait was built and okay and then
write the wrap content okay so now I can
even remove those things from here okay
however that didn't use to work it does
work now and that it didn't used to work
in this preview mode so although it
would look wrong but when you run it it
actually works but it seems like that
you know with with this upgrade it
actually works for me but you may not
work for you because I know it used to
be a bug so okay so when you're creating
any type of XML file the tool to start
with is file new and Droid XML file okay
so it's ask you the project project is
Yampa file is Styles dot XML and it's a
value so all you need to remember is to
give it a name and value values it goes
into valleys directory
what do you mean Barry Cisco no I mean
do you want a special style for Mexican
you may but you know we're not all this
stuff all this stuff
I would leave for the end like you now
want to translate it to you know Spanish
and you now want to provide better look
and feel for you know square screen and
so on I thought I would leave that stuff
for later it's up to you you see you can
type it right in XML like this or you
can use the little Add button so if I do
add at the top level see if I if I have
this selected now if I do add it's gonna
say it knows that this is selected so
the only thing I can add is an item
right so it's kind of context-sensitive
herbs but if I don't select anything
click on add it says what do you want to
add and I'm like I want to add a new
style so I'm gonna go ahead I'm gonna
create a new style now for activity okay
activity style he doesn't care what
parent and I save it so there's my new
style now within that style I'm gonna
define a bunch of items so basically you
define a style an old style is is a
bunch of stuff that you moved from the
other place make sense like for example
I want to add a new item right and in
the previous one remember that for
status remember for for the background I
used to specify the background here yes
make sense so as opposed to specifying
it here I want to get away from that so
I'm gonna cut this and I'm gonna copy it
here and then I'm gonna cut the
remainder okay and I'm gonna copy it
here right so
I'm doing is a moving stuff from yeah
yeah I just that's all yeah yeah you
cannot add items and well I'm not sure
why I'll take a look but you can always
drop into XML right so sometimes the
tool male you may hit limitations with
the tool but you can always drop into
XML so to reference it now so to
reference the style
it's basically style equals and then you
know in quotes you say add whoops you
say add style slash name of the cell
just like anything else that's all slash
activity right so I'm gonna do the same
I'm gonna move my orientation vertical
I'm gonna outsource all this stuff into
into cut all this stuff I'm gonna say
item name you know I'm copy paste it
here its own maybe a little faster I
don't know then using the Eclipse tool
overnight
and you guys do the same thing for
button create a button style right and
I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it to
manually this time around so style so
you can use control space as well right
button for the most part so you can I
can do control space item right control
space name you know and then I can add
stuff like size 25 DP and then layout
with layouts height also moving and for
the button where it was
height was grab content seemed like that
and so now I can out I can take all this
stuff out I can take this right and
style equals and style / button
mmm interesting let's see
and so I'm going back at square one but
at least we have stuff defined now
elegantly right so it works everywhere
but I still have a problem with the and
not I have a problem but I found a bug
see how the button it it doesn't look
the same way when it when I run it as in
the tool right it's misleading yeah that
seems to be their bug and also notice
that so for example I may want to take
out that remember how we set them in the
manifest we set themed light I may take
all the theme from here but now what
they can do is in my style I can
actually specify for the activity I can
specify the the background color and you
can specify the text or I can make it
apparent at Android I can do some of
this see if this is going to show up
here like that now we're on it
well let me see if I can make a default
style so I'll say something like this
control space style name equals parent
and I can say I'll put some default
properties like for example all the
background is gonna be white so item
name equals back background I'll say for
white and the text background is gonna
be text color what's the name for the
text color Thanks see sometimes you may
not know what the property name is like
I don't know what in the name of the
item for text color is let me say block
here okay look at what it what it does
here and
text color so that's the one yeah so
that's kind of how you can look it up
sometimes so I'm gonna say thanks color
and text color is gonna be so it's gonna
be black or up with the dark colors and
like that it's a button
parent is not
mmm
so I'm taking my parents style for the
activity
and try something here so I supposed to
add style such team like I'm going to
say add style and let's see what comes
up
I'm not sure
uh-huh
I guess something like that so I'm gonna
name this one you see my my a style or
theme that does do a sting
so I know this wind it stands for global
darica so apply them globally
interesting um so what they did in a
mana for I added a theme in the manifest
file right but steam is just a stylish
is that when you define it as a team it
propagates to all the elements so you
can put it on the application level so
he had that theme is style global and
install global is just a something that
they defined in here so just excel or
believe everything's gonna have you know
white background and the text is gonna
be it's going to be you know dark I
could have been carried to that as well
yeah I could have I could say parent is
at Android style slash theme dot light
right and then I could actually take
everything out right so if I run it it's
essentially my global is actually just
the team same yeah there you go
I could have done it like that so we
don't really have anything new it's just
it we're renaming it so the tea yeah
exactly
yeah exactly
so so that's kind of so you know you can
go crazy on this you can do as much as
you want
you know but we basically altars a lot
of stuff so what my my file now looks
like may close couple these things so if
I look at my my status dot XML it
doesn't it's much simpler because here
all is defined stuff that is new right
here I only defined stuff that is new
right I guess for added text I still
have a lot of stuff right but it's also
nothing that I anticipate having
anywhere else so I don't really care
about defining it globally
essentially you important
five or six money yeah yeah so so that
this way we're gonna reuse all this so
later on if if we have a button
elsewhere we can just apply button style
and so it's basically it's like a CSS or
axis oh yeah
so far so good yeah
did you came question so the status XML
looks like this I mean I could have
outsourced the Edit box as well hmm
fine
so I could literally so a bit everything
so this is all not specific so I can
take the top I'll copy it here I'm gonna
take this out all right I'm gonna cut it
oops so that just happened you know we
open that two stars stars so what I
wanted to do is I'm gonna basically copy
all this okay and then I'm gonna delete
these two I'm gonna delete these all
right I'm gonna simplify this to close
it like that right it's a bug with a
close sometimes and so in my style copy
all that stuff okay so fill parent blah
blah ID and this is not gonna be part of
this so I'm gonna say style write name
equals edits box like that I'm gonna cut
that surround it here and then I'm gonna
copy and all this stuff
okay and then I'm gonna do
I mean it's kind of like massaging this
text unfortunately so like that
I'm sure something tonight some kind of
script to make this simpler to extract
from one for the other of in then
control shift F to reformat so now came
a new style so now if I wanted to get
rid of this in here I can just say style
equals that style slash that reformatted
and it's kind of annoying that the clips
that was no other thing something's
wrong so it does it underlines it yellow
would see if re opening solves a problem
and it doesn't but this should work
right so it's much simpler my layout is
now much simpler because we outsource a
lot to stuff into the spheres
quote-unquote CS as well there it is
mmm-hmm star status so basically I only
keep stuff as specific so a text text
and ID so text hint and ID that's the
only stuff that's specific
but what's new is every single one of
them is going to have style attached
there so style style style
so one thing that we could do here is we
can specify what kind of a keyboard is
gonna pop up right we can hint to the
system what kind of keyboard like right
now you know when I start typing it
brings up this keyboard which is what we
want right but if you if you want it to
specify what kind of keyboard there's
something called input type input type
and in Ubuntu doesn't work again but it
can be one of these like text caps tax
cap word sentence autocorrect blah blah
blah right so I may say ought to correct
for example okay and then text there's
tax pass for text filter phonetic number
phone date/time okay
no it doesn't but you know you would use
probably like a phone or a number
maybe good right yeah but see if I do
like I'm just gonna pick two like text
autocorrect and not to complete them
but what that does so if I look at now
eczema XML what that did is it added
this to my to hear it except I don't
want it here so I'm gonna cut it from
here
and now I'm gonna move it into my add
stylesheet yeah so I'm gonna say this
right and this
so that's kind of how you can tell the
system sort of what kind of a keyboard
to use of course there's no special
keyboard for IP but number pad is pretty
close enough now the box itself is about
the box it's the box itself food Scrolls
if I run it it would scroll in the Box
yes but your your point was good and you
had to do with you know so that's gonna
be updating for that uh-huh
see this is one problem the third one I
have to address all right I'll explain
that later but we're gonna have to
address it wrong that's if I go on a new
line but for example you know the fact
that it doesn't wrap I have entered on
this keyboard
my cousin he doesn't do that but in it
doesn't wrap for example yeah yeah
plus I don't like my theme did you see
that how the toast comes up yeah it
would wrap the content it's just that we
the text itself is not being it's it's
going like continuously so there's a you
know there's a setting for that I don't
know exactly what it is but let me take
a look so I would look in this tool
again because that's usually the useful
yeah yeah it would yeah but I'm not sure
for wrapping
lines that maximum width is that she
makes interviews this many pixels wide
that's maximum length may be more
appropriate length as the sets the input
filter to constrain the text length to a
specific number so next line maybe it's
more specific like for example I could
put 140 here right but but that's still
not telling me the how to wrap and if I
don't know exactly which one it is it's
one of the properties a scroll
containing yeah but it will
automatically scroll if it needs I can
for which one yeah yeah so that I that
icon is this icon here okay so that's
the icon so that's the icon that's gonna
go on a home page or not enough home
page and in the launcher right yeah and
so you know if I double click on it you
can see that's the icon right so you
just replace that icon and yeah and that
icon is referenced from the manifest
file because it says here which I want
to use so if you provide the new icon
you can either change name or just
replace the actual image yeah yeah so
back to yeah so I'm not sure exactly
what properties for wrapping but yes
that's one thing that we you know we
could set up some wrapping on how to
wrap dirt
element okay sanic are you guys still
working in this or do you wanna you
ready to something else so let's do one
other modification to this so what I
would like to do is I would like to make
the button and find an image for a
button right so like make something this
little something nicer so let's I mean
let's try our luck on in Google and what
if I go and find some Twitter let's say
for example I wanted this button to be
my my my button right for the background
right make sense so I'm gonna save this
file save images so I just search for to
the PNG and it's the first one I found
so I'll say button BG yeah and now I can
go into eclipse
just like before click on refresh right
to find it so we now know about button
BG that updates are right away so now
what I would like to do is for button I
can specify the background now to do it
in there directly in the button in
status XML or I could do it in the style
accent now it's up to you right it
doesn't really matter
so it's say we're doing it style so I
could say in style for button I can say
you know you can copy one of the from
activity for example I could just say
add background drawable and then button
BG right I saved that if you look at
this status like this she doesn't show
me this one it's a bug
but let's let's run it and see what
happens
okay so that's our button and it became
became the you know it's it's there
right the problem is how it stretches or
it doesn't right make sense there's a
problem you had earlier right okay so we
don't like that right we would like our
the way I imagine this is I imagine to
have my button be like this with a
little nice style tea here right thanks
sense that's what I would imagine so how
do we do that so so there's a tool
called draw 9-patch yeah and so what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to just run draw
9-patch like this in a command line BAM
just I can't I can do that because it's
in my I can't do that you guys can do
that right interesting why is it not
working this is new this is the this is
part of the update so tools draw nine
patch let's run it this way and see if
it's any worse so if I double click no
it's for me it still doesn't find it for
you guys it worked it started started
you draw nine patch why doesn't it start
properly what yeah that's why I mean
that's why I didn't work but okay so let
me let me do this I have older versions
of SDK Mac alternative
okay I have an old version of of drawing
pattern I doubt anything changed but you
know if you start a startup it's gonna
look like this and you know you can drop
your file like for example I can go into
my code I can go to Yamba and that image
that we wanted to make look nicer right
the button BG oh you know what button
bitch is a JPEG I just noticed first
thing first thing first
well what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
make sure that I save it as a PNG
yeah it's preferred to care of PNG and
we're actually gonna need a PNG in this
case so JPEG and gonna delete so now
button BG PNG what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna drag it and drop it into into here
into this tool or you can just go file
open that open right so you get to open
up a file okay so now what this tool
does is it shows you it shows you your
button right and it shows you on the
left hand side hearted button would
scale on the right hand side how the
button would scale let me make it to see
it shows you how the scale works XY axes
in both right so both of course is gonna
scale properly right but see how the
when I scale it just on X or just on Y
it doesn't look very hot right make
sense so what you can do with this tool
is you can draw a nine patch and the way
you do it is by drawing show that
patches it's a the image is very big so
so what i'm doing here is first funny to
delete patches that i did it so what
it's doing it was trying to set the
skill which part or it is scaled in
which part is not let me delete and the
point is it's so tiny see what i would
like to do is i would like to make only
a part of it stretchable and what i can
do is they can define a little line here
no I can define a little line here that
is now becoming stretchable
okay so so see how now the this stays or
just on the one side there we go see how
the T is not deformed it stays on one
side and here the T stays just the top
right and if I scale it on both the T
stays in the corner there's obviously
some a little bit of a gap here but like
that and let me delete one more pixel
there see how now I have a much better
looking yeah so what you're doing so
what your show patches so here's what
I'm doing here I'm basically saying that
I want a certain pixel to be stretched
so imagine that this whole normally the
whole thing would equally stretch by
putting a little line here in a line
here I'm saying that the on it point
it's gonna stretch is the point of
intersection which is that point there
and that's that white area
well nothing other than that white area
so now basically this button make Linda
so now this button is looks different
let me let me draw a let me point it out
in a different way so I'm just gonna
save this one really quickly I'm gonna
save it back into my project and I'll
show you a better example because this
this one that I just picked up is not
the best example so let me see
and the workspace yum resources in the
way you would want to save it is you
would use the same file name as the
original but do a dot nine dot right and
then eclipse actually knows to load that
one first right so now if I run it
you should actually use needs to refresh
here
so I'm gonna just turn on Ethan and test
it and then I'll show you a better
example let's see well you could yes um
this is still big in Photoshop you could
do it in Photoshop the problem with that
is that it you still it stop let me
let's pick a different example so here
is a let me find a button I'll just find
a regular looking button that doesn't so
hold on a second
development static file skin so images
when we find some skin just some website
button button okay button below okay let
me pick a button like this alright so
this is just a regular button I'm gonna
copy it okay and I'm gonna where I'm
gonna drag and drop it and it's gonna
cost a whole bunch of problems so I'm
gonna drop it into this folder here yeah
now it causes problems because of the
backgrounds right so I'm gonna rename it
and to button below button blow I lost
the extension button blue dot PNG right
so there's my new button so now let me
do this tool differently so I'm gonna
close that I guess I got a restarted
tool again online touch alternative
okay tools and touch okay so I'm gonna
pick the different tool right now a
different button Yampa resource drawable
okay take the button blue okay alright
so this is easier to see alright so you
guys see how I have a I have a button
and you can see how it scales okay make
sense okay so check this out so here's
the problem if I extremely scale it and
if I let me give give this a little bit
more space like scale it notice that
here's the problem this button has a
beautiful one pixel line white line
around it all right but when you scale
it that's what happens this way this
line becomes really squished and this
way this line becomes really wide you
see the problem so in other words
everything is proportionally scale
that's not what I want
I would like certain areas to scale as
soon areas not to scale okay this next
time so with this tool what you can do
is you can draw a nine patch and the way
is draw it is by doing a one pixel
basically it extends your image by one
pixel and it allows you to draw a low
one pixel black border box right that is
basically is gonna say which area is
stretchable so now what I'm saying is
the middle is stretchable in the middle
is searchable here but the corners are
not stretchable and yes you can do this
in Photoshop but this pool is just
designed for this right so so there you
go right so now notice how this line is
still preserved nicely right nice nicely
preserved okay so let me show you
differently what I've done is if I show
patches do you see nine boxes now here
it so one to let me write it like this
so one two three four five six seven
eight and nine and now I'm gonna move my
mouse so you can see those boxes yes
that's why it's called a nine patch so I
have defined nine patches and the five
is the patch that's gonna stretch right
the most right both horizontally and
vertically so that's where my content is
gonna be so in other words if I have a
large button small button square button
rectangular button doesn't matter
it should preserve its edges because one
three seven and nine are not gonna be
sliced
I don't know according to this
everything yeah I'm not sure I mean I'm
not sure this yeah I'm not sure what
that shows me you know this works really
well when I do it like this right so you
know but I'm not sure what it's called
it calls
yeah it doesn't get squished it gets
increased I'm not sure why I don't know
if it actually can get squished so one
way in that case would be to actually
start with this question image and have
it scaled up properly
yeah so in this case if when you do this
and you're happy with the look and feel
and all that and by the way you can
delete this so you can see how if I
delete this I can maybe make a smaller
area of the searchable in the middle or
something like that right um anyway once
you're happy with this you go and you
save this as the same file name but dot
nine dot dot PNG right so resource is
drawable so it's gonna be button blue
dot nine dot PNG save it and now I'm
gonna refresh this I'm gonna delete the
other button blue so I'm gonna leave the
dot nine one okay so now yeah so button
blue so if I look at it see there it is
and if I run it I don't know if it has
to I have I would have to try it but
that's that's the standard yeah yeah but
see now the button is actually looking
nice too bad it is not a little bit of
our space around the button to actually
provide to see what it looks like but we
can provide a space right by providing a
padding so for example 10 DP so not that
not telling but margin right margin 10
DP there like that right buttocks
I don't want to put it there I'd rather
put the margin in the stylesheet so I'm
gonna copy it from this one and I'm
gonna add it here
I'll be formatting that and I'll say
sure 15 is fine so let's run it uh-huh
target so it should be now lined up and
the bottom should look nicer there it is
right and if you look at the bottom you
can see the edge is actually nice right
perfect
now even if I go and I change this to
the other layout so I turn it around it
still looks good right although the
bottom is now much longer and all that
right it's control I feel out of control
f11 again so does that make sense yeah
so why don't you guys try it like find
some button or some image in you know
make it into a nine nine touch if you if
you have nine patch working again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
