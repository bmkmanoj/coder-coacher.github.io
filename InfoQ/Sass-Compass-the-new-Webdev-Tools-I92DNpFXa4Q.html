looked I heard this new thing coming up
she says bring compilers and I thought
that's silly who needs that i can write
CSS I don't need something to compile
for me and well I start with it I looked
at it didn't like it and went ahead out
at the same time css3 came along or it
came out big and the browser supported
it and it was awesome everybody got
excited about it and pretty much exactly
the same time you realized okay the
browser supported that they all do
differently they all need a special
syntax it's so not going to be fun so
about a half a year later or so i think
it was in twitter i found life reload
push what about life we load that's very
few you're missing out life reload was
awesome life reload allows me to simply
forget that thing that I've been doing
for about 12 years which is i'm editing
something i'm switching to the browser i
hit command R or back then it was f5 who
remembers that on windows to see what
has changed now lie fallow does that for
me clever enough you can find it in life
without com what they say about
themselves is it's the web developer
Wonderland a happy land blah blah blah
they are right it is really cool it
saves me a lot of stuff what it also
says is things about coffee scripts as
less the dimension coffee strip is
already reason why I stopped looking at
it again and I just ignored it further
it keeps saying oh yeah you don't have
to reload your browser and that's the
part of like and that's awesome fact I
still don't know SAS obviously at the
same time I started to really get into
gradients who has written a gradient
that is to be used grass browser how
many of you liked it yeah that's okay it
looks like this that's awesome at so
many 9s that's actually did the most
recent version with the most recent just
again changed background syntax that
nobody understands I think except imp
Explorer 10 this is so much fun and it's
great to do that once imagined at one
point when you just change that your
designer comes along and says oh
actually that color like about the third
from the right that needs to be
something else and you have to write it
all over again that's a lot of fun so
after having looked to live road this is
live reload it's not pretty I agree it's
very useful after having looked into
life reload quite a couple of times this
teeny tiny but no there it says compiles
as less dyess it was always there I
always kinda saw that i always kind
ignored that but okay i'm really annoyed
about all those extra browser extensions
so let's have a look i have to mention
at the same time we're sort about code
kid even less people code code is
absolutely awesome it's kind of like
life alot but pretty but it's not quite
the same it does it does everything that
you wanted to do does actually more than
life road as it optimizes your
javascript it combines that it handles
it it Lintz it it's awesome but it
doesn't do and that's the reason why i
don't really wanna use it or can use it
that it does only reload my local webkit
browser that is controllable using apple
script which kind of excludes Firefox or
Oprah it reduces it to Safari or Chrome
essentially and as I do a lot of testing
on windows
on mobile devices it kinda makes it uses
for me but it's great remember like code
kid it's pretty cool so again I saw that
little button life reload thinking okay
I give it a go if it's really just
checking this little box let's give it a
try so I looked into sass because well I
looked around and that seems to be the
choice the weapon of choice really and
what's s talks about him says is that it
makes CSS fun again and just after right
that incident of realizing CSS is so not
fun having to write my lines of CSS to
do a gradient that's pretty much exactly
what I want so I do what I think what
the website says I installed the SAS Jen
and I don't know my command line and
seconds later I'm just desperate it
doesn't work it gives me weird errors so
thank you stack overflow obviously I'm
gonna Mack I can't just install and a
gem I have to sue to install it so there
you go add some pseudo and it's much
much nicer now so what can this thing do
mix sense mix in Swiss or about make
sense that's more people know about SAS
you're cheating never mind this is a
mixing a mixin is a reusable chunk of
code you define it it's work you define
it with the mixed in syntax you give it
a nice name and you can just plug any
kind of content into your mix in and
then you can reuse it by just including
it over and over again it will just
really return that piece of content this
is really nice if you have repetitive
code huh we've just seen a lot of
repetitive code right so if I wouldn't
have wiped life you load this is what I
would have to do to convert my new sass
file that i just created or a folder if
i want to do luckily I don't have to
because it does it for me so after
having compiled it life alert did that
for me this is what the CSS looks like
it really just extracted everything that
was SAS before it returned exactly what
I wanted that's awesome that's pretty
useful so what makes them really useful
is that makes sense also can have
parents so you can define as many
parents as you want to in this case I'm
defining linear gradient so I want a
from and two for the most simple one and
then I can just reuse those variables or
parents in my code in my mixer excellent
so taking my beautiful code that we saw
earlier and pack this in a mixing and
I'm going to pass again from 2 i'm going
to default to a super old-school browser
that has never heard about gradients and
just give up one of the numbers and i'm
going to use every other syntax that the
world knows down to the most current one
and i'm even supporting with index
blower here i'm just going to add this
variable over and over again awesome and
this is what's supposed to look like i
use my new style by my new mixin I give
it to nice colors and I'm going to
compile it and it's compiled and what it
does is it beautifully replaces all the
variables it looks great and I go all
the way down I'm happy everything looks
great looks awesome and what exactly
happened here in tan explorer even if
it's not involved it drives me crazy
this is so me so after having the
regular age you look into the docks
that's what a docs look like they
actually really useful a nice the docks
tell me about interpolation so
interpolation I'm totally going to under
use it in this case but what it does is
it basically allows me to have a dynamic
embedding of variables in a special
context why I do need that is because
my variables down here they are not just
in the regular success in text there are
in a string and says reading this in the
string thinks it's just a string and
ignores it so to make says interpreter
debt I need to use this hash and their
curly brackets around my variable and
then I can use my gradient mixing again
and it actually works everywhere awesome
I can reuse it with all kinds of colors
and I never have to write prefixes ever
again ever okay that's all I need it and
convinced i really like this what else
is there nesting nesting one of your
most beautiful features in terms of it
actually looks nice who has ever thought
it would be nice if I could just like
have an module in a module in a module
and just have it like more belong
together than just sitting next to each
other this is exactly what it does for
you so what i can do is i can go ahead
and define i'm out you'll not bar and in
there i have a couple of properties with
height completely normal and in there
now i'm actually starting to nest in my
nav bar i have an ordered list and in
there i have a list element and in there
i have an anchor eyewitness compiles to
is this even though it's kind of tricky
here because we are using the nested
intonation this is actually just regular
CS that it does for you it does all the
nesting for it finds out okay does my UL
in my neph bar some writing an F for ul
and it does that all the way down the
chain and it just outputs reckless
assess what you write is so much more
visual as a module that's got me really
excited and like everybody I completely
over used it so a word of warning here
it is beautiful to just missed your
stuff down the line you end up having
ridiculously long selectors we all know
those are not really a good idea so I
suggest you use nesting but you think
about the CSS if you actually want to
have afterwards because that's what it
has to be
left so if you have a selector that
isn't mile long you're probably doing it
wrong so something else that I found
seriously cool only found after looking
into ducks because I never have come up
with myself you can actually nest parts
of properties as well so this is
something that's users obviously can't
do at all I just say okay in my
fictional glass I have a border and in
there i have border style and India have
bought a left and the left has width and
left as a color and it just inherits
down the line beautifully this is
something that is so clever I keep
forgetting about it but every time I
read about to think oh yeah yeah I
wanted use this so badly I promise at
one point I will use it but I suggest
you do it it's great you can nest
awesome so one of the things that came
up in you have to have is the parent
selector the parent selector gives you
the chance to actually reference upwards
to change is it something obviously CSS
come to itself and its only works inside
of a chain inheritance so what you can
do is you can we have our outer selector
for an anchor and the m % here it's
representing this anchor in the
inheritance what i can do is i can just
use it so by default you can see by
default it's going to be a and there's a
space and that's the property right so
if you want the two to be together
essence for the selectors hover and
activist cetera you have to use the
selector today are together that's the
easy part the awesome part is when you
then need to add some extra classes for
example if you think about what boo
moderniser does it gives you all those
browser prefixes you can use you can
then just use their prows of a fix here
and have your inheritance in in there
you parent selector and it outputs the
selector upwards that's really really
nice you're going to use this a lot
and I definite mentioned at the
beginning if you have any questions
along the way just shout out and very
open to questions has anybody used that
already handful okay what you totally
use every time everybody is variables
that's something that comes up every
time people talk about regular sees as
we want to have variables I bored of
rewriting all my colors all the time you
can't do it in CSS still working on it
it's going to take a while incest you
can have it right now and says you can
just go ahead and define all kinds of
strings or colors or in this case of
color or a style just pre fine it with a
dollar and your half this variable
defiant you can reuse it everywhere in
your file and it will just be replaced
to whatever it is it also has a
hierarchy so if I would for example
define my main color inside of net bar
it would not apply down here and vice
versa so we have a very nice chain of
inheritance if you go to the root like I
did here it is just available in all of
your stays as well interests as well and
it will replace this is something that I
use a lot for things like theming I'm
working on the mail client for Yahoo and
the current medline has about like 20
different themes they all going to use
this syntax and basically we have one
big file that contains the actual
templating and every theme then it's
just a little part of variables that we
just modified really easy and quickly
it's beautiful we used to do this much
more complex functions are extremely
valuable what they give you is beautiful
little things like okay I have melon
color i define it as my variable that's
easy we just learnt that and imagine
your hover over that link what you
usually do is you want some kind of
visual feedback I just have it over this
link what you tend to do is oh yeah
let's find a color dad with represent
steps and you talk to you designer and
designer looks it up and they eventually
come back with a color that might fix
what actually is much much quicker
especially thinking in the theming
context where just have lots lots of
color sets as you can use lighten or
darken together with a percentage and
actually just take this number this
color that you put in and it will modify
it on the fly and output the colors for
you this is incredibly easy theming has
never been a fun talk about fun
calculations talking about not fun who
knows this bad boy oh you lucky bastards
you don't know the box model it's broken
beyond repair so what you do to have to
style up box is obviously a box just has
not really just a width it has its width
that you define it has a left petting at
the right petting it has a border on the
right has a port on left and that
whatever it is at that very point ends
up being the width it is painful and it
is actually something that you have to
think about a lot of you supporting all
the browsers I'm one of those so let's
calculate that because we don't have to
do that ourselves anymore so we just
want to say our box hundred hundred
pixels and put it when I mean hundred
pixel it actually should end up being
kind of pixel not what the browser
things is a good idea so I'm going to
define my border is slip exles add some
padding of 10 I had some margin of 10
and then i'm using calculation incest
and i'm defining okay my margin doesn't
affect my box model i don't care my
petting it's my petting my border is my
water and then my width that's the
critical part i just go ahead and use my
width and subtract the border and
subtract the padding and i ended up
having exactly the number that i would
never being able to calculate math
74 pics who would have thought this is
something that gets me excited plus I
get you excited howdy exciting it's late
I know
percentage excellent question actually
you can calculate all kinds of units you
can use percentages to calculate you can
use em to calculate that actually builds
in amount of predefined relations so we
says knows how many how many pixels and
M has it knows how many pixels and inch
has and is able to convert those in
between so you can actually take two M's
and subtract 20 pixels that works it's
pretty cool yes
yeah excellent question so there there
is a built-in function that I would have
looked up I look into it after the talk
there's a function that actually gives
you a color contrast and you can give
them max color contrast and a minimum
color contrast and give you the ideal
between the two it's it worked
beautifully so add import that's
something that we know from CSS right
who's using CSS import at the moment in
CSS I'm really sorry to say but the
problem the problem with Adam port in
CSS no further to the problem with that
important CSS is that it doesn't
actually import it takes your CSS at the
fine snide import it low zip file and
then defines another one it loads that
file it ends up in loading a lot of
files and it just has so many HTTP
requests the beauty of at import in SAS
is that it actually doesn't import it
includes the files so on the Left I have
my one sass file that I used to compile
and I'm telling okay import my file here
importers are the file and for this
third file and it ends up being one file
no kitten has to die so that's cool
that's ass but there's more the thing
that I find most beautiful about SAS is
actually not says itself it's compass
compass is a CSS framework that sits on
top of sass and basically gives you a
lot of extra stuff around so what it
says about itself is that it's an open
source Jesus authoring framework that
sounds really interesting I think it's
just a beautiful excellent make set of
CSS mix-ins functions helpers and extra
tools that make it really awesome so
who's using composite amount that's
again a whole different set you're
cheating
so the way to get compass is again your
go-to new command line and you just tell
Ruby to update its trims and then
install the compass jen and then you
celebrate because you didn't forget to
use sudo this time yes makes me proud so
and what you can then do is you can
initialize a new compass project by just
going to a folder that you just created
and tell them to install compass and to
tell compass to watch this one folder
and what the watch means it's basically
doing what life will out is supposed to
do so we can ignore that because life
willow does it what the insulation does
when you say compass install is it
creates nothing but this little Ruby
config file so you can just do this by
hand what I'm doing is I have one of
those and i just copied them into a new
project I don't have to go to anything
else a couple of things that are
important in there it's really just
where does my CSS live whereas my sass
live where do my images live yes those
are important as well and to JavaScript
and then you have a compass project and
suddenly have the possibility to do this
you can import compass and compass gives
you all this beautiful power that I just
mentioned you have suddenly so much
power over cs3 remember that gradient
mix in it we built in the beginning food
away because you don't need it because
compass has that built in and the
important part is I had to update that
mixin when the news gradients index came
out because suddenly it was unprepared
and syntax was unproven explorer 10 and
everything I had before was broken and I
had to go through and I have to update
this grayness index you don't have to do
that because all you have to do is you
have compost installed and you say
compass update and then everything will
be recompiled and you suddenly have the
new syntax that is done for you don't
have to think about stuff like that
anymore that is convenient
convenience is good it gives you all
those nice and mixes you can change the
backgrounds you can change the gradients
you have box size in your box shadow
flexbox is beautiful in there everything
that is basically new and hot and css3
is there and documented nicely as a
special front face index that generates
all the nice bulletproof front face
syntax for you gradients i mentioned
that hyphenation hyphenation is great
text shadows regions transitions
transforms those are the 2i use the most
because writing those by hand damn that
is painful so having spoken about the
box model obviously being the prototype
were in my team hey don't have to care
about an explorer that much anymore so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
box sizing what's what about box sizing
yes are you all using it no you should
it's awesome Paul Irish actually
published little article it's linked
down there read about it it's really
really cool what it does is it basically
makes the box model that was considered
broken and it an explorer for back in
the days it rolls it across every single
bout that it is today and basically
gives you a box model that ignores
everything about padding and margin and
borders it just when I tell a box to be
hundred pixel wide it actually ends up
being hundred pixel wide I know it's
crazy this is the first line of right in
every project highly recommended so
remember that gradient that we did
earlier this is what I can now do
because I don't have to care anymore and
actually I get even more support by
using this little toggle up here I'm
actually adding support for an older
Oprah's who are unable to do that as
well and it will generate an SVG
dynamically for me to be then stand
across an old opera background as
beautiful and then I can use the
background image mix in that compass
gives me and I'm passing in a linear
gradient and tell them where to go and
what
colors to use and some information about
my box and this what it expands do now
that looks terrible but it's dynamic I
don't have to care anymore what I cares
about this that is beautiful this is
maintainable I don't have to write it
once this is done for me and I don't
care anymore this up here is a by 64
encoded SVG that is never going to be
used other than an old opera you don't
have to do this it's an experimental
feature but it actually makes this
ultimate cross browser experience
beautiful and then it will just write
every single one of these and works out
you can actually see that this is still
the old syntax they are going to update
compass very soon it will come out
before it Explorer 10 come out and what
it does is will just update this for me
I know this is currently outdated the
beauties I don't care I just have to
update compass once it's there and it
will work so obviously i still have to
think about how a gradient looks like by
myself right i have to actually find the
colors no I do not toots like this and
it has very subtle naming your ultimate
css3 grade and generator I'm actually
pimping this because it is the ultimate
solution you can just take a of a
gradient that you found somewhere and
upload it there and it will extract you
the perfect CSS gradient out there this
is so cool beauty is it also besides
just generating CSS it can also generate
SAS for me using the compass syntax so I
can just go ahead upload an image get my
sass go back and actually have this epic
code that generates a crazy amount of
CSS behind the scenes but it just works
and it looks great highly recommended
this is free what is not free but
actually a little bit more awesome still
a CSS hat and since had completely
rolled over me in the same way that sass
kind of did because I thought okay this
is a tool that is obviously not needed
for me
because I'm grown up and I can write CSS
and I don't need this tool but his tool
does is it lives in Photoshop being a
coder having a tool that helps me in
Photoshop was kind of like a I don't
need that I went to designer who has
that installed I looked at it I loved it
and I've paid for events awesome what it
does is you can just select a layer in
Photoshop that has a gradient that has
text with a shadow that has overlay with
another gradient hang one of those
things that is painful to actually
reconstruct by yourself and just by
clicking at this layer it will give you
the source to do the same thing in CSS
and again it not only outputs for CSS it
also the outputs sacks for me with the
necessarily compass makes sense and it's
it's absolutely beautiful it's a bit of
a pride going away because okay i'm
relying on tools to do that for me but
knowing that I could do it myself makes
me feel okay and it saves so much time
you have no idea so this is cool go back
to compass when it also comes with other
than saving me a lot of typing is that
it actually has a lot of thought through
best practices already built in so about
I don't know a unit half to two years
ago probably not that long ago I fell in
love with inline block because in an
blog helps me solve all those problems
that floats kind of gave me floats
always end up being painful at one point
you have all those columns and it
doesn't have any more and I keep hitting
this and it's it gets really painful
using floats inline-block works around
is beautifully by just having all the
beauty of block elements but being able
to sell her or to be aligned horizontal
for example so thing is obviously it's
not a hundred percent cross-browser
right
wanting to be an element to be in and
block actually required me to write some
extra code I don't want to do that what
I want to do is I want to say you box I
want you to be 9 block and what says
does accomplished us behind the scenes
for me is writing all this code and it's
actually clever enough to go outside and
write some extra this is a knack for in
explorer for me to be able to actually
use this cross browser just like that
this is such a time-saver and I never
had any problems with any in explorer
stuff anymore what I actually end up
doing this I just code away and when I
open it in a browser that haven't tested
before I don't start screaming like I
used to it actually just looks like it's
supposed to look I hope you will have
that eventually another thing is clear
fixes obviously this is a little more
known having worked with floats all the
time and cliff fixes are not that
problematic anymore as you can today on
you say okay overflow hidden and someone
it expands it for me so I still have to
only what it once what I still end up
using crossover hidden is usually not
what I want I end up having something
that it needs to go out of the box so I
want to use the old school Claire fix
and the old cough lyrics is still in
there but it's a subset and pipe is in
this case a subsection of compass and
who is what about pie it's it's a
special one it's a special a framework
that uses JavaScript and all kinds of
CSS hex to emulate css3 for internet
explorer and everything that you know
about pie is built-in compass already I
really use it because I don't really
want to have and explore all that beauty
on being slow down as hell but this is
something that I still use all the time
so that clear fix is usually what I go
for instead of overflow hidden and it
writes it all for me and it just allows
me to use the float if I have to
otherwise yeah
11 and helpers are out there and that is
the stuff that keeps blowing my mind so
who's working with sprites sprite sheets
everybody who likes working with white
sheets you're sick person are you using
this technique okay I take it back it's
really really painful working with
sprites you have to open Photoshop or
fireworks or whatever using you're
pushing pixels you're moving your images
together in one big thing you do this to
reduce HTTP requests because you know
the kittens don't remember the kittens
you do this also the kiddies you built
this massive image and then you have to
measure where is this image and it's
it's really really not fun and the
moment you remove an image because it's
outdated and replace that you have to
calculate every single you have to
calculate every single location again
and it's just not fun so compass does
something seriously awesome and that's
one of the things that I have not found
in any of the other Jesus pre compilers
which is why I will stick with compass
for now it allows me to just point
compass to a folder of PNG's and what it
gives me is not only all those images in
one folder combined into one big image
know it also generates all the CSS
needed to find every single image in
this big sprite sheet and that just
keeps blowing my mind so what I'm doing
is I'm telling okay i'm importing
compass and i'm going to use my folder
icon there's a folder icon which is in
my images folder now tell compass to
just use everything every PNG that is in
there and then i'm going to include all
icon sprites icon in this case is again
the name of the folder so if my folder
would be blah it would be all blah
sprites and then when the heck go ahead
and finds every image in there so in
this case there's four images the first
image is sprite attachment is the lead
it's reply and it generates this new PG
for me and it includes it and then it
does just as more of those it will then
write a new style for every PNG in there
so I can simply go ahead and use this
class and wherever I attach this class I
know this bright will turn up my
employee this is what it looks like this
is my folder full of sprites this is
what it is for me beautiful and it even
sorted by size not that it's relevant
more importantly because i'm actually
not much of a fan of having my CSS
dictate how i have to write my HTML so I
don't want to attach a class called icon
attachments bright to an element that
should have an attachment right so
instead of that you can define your own
classes and include one sprite
specifically so i can just say ok that
element in my HTML that was already
there but i don't have to change anymore
you have this icon sprite and it will
just apply them just like this and what
do you output Z I also use some extra
icon spacing because in the version that
we had before they're actually really
close together which is slightly
unpractical because you just have to
change line-height a little bit and you
had to sneak out so adding a little
flying height is awesome or use diagonal
sprites diagonal sprites came up like a
year or two ago and they're really
clever if you if you have like a list a
list of elements I know I saw that face
I have a list of elements and that
element every element in there has a
different icon and you don't want to mix
around and you don't have to around
with all these positions because what it
does is it will simply cut out that one
element in there and yes I know there's
a bit of a downside because it is
actually not much bigger the sprite than
the other one so it loads the same way
but once it's loaded in your browser it
will be extracted it will be the
full-blown image and then it's actually
bigger than your original one which ends
up using
Ram that's the downside I still love
them for special links so i have one of
those those like navigation elements
where every single element has a
different sprite image in there this is
what i'm using there I'm not doing this
that big but I'm using it and it's
really cool those rights now sprites
give us all that HTTP reduction which is
really awesome but it kind of limits me
one of the things that always drove me
nuts with sprites is that I can't simply
take an icon anymore and tell that I
can't be right aligned or left aligned
and will automatically be horizontally
centered because all the other icons and
that's bright can't just be centered
with it so that's the one downside and
it's always a bit of a pain so what I'm
using in new projects instead is I'm
actually using an inline image and with
a syntax that looks surprisingly similar
I can just say inline image instead of
sprite image and it will just include as
we saw earlier just include the whole
image intimacy is using page 64 and i
know this is again this does
disgustingly ugly and it looks terrible
and if you think about oh yeah but I
have this icon more than once yes you
can do that Jesus if it's actually your
friend in this case and if you have 1i
can modern once it G zips out very
nicely so you don't actually have much
of an overhead and you can go ahead and
use all those nice nifty alignments it
has a one downside compared to irregular
sees as that links external files
obviously this CSS has to load
completely first so I'm using this in
mobile apps for example where to CSS and
all the images already there so I have
one file and it loads extremely quickly
rather than having one file that loads
not a phone that lets another file this
is where I use this and I like it a lot
so another really nice helper is imaged
with it comes with image height just as
well what it does is I can point it to
my file that I just loaded and I can
tell okay give me what the width of this
element or height if its image height
and this makes it very flexible again in
terms of handing icons for example if I
have a background image that is an icon
my designer today decides this icon is
15 pixel height and it's 20 pixel white
white and that's perfect and a hard code
it's a bit light damn you it's 10 pixel
wide and I add some petting of 10 pixels
and it works beautifully and then in
half a year my designer decides actually
those in those icons are now 30 pixel
wide what I have to do now is I have to
run from my code and find all those
widths and we compile them what I don't
have to do now is because when i change
this file i will automatically compile
my file here and whatever petting i
decided to have it is now there this is
really helpful so there's all nice and
great but what you can't do anymore now
is to actually change all that CSS in
fire black or in the web inspector right
no because there's a couple of
extensions out there for firefox as well
as for for a WebKit that actually allow
you to find what sass file is behind the
compile sees as far which is extremely
fun only fountas not too long ago before
that I had exactly that problem I did
all my changes in SAS I compiled them I
looked in the browser and okay there's
something I need to fix and because I
used to do that I opened by inspector
and I clicked around and I made it
perfect and then I had all those changes
in my inspector and not in my sass and
looking around Specter I wouldn't know
we're in my sass file that information
was now these extensions give me exactly
the line in the sass file and I can make
my changes there this is fire size for
Firefox this is SAS love for web kids
and having learned us to this morning is
knowing that it will actually be built
into Chrome not too far away because
it's already in the Knightley's and at
one point you can just turn it on and it
will automatically work and you can
actually go ahead and save your CSS at
your sass from there back into your
project really cool this is very close
to visibly editing that we never want to
but hey the only thing that this needs
is debug info so what you need to do is
you give you have to give this little
information here in your Ruby config of
your soil in your in your in your
compass project and what it will then do
is it will do a massive mess so what it
adds is this extra code here that tells
the extensions where to find that
information and this looks terrible but
you don't have to care about it because
once you compile for production you can
just tell them to not use this and it
will be trimmed down so this is a one
way thing it's only do just for
debugging and actually only turn it on
whenever you need to because it's just
so much extra code but it's really value
but it really helps so I was surprised
nobody asked parties before
yes says is not the only Caesars
precompiler so there's more let's talk
about the others all you got the
reference I wasn't sure if it's too long
ago so the others at least the other big
ones are less and stylist and those two
actually have one thing that I like
about them they are both driven by no GS
so they nicely fit into your JavaScript
back if you have them but I still prefer
SAS and I preferred because of those
things that I showed you encompass all
those extra little tools that are so
nicely thought out they make sense the
winner and there was a lot of talking
about which is actually the right one
which is the winner and I think Chris
Coyer from Caesars tricks actually put
it nicely it is just the most mature it
has less bugs it has the best
documentation it in my case I extended
it's the most fun to use because of
compass it doesn't mention that but I I
think that's the actual one so
concluding and thank you very much
