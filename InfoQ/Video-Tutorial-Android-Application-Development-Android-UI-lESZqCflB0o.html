remember I said one of the biggest
differences between regular Java and
Android is the UI so that's where like
we have a lot of new stuff
so with that I want to let's talk about
the UI in Android because that's a big
part of what app development is about so
the biggest difference is there's
basically two ways so not one way but
two ways to develop UI in Android okay
so the way number one is to do it
decoratively so what that means is that
you are writing XML code right and it's
it's very much its first is it still
similar to HTML I guess is anybody
created HTML page before like back in
high school yeah okay but you know what
I mean like Dreamweaver doesn't count I
mean HTML like as in you use notepad or
favorite write your ID or editor okay so
that's one way to do it the other way to
do it is procedurally you code it you do
it by writing Java code okay and that's
that's pretty much very similar to what
AWT and swing look like in Java in other
words it's a lot of code lots of typing
all right so the way we're going to do
it is we're going to use both ways so
we're going to start here okay this is
going to be our number one and then
we're going to go here and we're going
to finish it off here that's sort of the
approach that we're going to take okay
let me kind of explain that another way
XML is really good for it's describing
what a widget looks like take a button
for example
Chanel is a great o to describe what
button gun is going to look like what
its content is going to be the color the
size that the you know roundness
whatever it is all right on XML allows
for tools to do that so you can have
tools that look like Dreamweaver to
create you know UI but XML is not the
right tool to say what the button does
you can't easily say do this when you
clicked right when you click so that's
what we're going to switch to Java and
Java is going to be what we programmed
the button in does make sense you do a
lot and you go as far as you can in it
XML then you switch over to job it's our
essential exactly exactly
Java is for action and then XML is for
that description look and feel cool okay
so we're going to start a new project
and we're gonna then start working on
new UI so I'm going to start this
project that I call Yamba we just saw I
already have some number I'm just going
to move this young but to Yamba alt
refactor rename okay so what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to close everything here
and I'm going to start a new project I'm
gonna call it the Amba for yet another
microblogging app you guys can call it
whatever you want but let's create a new
project a new Android project as I said
I'll go Yamba and be my project
and I'm going to base it on who should I
try Android 9 or the hack and the 2.3
now I haven't written anything on
Android 2.3 so might as well give it a
shot so app but it doesn't really matter
what stuff that we're using API that
we're using it's pretty much hasn't
changed in century 3 or something right
so don't sweat it like you don't need
the latest greatest or anything like
that
right so so yeah so application name
will say young package name all is calm
all is calm Yamba to keep it short but I
don't think there's Komiyama don't yeah
hmm you know I'm going to do learning
Android of yonder there that's my uh
that's the book domain name so what what
IKEA might as well and create activity
I'll create an activity so we're going
to start before you finish it so we're
going to start with and let me open the
picture like this I have pictures that
make me make a little more sense so to
reduce so our final product is going to
look like this right so it lecture looks
kind of bad on this but we're gonna our
final product is going to look like this
but we're going to start here ok and I
call these see I use the surname in
convention you don't have to use this
naming convention but I usually say the
name fold by what it is so for example
if it's an activity it's going to be
something activity if it's a service is
going to be something service
right if it's an adapter is going to be
something adapter that way when you have
a bunch of stuff all in the same folder
it's easy for you to figure it out okay
so that's basically how I typically do
it so this is status activity because
this is going to be the one where you
update your status remember it's got a
big box and a button on which you click
and you press it in it says click on
these cells okay so that's why it's a
status activity so I'm going to start
with that one so that's that's going to
be our number one it's going to be this
one and it's going to update I'm hoping
to get up to here today right so we
update all that to work let's go so back
to this I'll say status activity again
and then minimum SDK version it's going
to be it doesn't really matter
I'll go back to four just because I want
to be able to run it on my old-school
HTC deb 2 device which is loaded with
with a cup donut 1.6 so with that why is
it not letting me do it doesn't want it
huh interesting
okay so I'm just gonna do that dot mark
on that he doesn't matter what it is you
guys can use your own right but it's
interesting that it doesn't allow for
dashes that's a great question why
shouldn't a lot for dashes I will show
you another place where it doesn't allow
for dashes there is a place where it
doesn't allow for dashes and yeah and
I'll show you that later ok and finish
because if one of the reasons why it has
to do with with how it manages the
resource files and the - has become - is
in Java it's going to wear a low point
that out later okay so we now have a
project again it's it's it's a
everything came from a boilerplate so
this boilerplate code there's our file
that's generated
there's our resources that are generated
so so far everything looks pretty much
the same as before right now
it created a default file for us
main.xml right which is with the our
main layout but i don't like to call it
main because we're going to have
multiple layouts so what makes this one
main right so i'm gonna rename it to
status to respond to the status activity
I just find it more meaningful on in in
Eclipse to rename something there's no
such thing as rename but you do the
refactor rename okay because the Eclipse
does a little more than just rename it
actually checks for references were
applicable now that doesn't mean that it
always works but it does do some
something more than just renamed so I'm
going to simply rename it to status
stud2 dot xml okay just name change and
this should break your project
did it yeah yeah so see how you get all
this dirt at xxx right that means
compile-time error syntax error right
now these are easy to find when it's
java it tells you exactly blurred drill
down open up status activity you find
another X and it spells out of the
problem is our layout main no longer
exists
right so the moment you change the file
that moment our God to regenerated the
recompile so you so reference to
something that's our layout mean doesn't
is no valid anymore so you just
basically delete this click on dot and
see clips now tells you what's available
there so you can now just use Eclipse to
complete this and change basically main
to status save it and everything
everything gets recompiled and rebuilt
and your project should be whole and
complete working right so my at the
point to this is just kind of how do you
try to trace Java errors that's point
number one you look you drill down
through the little axis but the point
number two is remember I said R is in
one one ugly file we're not going to
look inside of it but we're going to use
it and the way we're going to use it is
by you don't have to do this but if I
just want it to refer to something I
would say r dot and then you wait an
eclipse gives you options right and you
say how layout dot and your weight in
Eclipse gives you options in bam and
completely that way okay so doing it
this way it's much smarter a it's way
quicker for you B it avoids typos so
it's actually recommend I recommend it
to use the self completion in Eclipse
because that way you're going to avoid
some type of other ways and you'll be
like oh why is this no compiling this
bit change
studies are updating why not start see
muscles which source oh why did it
update here yeah well that's you know
you would expect that to work right yeah
it just sits bug it's it's needs not
complete normally see Eclipse tools are
still ready mentally like in Java if you
do something refactor rename it actually
does way more updates but for this
particular thing it doesn't yeah it's a
I'll show you what your source code for
it is if you want to fix it at some
point or or file a complaint ask for the
money back okay by the way I'll be
showing you some very cool you know
eclipse features as we keep on going so
you'll see some shortcuts along the way
okay so so far we we were just back at
square one we haven't done anything
crazier project renamed one file big
deal so let's take a look where we're
going to start is back again here right
so we said this is a good location to
start we're going to start declaratively
first and then we're going to switch to
Java so that means let's open up that
status XML file which for now is just
big or not so big black box
everyone god okay so first of all this
is sort of new it wasn't like this
before but I kind of I updated my tools
for eclipse oh my it looks slightly
different than what may look for you but
um here it says basically call you're
looking through this mode the resolution
and I'll just make it it's your Pico
device yeah you can pick a device that's
kind of I guess a little better than
picking the you know so this will be
like for example Nexus One but see
doesn't fit in my screen so I really
just don't care I just want something
that sorta looks a square e or in sort
of fits in my screen but you can kind of
adjust it you guys you know croissant s
if you're working on a specific device
like square screen or something like
that this can be helpful okay you can
change if it's landscape or portrait
view that you're looking at and so on
and so on okay now one thing that I do
want to set up in terms of the
environment when I work on the UI and I
find it very useful to open up these two
windows on the side one is outline and
the other one is properties window
okay so outline properties so if you're
using my virtual machine you already
have it configured that way you don't
have to do anything so it may be closed
like this so if you're using a virtual
machine you should have something like
here right and you could click on this
and that expense it alright again so
it's here and it expensive for those of
you cannot using virtual machine you
probably have properties open but you
have it open down here yeah now okay
okay okay or you don't have properties
in to open at all so here's what you do
whenever you're missing one of these
windows they're there zillion windows at
your disposal but they're not obviously
all shown because there's not enough
screen space so whenever you're missing
a window you're going to find it under a
window show view and then if it's not in
this list here then it's going to be
under other so window show view other
and then properties is under general so
click on it and it should open for you
to stand on yeah now it probably opened
it for you down here so you can drag it
like that or a dirt and put it here
right so you can see how you can drag it
okay so you can put it here
and you probably want to adjust the
width of property and values because I
bet sure your properties box column is
super stretched right now make sense to
come I want to have it it's the name
value pair so I want to kind of adjust
my columns so they fit right so that
this is my property column and then this
is my value column that's how I like it
so when I click on one of the components
I can see the values and everything kind
of nicely fits more or less right well
you got to select an element first
so everyone got it let's go I like to
set it up my my my environment and yeah
and they'd change this tool a little bit
so it's May technial while getting used
to it myself but I'll point out what the
changes are okay so what we have here is
we have a whole bunch of widgets widgets
are properly called views I'm just going
to explain what that means in Android
I'm going to fast forward to this slide
BAM so what we have is you basically
have think of it is kind of like Lego
blocks right like you have Lego blocks
that are it represents something on a
screen and that something can be one of
the two things it could be something
that can contain other things or it can
be a thing in other words it could be it
could be like a branch or a leaf right
in other words it can be you know a
layout meaning a layout is a placeholder
for other things versus a thing would be
something like a button make sense so a
placeholder is not really necessarily
visible itself is it's more used to hold
other things like container in swing yes
it's what in Java we called it container
and we call an actual view a component
in containers are components similarly
layouts are views is just they're
special kinds of views that can contain
other views or it's a composite pattern
if you guys are familiar with design
patterns right it's a it's you can
compose like many of something is also
something right does that kind of make
sense okay so basically the way we're
building the UI is by putting mixing
layouts and views on top of each other
right
cool so right now what we have here is
you can kind of see in the outline it
kind of shows you have a linear layout
which contains a textview linear layout
contains the textview oops
and I'm going to change this team from
for you guys to see from team to team
light and like I said it doesn't really
do much other than make it on the screen
better there is something called teams
but this is not how it works
I'll show you where how we define a team
in all that yeah this is just merely for
what's visible here exactly when you run
it it's not going to be applicable but
there is a way to create teams that is
essentially like style sheets in Java in
CSS right and we will work on that as
well so so you can kind of see that
right now I have one thing there it's
called the textview and it's contained
within on linear layer two essentially I
have two components okay
so let's let's kind of a let me kind of
open up that application that I had
before let me look at this screen right
now um so if it doesn't mean that you
always have to built and like this but
this is very simple UI so let's kind of
look at this UI how many things do we
see on this UI how many components do
you guys see on this UI yeah I think the
correct answer is five but let me kind
of let's count it so we have the mother
of everything which is the box that
holds everything a KL layout right so
that holds everything inside of it we
have a title right we have this thing
here this is the count you know as you
type it kind of goes down right then we
have the area where we type stuff okay
make sense and then we have the bottom
those are roughly the components so um
the the they have different there are
different types so the ones that contain
just text we call them text view right
the one that is editable text we call it
edit text okay button is just a button
and so this would be a text view as well
so let's not worry about this one for
now we'll get to that later so we have a
text view for by an edit text followed
by by a button right so far so good
so to recreate them like that what I
would do is we already have a text view
you can kind of see it here in the
outline this kind of shows you the
outline of stuff right so you have an
edit text a header text view then I
would find an edit text then I would
drag and drop it okay and then I would
find a button and I would drag and drop
it so there are my four components right
it's a mother of everything text view
edit text button and you can also see
here mother of everything contains one
two three components you got their nest
inside of it um it doesn't matter we can
go with the button and then put a source
yeah yeah well we we can now you know
yeah we can change that later it's only
big deal
so it doesn't look that great but at
least structurally we have the four
things that we need that's how I would
start okay
so everyone get so far okay so now what
I would do is I would adjust properties
of those things so let's start with I
don't know let's start with the second
one no let's start with the third to do
the bottom it's the easiest so select
the button selected by clicking on it so
it's uh you know it's ER
it tells you that the button is selected
or you can select it here doesn't really
matter how you select it now if I open
up the properties you're going to notice
that there's a lien and one property for
the button okay there are quite a few
things and by the way the best
documentation probably is eclipsed by
putting a mouse over it and kind of
trying to figure out what is what right
since you're deleting the documentation
but how to distill in properties how do
you know which ones you care about well
I kind of intuition or I kind of gave
you a little cheat sheet so these are
the ones you kind of care about so these
two you almost always universally care
about layout width and layout height
okay that essentially tells the parent
how much space to reserve for you the
component layout width and a height it's
under misc so it could be hidden
sometimes if you yeah especially on
Ubuntu that tends to be closed down that
little box I don't know why yeah so
layout within layout cut so let's take a
look so under miscellaneous fund layout
with an LED right for the button and for
example for height you know I could put
something like I don't know 200 TX right
and there's my button not 200 pixels
right now what is a problem with that
there bunch of problems with with that
why is this a bad idea 200px so 200
pixels won't scale to different screens
okay so let me let me explain the units
first and then we're gonna come back to
this so units in Android UI okay so uh
you all know what pixels are you all
know what inches are some of you heard
of millimeters yeah I'm just kidding
points everyone knows about points right
now this is basically what's new in
Android except these two are like the
identical DP and dip right so really
there's only two new things so DP is a
density independent pixel what that
means is if you have a screen of 160 dpi
then they're equal right if you can do
this assist 160 dpi is load the load low
density so if the screen is 240 dpi then
you know it does translate into 50% more
pixels right so in other words if you
wanted to scale it properly with the
screen density right you would simply
forget about pixels from now on and just
change that to DP it's very simple
whenever you use pixel there's really no
good reason for you to use pixel ever
again use DP that's easy okay on and
it's a real problem
this screen is kind of 60 dpi this one
is 240 right so everything if I use
picks up everything will just shrink
automatically on the screen right plus
it's a bigger screen so you get you have
quite a big problem right so that's it
and then SP is basically a scalable font
so if I say something is 30 SP
then that would normally be 30 DP but if
a user says I like everything
extra-large because I'm kind of blind
right then 30 SP may translate into 50
DP or something to accommodate you users
preference so you may or may not care
about users preference for example I may
say buttons
I'm not going to acknowledge user
preference but like title I'm not
because that messes up my layout or
something like that right it's up to you
so the bottom line is a one approach
better is as opposed to hundred deep px
is to do 200 DP which basically would
automatically adjust for the density see
how I became almost smaller however
we're not going to even do that because
what 200 DP on on this phone versus 200
DP on a Google TV 1080p you know large
screen 65 inch TV it's not the same like
this app would like to look like a tiny
little blob in the top left corner of my
Google TV right it wouldn't look good
right and Plus try to use the thing to
navigate to that would be like a
nightmare and then if you guys try that
it's really hard so you want you want
everything to just personally for the
large screen so to do that what you're
going to do is we're going to use as
opposed to hard coded numbers we're
going to use one of these following -
wait I said - and they're three it's
really to fill parent and match parents
are basically the same thing they just
switch to match parent as of 2.21 I
think no 2.2 but there basically is just
a new name for me of for a match fill
parent so I tend to use fill parent as
opposed to match parent for backwards
compatibility arrestor what that means
is take all the space that's available
to you what rap content is is take only
as much space as you need so one is
super greedy the Adoni super generous
right so for example the height of this
button should be what should we be feel
parent or wrap content yeah if I did
feel parent see how it takes all this
all the space that's not what you want
so I'm going to do here I'm going to do
a wrap content and now it just takes
vertically as much space as it needs and
then for the height for the width I'm
going to say what yeah because we want
to stretch it sort of like that again
you can you may have a different idea
what your UI looks like but it just
that's one kind are you going to use to
demonstrate so far so good okay so now
that one is fine notice what I'm going
to do is I'm going to do multiple passes
through these components so first I just
drop them onto the screen right so for
the second pass is to just fill parent
thread content third pass is going to be
to adjust text for passes something else
and so on so I'm going to do this it's
going to slowly get looking better and
better right I find that that sort of
tends to work well approach okay so I'm
gonna pick the second one which is the
the text area right so that one if you
remember we want it to kind of take as
much space as we want in the middle of
our screen right we kind of wanted it to
you know take that entire middle of the
screen okay so what's going to be the
weight of it so the weight is going to
be filled apparent fine what about the
height okay so let's take a look so now
fill parent BAM and what happened it did
still the pan but what's happened to my
button
so the point with this that I wanted to
come across is that we would feel parent
the the order of children matters in
other words sucks being the youngest the
youngest child right you get pushed out
right so then obviously that was the
case so so what do you do about that one
thing that you can do is you can say you
can use the weight and the way it is
let's see if there's a better
explanation with the way it is no see
there's not never documentation for any
of this weight is one of them components
that I can I'll mention here it's
basically how grid your generous
a widget is on a scale from 0 to 1 0
means don't care about anyone else 1
means fully you know obliged to everyone
else and it can be anywhere in between
so if you wanted two components to like
fight for the same space 50/50 then you
can just give them the same weight and
they can share the boots say r1 I want
all the parent space
I want all parent space okay how much do
you want how many so you can kind of
like use those numbers to kind of adjust
sixty forty thirty seventy rate ratio
and so on but in this case I'm just
going to say I'm going to fill the
parent but I'm going to be fully
generous to everyone else who also need
space so I'll put number one their
default is zero so that's why it didn't
care about anyone else so that gives me
that kind of feel the place but leave
others as much space as they want cool
and finally the top guy it's pretty fine
the way it is it's you know I don't have
any complaints about it other than one
minor thing I would do is I would like
to Center that text it's going to be my
title right so I'd like you to Center it
it sort of I would like it to look like
this in the middle right now the word %
turning or alignment is gravity okay
just a funny way of saying alignment in
Android so the question is how do you
does gravity and there are two ways to
adjust gravity well if you look at
gravity you'll find two two gravity's in
this zilean in one property here right
look there's something called layout
gravity and then there's something
called gravity somewhere here gravity so
which one so a layout gravity says how
this component is laid out within its
parent vs. gravity is how is the content
laid out within the component okay so in
other words if I try to see this blue
box if I try to Center the blue box
within its parent is what is it going to
do well but it doesn't have a lot of
space to maneuver so centering it it
actually doesn't do anything because
it's already centered the box is you
know it's like you take you took all the
space and I trying to center yourself
within the space you already took like
not a lot of space to maneuver so that
doesn't really do much right in this
case we want to position the content
within the box and that's the other side
the other gravity so by the way for
those of you who are not using Ubuntu
you can click on a dot dot dot and
choose Center and that will just do it
for those of you who are using Ubuntu we
know we you like to type so you go ahead
and type Center the daughter dot doesn't
work or hasn't worked until you know
recently but there is a new verse
just released today so I need to test
out okay so the point is if one set if
one of gravity doesn't work try the
other you know another way of thinking
about it okay so we now have this layout
right it looks like this pretty much now
what we would like to do is let's do
some cosmetic changes so first I want to
make that the size of the text larger
right but then I also want to change the
content of the text okay so let's start
with this guy now so let's start with
the content so um you would you would
probably figure out there is something
called text and that that's probably
contact the content right for that one
and for the text I could type status
update and boom that works but that's
not a good practice right hmm yeah so
yeah that's exactly one yeah I'm just
going to explain that yeah exactly so
just like we moved English quote/unquote
English from Java to strings.xml
similarly we want to separate the
concerns of the XML files so this disk
file that were working on is a layout
file it's concerned is the layout of the
screen it's not concerned with the
language right so we should still keep
language in strings.xml and then layout
in layout you actually want to separate
them okay although not happening it will
work as you can see that does not will
work that that works by the way if you
try to put a code like this into
on the source code repository to compile
it's going to fail because they run some
kind of blend some some kind of you know
to check the validity of the code and
that that breaks it but it does work on
the development environment however I
just briefly noticed during lunch that
one of the things that they mentioned in
platform is the support for pro where's
the what is a distinct ProGuard to the
side
anyway so that's something that I'm not
sure exactly what it does but oh that's
just the obfuscated right yeah but it
doesn't do any does it do any length
type checking on the code itself you
know okay this mo there is a there is
this file program that's now supported
so optimisation passes don't just mix
case class names see I'm well this is
all just got to optimize it to keep up
with classes yeah this is just the
obfuscator so far anyway the point is
that you shouldn't be using names like
that
status update so in other words what you
want to do is you want to define your
text in strings.xml now the long way of
doing it is to open up strings.xml right
click on add and create a new string so
click on add click on string and then I
would type in something like title
status update then I would say status
update um I like to also prefix my name
value my strings with what they are for
would by the name but just because this
is a pretty flat list right so over time
you're going to have 20 30 50 different
strings in this file right because it's
all flat so otherwise you wouldn't know
so you may not know how it's all
organized okay that's one so this is a
long way of doing it okay and now you
would go to status update here and then
under text you can select the other dot
and then pick it from picking from this
list
sighs subject right the shorter way it
doesn't work or doing work in Ubuntu and
that's to click on the daughter dot
click on add new string and then you can
quickly use this to add and choose right
away so you don't have to open up a
separate window for blah blah for status
update for string so so anyway that's my
text if you want you can change its size
to like 30 DP for example to make it
really big you know text size
okay that's about it I mean we can do
some other cosmetic stuff later on
yeah yes oh yeah so let me explain this
since we use that little dot which
doesn't always work ad string says look
at strings.xml yeah and then this is the
actual name or key of the string so it's
always going to be ad string slash and
then something yeah works again so I run
down with that one okay so the next one
is this one which is our edit area and
we probably don't want to have a default
text right because default tags would
mean you have to kind of like delete it
first before you can start typing it
which is very annoying right but there
is something useful oops in here which
is see what I have here please enter
your blah blah blah that's not a default
tag that's a hint so when I click on it
it does this in the start typing yellow
it just disappears right so that's
called a hint so what I'm going to do in
our example is I'm going to find text
I'm going to get rid of it first so now
there's no text to delete it
but then I'm going to find something
called hint and I'm going to enter a new
hint so I'm going to click on that this
time dot a dot new string you know say
hint stutters you know say something
like please enter your status message
all right so this is that click and
enter into right so just specify the
name and then the value it's kind of the
name Bali's kind of reverse then it adds
it and now I can choose it and now you
can see how it says add string slash
hint status and you can see that there's
please enter status message there yeah
yeah so this would be the key this is
the key and this is the values its
reverse so this is going to be r dot
string dot something right that's why
it's kind of like that but it isn't this
in Ubuntu has issues so you may have to
manually go into strings.xml right
the twerk moment the UI hints this oh I
just upgraded my Eclipse tools to ADT
version eight which is needed by
gingerbread Gingerbread yeah so I just
ran the table during lunch so I first
time I see this I don't necessarily
think it's more useful because I really
don't know but so yeah I don't know yeah
that's what it looks like okay so so far
so good on this please enter your text
all right so let's do it you guys do the
same for the button so we're going to
change the text of the button to
something like button update which we
already did so I'm going to do it
quickly because we already did this
tip tip I'm going to change the size of
the text to text size on my calendar 25
DP
me
now what you see where you changed click
on it the formatting all the property
all that property okay but make sure you
mean this is only going to work if
that's how you define it in strict
section all right right you guys get it
right so that that this point to
strings.xml and then this is going to be
a name of a property in strings.xml so
otherwise it's not going to work
so far so good
yes if you wanted to you would go help
so you can go check for updates actually
in a clubs help check for updates and
dev to check for updates to everything
yeah
for me it's nothing top did you can so
let me show you this way because it's
more accurate so that's that one so it
must exist under that name for that
workout
got it so kidding when you save
everything everything should compile you
should not have any red x's right okay
so is that I'm pretty happy with the way
things look graphically again where is
it uh yeah
so so far so good hmm you cannot undo
what no just check now
so you well you can edit like this we
can type
for us there's no say button so now when
you go status for the text
but in seeking status where as fine but
they exist find everything
god bless said and this one you don't
need change the text write some
different types the same idea just with
the difficulty about it it's not yellow
notice up there
exactly good because your text is all
out power to delete text in the text
go find proper a whole text here I'm
Bobby so text go down
ever got yeah so now now we've pretty
much any questions for okay so we pretty
much cab this you I I mean there's more
cosmetic stuff we can do but let's now
look at what the next step is so let's
just say we're happy cosmetically how
far we got it - right so we are sort of
done with number one okay so now we're
going to do number two right we need to
graphically we need to program the
bottom you want to do something when the
button is clicked okay
so out of this for prop five one two
three four elements that we have that we
have which ones do we need to care about
programmatically okay so this one and
this one yes and we need to know
programmatically what's typed into this
box and we need to know programmatically
when the button is pressed right we
programmatically don't care about the
title nor the layout because those
things are just there for cosmetic
purposes right okay so another important
component for out of this we saw a
layout right you saw layout with weight
gravity in text the only one you haven't
seen so far is this one here ID okay so
this one and ID is a unique identifier
okay and it's going to be necessary for
us to look up elements programmatically
in Java so first of all not every
element needs ID just the ones that we
care about need ID secondly Eclipse is
always going to put an ID on elements
and it's going to put AK one of those
default IDs so often you're going to
want to either remove them or rename
them right so let me show you an IDs
always pretty much always start with at
plus ID and then some unique identifier
why why is it the pole
us here because we get at string it
didn't say add plus string because drink
add string was referring to another file
where strings were statically defined
but here we're not going to have another
file of IDs when we say @ + ID blah that
means that we are dynamically right in
there creating an ID block it doesn't
it's not defined in another file like
string is right so in other words it
it's almost always @ + ID / right but
just if you kind of cared about why is
it wasn't there in the first place and
again it's just my hypothesis on that
not true okay so remember I got here is
at string we had add string in the sum
tax okay so back to back to this so you
can kind of see that Eclipse see if if
ID is assigned Eclipse gives it this
default ID edit X 0 1 + button 0 1 so
edit X 0 + 1 tells me exactly nothing so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
find that ID and I'm going to change it
so as opposed to calling this at the F
plus ID edit text 0 1 I'm going to
rename it to something that's a little
more meaningful and I use the same um
remember how might my convention is to
say what it is first followed by the
name so I would call this edit status so
tells me that it's an edit field right
so I selected the middle box the edit
text and it changed its ID to add + ID
added status like that
so Percival
so then button is going to be the same
idea default is ready their button 0 1
I'm going to change it to button update
because it's that's what the button is
so I know which button it is because
same you know you're in a medium-sized
project you're going to end up with 20
30 50 of these IDs so we also want to
some kind of way of naming them so that
they're a little more obvious it doesn't
have to be unique actually it doesn't
have to be unique you could have the
button update in different context and
use the same name it just you're going
to be careful I'll point this out later
on but when it comes to Java it's it's
an easy way to create a class cast
exception because they're all the old
type int so when you try to cast it Java
sometimes can you know it can't verify
that it's not Android is sort of
breaking some of the things that were
used to doing in Java like in Java you
used to need a clearly naming stuff well
Android kind of breaks some of those
things ok so that's sort of the the
problem with that alright so now that we
have that you know you can verify here
that you know indeed it's called edit
status in button update okay so now
we're pretty happy with this you know we
can do more cosmetic stuff like I said
but for now let's leave it so let's
switch over to Java let's assume we're
done with this so let's switch over to
Java so pin up your status activity dot
Java file
okay so I don't get it open okay so if
you remember our life's activity like
our life cycle for a picture we said
this is a life cycle of an activity at
the beginning it doesn't exist and then
it goes through these steps and then
finally it's in a running state so you
get to configure it somewhere along
these lines you can fill in one of these
blanks so whereas you may not care about
filling in all of these blanks one that
we almost always universally care is
this guy on create on create is sort of
like almost twelve is you Cabot it's
sort of like you're in it or your
constructor it's a good place to set
stuff up right make sense so that's why
in here we have on create already
pre-configured to us and again at this
point it just causes super and then it
sets the content view to that XML file
which we just did so it says do this
point to that file there right our
layout status XML right we talked about
that dream so let me just explain this
line 11 this line 11 actually does a lot
to work okay it does a hop a hell of a
lot of work so what this line 11 says it
says set a content for this activity to
this layout what that intern does is it
does what you would have done in a WTO
swing it basically it's equivalent of
opening up this is our XML file but by
the way that we worked on and by the way
if you want to make it look pretty you
can go source format and that usually
makes it a little prettier camp just so
that we can because you know when you
work on the other mode they just kind of
throw stuff together right but if you
now look at it this way and so so you
show you
a whole bunch of useful commands in a
clip source format is one of them or
ctrl shift F again so now on so this is
our layout this 14 lines of God how many
of you did they WT or spring okay so if
you were building this in a WTO swing
you would have to have you would have to
say button my button equals new button
my button dot said tax my button got set
color my button got set ID my button
blower then you would freeze element you
would have done that right in other
words it's the equivalent of for each of
these elements creating a new java
object creating a new java object
creating a new java object leading new
java object setting the property for the
java object having property for the job
of setting a property for that java
object same property for another job of
another java object another job and so
on and so on in other words this 14
lines of XML code would have been
equivalent of 40 50 lines of Java code
make sense so what this line this
innocent little looking line here does
is it opens up that XML file pointed by
this resource so it knows AHA we need to
look at this XML file opens it up and
for parses it and for each element
creates the object for each attribute
assigns a value to that property of that
object then creates another object adds
it to the previous one if it's a child
right and sets up appropriate attributes
and so on and so on right so this loops
through this entire text that process is
called inflating from XML so we are
inflating Java space memory space Java
object tree right from XML and that
tends to be a little expensive because
whenever you're creating objects it's
expensive malloc is expensive right
and so that that that that's what what
what happens there so that line inflates
XML
the point is after this line of code the
oldest objects actually exist
in Java memory space in other words XML
is a throw away right so XML is just
there to help us to write code that then
it's going to on the fly become Java
code and that XML is never seen again
until next execution right so that's
what happens right so we could have done
all this without XML ages XML makes it
easier first to write right so what that
means that is now I have I have access
to all those things in in Java so the
ones that we care about are these the
edit text with idea that cells and the
button with ID button update right so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
define them a class globally and then
we're going to loop them up initialize
it so here's what we're going to do
we're going to define edit text so edit
status and button button update
now why are my edit text in button
underlined red right you need to import
them so you need to go look up what they
define figure out the package and then
go open up the import and importing it's
quite annoying solution to that is
source organized imports or control
shift oh bam just figures it out the
imports it in hides it from you okay you
see that it was lightning fast when my
team missed you so I'm going to undo it
so see how I eclipse even hi it's import
for me because it's just noise right
okay in secret this is missing so in
regular job if I was using notepad or
something I would have to go look up
where this is and I would have to go
import Android dot and I have to now
figure out which package and so forth
right but since we are paying the price
of using eclipse might as well use it so
what you can do is you can go source
organize imports BAM and it figures it
out for you okay
it even hides it back from you because
it's not important so far so good so I'm
not going to be like whenever you you
know whenever we run into this in the
future I'll just do control shift oh
you're not going to see it just BAM caps
because it's it's a very quickly
shortcut every once in a while runs into
an ambiguity because there's multiple
something you know multiple possible
imports I'll mention that because one
such case is going to come soon so I'll
mention that let me get it cool so now
that we have those two imported we can
now find it from the memory space so
there's a there's a useful method that
that helps us look up a view that's in
the memory space by ID it's called find
view by ID for any of you that are
familiar with anybody familiar with
JavaScript you know find element by ID
so there is
very much the same thing so my edit
status is going to be added text and
then you get a type find view by ID or
if you don't like typing you can do
control space and then start typing find
and there it is right so just control
space and Eclipse figures out what is
possible to type right and then it's
going to be ID is going to be our dot
and then look how our gives you options
and then you pick ID and then it's your
dot and then it should find edit status
right in there in other words wait after
you press dot and select as opposed to
type so this whole thing looks like a
long line but don't type it because then
it just leads to titles right so
similarly for button so button update is
going to be button and then control
space find you by ID r dot ID dot button
update BAM done I'm not a fast typer but
just like use the completion right
so far so good okay so now we basically
inflated our xml and we found our xml
from the java memory space that's what
we've done again so our next thing to do
would be to do to handle that button to
actually do something with that button
right so how would you how would you do
this in a regular AWT or swing you add a
listener right yeah so we're going to do
exactly the same thing here not that
stuff looks pretty much the same so so
as you what you can notice is that other
than that we are augmenting the Java
with xml it's pretty much back to a WT
or swing so it's a very similar approach
which is that as opposed to explaining
what the button looks like in Java which
you can we don't have to because we can
inflate it from XML that's the only
difference right okay
so I'm going to do I'm going to say
button update dot set on and there it is
onclick lesson
you can just start typing set on and
should find the trade
so question how many how many of you are
familiar how interfaces work in Java
okay
interfaces like you guys know how Java
interfaces work and all that okay
inner classes is that too strange of a
word for some hmm not too strange I've
heard it before
okay okay I mean not like sometimes like
a lot of companies are going to it's
people who have just been doing si for
their entire life so like even the word
interface is very strange so it's pretty
standard okay so what I I'll show you
like a nice little trick and not trick
but the useful thing so I need to do way
this works is we're seeing button when
you get clicked notify somebody okay so
it's kind of like we're registering
somebody with the bottom you're saying
button call this guy when you get like
that's how the mechanism works okay
now that this guy goes into here we need
to specify what this guy is but whoever
it is needs to adhere to an interface to
a contract that says onclicklistener in
other words to be able to get a phone
call that button got clicked you got to
be somebody who is a click listener
somebody who's capable of listening to a
click meaning a java enough you know you
need to implement Java interface right
so I have couple of choices here I could
define a whole new class and make it
implement that interface I could define
an anonymous inner class make it really
tight code but really confuse the heck
out of most of you okay um so out of all
all evils the easiest the least evil
thing is to to make status activity
implement onclicklistener
okay so here's how it works I'm going to
say call this you know what this refers
to right
so this refers to the class itself right
so when you say this that means not
class but instance itself to status
activity right so I'm saying button when
you get clicked call this okay and let
it know that you got click but rightly
Eclipse complaints it says whoa whoa
whoa this is not going to work because
this is not implementing that interface
right you can put your mouse over it in
Eclipse tells you why it's not working
you know you know kind of a very
encrypted language the metal set onclick
listener in type view is not applicable
blah blah blah right but that's what it
means it says you know you know what
like whoever it goes in the parenthesis
needs to be on click listener so what
you can do is you can go in this list of
quick fixes and pick the last one on the
list which is basically says let's
status activity implement on click
lesson right so what that does is check
it check it out check the top right
corner of my code so as I click on that
oops see how it added this implements on
click lesson so claps fixed my code now
this which refers to status activity
indeed does say that it implements on
click listen yeah I didn't type it that
it's got typed in right however we now
have a second problem it's nice that we
say we implement something but we don't
drill it well here we're just stating
yes we are compliant but we're not yet
fully compliant to be fully compliant
you go and you put your mouse on the
second problem on the new problem and
you say add unimplemented methods and
that now makes you compliant but
actually by actually providing what it
means to be a listener which means to
have a non click method
yeah I'm going to do this once again
because I know it gets a little
confusing so so first I set button set
onclicklistener so set the guy who
listens to you to this a clip said this
doesn't compile because this is not
valid listener should I put the mouse
over that I pick the last one on the
list set on let on click let's start
activity implement onclicklistener
so click on that that adds this to it
but it's still not valid because it says
is just saying that I implements and it
doesn't really make me implement
something right it's like I it's like I
can I can claim to be you know you know
banker but if I didn't go to the bank
school I'm not in don't have a
certificate I'm not really a banker
right so this guy is just claiming to be
a listener but it's not really being a
listener to be a listener means it must
implement on click so now you go here
and you say add unimplemented interface
methods and bam it adds this here and it
even creates all to do right do you guys
know how these to do is little work I
ignore them but there's a feature
there's a window and whenever you miss
the window you go into Windows and it's
called task list so if you care about
that it shows you all the tasks that you
have outstanding so if you have a little
to do like this it becomes actually
something that goes into the task list
automatically okay oh window show view
but yeah hi I I don't use that so I just
ignore it
so I usually you know in a bigger
project it may make sense but for
education I just delete that right
um it doesn't really matter anonymous
inner classes is one of those things
that it's a it's a religious belief
right and you there's nothing you can do
about changing people's minds about that
about 50% people think that's the worst
thing you ever happened to Java it
totally breaks all the rules of like
object orientation isn't that a lot the
other 50% of people think that that's
such a nice time-saving convenience
right just for those of you who are not
familiar with that I'm just going to
really quickly do this the opposite way
and then I'll rewind it to bit this but
basically an if I need the listener here
I need some I need a class that's
capable of being a onclicklistener
so what I can do is I can implement the
class here new on click a listener right
and and what I can do is now say so like
this and then say add unimplemented
methods and what I'm doing is I'm adding
a brand new class here without a name
instantiating it and defining at
all-in-ones so it's very it's very you
know in a way you can say it's clean
because I just need a little something
to drop in right in here and that's what
that the what this does but makes it
somewhat unreadable especially to people
who are like newer to Java or you know
like you guys are usually getting just a
refresher on Java and so on so that's
why um we'll be seeing code like this
and the reason why I need to explain it
is because you're going to be running
into other people's code because it's
quite often like this right but for now
I'm going to rewind it to the previous
less evil which is make this be a
listener click here say a dunny make it
a listener them and then say here I done
implemented them and now we have a
placeholder to do some stuff
as you can do methods 152 signatures you
another one is dialog entities who you
might have clicked what do you have
under EEO under imports you probably
imported or it could have collided on
something and it imported or wrong it's
imported a dialog onclicklistener
right yeah so just delete it and click
control shift to all again and it will
say okay I have a conflict which one and
pick a view over instead of dialogue
yeah so that that could have happened
because of the class not class path
issues okay so you know I can run this
at any point you know just to kind of
see that it's running it's not really
gonna do much at this point but I just
want to show you you know in the end of
the interest of keeping it all
incomplete at all times there it is boom
right and I can say something yellow
click on update nothing happens right
you know it's like we're building this
organically small steps in small
increments you know constantly winning
but so it may not do much all the time
but at least we're feeling good like so
it's it's an app it's working right ok
so then so I don't got that you can
compile it you can on it and kind of
works what does it show you let me sync
okay so what we're going to do is we are
going to gather the value from the
button and we're going
log it okay and then we're going to see
how the log file works so I'm going to
simply say string status is going to be
edit status dot get text you may have to
say to string because get text returns
you and editable okay let's go I get the
string that was typed into the box I
simply asked the widget the Edit status
to get its tax then convert the string
okay
so far so good okay so I want to show
you how to log now you know we're
building this incrementally so we don't
have to do gigantic steps one is no so
we're going to do small incremental
steps so one step we want to do next is
I want to just log this to a father to a
log file and introduce the log system to
you as well so there's something called
log and you can specify then the
severity level so you can do a log dot V
for verbose log dot I for info log dot V
for error log D for debug there's
actually even a log dot WTF and it
doesn't stand for what you think it's
dense it stands for what a terrible
failure yes and I'm not making this
stuff up and it's an Arabic should never
keep captain okay so yeah how
appropriate that I'm not picking stuff
up so in other K in other words which is
now going to say dot d for debug right
and you simply say a tag and a message
so tag could be anything I usually use
for a tag like the name of my class so
it may be something like status activity
it's just something that makes sense to
you it's just a tag so you can look it
up later on right and then the message
is just a message you know on click with
status plus status it doesn't really
matter some kind of message now when you
do control shift oh this time around
you're almost almost guaranteed to get a
conflict because there are multiple logs
available right just like you got
probably with the dialog so when you
guys get this you're kind of gonna use
your own common sense so is this our log
from Android util log or from Apache
common
logging hmm yeah this is Android we're
not using Apache just some somewhere it
collided in my class path so that's why
you know sander it it's totally
different like Apache has its own class
log that is used for its own stuff yeah
so it just that they use the same name
so enter etcetera so eclipses okay you
want me to import but I found two in the
same name which one I don't know which
one right so
so far so good okay so save it and so
save it run it install reinstalling it
bam bam
okay so now what we have is we have it
here and if I say hello click on update
okay presumably it worked with or either
worked or it didn't we don't know yet so
we need to now figure out how to read
the log file
everyone kind of got something that they
typed again so let's figure out the log
file so with as with most tools they're
sort of two approaches to at all one is
via Clips the other one is command-line
okay so you can use these tools that the
chip wood SDK they're all SDK tools but
they're just eclipse gives you sort of
Eclipse interface to that versus a
command line so let me show you eclipse
first so Eclipse gets a tool called log
cat
it's actually an Android system called
locket that has all the log information
in Eclipse you can view it via a locket
window now this locket window you could
open it by going to window show view
yada yada
however it's already probably open under
a different perspective so eclipse
because it's got zillion in one thing
that it can show you as opposed to
showing everything at one screen which
wouldn't fit you would need a very large
screen right what it does is it
organizes things into something called
perspectives so you guys should have a
DDMS perspective here if you do not then
click on the little plus and see if you
have it here because maybe this is not
big enough right if you still don't
then go other other and then find the
DMS perspective there okay
but whichever way it takes you to open
it initially click on the DDMS
perspective and should open up this
other perspective so far so good
so in this other perspective you should
have something called log cat right
there and should show you a whole bunch
of stuff if you guys still yeah
sometimes log cat is at the bottom like
this hiding like that so what you can do
is you can expand it because I don't
like like down here it's really hard to
read stuff in those three mini lines
right so what I would do is I would take
it and I will drag it out here and make
it thick we can drag those windows
around right right
yeah there are a lot of messages but
we're looking for the one we filtered
under status activity so let me show you
so for example what I could do is I
could now filter based on specific
either verb or super business so for
example I can say only debug messages or
only info messages warning warning sir
only errors right so those will be
different ways that I could that I could
look it up here right or what you can do
is you can click on the little plus and
then you can create a new filter and if
I could create a filter called for
example status activity and my tag
doesn't feel and you can filter based on
tag fit or something else and I'll
filter based on tag status activity and
boom there it is
yeah so if your locket is empty you may
not have selected the device so make
sure you click on the device here now
you have it yeah yeah well it's not it's
based on tag on the tag so whatever you
use to tag in here but I happen to use
the name of my activity let me take a
look at it let me show you how to look
at the locket from the command line so
here's how we're going to do it from a
command line control C so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to do adb adb logcat
and this now gives me a locket from via
command line so adb space locket is one
of the adb subcommands you saw adb shell
earlier so you can do a to be locket so
if I say update see how there's a status
update right here okay so I tend to I
tend to prefer using locket on a command
line because I can just keep running it
is a tail in the background and it works
really well on versus switching back and
forth in Eclipse for some reason in a
Mac it's really non-responsive
like it takes forever to switch back and
forth okay
however if you were to create a filter
on a command line you know you could
look in the documentation it tells you
that you say tag column what so for
example it would say something like
status activity comb star right that's
what the documentation would tell you
but that still gives you everything so
what took me a little while to figure
out that you also get to tell it what
not to give you they say star silence
and that's not very obvious so so you
got to tell it what you do wanna listen
to so tag column severity but at the
same time you go tell it what you don't
want to listen to which is severity also
attack home severity so all the tags
silence all the tags other than the tax
status activity show everything it's a
little a little convoluted I think but
but you know it works pretty well once
you get really know I mean you could you
could create some kind of pipe or you
know you could pipe this then well it's
logging no not really I mean where it's
logging is is going to a file on a
system partition which you don't have
access to as a developer well so so you
guys want to post this to the Internet
okay so what we want to do is you now
want to post this to the Internet
okay we have the text we're ready to
post it there's we need a library we
need to make a web service call okay and
we will need to figure out what the API
for Twitter is right so you could go and
you would figure out what the Twitter
API is or you could use you could use a
third-party library that is you know
already packages this for you so what I
did is I use this third-party library
called J Twitter so it's basically just
a plain old Java library nothing to do
with Android wear just a plain old Java
library that basically you know does the
mumbo-jumbo encoding on the URL for
Twitter API back in port so that we are
not wasting time on stuff that is just
javac is nothing to do with valuable
Android
right so and it kind of tells you how to
do that you say Twitter mean or create
new Twitter and then you can say Twitter
dot said status okay however their
library was broken so I fixed it and I
told them what the problem was
but I don't think that they have updated
so as opposed to downloading from them
you should download this for me okay
on the first of all I really same
network are you and can you guys one can
you guys see the following IP address so
one 128 107 12 167 I suspect not but I
just want to give it a shot you can yeah
are you guys are no guest network you
cannot okay that's fine so here's what
I'm going to do I'm going to find that
zip file to like have it code let me see
number seven it is no matter which one
I'll take this jar file and I'm going to
copy it copy and I'm going to put it in
my lambo project here and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to upload it to
this place one second I'll tell exactly
where you can get it from the turret to
to so here is where the fall is so try
to download it from here
and save it in your project so in your
Yamba director
to unzip it it is a zip file so Onizuka
just save it in the root of your of your
directory
I think you did yeah huh
make sure you type it properly let me
see but you know what let me just drop
it on a USB key and fast it that way
when everything else fails that's what
does it that's what God crazy USB keys
for okay put it in the root it should be
like this in your project so if you have
your project Yamba should be right there
where everything else is all right so
and then in Eclipse you should in your
project because it clips doesn't know
that you just drop something infill
project you should right click on your
project and see refresh and now passed
on to you as well
so if you should just refresh the
navigator
I love windows do you want to restart it
now do you know this is on safe do you
want to download some sample
applications and it's write the energy
in CSV to be all from you or you come oh
you know SCP I have an idea but I didn't
see you Oh where's the Flemish way he's
been living activity whether I was so
into the end you can see I'm in a
collection which may not see the river
but I'm idling I feel better after a
struggle between community but then boy
my sister
yeah I mean normally in a VM you just
shows you you can add right there right
can you see how it's been drawn now is
good okay so you guys added here so
we're almost done so now when you what
you need to do is you need to tell
eclipse to fund to add this into your
project okay so here's what we're going
to do right click on your own your
project click on properties and then say
under Java build path libraries click on
add the jar and then find a jar so again
so you click on the properties of this
then go Java build path library and then
add a jar with that sometimes well
that's why I did a refresh first of this
so you can yeah so you can yeah mm-hmm
that's that's where yeah try external
jar that's fine terms mom yeah you can
just drag and drop it into a project or
you can just copy it and then click on
refresh and then it should find it my it
should see it in there
so let's call you add external libraries
to a project reg that's basically what
we're doing we're adding an external
library to this project
hmm no it is not going resources it goes
in the root of your project it should
not be in your resources actually
yeah yeah you guys have a weird setup
normally it's easy from Ubuntu taught to
mount up to mount the USB so you go your
right-click on your on your project and
you click on properties okay and then
use it you click Java build path
libraries add jars and then you add it
you find it in you add so ultimately
you're going to have it in here that is
basically adds it to the class path so
the Java compiler can find it
inside of your project you need to be
inside of your project so just drop it
in your Yamba directory that's the root
of your project yeah yes oh right click
down on your project and say you know
properties Java build path libraries add
jars
I know when you guys got it Java build
path libraries add the jars
you can see that yeah
sotae twitter is the name of the library
this is the name of the library the
object we're using is Twitter yeah that
was just what they you know that would
they named it so and at this point so
this establishes the connection to that
online service and now I should be able
to do something like Twitter dot set
status and then I can say status right
that's our status that we have so
so far so good okay so now you can run
it so it's installing it melting sugar
pile you can run it don't forget to
control shift oh when you add weather
right because it needs to import it
right you can run it and what's going to
happens when I say hello from building C
what you should crash okay
it should crash well you don't have any
other option no the MS force closet it
doesn't really do anything other than
it's already closed our app is really
done right so the point was that when
you see that message I mean let me
create a message again so if I run this
is that yeah so when this message has a
very simple meaning so hello
you click on that what this message says
let's read it together
it says read the log cat okay so
whenever you see this message on think
about it you just go automatically and
you read the lock yet okay that's what
it says you don't have to use your break
okay I get the reader a lock yet because
that's what the answer really truly is
and now what they like about Java
is that it's very verbose and easy to
find the answer so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to say it'll be a lock at
to run my lock yet damn and C in Java
it's really easy to eyeball your
exceptions so here's how you read it we
go to the bottom of your lock yet
you then go up until you find the
beginning of your exception it's easy to
find it because you can eyeball the
whitespace right then okay so that's
what my exceptions
right it's right here okay
Twitter exception Java net socket
exception permission denied
okay so what do you think is the problem
no it's actually okay fair enough you
would it's possible to think that that's
username and password it's exactly so we
don't have a permission to use Internet
I don't have permission to use internet
so whenever your app let's take a look
at the permissions because we can
discuss that I want it to crash it first
and then talk about it so on basically
whenever your app tries to do something
that's potentially dangerous right like
read write to your filesystem read your
contacts and SMS is make phone calls
connect online access sensitive data
whatever that is the application needs
to own the key s to have that permission
the way it works is you as a developer
you say in application I need these
permissions right then when the user
downloads the application the user is
prompted at install time do you grant
the permissions to this app that it
needs so it's up to a user to say your
name it's everything or name nothing
right so on if a user grants is
permission only then the application
gets installed and then he has those
permissions so we what we mask for those
permissions okay so here's how you ask
for it you open up the manifest file
because all that meta stuff goes in the
manifest file you can go under
permissions tab let's do it via the tab
okay you'll click on add and it's not
permission but it's users permission so
you add users permission because we're
not adding a new permission we're adding
a request for a permission we're asking
for a permission
we're not defining a permission we're
asking for to use an existing one right
so you say okay and now in this pulldown
you find a permission called
Internet so Android permission internet
that's beyond Ubuntu huh you need to do
it manually
Ubuntu doesn't for this pulldown also
this is what I created this is work for
you guys ok worse I mean worst comes to
work you open it up in notepad whatever
right and you just basically need to you
need to type in this let me let me do it
like this yeah you just need to type in
this so uses permission blah blah blah
you can use a bad way if you're lazy in
typing you can also do this in in a
clinic XML you can do control space use
this AHA there control space oops
control space it doesn't work like an
Android name and any type of anymore so
now when you guys three type that you
read on it and if everything is nice and
dandy yeah
so far so good okay you get it I mean
hello from building C click on update
yes so that that's what it sounds like
so let me let me open up my : let me
open up my if I go here and I click on
refresh and it says mine worked a few
seconds ago which one is theirs okay um
I don't know let me see if I got an
exception
I got an exception too and let's see
what I know no I didn't that's an old
exception count rate limit status that
that happens
yeah yes built-in sort of mechanism so
if you try to submit the same message
multiple times it's going to fail so
change the message in should not fail
yeah
and this is our just our very first
version so we don't have a lot of error
handling or anything like that okay let
me take a look at that so the permission
that we want is the in Android
permission internet okay so if i refresh
this let's see so it looks like a bunch
of many many of you kept get successful
posts right so getting here let me look
okay so so seems like seems like for
many of you it's working right I mean we
can see that bunch of posts are posted
so that's a that's good right so that
means that
it's working so anybody still having any
problems you know No
so what you should know now but now what
we've done so far is we talked about
it's hard to create a simple user
interface right so what we've done is we
define the simple user interface we said
you know they're a bunch of widgets for
each widget you care about layout width
layout height
first and foremost and then if you need
to find it programmatically you need to
define the ID right we also said the
author strings into a separate file
called strings.xml and then once you
have all that's nice and dandy in XML
eventually switch to Java in Java you
defined here let me close this first so
you can see it so you define those
elements then you look them up right
after you inflated the view so that's
what we did so far on this and then we
attach the listener to our button okay
and then we did something for the
buttons of what we did for the button is
we simply you know created a new
instance of Twitter and we set the route
the route API for it because we're not
using Twitter and when we set set status
and that this does the actual network
all and post it to the network way okay
so far so good on that how do you stop
it
you can't well I mean to have it stopped
you simply leave the screen so BAM now
it's stopped in other words in a stop
state you don't ya know not eclipse the
device I mean yeah you you turn off your
phone I mean you can use the task on
some devices you have the task task
manager and you can ask the system to
kill it it may or may not right but it's
not why would you want to stop it
right I mean why would you want to
destroy it in other words yeah okay so
any questions and stuff we've done so
far okay so we're going to stop with
this for now in terms of the new stuff
right we said we're going to leave the
last hour and we only have like half an
hour actually left but I wanted to I
want to see is there any question some
stuff we've done so far again because we
more cosmetic stuff certainly that we
can do to this I just wanted to kind of
get it nice and dandy and working so you
can actually verify that it's working
you have a little application it's
actually collecting the data making a
network call and posting that data
somewhere right so what you're going to
do is tomorrow we're going to pick up
with this where we left off and we're
going to cover the graphic stuff as a
refresher so it's a good way to kind of
pick up well I mean they do if you're
talking about the actual project they do
talk to each other right but but the
things are loosely coupled so the way
you see I mean this guy doesn't to this
guy to start it up this guy does write
stuff into a file system which this guy
then reads from the file system right so
preference is username and password is
going to be there yes we hard-coded in
here
so right now you you can't sell this
application because nobody can change
their user name and password so next
what you're going to do is we're going
to create another screen which is going
to be which we're going to launch from
this screen I'm going to say star dot
screen and so on so they will talk to
each other
because make us so these components are
loosely coupled they are independent
just like a web pages on a website are
independent you can enter a website or
that page or dissipate but they do share
data so they shared it in multiple ways
what we're going to do we're going to
see how that works they're going to be
sending intents among themselves they're
going to be using the common application
object to share the data and
functionality they share the data by
sharing it for example this one writes
it to the file system this one reads it
from sorry the database that's another
way of sharing the data so they do talk
quote/unquote with one another yeah but
that sort of also call your design stuff
you kind of you keep it loosely coupled
collection of things of main building
blocks
