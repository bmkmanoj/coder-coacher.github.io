time today outlining where I stand on
some of the issues that are affecting
our country so the way we're gonna do
this is we're gonna basically bring up
an issue I'll talk for two minutes and
then we'll do Q&amp;amp;A on it okay that's
sound good oh the counter-argument
damn leftist media actually will step
outside this planet for today and in
case during my planetary visit here we
don't talk about everything you want to
talk about I am on what is
affectionately known as the Twitter's
and if you are also on the Twitter's you
can find me there and we can communicate
and I have a debate but just stick to
the damn format okay no crosstalk so
before I jump into all fun things mobile
I want to step back a little bit and
talk about something that's a lot older
and it's this concept of something
called mass media all of you who have
been sort of users of mass media for
many years and the mass media is
essentially any technology that can be
used to communicate with a really big
audience over large distances right so
this is the first form of mass media
that entered our planet print books
pamphlets newspapers magazines and a
print was around for hundreds of years
as the only form of mass media so the
things that made print tick and work
really gotten grained in our heads and
are still in our heads today in the way
we act and the way we approach other
forms of media there's really a glut
sort of an absence if you are not a
glutton absence of other forms of media
for a long time after print then in 1890
we had recordings you're probably pretty
familiar with those things
records tapes then we had cinema so we
had motion pictures then we had radio
the ability to broadcast those audio
signals so after several hundreds of
years of nothing going on every ten
years we had a new form of mass media
hitter plan this is a time of crazy
change right radios stuck around for
quite a while about 40 or 50 years and
then in came television television also
had a pretty good run and then the
Internet
now I don't think anybody will dispute
that things like the internet television
radio are forms of mass media there's a
guy who used to be a Nokia executive
called Thome Ataman who writes very very
long blog posts and he also wrote this
little book where he put out the theory
that mobile is the next form of mass
media I think this is really interesting
to examine whether or not he was right
because there's a fundamental difference
between treating mobile devices as small
screens right oh this is the smaller
smaller web browser it's just a smaller
computer as a computer you can bring
with you anywhere so thinking of mobile
that way versus thinking of it at the
same level as something like television
like radio like print as a form of mass
media right and so if you'll indulge me
for a couple minutes here I want to
drill into this because if we agree that
we can think of mobile as a form of mass
media then I think it changes how we
start to think about the concept of
designing for it and what better way to
talk about mass media and things growing
then to look at babies this is how many
babies we make per day congratulations
you seem to have figure this out I
applaud you there is however bad news
which is this is how many iPhones are
sold per day
so our nighttime activities seem to have
shifted somewhat right this is sort of
the new touch interface it's much worse
if you're an Android user because
there's 1.3 million Android devices
activated per day now let's look at I
pod touches and iPads and that number
goes up to about 562 K throwing Nokia
smartphones throwing BlackBerry
smartphones and you're looking at about
2 million mobile devices entering the
planet daily compared to 370 1000
children entering the planet daily think
about that for a second remember our
former governor who starred in a movie
called Terminator I think it started in
a very similar manner so this is pretty
extraordinary and if you think about you
know what makes something amass medias
and that can communicate to lots of
people work scale is one thing right
there's got to be a lot of it so that
you can actually communicate on a
massive scale
the other interesting thing to look at
is what's the impact of these things
coming out then coming at us so quickly
if we look at how long it took a
technology to hit mass-market adoption
and here I'm going to look at the United
States and the way I'm defining mass
market adoption is 40% of people of sort
of consumers in the US have one right
once they hit forty percent adoption in
technology it's a mass-market product it
took the telephone about 40 years it's
off my chart it's probably like over at
that halfway to that poll or so right 40
years that means if you're a telegraph
company you got 40 years to figure out
your telephone strategy you take your
time you know just do all the tapping
you need to get those who wiretap iudex
or whatever they used back then to
communicate in corporate environments
together electricity in the computer
took about 15 years there's pretty fast
but you'd assume everybody would want
electricity
like now right radio mobile phone
internet getting closer to five years
and the fastest technology ever to hit
mass market penetration in United States
is our friend the smart phone I took
about three years so contrast what
happened with the telephone remember if
you're the telegraph company that 40
years
to figure out WTF phone if you are an
Internet company or a computer company
or a mobile phone company you have three
years to figure out WTF smartphone and
as you can see the disruption that's
happening in the space many companies
are struggling to figure that out right
it's happening really really fast and
the other thing that is interesting in
terms of what this proliferation of
devices that's hitting mass market
penetration quickly is looking at what
it's actually doing to what we know as
personal computers right personal
computers the things that people use in
their day-to-day lives to essentially
get stuff done now right the internet
the computer you can pretty much do
anything you like on it when the
personal computer sort of came out there
was a bunch of companies trying to
figure out what is it gonna be you had
companies like atari commodore amiga
remember these guys right and as with
any technology what usually happens is
these early guys shakeout and one or two
folks remain so Microsoft the glory days
Apple hanging on by a thread right but
what happened over the past three or so
years is so remarkable that we should
zoom in on it a little bit that is
Android that is iOS taking this kind of
bite out of the personal computing
market that's because people aren't
using these phones is just you know
black rectangles to make phone calls on
they're doing all the things that they
used to do on personal computers they're
buying things they're talking on email
they're taking photographs right the
most popular camera on Flickr is the
iPhone 4s the second most popular camera
on Flickr is the iPhone 4 go figure
so not only are there lots of these
devices they're being used in all the
ways that personal computers are being
used and then the last bit to understand
whether or not mobile fits in this mass
media model of being big right one
definition of mass media is is it big
can we broadcast out to oh we got about
6 billion mobile connections today 10
billion coming really quickly by the end
of this year and this data coming from
Cisco who makes all those switches that
flick things around on the Internet
right so they got a pretty good read on
how many of these connections are coming
in and out by the end of this year they
forecast that we'll have more
connections than people in the world
about seven billion about 7.2 billion
people or something like that all right
and it's growing like crazy so do we
agree it's massive yes anybody my cage
match over that one okay so it's pretty
big so it fits our first definition of
being a form of mass media the other way
we can tell something is a new form of
mass media is can it do the things that
all the forms of mass media that came
before it can do well in the case of
these little devices that half of you
are probably on right now and the other
half of you have in your pockets it can
do everything print can do you've got
magazines newspapers can do everything
recordings can do you can have all your
music on there you can have all your
movies all your TV shows you can listen
the radio and you can wet browse the web
and connect the Internet so this little
thing can do everything all six forms of
mass media that came before it can do
just like the Internet can do everything
television radio cinema recordings the
print can do and television can do
everything right you get the idea
but mobile can also do things that none
of these other forms of mass media can
do it's always with you it's always on
you can use it at a point of inspiration
you can sort of use it with as a digital
interface to what's going on around you
or who's around you so not only can I do
everything the previous forms of 6 the
previous six forms of mass media can do
it can do more yet every time we have
this shift like when we went from radio
to TV what do we do well we take what we
were doing before because that's where
our heads are at those are the things we
understand we take those and we apply
them to this new form of mass media for
example when we moved from radio to
television remember I said radio had
like what 40 years or so to cook sort of
incubate what did we move over to TV
well the idea of sponsorship came from
radio people sponsored radio programs if
you've watched television recently you
may notice this thing called ads in
between there that's the business model
we learned on radio spokesmen are people
who literally spoke for a product
and perhaps most telling this is a list
of old-time radio programs that migrated
from radio over to TV you probably
recognize some of these names when these
first programs shifted over from radio
to TV this is what they look like they
sensually put a camera in front of the
people reading these broadcasts the big
innovation was when they put like a
poster right a visual element it took us
many years to realize the true potential
of television and what it can actually
achieve for Humanity all right it wasn't
immediately clear that radio is not TV
some early print was around for hundreds
of years and even today because it was
around for so long a lot of the stuff we
do on the web on something that has
eaten radio cinema TV recordings print
right it's even all these other forms of
mass media what are we put on it well
let's put pages together alright let's
look let's look at a grid layouts and
let's focus on things like typography
I'm saying these things are not
important but they're not really the
defining attributes I mean who in the
audience believes that a picture in a
box is the best form of advertising in a
medium that has eaten television radio
cinema recordings and print write pens
on the picture is pornography aside
now the web is not printed many people
will say this but it's still the way we
do things not a lot of people practice
this and here we are again we have this
internet thing that has been around for
a good number of years and we're moving
over to this mobile thing and I contend
that if mobile is really a new form of
mass media it is not the Internet we
knew before but I don't think this is
bad to have this evolution right it's a
natural process that's my natural
imagery Scott Jenson who is a early
Apple guy did a lot of work at Google
Mobile it says it really well so the
general practice is we sort of copy what
we knew before we gradually extend it a
little bit and finally we figure out
what works right and I think it's good
to do this as long as we recognize
that's where we're at right so to give
you an example of this sort of how what
kind of impact this can have this is
PayPal they started out as a mobile
payments company then they shifted over
to the web because the mobile stuff
wasn't really ready yet but they kept
that mobile payment so you know they
started making a little bit of money and
then it went up a bit and then BOOM all
right copy extend a little you know to
do find something that's working and
other companies are actually finding not
only that mobile can give them new
opportunities but people are more likely
to buy more likely to subscribe have
higher engagement all right a lot of
times people assume mobile is less but
it can be more if you approach it
differently and companies that aren't
sort of doing this in a how shall I say
address of matter are being taken there
anyway because their traffic is shifting
over to mobile our friends at Twitter or
friends of Pandora have already flipped
the switch that they have more mobile
traffic than they have desktop internet
and PC traffic and other companies that
are maybe not there at that inflection
point are seeing tremendous growth and
as a result really being inspired by
what they've learned from mobile and
taking that to all
different experiences right by working
in this new medium they're finding
things that they didn't discover in the
previous forms of mediums they are
working in and trying to bring that
elsewhere so what I want to do if this
sort of contexts right behind us is I
want to look at what have we been doing
in the previous form of mass media the
internet what are the things that we've
been doing on the desktop web for
desktop software how can we take that
and adapt it for this world we're living
in today this mobile world right this
new mass media hopefully you guys agree
with me that this is a significant shift
and then look at how we can build on
that and actually go beyond just
adaptation and optimization today and
really try to move forward in
interesting ways
however I want to do that by looking at
the most boring stuff possible in the
universe dramatic pause login form how
freaking boring can software design be
if all you're doing is making a lot of
form you guys all know how to do this
right it's what to input fields a little
checkbox that says keep me logged in it
doesn't nothing and then there's a
button alright you know what I'm talking
about
Luke why would we talk about something
as boring as logging what's the point of
this well I contend that login is
actually a huge problem
the average person authenticates that is
they log in to at least 15 websites
today I think this numbers under
reporter I think it's much higher than
this possibly even double some of them
forget a password hydrolysis has ever
happened to you you probably are highly
intelligent people you've never
forgotten a password right when I was at
Yahoo five to ten percent of sessions
logging into Yahoo which was the biggest
Internet's I was at 15% of all online
time spent in the u.s. at the time
hugely dramatic five to ten percent of
all those sessions were password
requests the number one request to
Internet help desks is password problems
and I really just don't understand how
people have problems with this stuff
it's just the photos mean I you know
like I've been trying to find a reason
why Loggins could be broken it's so
clear right I mean characters in the
first second and third positions can't
be identical characters in the second
third and fourth business can't be
identical you can't use words that are
Texas child or the months of the year
right like everybody knows this crap
I don't see why logging in is so damn
hard so what happens if we just take
what we've been doing for the desktop
internet let's say login screens well
here let's take you know Microsoft's log
into hotmail still one of the largest
email clients in the world and we're
gonna take this Windows Live experience
and we're gonna make sure it lays out
nicely on a mobile phone we're done
right well no all the problems we have
that I just articulated from the desktop
Internet are now on a small screen and
they're probably worse because you're
using fat fingers to try and type things
in the screen is small there's all kinds
of stuff going on around you right it's
probably gotten worse and if we just
made sure things lay out okay
maybe it would be not too bad but
instead this is what happens this is
eBay they have a login screen for the
desktop and they have a mobile web
experience and there's something that
they chose not to put on here and even
when I try to log in they don't allow me
to figure out what my password is
because they've removed this I forgot my
user ID or password feature nobody on
mobile will do that it's too small why
would anybody try to recover their
password on mobile the screen is small
forget it now I had the fortune of
talking to a very large e-commerce site
who was in this position they had a
mobile web experience where they did not
have the ability for people to get help
logging in there was no you know I
forgot my password sort of help and I
talked to them and I
I couldn't have asked them about this
and they shared with me the percent of
customer service calls related to login
on mobile how many people were caught
what percent of people were getting on
the phone or typing into customer
support to get help logging in what
percent of their total customer service
volume was related to this issue I asked
you intelligent people of San Francisco
to give me an idea
15 percent 50 percent none percent that
none is technically not a percent man
but thank you hey we're gonna go bigger
than 50 90 Thank You gentleman over
there
90% of all their customer service
inquiries were related to login issues
we won't say who did that but I will
point out that eBay recently updated
their sites to include a I forgot my
user ID password
well you can say yeah I Bay you know
they're like the 90s Internet right they
don't have this mobile thing figured out
at all let's look at one more modern web
2.0 company like LinkedIn like then it's
got this awesome touch experience right
except they got this thing that says
forgot password here which they chose
not to include here so if you try and
log in there say try again dude let's
keep guessing
I know anybody have a LinkedIn account
two of you of the two of you who have a
LinkedIn account when do you go to
LinkedIn what takes you there when do
you go to the site email you get an
email right somebody invites you you see
the email you're gonna go there okay uh
of you who get invites through email to
LinkedIn how many of you check your
email on a mobile device the same - okay
so let's assume this is really popular
and I would contend that this is
actually the most popular way to get
into LinkedIn you get an email you go to
LinkedIn right somebody wants to connect
with you so you'd think they give a crap
about this worldwide 36% of people now
check their email on mobile devices it's
the most popular way of getting in the
site so obviously they spend some time
thinking about this flow right Here I am
I get an email Tim would like to connect
great Tim let's connect so I am going to
hit that accept button and then I get
this I already have the app what do I do
I already have the app what do I do you
say know things you have to write you
can't you have no other choice say you
hit no thanks okay then you get this
because they're doing this cool
client-side empty body tag and they
basically load through JavaScript all
the webpage that renders all client-side
template thing awesome right 20-second
weight with a spinning ball so that's
awesome
go technology and then you go in and you
type in your damn email and so sorry
please try again because who knows
you're putting password and there's no
way to recover it this is their number
one flow and you know what sucks even
more could this possibly get worse yes
you know how it could get possibly worse
I can't even read the damn thing
I can't make this crap up people this is
the Internet and you know what what did
Lincoln do recently will they put this
little forgot password thing up that's
kind of cool and by recently I mean like
a year later this is Walmart they kind
of sell a lot of stuff on the internet
and on the desktop experience they have
this option that says you can buy
something without having account this
guest checkout introducing guest
checkout to an e-commerce experience
they'll generally boost conversion 30 or
40 percent because people don't want to
get married to every website right they
just want sort of a in and out kind of
they don't want to get tied too closely
to they uh they have an iPhone at night
anyway this is a good feature unless you
happen to be one of these people who
uses the internet on a mobile phone in
which case this is what they tell you if
you don't have an account please visit
the Walmart com full site which is sort
of the equivalent of saying okay drive
to Walmart go buy a desktop PC you come
back create an account and you can buy
something on Walmart thankfully our
friends at Walmart have redesigned this
and put in an option to create a new
account so what's the theme here well a
Stephen Hoover in his book designing
mobile interfaces has a really nice
phrase where he says mobile should not
be a dumbed down limited experience and
what you see time and time again is
companies that choose to leave things
out of their mobile experiences for
whatever reason a very common one is
this I mean oh people won't create an
account on mobile it's too hard people
won't try to recover their password on
mobile and they leave these things out
for these kinds of reasons and they
really quickly realize that no in fact
people will do everything these are
computers they just happen to be
portable computers so first lesson here
for adapting and optimizing to today's
world is not removing critical features
and there's a couple of there's small
things we can do right we could take
advantage of some of the cool things
these mobile browsers can do like they
can essentially set an input type of
email so that if you set that when you
tap into the email field you'll get soft
keys that have a little act and a dot to
make typing an email faster you can turn
off stuff like auto capitalize and
autocomplete so that
you don't have cap sensitive fields or
things that don't make sense to
auto-complete getting in the way of some
of those features
it's kind of small nice stuff you can do
that with password too but uh passwords
actually a bigger issue so what's the
deals password well somebody very nice
at Apple decided to instead of just
showing you dots when you enter the
password you know that thing you see the
dots right what they're gonna do is show
you a character for a second and then
turn it into a dot so the time you're
looking down at the keyboard is when
they show you the letter and then you
look back up they've conveniently given
you the dot again it's really kind of
them and this is one of the few times
I'll quote Jakob Nielsen and agree with
him he's done extensive research on this
and shows that masking passwords not
going to help you security but it's
definitely gonna cost you losses if
somebody's got something in a shopping
cart they go to recover passwords 75% of
the time they're not gonna buy what they
had in that shopping cart all right this
is quantifiably an issue in terms of
usability and as Jacob will tell you
it's worse on mobile because mobile is a
magnifying lens for your usability
problems remember our fingers are fat
right there's stuff going on around us
the screens are smaller there's all
kinds of things which turn usability
problems and larger screens at the
bigger usability problems on smaller
screens and mobile form factors so what
can you do instead well here's our
friends over at box.net and they have
this mobile signup page and they have a
big button here that says show password
so you can actually see what you're
typing imagine that I personally think
we should flip this and have it say hide
password because of smart defaults
meaning whatever option is in place at
the beginning you can have most people
will use and why I think this is fine is
because if there's a mysterious dude
behind you in a trenchcoat and you're
typing in your password just put your
phone down move right here's the other
thing if somebody's got in the other
scenario here is oh well somebody could
have a camera pointing at your phone
yeah well you know what you got this big
damn keyboard that you're typing things
in on that you
actually map finger gestures - and when
you type on it it makes the letters
bigger so what do you think you're going
to get the password from the tiny little
dots there or the actual keyboard that's
on here it's sort of a nonsensical thing
when you actually start to think about
it
companies that have lots of people
logging in like the Facebook's have
figured out this is an issue on mobile
and so what happens on Facebook's mobile
login screen is when you try to log in
they'll actually come back and say hey
their password was incorrect we're gonna
show it to you in plain text right now
so you can actually see what you were
doing
don't worry it's still secure mellow out
dude or you can say well just send me a
message you tap that you say enter an
email or phone number then they send you
a link you tap that link once and you're
in
alright so taking this issue of getting
into their service on mobile very very
seriously and they're adapting and
trying to optimize and move beyond these
standard interfaces we can always use
things like input masks so for example
if you're logging into the now-extinct
MobileMe service you have to log in with
an at me comm email and so what they do
is they put in this input mask which is
always going to keep the at me calm
visible and as you start typing right it
stays there if you hit an act it just
ignores it and as you enter things sort
of helps you by not having you have to
enter that at me comm Twitter does
something similar in their mobile
experience you log in with your username
which starts with an act so they use an
input mask to keep that app there
permanently and as you start typing in
you don't have to go hit shift find the
ant symbol you just start typing
characters right all these things are
small things that help you manage errors
Cora Rock goes a little bit further in
their mobile experience if you try to
log in with an email it doesn't
recognize right away they're going to
say hey there's no account here you sure
this is the email you're using so don't
even bother getting to the password
field and hitting the button and we're
gonna prevent you from making an error
right up front they do something a bit
more interesting my opinion because by
default they have this option checked
let me log in without a password and so
when you log in the first time with an
email address and password the second
time you come in all you have is this
little picture and you just tap on it to
log in now you can exit out go back to
the login form or turn
that off but no username no password no
button you just tap your picture and
you've logged in this is why this login
with Twitter or login with Facebook
stuff is so darn popular these days
there's nine hundred and ten million
Facebook users 50% of them are logged in
right damn now and half of them use
Facebook on third party sites yes you
use their API to enable login on your
service you hit their server comes back
says this guy's logged in let you in if
you're not logged in the Facebook at the
time you have to log into Facebook this
however introduces new issues which is
before we didn't know which email
address we use to sign up for a service
right now did we use Facebook Twitter
Email one email - how do we create the
damn account so while we're solving some
problems by giving people just this
one-click access we're creating new ones
when we did our little startup last year
this is what the sign-in screen looked
like you can enter either your name or
email address you type that in and you
basically do a search for yourself hit
that button and then you can see all the
different ways you can log in and your
any voters in which is Jason Batory
who's a original designer of mints site
has applied a similar pattern and
basically here you start entering your
name it does search you find yourself
and in this case I find that I can login
with Twitter
now let's address the two most common
questions that come up from here isn't
this a security issue showing all the
users in this type-ahead there's this
thing called Google where I can go and
search for any public webpage that's out
there in fact it's more efficient
because they have an API that I can hit
very more I can hit very more right so
if you have public profile pages there's
no additional exposure to anything
that's not already public and searchable
through a search engine the other
question that comes up is what do you do
about duplicates well they show their
picture to their name and you can allow
them to enter an email address instead
if you have hidden accounts okay there's
no public profile pages you probably
don't want to surface the names of
people in your service but if you're
doing things like multiple social logins
chances are you're building something
that has public profile pages so how
would this work on mobile well let's see
what voters and did turns out they
didn't do anything and it kind of sucks
so what actually works better on mobile
still and you see many people using this
is just using the buttons and giving you
a tap-in since mobile devices you're
generally not changing browsers so much
you just log people and bury the logout
button and not deal with this issue and
was people changing devices more
frequently this is where this feature
actually comes into play so I tap login
and there I am and at this point you
guys me saying okay Luke this is cool
for your little social networking type
things but I work on serious complex
stuff right I can't do this
frivolous crap well this is a company
called simple that's trying to recreate
what a bank is and their premises hey
we're going to focus on the experience
of banking and one of the things they've
done is they've really addressed this
issue of login and instead of doing this
password thing what they're doing is
using pass phrases pass phrase yes it's
easier to remember more secure use a
group of words and they even have look
there's the option to show your password
and hide it right so here even a bank
can improve usability of things like law
and screams it's not I'm in this domain
I can't do anything right
and I want to sort of make the
contention and I'm going to emphasize
this a little bit later usability and
security are not at odds these things
are not enemies all right you can
actually make things that are more
usable and more secure because right now
these dots and these complex pacts words
are actually very unsecure you know what
happens when you require having somebody
enter the birthdate of a French King one
lowercase letter two numerals a piece of
punctuation and the calorie count of
McDonald's french fry
they've write it down on a damn piece of
paper they tape it on their monitor they
put it in a plain text file on their
computer because they can't remember it
right it's actually the least secure
situation well rant again about this
again as you can tell this is sort of a
issue for me but let's put all this
stuff together and what can we do to
sort of optimize and adapt the login
form for today well one we're not going
to remove critical features so we're
gonna get people the ability to get help
can't remember your password can't
remember your login will maintain that
we're gonna use these input types and
attributes autocomplete autocorrect off
and put type email will actually show
the password by default let people hide
it and we're gonna save passwords plus
be flexible right you can use your email
or your full name or you can use your
username or email wherever you feel most
comfortable with we're gonna be flexible
and when you see this in action here's
our lowly sign-in form I'm going to
enter an email address we don't
recognize it so right away we can say
hey we don't know that are you new here
stop people from going any further if
they enter an email that we recognize we
can sort of visually reinforce they're
on the right track give them a picture
doing their name whatever you want to do
by default we show their password if
they want to make things hard on
themselves or they have a situation
where somebody's peeking over their
shoulder and they want to be more secure
let them hide it alright that's fine but
by default we give them the easy way out
then remember me is checked by default
so the next time somebody comes to this
form it looks like that one tap notice
I've sort of made that X bigger because
we have big fingers and
frankly the Cora thing just way too damn
small for any sort of touch UI and so
now again you can sort of turn this off
if you want or you can hit once in log
right in and I've been talking about
doing this for mobile devices right but
there's no reason a lot of this sort of
vigilance for login can't help us on
desktop laptop tablet and god knows what
else is coming next in the future and
speaking of God knows what's coming next
in the future let's look at some ways we
can sort of move beyond just adaptation
and optimization and really just rethink
this whole login thing for the new type
of medium we now have in front of us
it's a couple techniques here here's one
which is I'm just gonna have one button
and when somebody taps on it since this
is a phone I'm going to send an SMS
message in the background I'm gonna
subscribe to SMS messages coming back
and I'm just gonna validate that this
person has control over this phone
alright we do this all the time today
with email addresses we validate
somebody's in control of an email
address
generally phone numbers are deemed a
little bit more secure than just an
email address which can be more easily
spooked problem is you could do this
seven years ago and web today on the web
you can't there's a w3 standard that's
kind of doing this there's this Bondi
standards trying to do this and you
can't really implement this what you can
do though is what Microsoft Windows has
done so you may be familiar if the
Windows Phone which has really
influenced what they've done with
Windows 8 in fact this is a really
interesting example of sort of mobile
first operating system design and both
of these things are touch interfaces and
here's how you log into your machine in
Windows 8 they have this feature called
a picture password and the way picture
password works is you pick a picture
maybe of your family or something like
this and what you do is you make a
series of marks so you can draw kind of
a circle you can make a line you just
have to create three gestures and then
you can do taps as well and that becomes
your picture password next time you want
to log into your computer you can just
sort of slide this intro screen up and
there's the picture of your family and
in order to log in what you're going to
do is you will basically circle the
father and
connect the two sisters and tap the
mother-in-law in the nose and you're in
now I can't believe these words are
coming out of my mouth but I will say
them this is Microsoft taking a very
humane approach to computing what's
what's more human than like drawing some
pics and marks on a picture right it's a
picture of my family look us through
cool my mom whoa I'm in versus right I
second third and fourth character cannot
match to use five underscores and you
know the average batting score of some
goblin whatever you get when I'm talking
about
that's not humane right that's like a
machine stuff this is human stuff and
some of you in the audience are now
thinking what the heck is this idiot
talking about right he's telling us to
show passwords telling us you know don't
use these passwords like is he's totally
compromising all security that we so
desperately needed but remember my point
earlier that usability and security are
not necessarily at odds with each other
and let's look at this with the
Microsoft example anybody have a pin on
their bank account how many numbers is
it four five okay four five right what
are the ways to gauge the security of a
login system is to see how many
permutations it can have so you can sort
of handle brute force attacks right so
for your bank about ten thousand or
maybe a hundred thousand combinations to
try in order to test them all if you
move to alphanumerical characters you
significantly increase your resilience
against brute force attacks if you do
the kind of things that we do on the web
you know you have a minimum amount you
can use numbers or letters you can
really bump that up here's how
Microsoft's multi-gesture system fares
against brute force attacks it's an
order of magnitude different right so
while it's humane and you can sort of
drawn pictures it also ultimately can't
have greater security at least in the
case of brute force attacks against it
all right so usability security not
necessarily at odds in fact you
and find examples where they work well
together yeah so could you do this in
the web browser for example let's
thought what do we need to actually make
this happen well we need touch gestures
right sort of being able to recognize
where touch gestures happening we need
the ability to have images so any mobile
browser right now that has basic touch
gestures can tell you when the
touchstart touchmove touchend so you can
card the textures and we need image
upload which we actually have not had on
the most popular mobile browsers for a
long time but now as of iOS 6 we have
input type file where we can say give us
something from the camera or from the
photo library and androids 300 which has
had this for awhile but hasn't had a lot
of penetration I think between Android 3
and 4 the total amount the total percent
of that's like 21 or 22 percent right
now still a couple hundred million
devices but and it also has camera
calorie selection so technically we
could do this in the web browser
speaking of Android they have this take
on a login and so the way you do oops
let me turn this on the way you do login
on an Android device is you sort of
stare at it and it asserts that you are
friendly because it detects a smile and
sort of maps your face detects a face
implements facial recognition technology
which becomes your login and so now
someone else tries to authenticate into
that phone by attempting to be friendly
it can deny it access and then when you
come back to your phone they recognize
the things you let's you in regulate and
you'll know that she says see it works
if you doubt the Technic the security of
this feature rest assured that this
man's phone was not able to be
infiltrated by a clever look-alike sorry
I use an iPhone as my regular phone but
I got a couple Android devices and once
you start using this thing and then you
go back to an iPhone we have to type
these numbers you're like look at the
phone like don't you know me damn it
I hold you every day I carry you with me
all the time and you don't recognize me
it's like stepping backwards five years
in time right could you do this in the
web browser well for that you'd need
something like getusermedia API which
gives you sort of a local multimedia
stream which by the way is now in stable
release of chrome I think that's chrome
21 it's in Opera Mobile and opera and
it's in Firefox Knightley's you
essentially grab a webcam stream start
doing processing on it and do facial
detection first and then facial
recognition algorithm second in the
backend today you're in so we could
start doing some of this kind of stuff
even on the web is exciting in Japan
there was this hurricane hurricane sorry
it's not a hurricane there's an
earthquake which led to a tsunami but
equally devastating effect and what
happened was a lot of people got left
without any kind of identification
including their cash cards so one of the
banks came up with an advertising
campaign to help these people out which
is you are the cash card right and then
you sort of use biometrics to allow you
to gain access a lot of actual ATMs in
Japan use this right now to allow you
access into your bank now could we use
this Sun mobile well there's no reason
we can't interpret not only which finger
is down but combinations of fingers as
well Apple actually filed a there's a
patent that they file that was made
public where they can detect which
finger is down where on the screen so
you could sort of have like either a
pattern of fingers to put down for
authentication or a combination of
fingers and series regardless of which
one of these you think is interesting I
think this gives you an opportunity to
sort of rethink
idea of login and I'm not suggesting
Microsoft has the right answer Android
has the right answer or you know Happel
is encroaching on the right answer but
none of these things look like
traditional login forms right they're
all sort of rethought in this new medium
based on the capabilities and
constraints of what these devices can do
and so when we look at something as
boring as login what we can do is make
sure that our existing web pages or
software pages app pages whatever going
to call them layout okay right they fit
on the screen sort of step one but then
all the problems we had stick around we
can instead go the extra mile and really
try to optimize and adapt these
interfaces for mobile and you may say
Luke that seems like a lot of work doing
all this little diddle diddle diddle
right well remember one of the things
that makes mobile a unique mass medium
is it's always with you it's always on
it's available at the point of
inspiration so when something strikes
you wherever you happen to be in line at
the Blue Bottle coffee to San Francisco
reference what else do you people do I
don't know at the fixie bike Stan right
I don't know is there like a bike stand
where you sort of sit there on your bike
I live in the suburbs I don't understand
city life my inspiration strikes you why
wouldn't you want to make the process of
getting into a software application or
web service as painless as possible
right boom I'm in ok I can do my thing
instead of having you fart around there
with the damn password and the login
screen and the errors and all that stuff
so that's what we can kind of do today
to optimize and adapt but looking
forward I think we can do a lot more
right and if all we're doing is focusing
on layout and making sure things fit on
smaller screens we may miss out on a lot
of bigger opportunities again I'm not
suggesting Android or Microsoft has it
right but they're thinking very
differently about this thing all right
which I think I find very inspiring
remember this copy extend and find new
forms principle I lay it out at the
beginning right this is that fine new
forms area so we're finally starting to
get there which is really exciting
so login quite boring right
what could be more boring than login I
should we do another one in case you
guys do one more yeah
okay what could be more boring than
logging presidential debates sorry what
login
what could be more boring than login
dramatic pause
check out everybody's how many check out
forums have you seen right these things
haven't changed this the Stone Age guy
on clay tablets entered first name the
chisel in second they repeat password
damn need new stone repeat password
field and I'm only going to show you one
statistic to illustrate what's wrong
with checking because you say Luke you
know the web has been around for 22
years one of the things we surely have
nailed by now is check out right
I mean ecommerce digital economy after
22 years you think we've been doing
pretty good at letting somebody buy
something on the interwebs well last
year
3/4 of all shopping carts were abandoned
that's not so bad until you consider the
year before that it was better
we got worse how are we getting worse
and I again this is what I just wrap my
head around and I can't figure out why
people have problems with checkout right
here's Dell computer guys and they have
mobile thing to buy and all the stuff
that you find on the desktop of course
has been moved over to mobile including
the extension for your mobile number
daytime fax number and extension and
when you get to the end a half screen
devoted to I do not agree to buy after
filling out full screen of information
you laugh this is the web I'm not I'm
like making these things right all I'm
doing is using the internet and I find
holy they do this so our first
lesson here is reduce effort and this is
not the same thing that I talked about
earlier about removing critical features
right if something's important it's
important that we
of screen size but there happened to be
all kinds of things they're just not
important period as evidence of this I
have case study upon case study like
Expedia which has a checkout forms a
travel search and a booking company and
on their checkout form they had this
little optional field called company
that confused the hell out of people it
was optional he didn't have to fill it
in but they ended up removing it because
they found people were confused by it
and they got 12 million more profit
overnight they found 50 to 60 of these
things so those of you who know the
maths can probably figure out this is a
larger number than my brain can figure
out but pretty important stuff
especially if you make your money from
allowing people to buy things from you
so our first thing for checkout is let's
remove unnecessary questions but then we
can apply some other interesting
principles as well and this general idea
of keeping people on the keys and just
reducing overall effort if somebody's
got to buy something do we really need
to structure their name in all kinds of
different ways and if we really want to
be international to a certain extent
it's much better just to do tell me your
name right and we've removed optional
fields like the middle initial and what
we've done is we've allowed people to
stay on the keys so when they get into
an input field and that keyboards up
they don't have to go foot's and through
little input fields they can just stay
there in a tap tap tap and move on maybe
not so interesting for name but
significantly more interesting when you
look at what Dell is doing with phone
numbers I would like to contend that I
can take these 16 input fields and
reduce them down to 1 you've ordered a
computer in case something goes wrong
let this call you right maybe you can
convince me that ok they deal with a lot
of businesses which is the level
extensions ok let's give them the option
to add an extension but let's make that
secondary right let's tone that down
let's not expose it by default research
I've done over the years shows if you
can hide irrelevant form controls from
people that don't matter to them you
will create forms that are easier to
complete higher satisfaction lower error
rates if you really twist my arm and
beat me up and sort of knock my designer
sense out of me maybe I'll agree to have
add another number on
but still we're gonna keep it
constrained and not expose sixteen
fields by default and by the way that
complete absurdity of this interface is
this is a phone it has a dial pad it is
made for entering phone numbers why the
hell are you doing this sorry can you
tell I like give it a crap about forms
or something if I come across as an ass
just let me know okay
another nice thing we can do is we can
tell them this is an input file type of
telephone and what we're gonna get is
this big nice dial pad for phone numbers
right input type tell is actually pretty
widely supported here it is on iOS here
it is on the androids so you get a big
dial pad here it is on the Amazon silk
inside of a Kindle Fire again real nice
big fat keys for entering phone numbers
and the dial pad in particular is
they're sort of optimized for capturing
just numbers it's really nice if you
really want to be nice to people and
we're doing sit we're dealing with like
let's say specific formats for phone
numbers what we can do is create an
input mask so by default sort of show
them what the correct format for that
input looks like and as they start
entering it will maintain that format
right so they don't even have to worry
about should I enter a dash or space if
they enter anything that's not a number
we'll just ignore it in our input mask
and let them enter a number what about a
dress can we do any better here we've
got this sort of optional four digit
extension maybe what we can do is merge
zip code together and for the people who
need that four digit extension we'll
just be flexible in how we parse that so
they can just enter the - four digits if
they need it if not we'll just ignore it
so you know what sucks this thing sucks
right like 50 foot state long thing and
it's awesome if you live in Alaska
because they just tap in and you hey
this look probably the only time anybody
will say it's awesome if you live in
Alaska about dot dot right unless you're
talking about moose jerky but so if
you're in Alaska this is a four tap
operation tap the thing get this
tap Alaska tap done right if you live
anywhere else it's tap
look-look-look-look blip tap tap done so
it's you know like a five to six tap
operation so maybe one of the things we
could do to make this a little less
painful is instead use a text field in
which case you tap it once you tap two
keys you have done then you're still a
four tap operation so to address the
lady's question and then I'll come to
your question what if we just do enter
your zip code right and from which we're
gonna infer state and city because you
can get in the u.s. at least you can get
the city and state by this differs
internationally some places you can
enter a postal code and get like
everything for people all their places
it's not such a big deal it's not as
robust but anyway here in the US if we
enter a zip code we can get a city and
state back unfortunately sometimes we
get more than one city or state back so
we'll use our friends style pad here
we'll enter a bunch of numbers and we'll
come back with what a drop-down menu of
the options because you could have up to
two or three well do you really want use
a drop down here remember you tap it you
find it you tap it again what if instead
we use a stepper like this and most it's
gonna have two or three values so here
from a touch perspective you just can
tap this thing up or down to shift
between these two or three values
looking at this some of you may be
saying well what about this could we
just do like that right
this one actually makes me a little bit
nervous because I personally believe
people are gonna start entering their
entire address in here including city
state and zip code right it's just not
structured enough you need a little bit
of structure and for the record I have
generally been a bit opposed to this
enter zip to get your city and state and
I'll sort of lay out why anybody
consider themselves a designer here okay
so only a couple of you I'll give you
guys a design education for the rest of
you who don't have it so in order to be
a designer all you need to know is if
you look at an interface and you see a
lot of text that's what we designers
call a usability issue if that text is
read
that's what we call a biggie usability
issue if that text is red and bold we
call it a very big usability issue
okay so congratulations you're all
designers now let's test your knowledge
is there a usability issue on this form
yes let's look at it after entering your
zip code above you must select click
this highlight your city state
combination from the display on the left
after selection the city state will auto
fill in the appropriate category what
right so I've been this is when I see
the sorts of things when people try the
city state thing I get a little bit
concerned but I'm open minded right I
don't want to be biased by my
preconceived notions of what's working
on the desktop web so I went over to the
web or mobile site to see how they did
it there maybe it's a different thing on
mobile and I looked around I was just
sort of trying to figure out was going
on something was missing and I couldn't
put my finger on what was missing oh
yeah you couldn't actually buy anything
on the mobile thing so there was no
checkout form which I mean it makes
total sense it's not like anybody's
actually going to purchase something on
their mobile device right and if they
did they probably buy a lot less it's
not like any company out there can make
any sort of business selling things on
mobile devices and if they did it
probably people wouldn't buy that much
right I yeah so I understand what about
this got to pay somehow right so pick a
credit card type enter the information
did it to do well what if all this could
just become that we have some of our
friends from square here and they've
implemented this interesting pattern on
their application that works like this
essentially you can set this to an input
type of number but if you do that you're
gonna get this sort of wonky numeric
keypad with all these dashes and
squiggles and scratches and what I
really want is what happened when I set
it to input type of tell because I got
these big numbers right that's pretty
cool well it turns out at least on the
web what you can do is sort of use an
html5 pattern and say hey it's gonna be
a text input but I want you to use this
0 to 9 and
patter which will trigger this big fat
keyboard thing which is really nice
because now all you got is numbers and
it turns out in order to process
everything you need for a credit card
all you need is numbers so you start
entering your credit card numbers and we
show you the credit card type you have
if it's a valid credit card number what
we're gonna do if it's not a valid
credit card number we'll sort of tell
you right away if it is a valid card
credit card number we'll just sort of
slide over and now you're entering month
year and the security code and you're
still on these big fat keys alright so
now you enter month year we show you
where that security code is on that
credit card type you enter it there and
tada that's everything you need to
process a payment all right so reduce
the number of controls and inputs and
the keys if you want to see a nice
example of this look at square that's
the man who implemented right there so
nice round of applause or so he tells me
it could be could be a lie I can't
verify these things
everything on the Internet is alive by
light so that's kind of cool right some
of you may say well that's tuner I don't
know if I could use there's like two
cutting edge
well we can even make different
improvements one of things we can do is
remember sort of my peeve for these
drop-down menus I just think they kind
of generally suck like the drop-down
menu should be your input control of
last resort it's often people's input
control first whoa I'm sorry you had a
question earlier yep it they help
prevent errors but at the expense of
usability in some cases and the
expensive effort so you have to make a
trade-off is strict error prevention
more important to you than quickness of
input or efficiency of input or not
right
so with something like this one of the
things that we can do is if a mobile
browser supports type of months we can
get that which on something like iOS
will give you this multi picker menu
where you can spin the month spin the
year take a combo again this is the idea
of reduce input right consolidates stuff
if we don't support type of month we can
use this where we give them a little bit
of input mask and in the input mask will
just sort of show them the format will
only allow them to enter numeric numbers
which is excuse me by the way how things
look on your credit card anyway right so
it sort of matches that input type and
this is a nice example of this principle
of progressive enhancement which is if
you got really nice inputs like month
you can detect that that's supported
then we show that if you don't have that
but you got Java Script then you can use
the input mask but by default we're
going to do with people the to select
menu so you have full accessibility when
we basically do is enhance up based on
the capabilities we start with this can
you support month yes no let's use the
JavaScript version right so everybody
has something that works for them but we
make it as good as possible based on
what you can do on your particular
device it's a sort of nice baseline for
building to multiple device capabilities
what else can we do with Dell oh this
one's just pretty damn easy right why
don't just do this note I don't have a
checkbox why do I not have a checkbox
has anybody gone through one of these
forms filled in all the information hit
submit and then realize they missed a
little checkbox that says I agree yeah
it happens to all the damn time eight to
ten percent of these things have that
error and conveniently they will remove
all these sensitive fields for you right
so you go and hit that you miss the damn
check mark now you got to retype your
credit card your expiration date your
CVV your password or whatever you enter
so we can just do this and really
streamline things another interesting
thing that's happening here is we have
these sort of larger fingers and right
in between these two drop-down you know
two radio buttons there's this link it's
actually much worse at the point where
you decide to buy something on Dell this
is the checkout button and it's smooshed
right in between the apply coupon and
the click to call sales button which
kicks you out of the eighth the web
browser and into the phone so we can
probably do some stuff to improve it
this is probably the most important
action here why is it being given equal
treatment to apply coupon
now if we take all this stuff together
and this is the thing that really has me
encouraged I think we can create check
out screens that are 2 maybe 3 input
fields long what that's on Della's
checkout form had 16 input fields just
for the phone number
I'm talking about having the whole form
down to 3 fields well let's say you're
saying let's say you are selling
something digital like a book like a
movie like a comic like a game like
anything these days right everything is
pretty much digital so what's like
you're selling a book digital book well
we want to give you a receipt or we want
to send you the link to go download it
so we're gonna ask you for your email
address we'll set email type will use
that payment input mask pattern maybe
we'll ask for cardholder name depending
on how you do payment processing you may
or may not need different bits of
information you can actually get away
without cardholder name you can get away
without billing address you can get away
without zip code it's just a question of
how much risk you want to take in but
will consolidate name into one field to
keep people on the keys will reduce
controls so it's just purchase and read
your book now and you may say that seems
like a lot of effort Luke why should I
bother remember of phones are always
with us always on available at the point
of inspiration which means you can buy
things whenever you think about it
anybody used this thing called Amazon
Prime yes a couple of you Amazon Prime
is essentially one-click buying two day
shipping alright when somebody goes from
using Amazon to using Amazon Prime they
go from spending four hundred dollars a
year to spending nine hundred dollars a
year on Amazon why because it's just too
damn easy right Oh book ok whoa no I
think I need some toothpaste diaper it's
just you buy everything right those of
you Amazon Prime do not just buy
everything because like oh look at the
humidifier I don't think there's a
clearer example out there that shows
reducing barriers increases conversion
right if you reduce the barrier to
purchase and link down to something as
simple as one click which unfortunately
amazon has
patent on and guess who the largest
licensee of that patent is it's Apple
and they're once in the App Store and
iTunes right they sort of have one-click
thing every time you do that they pay
Amazon something it's that valuable got
a company like Apple pays for every
single transaction so that's a lot of
optimization again for mobile but
there's no reason we can't do this for
the desktop for the laptop for the
tablet for God knows what's coming next
right and speaking of God knows what's
coming next how can we improve checkout
in the future well maybe we could do
this you know hey you got an address
book on this phone fill this information
in well that's okay but now they got all
these scary dialogues on this stuff
right app wants to request full
information to your address book and
send it to server or anonymize it's
really scary sort of freaks people out
so until that gets resolved this isn't
really that that interesting what is
more interesting is a feature like
personal pickup from Apple and we look
at it as a way of rethinking what
checkout is how does this work well you
go into the Apple Store app in the Apple
App Store you know what I'm talking
about right the Apple Store app in the
Apple App Store and you want to buy this
juicer not that kind of juicer and you
say you can either ship it to you or you
can pick it up in the store when you say
pick it up in the store it'll show you
stores near you you'll use geolocation
to figure that out and you can say pick
it up here maybe this isn't the exciting
part the exciting part is if you do buy
that and you say you're gonna pick it up
in the store you walk into that store
and somebody comes up to you and says
hey Luke here's your iPad how the hell
did they do that
well it turns out they have a Wi-Fi
geofence perimeter that you're a phone
because you bought it on the phone
because you use the Apple App Store on
the phones always with you right they
detect when you come in the store they
have little iPads or iPhones that plop
you on the map and say here's where the
dude is that bought that macbook air go
and give it to them can you do this on
the web well you need to run background
process
for this sort of stuff right now the web
workers proposal doesn't have access to
geolocation maybe a little in the future
but right now this is sort of out for
the web in Korea there's a grocery store
chain called Tesco they're number two
they would like to be number one but
they don't want to be number one by
building more grocery stores so if
they've done is they've gone to places
where lots of people are like a subway
station and they created these
illuminated sort of poster boards and
they look like grocery store shelves
except they have QR codes as a designer
I'm fascinated by how they decide
there's two leaks and just one blue
thing I'm a who write like who makes
these decisions it's not like a visual
weight thing maybe it's a paid for
placement thing or right they negotiate
deals for this fascinates me but anyway
what you do is you take your phone and
you say you know milk milk egg egg
cheese cheese cheese hit by get on the
subway two hours later truck shows up at
your house with those groceries in a
city where most people don't have cars
and they be carrying around you know
smelly bags of cheese on the subway this
is awesome could you do this on the web
well again you need something like
getusermedia PayPal just bought a little
company called card i/o the way card i/o
deals with checkout is you just point
the camera at a credit card it'll scan
the numbers and the expiration date of
that credit card automatically and you
just take a payment right there all
right they did some experiments on this
essentially this is 2 X faster
registration a little bit of sales lift
as well back to Apple for a second they
also have this feature in the Apple
Store app from the Apple App Store
called easy pay and what easy pay does
is you go into an Apple Store you can
scan anything that doesn't have a serial
number doesn't matter the price I tested
this out I went in with a guy who's a
product manager over on the retail team
and he was sort of showing awful all the
things behind the scenes at the Apple
store to me and he took like a $700
Drive scanned it was like look you can
just buy this right here
so what you do is you point your camera
at the barcode you scan it it says this
is how much it costs you say pay you
enter your password sign in and you walk
out
that's it you just bought it
right eBay but RedLaser a lot of people
use barcode scans Walgreens 40% of their
online prescriptions are now scanned
from mobile the user experience manager
of Walgreens contacted me on Twitter it
said although that number is much higher
and then I wanted to copy his tweet and
put it in here but then he promptly
deleted it because somebody told him you
can't share data which is a real damn
shame now let me sort of illustrate what
I'm talking about here check out if
we're stuck in the mass media of the
past the internet right this is what we
do with checkout we're basically going
to take that experience we have from the
desktop web and we're gonna make sure
you can get through it on a small screen
and we're gonna collect all the
information we're collecting before and
you're gonna be able to buy the mouse
from Dell and look this one's the best I
thought it's almost finished
bastards tada you just bought a mouse
versus I go to an Apple store to buy a
mouse I pick up my phone I scan a
barcode I enter my password and I walk
out now granted one is in the store the
other ones online so you have to capture
you know like a shipping address over
here so there's a bit of a difference
but both of them are buying a mouse from
a computer manufacturer and I asked you
guys which one looks like the future to
me this is desktop first thinking right
this is copying what we were doing
before and treating mobile as a smaller
screen this is mobile first thinking all
right it's basically saying what can we
do on mobile oh it's got a camera oh we
got one-click shopping oh you have it
with you anywhere including when you're
in the store maybe we could do something
like this right
desktop first mobile first and sort of
summarize everything I've been saying
let you guys rattle me with questions if
you have any
I think mobile is actually a new mass
medium and I believe with Tomi's sort of
thesis here and hopefully I've
Illustrated what some of the reasons why
you can kind of subscribe to that
because it's this new
masamune it's actually a huge
opportunity right much bigger
opportunity than smaller computer
because it's different it forces us to
take all the stuff we were doing before
and add adapt to optimize question stuff
that we take for granted right we take
for granted the fact that a password
field is dots we take for granted what a
login screen is we take for granted what
check out is we don't even think about
it anymore we just sort of regurgitate
it out we'll figure this out right but
when you actually dig behind the covers
you realize there's tons of problems
with these things all right and again
I'm sorry if I come across as sort of
presumptuous with this stuff these are
the things that make the internet click
getting into a web site accessing a
piece of software how does that happen
heavens the login screens it happens
every single day millions of times right
buying something on the internet making
money through e-commerce this is one of
the underpinnings of what digital
businesses right so really actually
matters a damn lot right that's why I
jump up and down and care about these
little details if you take the time to
adapt and optimize your solutions in the
context of mobile all right I think
that's good for all devices if you find
something that makes it faster and
easier for these kinds of form factors
there's not necessarily a reason you
can't apply it to larger screens or
different form factors what have you and
last but not least because we have these
new capabilities as I sort of
illustrated at the end of each section
about login and check out this stuff
moves us to the future that we can
totally redo what login is we can kind
of completely rethink what checking out
and buying something is like even on the
web
all right the web is catching up really
fast if these things I showed you guys
how we've got all kinds of new api's
file access things so and so forth right
so that's sort of my rant thanks for
hearing me out if you want to talk more
about this stuff I'm on the internet and
I'm happy to banter sure and I can
answer some questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
