you everyone so this is going to be a
very quick talk hopefully very quick
about WebGL and this is really a very
deep dive so I want to discuss things
more towards the hardware level rather
than the JavaScript level however being
a JavaScript conference we will do some
JavaScript so let's begin so this is me
my name is Jay again that's my twitter
you can tweet about this do whatever you
want with it I work for PubNub as a core
engineer so I do server level stuff
Python a little bit of C I contribute to
melon j/s which is a game engine written
in JavaScript it uses WebGL very
recently which I I contributed over last
winter I believe
and what I want to really start with
here is a little bit of the history of
GPUs and rendering hardware and we'll
show some fun stuff with that and then
go through and get into what WebGL
actually is WebGL proper rather so on
the last slide you noticed I said
console hacking this is mario 64
nintendo 64 this is a hack that i made
and it's has nothing to do with WebGL
except you know this is the kind of
low-level stuff that i get into this
for example was written in mips
assembler language and that's what it
looks like you can go through it if you
want very simple the comments just read
them out loud they're awesome
so what it really does is changes the
liquid to a solid by checking your
position once your feet touch the water
moves the level the ground level up to
where your feet are that's it
very interesting and you can see even
more of that in some old stuff like say
the Atari 2600 what I mean by that is to
really program anything on this old
hardware especially when you get into
rendering stuff on a screen you're
really messing with the hardware so this
thing has a tiny CPU it's about one
megahertz not very many pixels can be
displayed 128 colors roughly on-screen
simultaneously
it has 128 bytes of RAM that includes
all of your stack space and gamestate
which is roughly enough for a couple of
counters in a ball position
interestingly enough no video memory so
what the heck how did they actually do
anything with this at all it turns out
that there's a a really great
presentation at a GDC a couple of years
ago by David Crane who was the author of
the original pitfall and I don't know if
you're familiar with it but do check
this out and I'll tweet out the slides
later so you can check out the video it
goes into a lot of depth about how
really with this hardware you have to
think in terms of hardware rather than
in terms of software and that's kind of
what I want to bring out in this
presentation about WebGL is it's the
same idea it's not that we're really
writing in WebGL we're not really
writing code for 3d rendering so much as
we are writing code that pokes a bunch
of bits into buffers and then asks the
GPU to do funny things with with custom
code
so this is really awesome and I do
recommend checking it out going forward
a few years one of the very first arcade
games that contained 3d rendering
hardware was the Namco system 21
released in 1988 it has a little bit
faster CPU it has five DSPs those are
digital signal processors which do all
of the 3d mathematics
it also has 12 custom integrated
circuits which are all of the components
necessary for the rendering so this
thing has roughly 17 GPUs it has a
little bit of memory lots of video RAM
it needs that for drawing those garage
shaded 3d artifacts and on the farther
range in the mid-90s Nintendo came out
with the Nintendo 64 and we saw that
screenshot earlier this thing has a 93
megahertz CPU its CPU it also has a GPU
that is roughly sixty two megahertz also
a MIPS CPU and this is very important
because it's programmable this is one of
the very first instances in in gaming
consoles at least gaming console
Hardware where the GPU is programmable
in its contemporaries like with
Playstation and so forth they gave you
really a piece of hardware a processor
that is really designed for doing one
thing and that's like drawing triangles
or whatever in the case of Nintendo
though they had a program that you could
load onto this GPU and have it run and
then just use this message passing
between your main CPU and your GPU and
you can do all kinds of crazy stuff with
it unfortunately very few companies ever
did so they just use the the standard
stuff the SGI ship
and this is kind of what it looks like
at least for the PlayStation era of 3d
rendering the top portion is the CPU the
bottom portion in green is the GPU so if
your game program wants to draw
something draw something pretty it might
say you know I want to draw a rectangle
so it it builds up this packet and then
it puts this on a queue and the GPU is
constantly consuming from this queue and
says oh oh well I've got a rectangle
this one's gonna be blue and then it
passes that information on to a
rasterizer the rasterizer is part of the
fixed functionality pipeline so in this
case it has a rectangle goes to the
rectangle rasterizer we also do
triangles all kinds of different
primitives some examples might be say
textured or Gouraud shading different
forms of lighting so on and
so things one interesting thing to note
about this is those little boxes in red
those rasterizer x' that's where this
programmable part of the GPU comes in so
on n64 you could change those you could
do things like do special lighting or
whatever you needed to do and this is
really what kind of leads into the more
modern more modern GPU and how it
actually works in this case how the
pipeline is or simplified any way closer
to it when your CPU wants to draw
something it creates a binary blob it's
completely opaque to arbitrary it
doesn't really mean anything to the GPU
you put it into a buffer so you create a
bunch of buffer slots in memory you
shove some data in there and then you
ask the GPU when you're ready to start
drawing using these buffers and what
happens is
this blob is passed on to the vertex
shader which is part of the programmable
pipeline and the vertex shader will then
pass information onto the fragment
shader and we'll see some some more
stuff about that in a bit now getting
into actual WebGL stuff these are some
really good resources that you can use
to learn about it the top there WebGL
fundamentals is awesome it was written
by a guy whose first name is Greg he was
a programmer on the chrome team really
cool guy and what he wants to do with
this website is build some fresh
tutorials and you know real information
that isn't just rehashed from old stuff
that came out of like you know opengl
1.0 2.0 tutorials and the MSDN WebGL
reference is really awesome so if there
are any Microsoft guys here props to
that this is actually the best reference
that I've been able to find for the
WebGL API itself Chronos is the the
group that oversees the WebGL
specification they have a wiki and
there's some awesome presentations from
Google i/o that talk a little bit more
in detail about WebGL itself and how you
build the buffers modify attributes and
so forth so do watch those and read the
specifications if you're really
desperate they contain actual
information but there
very dense it's hard to read and avoid
it all cost those retrofitted OpenGL
stuff a lot of that information is just
not portable so the very first steps
first thing we can do to get our WebGL
project going we have some Dom elements
we start out with a canvas and we have a
script and this is their JavaScript in
my example here I'm using jQuery just
because it makes it easy to select that
screen element and get the WebGL context
there's also a little helper function
here which I use just for reusability
really what it does is it creates a
shader object then the shader source
code is uploaded into that object or
passed into that object
finally it's compiled and then this
compiled object is returned the next
thing to do is actually take your shader
source code and you'll notice this is
these are just strings they can be
anything really source your source code
from anything
for example a last text file on a server
you just load it in with xhr I've also
seen in some tutorials they use a script
tag for this purpose it doesn't really
matter we're just using a string here
and something funny about these shaders
is they're really the bare minimum that
you need it looks it sassy like language
and it has a couple of global variables
these GL underscore things these are
global variables and we'll talk about
that in a bit so here we go we create a
program object we attach our our shader
source code that we get from our get
shader function attach that to the to
the program attach the second one to the
program and then we link it and again
this is like compiler stuff so we
compile them compile link and then we
have this use program and the use
program is very interesting because it
means that you can actually have
multiple shaders running or rather
multiple shaders loaded simultaneously
and then just switch between them when
you need to do different things so you
might have one that's a quad shader and
it draws textured triangles textured
whatever and then you might want to
switch over to a line shader which does
like wireframe stuff rather another
example would be deferred lighting
different tricks that you can pull off
but you just use different programs and
switch between them per frame you don't
want to do it too often but it's
available for flexibility
and before we go on with any more code
this is where the shaders will be kind
of demystified there are two parts that
are programmable the vertex shader and
the fragment shader and you can read
about kind of their purpose here the one
in the middle is the rasterizer and this
is part of the fixed functionality
pipeline this is something that you
don't have to code it's just built into
WebGL and it does stuff for you in this
case the rasterizer will take
information that it gets from the vertex
shader the code that you write and does
some interpolation on it and then passes
that information on to the fragment
shader which is more code that you write
so you can use these two programmable
things to do some well to do some very
basic things like the textured quads so
on and so forth but you can also do very
interesting effects which I didn't have
time to write but do some crazy
transitions and wobbly stuff and it's
just fun so
the things that you pass from JavaScript
into these shaders
are things like attributes and uniform
variables and so forth so just what is a
uniform variable uniform variable is a
part of the GL shader language which is
called a data storage type quantifier
and there are three of these attribute
uniform and varying in this diagram I
have on the left side JavaScript you're
able to provide attributes and uniform
variables directly to your shaders in
the case of uniform
you can pass uniforms directly to both
shaders simultaneously and attributes
only to the vertex shader
the difference between these two things
is kind of subtle especially for
beginners the attribute itself is
technically treated as an array within
WebGL which means that you would
normally want to pass things like your
geometry using using attributes you
would want to pass things like the
blending color of a specific triangle
things of that nature a uniform on the
other hand is something that is very
static
once you've set a uniform variable and
asked WebGL to draw your your attribute
array that uniform can't change so it's
really static and this is good for
things like global blend colors and
ambient lighting a projection matrix if
you're doing 3d and also on the left
side we have some actual GLSL code this
is just variable declarations but it
also has some data type information here
the attributes for example have Veck 4
which are 4 element vectors in the case
of the color that's RGB and alpha those
four elements in the case of position
it's XYZ and a W the W is a scalar this
is called homogeneous coordinates I know
I said I wouldn't get into any
mathematics this is about as Mathew as
it gets
really I just want to explain what the
hardware is doing so you can poke at it
and do funny things what else can I talk
about here the the texture coordinate is
a is a two element vector so on so forth
and these are the geo underscore global
variables that you saw earlier in the
minimal vertex and fragment shaders so
the shader language itself specifies
these variables and it's kind of weird
they didn't use something like I don't
know a return value from the main
function or inputs to the main function
whatever I don't know but you get four
different outputs that you can you can
write to so there's a position output
from your your vertex shader which
allows you to do things like input a
vertex from JavaScript do something with
it maybe you want to cause it to wobble
so a tree or grass wobbling in the wind
something of that sort and then you can
set the value of that position which
then just gets updated by the vertex
shader and the vertex shader will run
once per vertex element so if you have a
triangle that runs three times one for
each point
let's see what else the frag color is
for the fragment shader and that just
specifies the color that you want to
draw to the frame buffer eventually the
frag data is for multiple render targets
which you can use for some really crazy
lighting effects and so forth it's part
of the fix functionality pipeline I
haven't played with it too much but it's
there it's available GL points eyes and
point chord are inputs which allow you
to sorry the point chord is an input the
point size is an output so you would
output a size of a point so you can make
a point that's like this big or really
tiny and the point chord tells you where
in the rasterizer that actually is
drawing so where it's drawing your point
you can use this for funny for some
interesting things like say radial
gradients right
this is going back to some JavaScript
and this is where WebGL itself gets kind
of mind boggling because it's it's
really a very simple API when you get
down to it
however it's like nothing that resembles
other web technologies whatsoever really
because it comes out of the OpenGL world
so you have to do things like bind your
data to the GPU so you can perform IO
operations on it totally weird this is
JavaScript shouldn't do this but this is
what we have in the first case we have
an attribute which again is is it it's
an array right so what we can do is
specify how WebGL is supposed to chop up
this data this big binary blob and make
sense of it as an array
we have this a position here on the
right the string is the variable name
from our our vertex shader and you can
do some some more interesting things
with your JavaScript for example parsing
your source code to pull out all of the
variable names and so forth to do this
automatically but for a simple demo this
is this is okay so we need a we need to
get the location according to the GPU of
where that variable exists somewhere in
memory so that's get attribution second
thing is we can enable it and I'm not
entirely certain of the purpose behind
this but you can enable and disable
these attribute arrays as you see fit
that's disabled by default so do enable
it if you want to use it and the third
line there we'll do the actual chopping
up of this binary blob into useable
array elements in this case the the
arguments to this function are first the
bound variable second the component size
in this case the a position is a four of
avec four so it's it has a component
size for four components the type is
either going to be float a
floating-point number or fixed which is
a fixed point number and the next is
whether or not this data is normalized
I've never had a use for normalized data
in my attribute array so I don't use it
the next thing is the stride or the size
of each element in bytes in the case of
this vector it's 32 bytes that is four
elements times four bytes
and finally the byte offset the byte
offset it allows you to combine multiple
variables into the into a single array
so you might have for example this
position attribute you might also have a
blend color following it so in that case
you would have an offset of zero for the
position and an offset of 32 which is
just following the the position for that
blend color and you can do some
additional things here it's probably a
little bit easier with some graphics but
I will just go through this as quiz as
quick as I can because it's kind of
boring though the the uniforms are very
similar you have to get the location but
you don't have to specify anything else
about it it's already a known unknown
data type so you can simply populate it
directly and we can do that by creating
a float32 array and just fill out the
information whatever you want in your
projection matrix I just have commented
out there we don't care what these
values are at the moment
and that last line is how to actually
populate this uniform there are a whole
bunch of different functions that you
can use for WebGL they all start with
uniform so there's there's one for a
matrix for there's one for a matrix
three matrix two vector four vector
three all these different functions so
it's not a an awesome thing to have to
learn but there are multiple functions
for one for each data type and the next
thing we can do is populate the
attribute buffer that we created or
populate the attribute with a buffer we
want to create the buffer and bind the
buffer to this array underscore buffer
index this is a it's an index to a
register within WebGL so rather than
passing around full objects to WebGL
what you're really doing is passing
around these indexes it's kind of like a
pointer it's smaller it's more compact
and really yeah it's just for
performance reasons I imagine
bind the buffer to this register and
then actually fill out the buffer so the
buffer data method contains at least two
forms possibly more that second element
is either a size for the array for the
buffer or it's going to be a reference
to a float 32 array or some kind of
other native data type so in the first
one we're just creating it and giving it
a size and say okay well I have each
element is 32 bytes long and I have
three of those elements so that's the
size of it in the bottom portion we
create a an array of vertices and these
are again for element vectors XY is
again W and this creates a simple
triangle right now I'm just using what
is called normalized normalized
coordinates unit coordinate unit unit
vectors sorry so unit vectors between 0
and 1 or in this case negative 1 to 1
and we take this array and we set them
send that to the buffer through the
buffered data
the shader for this is starting to get a
little bit more complex now we have a
uniform matrix and an attribute for our
position the position being the position
of each vector each vertex of the
triangle itself and then finally we have
a varying variable and as you recall
from a previous slide the varying
variables always get passed from the
vertex shader into the fragment shader
we don't touch those from JavaScript
otherwise inside the main function this
vertex shader will receive the position
and the matrix from our attribute and
our uniform and runs the main function
against each of those elements within
our array
and in this case we're going to set the
color for the varying in this case it's
red the the BEC for there is RGB and a
and we're going to set the position
which is going to be our matrix
multiplied by the position the actual
vertex so this would allow us to do
things like projected into three
dimensions and on the other end the
fragment shader receives the vet the vet
for color from the vertex shader and it
simply just passes it right back to the
rasterizer for drawing that color to the
actual location and really that's all I
have for you I'm sure there are a lot of
questions I kind of went through that
really rapidly one thing that I can
comment though is there's a website
called shader toy comm and if you're
interested in getting into WebGL and
shaders and so forth definitely check
out shader toy they have a lot of really
cool demos but it also has a sandbox a
GLSL sandbox that you can just type in
your your own shader language and run it
right there
pretty cool stuff so
since I do have about 10 minutes more
than happy to take some questions if
anyone has any great questions so
question is if you want to start a big
project medium project whether you want
to use a framework to help or just learn
WebGL itself personally I would
recommend if you're short on time use
the framework use three JSU's I don't
know they're whole bunch of them but it
will really get you up and running
rapidly and if you don't need to use
anything very special like you're not
going to cause I don't know ripple
effects and wobbling and wonky stuff you
don't necessarily need to do like actual
coding shader stuff yeah right you just
might want to just load a model make
sure it rotates around do that sort of
thing the frameworks are awesome for
that
shaders with three jets yes it's
possible they have some kind of some
kind of functionality for that yeah
absolutely yeah WebGL itself is kind of
intense to be honest
it like I said it's like nothing we've
ever seen before or since on JavaScript
or on the web platform specifically
because it's so low level right good
question
the GLSL itself is a specification for I
believe it came out with OpenGL ES not
entirely certain about that ES is for
embedded system which is for like
tablets and phones mobile devices so
it's a cut-down version of OpenGL and
the the shader language itself is for
writing the programmable part of this
rendering pipeline so it's a C like
language it's its own language entirely
and you compile it down into a into
what's essentially a machine code and
you do that from the browser
from the browser yeah so let me go back
a couple of slides and we'll find that
example
right there so when we create the shader
here yeah and then we say compiled
shader this shader variable is just a
string this is the big who cares what it
is it's a string of source code and we
ask WebGL API itself to compile that so
it compiles it down into an object file
right executable half executable and
then eventually you ask it to link so
once you have all your shaders up you
link them together and then you use the
program so that's kind of how the shader
language fits in with WebGL the API
crying your privates ah so I don't
recall exactly which framework I was
using originally with Mel Andreas it was
whatever it was using browserify and
some other things what I found though is
it turned out to be really too slow for
some very particular use case for melon
jeaious it's just a 2d rendering game
engine so we don't need things like you
know 3d projection and all this fancy
stuff we just need to draw a bunch of
triangles really quickly and so that's
kind of why I started learning all this
stuff and eventually I was able to write
this little compositor that's actually a
lot faster than what we attempted to
prototype to begin with so that was the
the primary reason for for going through
all this hassle
yes
fragment shader coding techniques a lot
of the information is just whatever you
can find on google you can also yeah you
can also check out shader toy because
they give you all kinds of different
demos you just go find one that you're
interested in and look through the
source code but because it's shader
language and you may not be familiar
with anything similar to it I would
really recommend just you know taking it
one step at a time
look at some very simple examples and
then go on to the the more interesting
thing some are the things that you're
more interested in so image processing
well
yeah yeah that's
it's true you want
there's a library called I don't recall
what it's called
it has a really funny name maybe I can
find it here yeah I would just really
look at graphics gems is a really good
one so things like I know SGI has their
conference SIGGRAPH right and they
always have white papers coming out of
that and different presentations that
you can watch about different rendering
techniques presentations white papers
definitely check out white papers if
you're interested in that stuff
one example solid example I can give you
is how to do the font rendering within
WebGL
because we're just doing things like
abstract points with in WebGL itself
rather than rasterizing vectorizing a
write a glyph or something an S say
there are some really interesting
techniques for using a mask ii like
how did it work it was like you create
busy curves and get those to rasterize
and then use masks and so forth and you
can actually do like a vector font with
within web GL itself but this was all
information that came out of a white
paper
materials are a much more higher level
concept this is something that you'd
more find in a framework like 3j s
material would be something like add
reflectivity or what's another example
gloss glow you know that sort of thing
so you can create a create a mirror in
your world or create reflections on the
body of a car you know stuff like that
yeah it's precisely surface of any given
material and what it's precisely yeah
but it's a more higher level concept
than what you would do with like this
abstract points and such within a
fragment shader if you were to write a
fragment shader for doing reflections
and so forth then you would want to do
well you would build that yourself
clearly but it would be things like I
don't know reflect this vertex and then
do some ray casting or you know stuff
like that so we can get complex
that's a good question
you can do some really bad things if
you're not careful for example it's been
your fragment shader out of control with
a an uncontrollable loop just as an
example the yeah in that case chrome I
know will support some minimal
sandboxing for you and it actually has
this concept of losing the WebGL context
in part because of this aspect and in
the case that the WebGL context gets
lost then you have to recreate it and
reinitialize all the stuff but it allows
you to say have multiple WebGL renders
rending rendering running simultaneously
whether they're within the same browser
tab or within your own and they can be
killed individually and so forth yeah
really the worst as far as security goes
is a denial of service and those are
some of the techniques to to take care
of that
all myself for which parts exactly let's
say I mean like which which features
there's a very minimal trade-off to be
honest like there may be a slight
performance cost probably not all that
probably doesn't matter all that much
but really the the trade-off I think
would be in terms of flexibility like
what you're able to to do if you had
something very specific in mind like you
can actually build an entire game and
run it within the GPU and not touch
JavaScript at all except for poking at
it every now and again say hey update
frame update the RAM at this dream so if
you wanted to do something very
specialized like that a framework won't
help you but again that code doesn't
really use it reusable so you know it's
gonna be a one-off thing the framework
is really meant to be reusable and run
everywhere
yeah whatever we have one more
my opinion on unity I haven't used unity
however I know it has a huge community
behind it and community support is key
so if you are interested in getting into
game development unity was probably a
really good place to start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
