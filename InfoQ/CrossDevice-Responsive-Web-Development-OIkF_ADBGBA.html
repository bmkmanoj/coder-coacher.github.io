nice to see you all here and here I'm
going to talk about your mytouch slide
title say and a cross device development
with the web standards so basically here
I'm going to talk about you know how to
create you web responsibly using a web
standards and also i'm going to talk
about emerging web standards which means
you know the things my or minor works or
might not be supported or implemented in
browsers yet so i'm going to just talk
about something super new do
ok so again yeah my name is too mami
tomoe mimura and that probably I'm
better known as a girl in mac on
Twitter's and social media and I'm a
foreign an engineer and I'm a total
mobile geek so I've been working a
mobile industry quite a while so current
job is at nokia I you know on html5
evangelist and advocating an open web
there and previously I've been working
the palm you know I was a developer for
the web OS platform and also the people
that I was at the Yahoo you know I was
at the yahoo mobile and I helped to
shape the ladder you know the mobile
apps there so um one web approach so
what I'm talking about a responsive web
design you might think it's a sort of
new concept right but it's been around
for a few years already but but still it
sounded kind of new but the thing is at
this quote here it's written in w3c page
and I was written back in two thousand
eight so here's what is saying and one
way one way means making ads for ads
reasonable the same information in
services available to users irrespective
of the device they're using so basically
is saying don't discriminate your users
you know just don't discover a new users
you know well that's a modern which
device their own but here it goes so
however it does not mean that exactly
the same information is available in
exactly the same representation across
all devices the context of mobile use
and device capability variations
bandwidth issues and mobile network
capabilities all affect the present and
representations in furthermore there's
some services and information are most
suitable for and a target and a
particular user context so it really
sounds like a common sense actually so
again a basically saying just don't
discriminate your users you know doesn't
matter which devices they are using on
to browse your web
so there are so many form factors these
days so currently you know the market is
almost saturated with some mobile
devices it's like just so many things
here so we got phones and a phablet and
tablet I don't like the name phablet but
anyway probably toggle it and it's
something in between I mean it's
something like that's a fuzzy don't
tablet laptop I'm not sure surface pro
that's probably a tablet you know but
you can still use like in an upright
positions using a physical keyboard as
well so could be use that laptop and a
Chromebook netbook laptop whatever and
they have macbook pro laughs that's
laptop right and a desktop we have
desktop here so basically have so many
different kind of devices and screen
sizes and such that we have to worry
about right so the idea about you know
not to discriminate your users you know
we got this idea about adaptive design
you know it's painful while it's nothing
new really so the basically the idea of
a you know adaptive design is that you
know to deliver the best possible user
experience to the widest possible
audiences that's the whole idea and you
might agree I mean that you might argue
with me but i believe the responsive
design the concept of a responsive
design is actually a part of the
adaptive design so here's a too big you
know things I mean two big concepts
about the active design the first one is
the progressive enhancement so you know
this is not new right we've been talking
about we've been caring about we
developed a web to make it progressively
enhanced all the time I guess I hope
that's what you've been doing and other
way around I mean the another way to say
it's a graceful degradation when we are
talking about like lesser capable
devices so basically you know if you
have a great price
the good browser capable of so many
different features you can give the
enhanced experience other way around
it's great you know make it gracefully
degrade so the for example probably i
can say i'm css3 box-shadow so you can
apply the box shadow to any element by
using css3 right but if you are viewing
the same content on older browsers you
don't see shadows because those browsers
don't support shadows and that's
graceful degradation what sort of
graceful because it's okay for your
users not to have a shadows in a certain
content I mean certain element because
at least you know your users can access
the content just fine you know we would
say it's okay unless you know it really
hurts your design but the thing is the
full-backs it's not always taken care by
browsers by itself so let's say if you
have a gradient right like a CSS
creating a new background like dark
background and white color text that's
fine Anna nice you know the modern
browsers but when you're using old
browsers probably css3 gradients are not
supported so if you don't you know
provide feedback I may not feel bad the
fall backs I mean the default solid
color in a by D for the browser's
background Hawaii and text is quite
right so the text is going to be
invisible so that's going to give it
really bad you know experience so you
have to make sure to give the whole back
you know as a default back on solid
color in this case like dark grey or
black missile in color the things like
this if you always have to make sure and
the responsive design it's a relatively
new concept and we have three I would
step 3 concept I mean freaking component
of responsive designs fluid layup and
media queries and responsive images the
last responsive images been really like
hottest topic these days so I'm going to
cover those three and my
right now so first thing I'm going to
talk about the fluid layup it's a fluid
layout new so back in the time I'm not
sure how many of you been developing a
web for that long but let's say like
passing a dot-com era or whatever we've
been used in table layout right we know
it feels so like a guilty using table
layout because people is not meant to be
for layout obviously that's what data so
maybe like after 2,000 whatever we get
CSS and we've been saying content and
you know presentation layers had to be
separated so now we use CSS and if you
developing web like around two thousand
three or so probably you've heard of
something called holy grail call them
liquor design right so back in a time so
we use the floor maybe we still do
actually because it works float and
negative margin it's like a one of the
tricks right you have some semantic
markup but you want to have a layout
differently from the flow of the markup
so you use a negative margin to shift
the content and you know looks different
or make it look differently instead it's
really hassle so i would say old hacks
and tricks will be using it's like
really pain you know the total pain in
ass and maybe around two thousand five
six we get a cool stuff like javascript
me UI frameworks right so yeah who had a
of this yui great layout which worked
still works perfectly it's really nice
then we get jquery right was it two
thousand six ish and then JK it was a
huge deal because we could use so many
different plugins and we had a variety
of UI related plugins as well in a
wonderful job i would say most i know
the most popular but one of the popular
plugging
the most abuse blog game was Miss only
so that creates a great layout but it's
more like a Pinterest look you know you
I that's nice but I don't like when
everybody using but anyways so now in
the future we can see a free layout so
we get coulombs it's a different type of
column to see a tray columns and columns
and flexbox regions and great so I'm
going to show some examples here so this
is a fluid column I call so using css3
columns so that's the actual screenshot
so you know in a mobile we get one
column I say mobile but when you have a
small screen either only one column and
when you have a wider screen have three
extra I can show that actual examples
easier to explain
can you see it
maybe I'm going to show it start from
narrow so yeah this is let's say I'm
going to just close this
so I said it as a column and the 200 CSS
pixel here you know when you have a
narrow window here I get the one column
right and it wants the window size
window width get 200 pixel x 2 plus
margin hairs and that column gap it's
used about 1m but it depends on the
browser unless you set a specific you
unless you specified so you get two
columns and the same thing it's and so
on so forth you get more columns as your
browser windows get bigger so this is
really easy to do this with css3 all we
have to do is just columns 200 pics here
but currently you need you know vendor
prefix here and the column count odo
means like you just so it's
automatically increment I mean increase
and decrease the number of columns and
this is by default so you don't need to
edit if you want no order so browser
supports pretty good i would say so they
are all the supported browsers they are
when you see the star it means you still
requires browser the vendor prefix and
it is a two operas here the reason is an
originally operates rendering engine
wants a presto so 11.5 the version 11.5
is impress the base engine and when a
while ago they have announced to switch
to WebKit rendering right and so upper
40 mins actually using WebKit rendering
engine which is not available and
desktop maybe I might be wrong but it's
available mobile for sure but the after
15 so since Google have the
WebKit to you know create their own
blink right they blinked rendering
engine so there are powerful chrome team
so now the opera 15 is a blink paste so
basically it works almost same its
chrome I would say so anyway those
brides are supported so you can use now
pretty much oh and I eat n 2
so for mobile I would say all this IE
for mobile is the i-94 windows 7 the
current browser I know I mean I 10 on
the windows 8 in our windows 11 I mean
the internet explorer 11 is available
and it's not available in mobile yet but
it will be soon so another example here
it's a flex box so basically is a
flexible layout to create it for let's
say mobile and tablet or anything bigger
and just take a look at this section
here are like a main section for the
larger screen you got Colin's right but
when you were in a mobile but just a
collapse up or more like it just flowed
in the row instead so I you know what
it's kind of embarrassing to show this
demo because I just figured it what's
broken now but anyway
so this is y a wider screen and when you
have a smaller screen yeah the layout is
a little broken so I had to fix it but
you get the idea right so I take and
kill this with using media query here so
again it's pretty simple with flex box
itself it's kind of cumbersome maybe
requires sometimes when you too long but
this particular example is super simple
because ok this is a default so I make
it mobile first so this is mobile
version it's a flexible roll first of
all disco by flex and flex flow row and
when you have something larger than 640
or what about the breakpoint you decide
it is giving a column it's simpler than
you think and if this is currently I'm
supported by those browsers here skit in
there you know this is super new so you
know not many browsers support it yet
and I didn't include a Firefox here
maybe I have to check it again but i
believe firefox still using the older
specification of flexbox the thing is
the css3 flexbox being around years
because i remember i was using in like
2010 ish I don't remember but something
sometimes I run that may be lovin but at
a time you know the specification was
totally different so it's been changing
you know so I'm not sure the one we have
now it's stable enough but I hope it's
not going to change any more then just
change too much and of course it you
probably can't see but you should really
take a look at the specification on w3c
page actually I otherwise to do so for
everything I talked about today ooh and
another one that's pretty cool regions
so regions it's another full css3 stuff
it's super-new
and currently it's only supported I mean
implemented on few browsers and this is
I think Adobe's really pushing these
days I've most of the good articles like
xenon lights from Adobe database and you
can use regions for responsive layout as
well okay I have a demo here
I have to use safari so this is so far
seven actually I have this example
called pen I i can just yourself let me
see maybe i can just use this so
basically okay let me save so now you
see on this the preview window here so
this is pretty narrow right so i would
say emulate sort of simulate the mobile
window size use the only one coulomb
just nothing special right but once they
get larger you get Coulomb I anything it
doesn't go down more but and even now
you see the colon there I kind of wanted
to make it a more complex layout for
that demo too but I didn't really do the
job I guess
anyway those are screenshot that's what
you just saw so ya hear that what is
region is so see with CSS regions you
know you can define how the contents
flow just like a magazine layout so my
example was like maybe just something
only one two I made some super simple
layout like like this but you can just
create like anything you want and this
is how it is it's kind of strange
because now you know you have an empty
dibs here right you can use probably
might want to use a section instead but
basically this is where the content flow
and the content itself resection a
separate little place so I have article
class content blah blah blah as a
Content separately and how in a way I
made it a responsive is so content and
region actual this is I didn't make a
mobile-first for this case but anyway so
flow into and the flow from is what you
need an article this is Natan like a
namespace you can name it anything you
want so basically this content goes into
this specified flow and if I didn't add
and edit include all the CSS for the
each region 1 and region two but you can
define whatever you want but this is for
mobile so when the browser window is
small you don't want to go special you
know layout right so just make it a
flowing to none and display know so you
don't even bother display in this part
so this is how I did and again it's
currently implemented on only in a
safari 7 and ie 10 but my demo
particular game works only in a safari
70 it works on iOS 7 as well but anyway
um the demo work zone in Safari because
I have implemented these regions but
they have implemented slightly different
so that requires using I
frame for the content so I didn't bother
adding I frame for this devil so it
doesn't work on ie and another cool
things coming up its grids so this is
like responsive grid so great layouts
you can pretty much guess what grit is
you can just define great and where you
want so this example actually this is
just a diagram not even a screenshot I
mean the actual screen shot but anyway
even probably you can separate by
orientation in this case in portrait and
landscape so you can define a different
in a layout here right and this is
currently implement only on IM but the
specification have changed since the IE
have implemented so now if you read a
specification w3c page it's everything
is totally different than the way in
microsoft have a handle so i didn't
actually make a demo for this so and
next topic here it's a media queries so
i believe in a most of you who's here
today already have good idea about media
queries so i'm not going to talk about
too much in detail it's a huge topic
itself right so i'm not going to talk
too much in detail but i'm going to just
cover something interesting okay so
start from classic days again I've been
developing a web for a long time stone
olden days when I was developing for
mobile for future phones we had a CSS to
just as extra 2.1 a media type called
handheld and this was the media type we
use the useful mobile and we can have
specific CSS here but the thing is I'm
standing I'm really user because it
wasn't it didn't have a great sport and
oh anyways so what's supported by
operamini which was the most popular
mobile browsers back in the time an open
wave OB go and pocket I
they consider to be a legacy browsers
these days but so i'm not sure i might
be wrong but the first time i ever
noticed this handheld is stopped working
was when I first you know developed for
very original iphone so it looks like
this it's really not the popular choice
for latest you know like ladies train
like on smartphones so the iPhones
Androids all those you know the browsers
for smartphones don't support it anymore
but now we get them in a new and more
improved in a media career it's for css3
so that's a weighted oh so you know you
can control your presentations you know
without modifying the content itself
it's actually funny because this is not
a super news although this is css3 the
idea itself spin they have a long time I
believe the Opera first proposed I'm not
sure I what might be wrong though but it
was finally you know came true for a sub
css3 a 363 so now we can all use it so
quickly go through what we can use media
queries here ok so or in this condition
you are and separating styles by the
width of the target be bored it's how
you view point when I'm saying it's a
browser display area right so mean with
max with but if you wanna get separated
styles by actual device you know it's at
Ohio to device itself that rather than
just stabbed with a browser is using
mean device ways instead of just wet
well you can combine with orientations
as well
oh yeah and you can use that the series
is pretty it's calc it's been supporting
some processes that's pretty cool and
love this stuff and another thing you
can do is a device pixel ratio so that's
getting really like interesting topic
these days I'm going to you know give
more time talking about device pixel
ratio here so this is a diagram right
for iphone not iphone ipad 2 3 i think i
think i'm not really i always person so
the basically i'm just using this
diagram because they're physically the
same size but twice that much the ppi
and when I say PPS just picks up orange
so it's more pixels so I'm going to talk
about high pixel density displays a
little bit more here so again I'm always
talking about classic we have a
developing days and a long time ago we
used to we amend users like when you
browse in the webs and such well in
general we had CTL monitors with pretty
low resolutions here right and at that
time we are making web pages in a like
optimized for 800 x 6 pixels so that
looks like all the other page but
sometimes maybe you know LCD screens get
really in a good price so we all upgrade
it to this thinner and nicer screens a
lighter screen so when you use him you
know when you upgraded your screen now
like you're you know good old yahoo page
looks small like shrunk not just drunk
you know image and text neighbors and
small but it looks better I mean it
looks crisp but it's still reading a
small text it's not really great thing
if this same thing happened to mobile
phones
so here's a banks some using the example
it's iphone 3 and 4 here it's not even
ladies but I'm just using because the
same physical dimensions but iphone Fool
has a Retina display so here's a web
page web page optimized for original
iphone sites 320 x 480 I love the onion
so when you try to fit this exactly 320
480 into here which is twice not so much
size right so you sort of expect to
making like here in a display like this
but this is not what you get an iphone 4
why because all the iphone folds I mean
the retina displays automatically takes
care of you so basically it's zoomed you
know zoom updates content to fit just
like in them the other older iPhone so
basically now it's faking the pixel
device pixel whats double right now it's
a faking a pixel size 2 480 x 320 what
we call it for 8480 CSS pixels height
and a 4 320 CSS pixels here the reason
is ok also this is how I care so now you
get twice as much pixel here so your web
page looks super nice but again you
still have 94 height-wise 480 CSS pixels
but actually it in your 96 device pixels
right so here's the confusion you got
two pixels values it's one CSS one's
device so that's really important here
so pixels in the CSS is relative right
and one CSS pixel and one device picks
that's not equal not always equal i
would say it is recon many devices yes
but it's totally not equal when you're
using retina or any new devices and you
can get this value by using down the
window that device pixel ratio is how
you get those value so for retina
display you get to 2.0 but this it
depends
which browser in which you know the
device you're using of course so the
nexus one was 1.5 and Galaxy Nexus
what's too but even if you were using
the Galaxy Nexus but using opera mobile
browser for whatever reasons you get
2.25 and now oh my gosh it got three in
a galaxy s4 has three oh my gosh that's
too many pixels right oh but here's one
interesting thing I don't want to
confuse you too much by giving you too
much information here but it's something
new wait I real recently noticed so when
I'm talking about device pixel ratio
that sounds like you know it's really a
higher to device itself like its attack
you know it's Frida comes with the
device right so this machine here the
one I'm using the macbook pro is not a
new one so this is a you know not the
right hand display so i expect that
device pixel ratio is 1 then always one
but I'm wrong well when i'm using
firefox and the latest chrome so i can
show it to you so in other browser you
can change the zoom right so this is
actually screen shot came from firefox
you can zoom in and out the content so
let see i have a chrome 33 here
I really don't want to confuse you but
anyway so I have CSS and I'm just
writing some CSS here and depends on the
device pixel ratio you get a different
cat picture so this is one or you're
going to see a lot of care pictures of
my presentation I'm warning you so this
is one again my macbook pro is not ready
now but see so I'm Preston on the
command shift + put some easy mac so
making it's bigger you can see over
there so it's ah not now sorry okay so
device pixel ratio okay hold on a second
get 125 150 I had to refresh it so now i
have a zoom on then factor one fifty
percent and when i refresh this page you
get different kitty cat right it's not
that magically device pixel ratio is
trying to 1.5 this doesn't happen when
you were using chrome like 30 or older
so it's really new because i'm using the
latest from which i think this one is 33
let me see no I was wrong its 31 33 yeah
I get the user agent printer here yeah
so this is actually the first chrome
browser and if I have Express has been
always working this way I never knew
really this was like something so like
nobody knew about it so same thing okay
dip dip when you get a pixel ratio yeah
I get two so now it's a two hundred
percent zoom right so I don't want it
you know I don't try to confuse you know
those but it is still confusing for me
because I'm not sure if that's you know
what we expect or not so you know that's
something the browser vendor decide and
a Firefox guys in Mozilla guys been
doing this way and i believe i guess the
chrome guy just decide to you know make
it work just like firefox but other
browsers don't do this
whatever I don't know how important is
but it's good to know so device pixel
ratio it's zoom dependent but okay the
thing is this is not a meant to be
working for touchscreens so when you let
the only you have android phones and
then you try to in a zoom by you know
the pinch zoom right this doesn't work
so pinch them yeah so this only works on
desktop i would say i don't know exactly
why but a pinch them it's not we have to
thanks okay so packed in a media query
itself so this is a media query to
support the retina displays right so
mean device pixel ratio too so if you
know the pixel and a screen has a dpr
when I say DPRs device pixel ratio DPR
most and to maybe do something else
right now give the difference on styles
but come on so another vendor prefix
help so this is what web get especially
when he is supporting 1.5 because some
screens DPR is 1.5 this is full web kit
and Mozilla has a different syntax IAM
when you wanna combines min that's weird
and this authors even we are learn I
mean this offers a crystal upper so this
doesn't happen this is soon and the
latest opera is a blank piece so that's
a web cube so this is for old author but
anyways I don't know if you can see it
is but instead of 1.5 you have to keep
three or more to this is actually
disasters right but you know what now I
find a way to just get rid of those
crabs use the resolution so this is not
really something everybody knows yet so
you can totally use the resolution media
query here that's so much easier but
this is currently supported by those
browsers so the Safari doesn't like it
yet so you still have to keep the device
pixel ratio
24 Safari oh and you might wonder why
it's 192 because a browser browser the
96 DPI that means 9696 CSS pixels in one
CSS inch we are about to CSS everything
the units are all CSS so that's why you
know when you talked about you it just
multiplied by Q so it's 192 right and I
don't know if you can really see I made
this IE icon a little dim because I has
bug I reported already did I need the
support well at least you know future
detection light sometimes it's really
annoying things for the web developers
feature detection lies because I said
yes I support resolution but it doesn't
get the right value so no matter what
you use I always believe it's 96 so it's
useless on ie I hope they fix it by 11
and this is easier so instead of using
calculating DP is you can just use the
DPP x those numbers are equal here
because this means basically it's DPR
here bless you this is supported by
chrome and firefox only so far
there's another thanks so when we talk
about media coverage with makeup CSS
right it works with JavaScript do so
this later than one of the new stuff the
match media you can approach media
queries in Dom so it's like a mediator
is equivalent to query selector kind of
food soup anunico and it returns you
know that this method returns a new a
media query list object an egg person
result in space fighter media queries so
that's how you use Oh browser support
them already you can use it now pretty
much so it's easy that's how you do so
you can dump the whole media query
strings in there so again this is kind
of like a query selector it's really
convenient so if it matches a do stuff
and other things again I don't want to
confuse you too much as a lot of
informations but there's so many new and
cool stuffs coming and this is the
series this device a deputation so what
um this is like a meta tag of you I
believe you already know that but this
is how you specify the content width so
when you browse in your web page on
mobile phones it doesn't look in a
shrink stance the content it just fits
right in the device with but many people
think this is kind of a strange to use
you know specified how its rendered and
view a billboard in the middle back here
it's kind of strange and i think the
developer I mean the guys in Opera
wanted to make it into CSS so they have
proposed something called viewport the
app viewport rule so here the width
device-width this is the same exactly
same things that this emitter viewport
and it currently it's only supported by
a press tool based opera in ie10 so
again it's kind of like a regulation so
now you know opera i use different
rendering engines so this no longer
works plus another bug i found and i
reported to the microsoft guys it's
buggy and i-10 they have reimplemented
wrong it's device with in CSS value but
they reports there you know return this
validates device pixel that's wrong so
basically sorry i is confused i'm
talking about this but this is useless
currently can't really use a buggy but
it's cool it'll be really nice if we can
use it because we can make some match
combined with media query I mean the
media rules here we can use both nested
so be really nice if we can use it oh
the cool stuff
ok so now okay I've been talking about
media currently in a CSF three but we
can use stuff level for which we kind of
call a CSS for but w3c guys don't like
it when I whole is this before so I
still have to call a CSS level four but
anyway this is new stuff and this hasn't
been implemented in any browsers yet but
basically now we can printer that detect
the accuracy of your input device so if
we know in coarse and fine in the course
you can guess this is pretty much like
touch screen people operate dealing with
a finger thingy right this finger and
fine it's a mouse or maybe stylist also
we can detect hover it's a boolean
general one so it has a harder or not
could you touch screen doesn't have a
hard right so this is how we can use if
hover exist we'll just do something for
look like many hover on something oh
this is like the hex code I love it's my
favorite
oh then this is super new I just want
out yesterday range so this is how we
beam right and mediocre is now Ming
height whatever I hate minimax why
because I always don't know that means
if 600 is included or not so now i can
carry this is the proposal now again is
just greater than an equal sign so we
know exactly what we're talking about
right that means 600 single it this is
super new and i don't know if it's ever
going to be in actual specification it's
just proposed like in a few days ago I
really would love to have this again I
hate me hide nagamine with max I don't
like it no and there's a cool things
it's really cool things lumino stay so
this is a new thing again this is super
new no browser have implemented
basically what it is is device has a
light sensor I don't see all devices
many devices have light sensors so
depends on the user's environment it
detects light level let's do this room
like indoor a nighttime kind of dark all
when you an outside and daylight it
always know so this CSS what it
basically does is win by default you get
gray background in black text when you
in a dark room make the background color
dark and give it a white text color when
you're in a light our environment make
the background color just pure white and
give some text color you can't use this
yet but it's already available in
JavaScript side so it's called ambient
light events and this dome event is
already available in Firefox so I wrote
this demo so it basically emulate the my
previous CSS sample with JavaScript here
so what i'm doing here is i'm in a room
it's dark room so in a dark room
I have a dark background here and I'm
going to turn the lights off no not off
um so see what happens come on is it
working oh yeah 28 locks oh that's not
nice in turn lights on and I'm going to
turn the lights off again this was 200
locks cool all right and it's really
working and this is a nexus 7 and using
a firefox browser I try this in a
Firefox OS I have a telefonica's key on
phone I expected it works because the
Firefox is the only browser supports now
but it didn't work on my firefox one and
my own guessing that because it's a
relatively low end phones so maybe the
device doesn't come with the light
sensor but i'm not sure you know a
little bit worried about my power now
it's not charging so again this is
written in JavaScript and CSS equivalent
is not available yet but it's coming
okay it's charging now so another topic
here so I'm switching a subject
responsive images I would say this is
one of the hottest topic and web
development now up sorry so responsive
image use cases the three use case maybe
more but let's say we have three use
cases currently the resolution switching
in art direction and DPR switch info
high-res images in a coded retina
displays and such I'm going to talk
about those now so this is a resolution
switching and one of the use case we use
for the responsibilities so we can base
the same image here but it depends on a
device you might want to feed a
different image dimensions maybe not
just a device just the window size or
orientation as well so just basically
giving the image with different size now
our direction is a basically the same
idea except instead of using just scale
down photos or images you just maybe
crop off or could be even def totally
different image you know the basically
idea is just try to match the layout the
best fit tuna each device and vp are
switching is about again this is for
support in high DPI displays so in a
retina displays you probably want to
give the higher resolution image and
instead so again this is really ongoing
issue we've been discussing a lot about
this because we are handling those use
cases in our own way did you know
currently but it's always have something
issues
so this is like a commonly used way I
can think of it's like using media
queries right something I've been
talking about just not so depends on
them depends on a device sighs oh I
think I kind of mess up with having
device and just the weights here I have
to fix this but anyways so basically
this is for tablet this is for the
larger screen using different images
it's a long since people what we can do
now and it's okay it's easy enough cool
we like media courage right so the
problem is always on you know the break
point so it's talking oh I kind of
messed up this code is wrong but break
point is those numbers right how are you
figure out do that you know currently
what we do is we have to just get the
statistics of popular devices and try to
just figure out which number to use but
this is really oh I mean it's pretty no
easy way to do so many times we just
guess we'll just use whatever copy paste
from maybe somebody else it's like try
to come up with most popular numbers to
use 3d not easy to ask me not as a no
good way to find out and using the
background in a CSS for the image it's
not semantics because this time an image
can be a part of contents not just the
presentation it's the content so it's
not quite semantic using the background
image and then this is a sombre haces
download all assets so again when you're
talking about like let's say a tablet or
like a larger screen we need only one of
those images we don't need a boss but
summarizes download both anyway the
wasting bandwidth so this is actually a
test there's a test on by and Tim
Catholic and its really have a nice test
result in his blog page so it should
check up really
if you not use a media curry to take
care of this you know the resolution
switching you can of course use a
different way like a fluid resizing
basically this is just using the image 1
image no media gallery just handle with
CSS in this case it just always
stretched one hundred percent or shrunk
whatever it depends in high order to do
this you need to probably get a
relatively large photos because when
folder is stretched out in a quality get
lost and it it doesn't look pretty so
pro and cons pros yep only one asset you
don't have to you know provide a bunch
of assets easy to implement and you
never have to worry about breakpoints
and hassle but while resizing you know
having browser to resize the images that
the CPU intensive and then you know now
i think the browser handles resizing
image x cubed in my cubicle e so i think
the image doesn't get lost means
something it doesn't get pix elated or
getting nasty artifact you know we used
to use some weird things that's have to
force it in a bicubic and all that I in
such but we don't have to worry about it
now but still still you know it causes
in the browser to recalculate and reflow
so it's really the CPU intensive
operation and wasting bandwidth well
it's not that much wasting compared to
when I downloaded a whole bunch of asset
but still you probably started up with
large image even when you have like
let's say thousand pixel width but it
shrunk to the mobile phone which you
only need 320 pixel and so you know you
really don't want to have huge image for
mobile users so that's wasting bandwidth
as well and another some tricks you can
use for art direction in this case when
I say our direction because this is a
sushi image useful wider browser for
mobile it just drop it off here
using only the center part of this image
you can do this with a media query so
it's talking about earlier or you can
just use the CSS clip this is not
nothing new CSS clip is actually coming
from CSS 2.1 and you have to just use
what you need a wrapper in this case
because have to be positioned absolute
to be able to use clip but I don't like
this syntax it's really annoying because
anyway you have to probably open up be
with you open up your image with
Photoshop or something to get those
numbers here because you need all those
figures i mean the pixel values for here
to specify where you want to clip its
kind of knowing two great things it's
one asset but when we don't like it
because the CSS clip is annoying and
again the same issue using a huge image
but using only the central part mmm not
so great and another use case it's a
high resolution pictures right so
actually this is what I happen when you
using a low-resolution image for the the
browser on I would say a device which
has device pixel ratio too so you might
not see it on this projector screen but
basically this first image here looks
kind of fuzzy not so nice but second one
is actually larger image which is choice
as large but area wise is four times as
much and that's well that looks decent
so currently when you want to do this
for retina displays and such this is how
we take care same type of deal you using
media queries by using the bus pixel
ratio tool and mean resolution that I
was talking about earlier to handle this
image so you get by default you have a
banner in normal size but when you had a
Retina display
you need a bigger picture buddy have to
step back once that's the
hundred-percent to be able to fit in a
size again yeah in may so it's simple
enough Soto maybe not but you don't need
any other scripts javascripts our site
anything you can just take it right
there and CSS it's cool i mean mediocre
it's pretty cool oh but another thing is
okay the browser dependent media query
means you know it's talking about those
resolution might not be supported will
have to have vendor prefix blah blah
blah it's really cumbersome have a lot
of things to do and the same thing it's
not semantics to use background for the
contents and another thing same thing
some browsers download all assets most
of recent browsers don't they just
download only 21 need it that's good but
like Android browsers and such it tried
to download everything this is new so we
have something and could image that so
this is the image set is a new solution
and proposed by Apple for CSS level 4
and now is the google suppose this idea
to so now the browser you know the
support is getting bigger and bigger
it's not just a safari to the blink guys
supports do so here's just a CSS
background-image this is default but you
can all set the set of images here 1x 2x
you can guess what means of 42 x means
when a device has a high DPI you know
like a Retina display use high-res image
that's how it works and this is still
ongoing and a specification changing
like a daily whatever it's just probably
this is already outdated I might be
wrong maybe we no longer need this URL
but I might be wrong it's changing all
the time so you have to check the
specification so it's unstable to use to
be honest
it's great because less hassle syntax on
the media career is your earlier right
this is simpler a better thing is and to
not many browser support it yet and
specifications unstable and again it's
not semantics it's still in the
background image okay so if you can use
a vector image vector image scale nicely
so you don't have to worry about this
this is SVG you can just resize whatever
we want without losing any quality it's
pretty cool if so if you can use these
widgets another way it's a great browser
support when web phone is another
popular techniques you use you know
maybe you already using so if you only
need some simple pictograms and single
color this is what you go you know it
should be different use the phone icon
so you can just scale any size you want
it looks pretty maybe implementation
it's not so pretty currently but it's
still the factor which is really awesome
so besides vector going back to the
original topic about like supporting
responsive images their solutions sort
of you know the methods we are currently
using so javascript is another thing of
course I was talking about match media
method earlier that's a standard way to
do modify the GS of other third-party
you know libraries out there and it
Polly fields I'm going to talk about
what polyfill it is later but basically
it's a polyfill of a picture element in
a picture feel Jas it's awesome and now
I have a next picture it's a polymer
it's funny actually if you I don't know
if you're already familiar its web
component that's another really new call
you no html5 things so welcome so X
picture is web component
you can basically just define your own
element and I mean a component create
like you I component by yourself so
Polly modulus is actually a polyfill a
web component so this is kind of weird
polyfill of a polyfill using the
polyfill what oh gosh I confuse myself
it's a polyfill but using some whips new
web standard that requires full of fail
so it's kind of complicated but it's
cool holdem at school another thing
server-side solution what is the server
site content negotiations using
something called adaptive image it's
commercially commercially available
services and the ph i think it's PHP
based in a st. jio is another awesome
things again use I think it's a
cloud-based and the other things you can
do not so the standard technique but the
nice hacks like clunker technique the
clock is really a strange actually but
it really works nicely and this was
basically using media query inside of
SVG so it's really happy and I say it's
VG but you use a raster image within it
and this was created by still SL whale
and she she was she had spoken in this
meetup before too and she's sometimes in
here so I mean you know attending is
made up to so I think many of you
already know her it's really interesting
and technique you should look it up and
I think she call it the clown car
because you just put all the images
stuff into in a single SVG file sync
there are still concept but ok but we're
talking about image woman like image
like element image how is an actual
responsive image like image element like
semantic image so obviously image it's
been available in HTML like as long as
we know it's old stuff and this wasn't
you know meant to be made for the
responsive design we've really need a
solution now we need a standard solution
they have responsive image using licka
semantically using the image element or
feel I mean so now we get most on one
solutions proposed by a different
browser vendors or different you know
interest individuals source set
attribute so this is a proposed by Apple
and adopted by a lot WG and I think you
remember I show the image set before in
a CSS right this is really similar to
image set in CSS the basically got the
idea from image stood and adapted in the
image dark hair so you know Alton source
already but this is what its new has a
new source set attribute so you can
define a different pictures and images
you want to use in depends on so this is
a condition here so 2x that's retina
right and 100 pics I mean hundred w
means the maximum view / of the 100
pixel 100 CSS pixel in this case and
this has been experimentally implemented
in WebKit nightly already but then now
of course we have a lot of drama but oh
you know what we should do with some
responsive images so this whole new idea
this was proposed by a responsive image
community group this is a part of w3
secret but it's a community group this
is browser vendor-independent anyone can
join i'm a member too so this is a whole
new proposal using a picture element
instead of using this image we just
don't want to bother with the stuff we
already have so just whole new the
picture element here
so this looks totally different from
this you know image using attribute it's
more like a nested tax they are because
the whole idea I mean this markup
patterns adapted for video and audio so
I think you already sort of familiar
with html5 videos right so that's sort
of similar you get each source here I
mean it's all spooning image so it's
there and in a you define oh yeah so I i
forgot to mention so the cool thing is
about it you can still use media query
you don't have to rely on some whole new
syntax some weird things like you know
here so what's that 100 w2s what's that
some people don't like it I don't so we
already use media Cory why not in a
markup to write so this is the idea
using media Cory in a markup and you
take care of a full backs and accessible
text as well so I totally support this
idea and again early i mention the
polyfills a picture filter Jas and a
polymer-based the X picture it's a
polyfill of this actually so currently
no browser have implemented this so
those polyfill basically mimic this for
you can use it with that that's a whole
new things ok this is not a markup this
client hint is a proposed by google so
it's basically a request header right
HTTP request header in the server uses
this client hint chkn dbr 2.0 here
so the server used is a client hint
assist content negotiations here so it
automatically picks the right in the
assets in contents which version of the
images and such and it's not like a
traditional user agent sniffing it
doesn't require any third-party data
base like a Warhol and such and
apparently this already has been
implemented and the latest chromium
build but you still have to use do you
know enable you have to use some flag to
enable this feature I haven't used this
yet personally so don't ask me any
questions and I'm hoping to hear about
this the next week yet that Google
because Google has a chrome dev summit
so I'm hoping to hear about is I don't
know mr. Donner but I'm hoping okay so I
talked about sort of important things
and I'll cool new web standards
immersion web standards but what's best
so we don't know really you have so many
features here and now we get smart TV
why don't brass web on TV because user
experience is awful and I don't want to
use you know the cliq orchard browse web
it's like so 90s but still so smart baby
has a lot of you know the home I mean
those guys has a lot of homework to do
have to solve those using interface I
mean they use experience and they'd have
to provide a better experience for this
but but if ever be available and if your
people you'll be or I mean you people
you know people dress in your web page
on TV then you really have to care about
responsive let's say responsible text I
didn't mention anything about responsive
text it's nothing new but basically you
know when you watching TV you'll sit in
a couch it's not like it's in mobile
phone right here or desktop computer a
distance between your pure you know your
user in a brother's probably far away so
you probably have to reconsider the text
size Oh margin or maybe line height and
all those what the people call it like a
responsive
so you might want to adjust the text
size in whatsoever so it's about all
like user experience issue the more than
technology itself automotive believe or
not their proposal for standardizing
html5 and basted Big O api's browsing
the web while driving sounds awful idea
but again this is a user experience
issue I believe this is going to be more
like voice activated or something
different and maybe service is more
dependent geo locations and such I think
it's going really different type of
interaction I have no idea I live in San
Francisco I don't even drive a car but
this is probably next things you might
want to care you might want to worry
about it's a lot of interesting things
going on with those guys wearables I
think I saw somebody waiting classes so
Google the last I believe it comes with
browser now it's a tiny little browser
but I heard it has device pixel ratio of
two or maybe 1.5 yeah it's 1.5 so now
we're about device even come with
browser and other wearable things like
pebbles right a Fitbit I don't wear my
Fitbit today because mine's broken now
but you know that's another popular
wearable devices these days and
currently those variables don't come
with browsers but you never know
something like a pebble smartwatch you
never know so maybe sooner or later you
might have to worry about it an Internet
of Things IOT it's another big thing
this is like one of the hottest things
and you know industry now right so like
a nest you know that's a smart
thermometer and you're gonna have smart
whatever sooner or later you're gonna
see smart like anything and then again
currently like nest and stuff it's not
about browser it's not about what you
worried now but you don't know I don't
know really so you know as a web
developer i would say you always have to
have a research keep i own anything new
and you never know what's gonna come
next
so thank you so much and this is like
everything I know it's really long I
don't know how long I've been talking oh
my gosh it's long and i have my slides
available my github and i have a speaker
there too but i think the one slide and
speak attics outdated and in case you
didn't get enough care picture HD deep
