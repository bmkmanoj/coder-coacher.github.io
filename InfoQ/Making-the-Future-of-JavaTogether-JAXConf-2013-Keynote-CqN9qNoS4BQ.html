to be here and be able to address
everyone at Jack's comp this is actually
my first time speaking at Jack's comp
they wouldn't send me to mind so so I
get to do the one here but that's very
good for me because it's quite close
first of all I'm just going to put this
legal slide up you can all read it while
I'm talking all right there we go so
just a little bit about about Who I am
and why I'm here as Mark mentioned i run
the development team for java SE and the
java SE platform at oracle i've been
doing that now for about three years
since oracle acquired son prior to that
I i ran the j rocket team for oracle and
previously for b EA and i actually got
started with java many many years ago i
was i was on the java team at java soft
even before it was sort of sucked into
the Sun mothership so that was from from
early days I think there were about
thirty 30 odd developers on the team
when I when I joined and I am
responsible for some fairly egregious
bits of code which I hope none of you
google and look at but I went over to
the dark side many years ago and so I've
been involved in in management of teams
that are are working on java and and
other technologies like java i had a
brief flirt with startups in about two
thousand to two thousand and two i don't
know if any of you remember but those
were particularly bad years to do
startups so anyway I came to my senses
and came back to the Java fold as I hope
many of you also will do if you've
dallied with other technologies so first
of all just sort of a general kind of
perspective of how we view java at
oracle I think there are there really
for us three very important things that
all have to kind of work together one is
the technology
and and this is something that you know
clearly is very strong has been strong
for many years but at the time that we
came into the picture needed a little
bit of kind of picking up and and
dusting off and and getting moving again
on the community side it's clear there's
a very passionate community around Java
and I'm going to touch on a few
different points of that but that that's
something that always has been a
strength of Java that it really is more
than just one vendor you know kind of
telling you how it needs to be it really
is a community of people working
together to make something that works
for the entire world and I think the
technology is stronger for that and
certainly it's something that we all
enjoy and then the final part is is
Oracle leadership and you know there's
there's a reason that we use the word
steward when we talk about our
responsibility for java and this is
basically that we have a very large
investment and and a lot of a lot of
reasons to to work on on Java and invest
in it but it also is something where you
know having a community that's
completely chaotic is not always the
best way forward sometimes you know
someone has to sort of hold the flag so
that everyone can rally around it and
that's kind of how we see it I'm going
to throw this up quickly because we do
have a number of new additions to the
JCP during the last year the JC JC p of
course is the standards process through
which we standardize java but the
platform technologies and stand-alone
technologies and we're really pleased to
see this kind of engagement one of the
things i would mention here is that
there's been a very nice transition that
we've seen over the last couple of years
we're not only a you know sort of large
and small companies are getting involved
in this in this role but also a number
of the user groups that are out there
and this is i believe the first time
that we've started to see that happen
with london java community and sujatha
from brazil and just to show you why
this matters is because there's a
tremendous number of Java user groups
out in the world now these of course
range
in size and format but all of these
groups get both some support from Oracle
but are also run by individuals in the
community for their communities I would
encourage all of you actually how many
user how many people are user group
members okay so we have a few for the
rest of you check it out the Silicon
Valley user group is is one that's here
local and is is fabulous they do a lot
of great work have a lot of good talks
and so I'd encourage you to to think
about joining it so here's just a short
list of things that you can do resources
you can check out and ways to get
involved a couple of these I'd call out
I think one of them that's very very
interesting is the adopted jsr effort
and this is something where user groups
in the community have kind of gotten
together in order to to learn about jsr
surly and to help move them along so so
that's definitely one to check out all
right so what I'm going to do now is go
through various areas of Java technology
so I'm going to talk a little bit about
se we'll talk some about the client will
talk about embedded and finally we'll
talk about EEE alright so now we get to
do another poll how many people out
there are using primarily java 7 today
okay quite a good number how many people
are are still using six okay some of the
same hands how many people are using or
using five or earlier oh you all get an
a-plus and in fact you'll get an a
double plus if if you're all in 70 wait
we'll have a little bonus extra credit
how many people have downloaded and try
builds of eight ah ok we have a few
we'll see hopefully so my goal by the
end of the day is for the for everyone
to have said wow I really want to
and check this out so I think what we've
seen here in the audience is kind of
consistent with what we're seeing in the
industry there is quite a move to seven
as we all know you know when a new major
version comes out you know you'd be kind
of crazy to take it and immediately
stick it into into your data center
under a mission-critical app however
there was pretty Swift adoption with
seven one of the things that we've been
proudest of is the addition of some more
ports we actually added both a port to
mac OS 10 as well as a port to Linux arm
for java SE and in fact these these were
these two ports that we did over the
course of last couple of years whereas
many ports as have been added to the
java SE platform in preceding 10 years
it's a you know on the one hand you
don't see that much because it's what
you're used to having you know just
running somewhere else on the other hand
it's a tremendous amount of work for the
team adding support for another platform
and making sure that we have those those
bills coming out at the same time as the
other builds so we have a lot of work
going on on eight and nine and in order
to talk about those a little bit i'd
like to invite my colleague Brian gets
up on stage this one does have an auto
switch all right there we go great so so
Brian what's in Johnny why should I care
so there's a lot of the stuff in Java 8
the the part that I'm most proud of and
this is about what I've been working on
for the last three years is adding
lambda expressions to the Java language
lambda expressions are powerful language
feature in their own right but they also
enable some even more interesting things
to happen in the in the core java
libraries java was unfortunately one of
the last mainstream languages to arrive
at the idea that lambda expressions are
a good idea but we got there better late
than never the the facilities you know
that we've added in the libraries allow
people to take the collections that
they've been working with you know for
15 years and a do that link style
parallel map produced kind of queries
against their data and the
result is that a lot of the common tasks
that people do with collections and Java
code the code gets simpler cleaner less
error-prone easier to read and generally
allows people to do more with less with
less code okay excellent and so if
people if people want to try that out
where where should they go so the all of
the all of the new lambda stuff now is
in the other JDK binary downloads that
uh that you know you can download off
java.net historically we had been
working in a sandbox so we have separate
lambda bills going forward people won't
need to download the separate bills they
can just get the main jdk it build and
it's all there okay good hey um so I
know it the keynote for Jack's in in
Germany there was a talk by Marcus
slaughter down on nas horn so what do
you what do you have to say about that
yeah so not Soren which is the name it
comes from the german word for
rhinoceros is an implementation of
javascript on the JVM we've had an
implementation of javascript that's
shipped with a jdk for years called
rhino and so Naz a'ren is a reboot of
our JavaScript implementation it's
written completely from the ground up
much much faster than rhino you know and
has really nice features for interop
with with java and with other languages
that run on the JVM ok all right and so
this is a call to action yeah so you
know people ask what they can do to get
involved a lot of people think in order
to be able to contribute to OpenJDK they
have to write code and while it's great
if people do contribute code or
contribute test cases some of the more
valuable contributions that we've gotten
from the community are people just
downloading the code trying it out
reporting back their experience whether
it be bug reports or this didn't work
well with my code or this work really
well with my code and and similarly you
know you might think that well now that
we've had feature complete for java 8
you know is there any opportunity to
influence the outcome the answer is yes
we have a long back end on our you know
product cycle you know as we move into
stabilization but there are still
there's still time to file down rough
edges so you know people this is a
really a good time for people to
download it try it out report back your
experiences okay but tell me just like a
little bit practically how does this
work I mean you know I've seen a lot of
open source communities where you know a
bunch of development is kind of done
behind closed doors and then it's thrown
over the wall is that what we're talking
about here no that one of the big the
big aspects of OpenJDK is transparency
all of the development is done in the
open all the repositories are available
they open the expert group lists the JCP
expert group lists are in the open and
so you know you can see the history of
the design discussion you can see the
history of uh you know the code
evolution the test evolution and you
know every time we every time we commit
code repositories we get questions on
the mailing list fo I'd looked at this
code you committed why did you do it
this way so it the justjust the
transparency of the code repositories
stimulates a lot of a useful discussion
on the mailing lists okay thanks so a
couple of words about about the future
so I think we know what you know some of
the some of the features are that have
been discussed and you can see some of
them listed on this slide I actually
like you to tell us a little bit about
you know how how you and mark in the
team think about evolving Java yeah also
the reality is the world changes right
java may you know as it was conceived in
1996 may have been a great language for
the programming problems that we wants
to tackle in 1996 but the world changes
hardware changes the problems that were
we're trying to solve change programmer
demographics change programming fashions
change and so you know the the languages
and tools that we use to program need to
change with those things and that
doesn't mean we embrace change for its
own sake but you know you know we're
going to in a measured way continue to
evolve the language so that it is you
know continues to be an effective tool
to solve the kind of problems that
people you know want to solve and so you
know what an example that you had in
your slide is GPU programming we
couldn't you know in 1996 we couldn't
imagine that mainstream programmers
would use GPUs to solve this solve
problems but the hardware's of all this
way and we want to bring that at the
programming model and make that easy for
java developers to take advantage of
okay
well so the approach are taking of sort
of daring to change and evolve I think
it sounds generally good doesn't it risk
sort of running into a situation where
we're just kind of cramming more and
more and more tools in so that that's
certainly it is certainly is tempting
right i mean it's it's fun to add
features and every java developer you
know every one of the 10 million dollar
developers probably has a pet feature
idea in their back pocket which you know
they will tell you about if they managed
to corner you at a bar and we clearly
you know could not implement all ten
million of them or even 50 of them you
know these it takes a lot of effort to
implement a big language feature you
know what a big platform features so we
have to pick very carefully and so we
look at what are the pain points you
know that developers that are affecting
developers you know lives now and you
know we try to pick carefully which
features will most enable people to move
forward without succumbing to you know
fashion of the week mmm okay so speak in
fashion of the week you know heard of a
lot of you know great and interesting
languages out there doing kind of
cutting-edge stuff do you consider it a
problem that Java is not doing that no
III think it's great that there are so
many languages on the JVM you know this
probably we have we kept a list at one
point we stopped maintaining it it was
over 200 languages you know that run on
the JVM if people would rather program
in Ruby where they'd rather program in
Scala and deploy on the JVM to get all
of you know all of the stability and
performance benefits that's just great
we're not going to pull every feature
from every one of those language than
judaa but we couldn't but we we also can
look around the community and stay see
what's working in a lot of other
language communities and decide whether
maybe it's time to bring that particular
feature at the Java hmm okay great
thanks very much right thanks George
okay just quickly throwing the roadmap
up I wanted to have this and I'll have
equivalent ones in other sections mostly
just for reference okay I'm going to say
a few words now about javafx so how many
people out there have have tried out
javafx okay a few so this is is really
something that you know has had kind of
a long history in various forms the way
that we're sort of viewing this is is
basically a sort of restart on on client
technology kind of keeping up with
things that people are used to using I
actually mentioned when I was working on
the on the client team earlier I worked
on the AWT team and was one of the
founders of the swing team and so so
this is an area that's you know near and
dear to my heart I've been very very
impressed with the work that's been done
on FX and I think in its current form as
it's been sort of made to be you know
Java API sand and useful from Java and
useful in many of the places where you
know rich client technology is is useful
it's really quite impressive we do have
quite a few deployments actually out in
the field and javafx is now an openjdk
so this is something that you can go and
check out the source code to there are a
few bits that are still on their way to
being opened up but this this is
something that I think is a tremendous
step forward in terms of transparency
they've also done a bunch of work with
with being able to package for the mac
app store and and i expect we'll see
similar things for for other kinds of
app stores out there in the future here
again there's there's no lack of ideas
of things that could be done i think
openjdk is a tremendous place for you to
be able to go and sort of see this
development happening and also to give
us feedback on on what things you'd like
to see or perhaps even contribute
yourselves so please do check that out
the roadmap for this is actually the
same road map that was on the previous
slide we
just a few bits kind of called out there
that our client specific okay now I want
to shift gears a little bit and talk
about a space that is is fairly new for
me but i think is extremely exciting
here's why i want to talk about this I
think you know as we look back over kind
of you know the last the last 50 years
or so what we can see is that there have
been several distinct kind of ages of
computing right so in the beginning
computing was this thing done by you
know people in white lab coats at big
companies or government institutes and
then we had a period where we're
basically you know ordinary people you
know people like us we're able to get
access to this technology and start to
use it and start to work on it and and
now you know many people out there have
said that we're coming to a time which
which they dubbed the Internet of Things
this is basically a time where we're
kind of computing is kind of moving
beyond you know laptops and desktops to
being something that's that's pervasive
and kind of all around us you know in in
some of the sort of you know small
magical devices that many of us hold but
even in in a lot of other kinds of kinds
of devices you know small things like
sensors and other things like that and
in fact we now apparently or at the
point where the number of devices and
and I should point out the number of
connected devices is actually surpassing
the number of people in the world so I
think if you sort of think through you
know your daily routine and what you do
you know we've gotten to a point where
these things are all around us and
sometimes we don't even think about it
but you know in a typical day we might
actually come into contact with hundreds
of these things in fact many of our
homes in fact you know many of our cars
actually already have you know 50 or 100
of these kinds of small connected
devices and so what that means is that
there are a tremendous number of
potential use cases for this technology
out there right
so just a few examples I'll throw up one
here in traffic management industrial
automation that one's kind of clear and
has been around for a while retail
transportation
and of course in in health care as well
and one of the neat things about this is
it really is something that you know
brings about a potential to to have
completely new kinds of things done and
really you know the the limit here is
starting to get a point where it's it's
our imagination I'll give you kind of an
example here's a home automation and in
fact you know just looking around this
house there are all kinds of different
places and points with where devices can
be connected and you know they're not
just things that are now like smart
little gadgets they're actually
connected gadgets that are providing
some kind of data that can be you know
remotely updated you know that when new
facilities can be added dynamically on
the fly and and so I think you know for
for us involved with development this is
an extremely exciting time here's
another thing that I think is exciting
about it is that you know we're actually
coming to the point where the
technologies needed in order to program
these devices is becoming much much much
more accessible so you know it used to
be the case that you know it was kind of
a black art putting together some you
know software stack for one of these
things we're now at the point where
these devices are capable enough that
they can run many of the technologies
that we here in this room like and in
fact I we've been talking a lot with
people involved in working in this space
both you know companies and developers
and one thing that seems very clear they
view this as an area where new
possibilities are happening but with
those possibilities come a new set of
challenges right it's extremely
difficult and expensive if every time
you're going to make one of these
devices you have to create your own new
proprietary software stack right it's
very very difficult and expensive if the
only developers that you can get in
order to put together your your
application for your new device come
from a small set of people that know
some
you know obscure language right so it's
it's very very difficult if when you
want to make a shift maybe in the middle
of a project or maybe between projects
ever all of this has to be redone right
and in fact you know one of the things
that struck me is I started looking at
this area is that this sounds to me a
lot like the way the the the the
workstation or desktop or PC world
looked prior to Java right basically you
were kind of at a point where a lot of
time was spent by development teams and
I I remember this like yesterday because
I was on one of these teams where you
know we would spend all of our time
developing on one primary platform and
then we had a team that was just about
as big as that primary development team
that was working on nothing other than
porting to everything else right and it
wasn't much fun and it meant that you
were spending a lot of your time on
things that weren't what you considered
your core business and so you know for
me one of the great advances that Java
brought with it was the ability to not
have to worry about that anymore because
you could just worry about developing
your your application and you would know
that there was going to be a performant
scalable runtime on the platforms that
people cared about so this is exactly
what we're saying now in the meted space
is basically a huge amount of
fragmentation a huge amount of
inefficiency and cost that everyone
throughout the industry is bearing and
none of them want to bear and so so I
think this is an area that is sort of
ripe for disruption and I think Java is
a great technology to do that okay
so to mention just a couple of things
that that are sort of already there
today because you know when I say this
it sounds like oh now we're going to go
do some brand new thing well of course
this isn't something that's brand new
this is an area where Java has played
for many many years and a lot of the
pieces of Technology are there they're
just things that are sort of getting
pulled together and to some extent you
know the the the devices have moved to a
point where you know some of these
technologies work more smoothly as you
know we see with our phones right every
day every day they're they're getting
more capable the same is true even on
even on the low end and so we have a
couple of releases that if you're
interested in looking at this area you
might want to go and check out one is is
a new release of Java ME and that's for
the sort of quite quite small very low
footprint devices and then another is
java SE embedded which is is basically
SE sort of slimmed down and sort of
tailored to run on smaller devices and
in fact something else that we've
released which is called Java embedded
sweet and this is basically something
that lets you handle that kind of case
that we saw in the smart home earlier
where you have a bunch of edge devices
and they have some amount of
connectivity and but perhaps not all the
way to the back end typically what
they're doing is connecting to some kind
of local gateway or condensation point
that basically is is sort of taking and
coalescing the information possibly
massaging it and determining what gets
sent to the back end and and so on so
this is is perfect for that if you
haven't checked it out please do and in
fact we have a complete road map here
for for those
okay I'm gonna go on and now in the
final section I'd like to talk about
Java EE and in order to tell me but with
that I'd like to invite my colleague
arun gupta up on stage hey good morning
hey we have to do this all right let's
go so uh why don't you tell me what's
going on in E yeah absolutely but first
of all July II you know has been
extremely popular sort of the number one
standard for building enterprise
application some of the key tenets of
the Java EE platform itself are you know
it's it's focused on developer
productivity it's focused on you now
we're going to make you productive so
the focus has been building you giving
you more pojo driven objects you know
just an approach oh you put annotation
and let the container take care of the
plumbing or all the infrastructure part
of it it is a lot about portability we
have the broadest industry adoption in
terms of 18 compliant application
servers on how you can build your
application to the Java EE API and just
seamlessly run on any of the compliant
application servers 18 is a pretty big
number with a good mix of open source
and commercial vendors that was very
well extensibility modularity some of
the key aspects these are sort of the
key tenets of Java EE in general so when
it tells all other about how this was
put together absolutely Oracle is the
steward for the Java EE but effectively
this is all driven by the community
people like you really and this is what
is a symbol of it you know as a matter
of fact java ee 7 which is just ready to
release literally next week and we'll
talk about that in a minute was put
together by 14 active j srs as part of
the java community process that was led
by 16 different specification leads and
they were expert group members about 200
expert group members from 32 different
companies all around the world so truly
a global phenomenon in that sense so
really really tremendous they were about
26 active java.net projects everything
done in a completely transparent manner
following the JCP transparency rules and
glassfish for which is the reference
implementation for java ee 7 there have
been 89 promoted bills so completely
again driven by you feedback by you
features by you so that is just intra-
right okay now as you mentioned 18
different implementations of v e6 and i
think some of the fastest adoption and
and and those have been coming out at
quite a pace right right i think that is
the you said it right right very rightly
fastest adoption in terms of fastest
adoption by the application server
vendors and by the developers in the
sense we have done like this is the
sixth release of java ee that we have
done within two years we had about 18
plus compliant application servers
giving again you a chance to build your
application and run it in a very
portable way and that doesn't happen
without the transparency you were
talking about absolutely immense i think
i tell my kids all the time the two key
tenets that values to me is honesty and
transparency and that truly shows up
right here itself okay so why don't you
tell us you mentioned that e seven is is
is final why don't you tell us a little
bit about what's in it right Joey seven
is the specifications are final they
were done like a few days ago already
Hawaii seven is ready to be released
it's going to be done next week three
primary themes over there the first one
being you know embracing HTML so as our
html5 effectively you know in terms of
html5 we've been doing HTML for a while
so weary silly to say that but html5 in
terms of html5 we are giving you first
class support for web sockets building
web socket driven applications giving
you a native support for json processing
allowing those html5 passed through
attributes like you know those type and
all those things which were not
available with JSF earlier so all of
those are very very core to the
application platform now the other part
of the second theme of java ee 7 is
developer productivity
in java ee 6 primarily because the way
CDI was introduced late in the game we
could not do lot of alignment but now we
have we are providing a lot more
cohesive integrated platform with CDI
managed beans ejb ease transaction all
of those concepts very well tightly
aligned with each other truly giving you
a feeling of an integrated cohesive
platform again focus on developer
productivity and then Java EE of course
is very well for enterprises for them we
are again giving two brand new
specifications a standard way of
building batch applications first of all
no need for a third-party proprietary
framework library now it's part of the
platform now and then concurrency
utility api's so lots of new feature
action pad release literally coming up
right and did you mention that this was
fine this is final actually that's
correct so the java ee 7 all the j
swords are final for a few days now in
terms of the implementation the
reference implementation which is
typically given to the licensees only is
being done as well but for you as a
developer you know we've been using bill
89 for a couple of weeks that sort of
the final candidate but a java ee 7 sdk
which contains not only just the
implementation but tutorial docks
samples all of that integrated bundle
will be available for you next week okay
where can we go to hear more about it
yeah and for talking about next week
next week we have a online webinar
scheduled for you it's a java ee 7
launch webinar it's an online-only event
handy link is bitly link is java ee 7
launch highly encourage you to register
for it there is some brand new there is
not some but there's all brand new
content that is generated as part of the
launch so effectively what you will see
is business keynote technical keynote by
Oracle exacts customers partners why
they value java ee how they are betting
their business on java ee most
importantly and I'm a developer I'm
geek so for me what is most interesting
is there are 16 sessions by all the
specification leads from the java ee 7
expert group these are actual technical
breakouts which you can listen on demand
so you register is a free online event
you register for the online event you
can listen to all those sessions and
again you have a chance to engage with
the specification leads asking your
questions and getting answers back from
them in a live session excellent thank
you okay so um tell us a little bit
about how adopt a JSR has been working
throughout this process very well
actually you know adapter jaser if you
understand you know rapid yessir was
started like by london java community
primarily for grassroots evangelism and
what you're seeing is 19 different java
user groups that participated as part of
the java ee 7 effort what these j's are
what these jugs do it is basically they
they said we're going to take a look at
a JSR or a bunch of j sorts together and
then as part of that we will either
arrange presentations within our java
user groups to educate more about it to
our jug members or arrange hackathons or
no bill end-to-end sample applications
or anything on those lines so these
drugs literally before the jsr became a
standard they started contributing
toward the jsr and actually made an
impact where the direction of the jsr
was changed as a matter of fact one of
the jugs that i want to highlight here
is for example belgium jerk they
arranged a hackathon on the WebSocket
jsr the Builder n2n application which is
a tic-tac-toe application and that is
integrated as part of the GlassFish for
java ee 7 SDK nice so real contribution
actually going back to the community
coming from the community and back to
them okay so how's the reception then
447 thus far very well actually you know
I mean if you see the courts hear from
David Blevins who's from Apache Tommy
community or ESPN or Pete Moyer the
response has been just terrific and I've
been presenting java ee 7 hands-on lab
for a few months now all around the
world
of course the lab has been evolving
yesterday we had a very good session
about you know a few attendees in the
lab but very interactive session very
good feedback and folks were interested
in learning what the new capabilities
are coming in there so overall the
feedback has been just tremendous great
so I you know one thing that's of course
very important you know as new versions
come out is that you know the IDS that
we use actually track that what kinds of
things are you doing in order to make
sure that happens yeah I agree no
bullying is very very important part of
it you know we have annotations we can
definitely use bi for building your
application or just maven based tools
but NetBeans again provides just a
terrific experience in bootstrapping you
know giving you a simpler out-of-the-box
experience where you can just create a
maven project very simply you have
entire code completion debugging
glassfish for configuration run time
debugging all of that support part of
NetBeans itself so that is just
tremendous they have lots of new results
that are available for simplifying your
experience not just NetBeans eclipse you
know they have a Kepler release coming
up end of June has an updated glassfish
plugin as well where you can configure
glassfish for runtime and they have some
new wizards coming in as well intellij
also has some support it's kind of basic
and I said you know of course you're
free to choose your own VI or emacs
support as well ok so we've talked a
bunch about e7 of course you know with
seven coming out now it's always
interesting to look to the future what
kinds of things are you thinking about
for 48 and Mia absolutely so java ee 7
you know it's going to be the
centerpiece it's going to provide the
foundation step for everything that will
do going forward so things like you know
think about modularity you talked about
you know how we can have modularity in
part of java SE build upon that we will
define a concept of how you can do a
modular application some of the other
things that we have been thinking about
how to do J's on binding very easily
other things we have been thinking about
is how to provide a standards-based pass
programming model which was the original
theme for java ee 7 but because of the
community feedback we decided to kind of
delay
and things like that so all of this is
literally up for the grabs at this
moment you know all being discussed
pretty a you know will be discussed by
the expert group and that's when the
decision will be made but this kind of
shows you a kind of a feel of what we
are planning actually okay excellent and
finally on road map anything you wanted
to say yeah so a glassfish 3 1 2.2 is
the current release but literally
starting next week june twelfth as i
said is when the GlassFish for open
source edition would be available for
you to actually run it along with java
ee 7 sdk absolutely i would highly
encourage you once again to join the
java ee 7 launch and own show up you
know in numbers over there get access to
the latest content even if you register
if you can't view the content that then
and there you have access to all the
content to you afterwards okay thanks
very much right thank you
okay and that concludes our early
morning romp through java technologies
I'd like to thank you all for for coming
and listening this morning I know it's
sometimes a lot of traffic to get
through and nine o'clock is pretty early
for some of us yeah I resemble that
remark and but but I I think you know I
hope it's been useful for you I think
that there's a lot to offer and I hope
you get a feel for the kind of
investment that Oracle is putting into
into Java and also a feel for the the
kind of excitement that we see in the
community as a whole a lot of new things
to to try out if I hope that you've all
gone away having listened to Brian going
all right now it's really time I'm ready
to go and try jdk 8 you know give it a
whirl and and give give feedback now so
that if there are any issues that you
like to point out to us is there's an
opportunity to get them fixed on the e7
side please take a look next week at the
webinar or in the following days as
everyone says and also a bunch of you
know interesting things both on the
client and in the embedded space that
that hopefully will spur your thought as
you're going forward so thank you
everyone and have a great conference
