Francisco 2014 in the four year of the
grand hyatt hotel and I'm here with Juan
Gomez senior mobile engineer at
eventbrite hey good morning one good
morning so what tell us a little bit
about yourself and what you're
passionate about I'm really badging
about Android and mobile in general I've
been doing that for a long time one time
like six years of its inner areas of
Android and then before that I used to
do a lot of a lot of j2me and a little
bit of windows mobile no Windows Phone
Windows Mobile so yeah I do any palm OS
to a little bit yes and a little bit of
brew but mostly j2me and windows mobile
where my my strong suit excellent so
what are you here speaking at the
conference about my talk was yesterday
it was about app indexing which is a
Google technology to kind of tie your
website with your app so it's it's
really interesting and a lot of people
don't know about it so that was kind of
my my my idea to try to expose more
people to it so what is that indexing a
big thing thing is basically a way for
when you're searching for something on
Google instead of google sending you to
someone's website and usually a lot of
websites are not mobile optimized
instead of you pinching and zooming if
you happen to have an app for that
website the Google search the Google
searches all would basically take you
straight to the app to the content that
that you were looking for instead of
taking you to the website it takes you
to the abbot so for instance i'm looking
for a recipe for like pumpkin pie and i
have an app for recipes and I so I
search for pumpkin pie and then when i
click on it instead of taking me to a
website it takes me to one app that i
have on my phone straight to the pumpkin
app recipe or in a memorized case if i'm
looking for bay to breakers or
governor's ball one of the big events
that we have instead of taking you to
our website it takes you straight to the
app straight to that event and then you
can buy tickets or if you already have
tickets you can get directions on how to
get there and stuff like
now give us an idea how is this
implemented inside of Android from a
developer perspective okay so from a
developer perspective is actually all
intense so it's something that you put
on your android manifest so when your
app gets installed you get registered on
on on the android OS for a certain type
of events so on your android manifest
you have to give it a format basically
of that URL that that you're looking for
and then every time Google sees that URL
either on the browser so even if it's
google search results or if someone is
reading for instance a web page and it
happens to be a link that matches the
format whenever they tap on it it's
going to take them to your app so it's
something that happens I didn't tell
time and then the the formatting you
specified on the on the Android manifest
the minute that happens your app gets an
intent and then you deal with int and
you kind of deconstruct the URL and then
load up the information and show up to
user just really cool does this actually
mean we can start bringing kind of the
world a restful interface design where
each resource and each location is truly
addressable like right now in Android
when you you look at the API level the
address ability is achieved just by
sending it to an activity and then
hidden inside of the body of the intent
is the metadata that the activity has to
decode is this moving as more towards
that address ability property I think
that's kind of the point and since it
still works with a URL schema you can
have unique identifiers for your content
and that's that's part of the idea I'll
and that's what Google is pushing people
to its if if I'm looking for something
specific and I click on that link i want
to see that information on the app the
problem is that's where it stops the
minute you get the intent as you
mentioned there's no real built-in
mechanism to go straight to the content
it's something something that the
developer has to build by himself
basically so although it's trying to get
us there that's still not not a building
mechanism on Android to to be kind of
restful and and and be able to address
content inside a nap with something like
a URL which would be ideal but there's
nothing built in at the moment but this
is kind of taking us there
I think if this takes off Google might
think about this seriously and have a
built-in way for you to address content
directly within your app now this is
this kind of linking work between
applications not just from web to app
from app to app as well ah so the this
is mostly a web to app so on the Google
side and that was mostly what I was
covering but there's also a really a
really good initiative on Facebook's
aside to do linking from app to app so
and in basically making it
cross-platform it's on Android we have
intense so we can address all their apps
and basically send information over but
they wanted to do something
cross-platform and I think their
initiative it's called app links so you
can register with Facebook and it's
basically trying to build inner
communication between apps i own a
cross-platform weight so it works on
android and iOS and there's also an open
source initiative i think it's called
open links i'm not entirely sure about
that one but it's an open source
initiative since a lot of people are not
scared but they have the reservations on
things that are completely driven by
Google or completely driven by Facebook
so this open source initiative tries to
address that and be developed more in
the open they still don't have the
traction that Dad app indexing and maybe
deep linking has on Android but the more
we started seein I think the more
interesting this space is going to get
now what about content providers content
providers are at least intended to
provide us this kind of address ability
of resources but they're not necessarily
linked to a display where do you see
content providers fitting in with this
type of architecture i think i Kund
embroiders are for something like this
they're ideal ideally you would get the
URL matching on the Android side you
would get the URL pass to your app to an
intent and then ideal you take that URL
and sent and send it to a content
provider that will give you give you
back what you want if you use that type
of architecture it kind of ties in
cleanly the problem is content providers
have their own issues that i'm sure a
lot of android developers are familiar
with and and they're also give us a few
examples well i think for a lot of
simple cases they're overkill it's it's
really hard to get a content provider of
the one
off the ground and well implemented for
something simple as it's it's overkill
so sometimes people because you need to
have you need to care about like storage
and and how you load and a lot of
different things that that you don't
necessarily need all the time so for the
stuff that's really simple a counter
provider sometimes it's overkill and I
think that's probably one of the of the
biggest downsides and in it there's
there's complications it was a great
idea but it's been around for a while
and I think I see Google kind of going
back and forth with it because it used
to be contemporaries used to be king
right around the first few versions of
Android but now you don't see them
anymore they don't use them on on like
the documentation they don't recommend
them as much as they used to so I'm yeah
comfortable wires are not i'm not sure
if if but they have their own set of
problems it's fair enough now we need to
start describing this deep linking are
you doing this with just a normal HTTP
scheme or are you actually defining your
own scheme and protocol in terms of the
URL patterns so right now we're using a
combination of both we actually went and
registered with a I o'day I yeah I a na
keep forgetting the name I na we want to
register our own protocol schema which
is what you should do if you're a good
net citizen but we found out that HTTP
is usually enough for most of what you
need so we have both I'm not suggesting
people go out and register their own
protocol HTTP is usually enough for most
of your needs so but we went out and did
that with your registered and we're kind
of using both we're using our own mostly
on the iOS side but on Android we're
using a combination of both but we're
finding that HTTP is solving most of our
needs so we're slowly migrating to more
on interest using the HTTP one so
developers out there that are looking to
do this type of deep linking and app
indexing they could just get started
with HTTP and not have to worry about
going all the way through the hoops to
register a custom protocol ideally you
should use HTTP you if you already have
a website you should you already have
your your kind of
your schema you should just use that and
leverage all that value that you build
on your restful URLs and your
descriptive URLs just use that in
leverage HTTP so for most use cases that
most people have HTTP should be now
excellent now moving out to kind of the
broader picture what's the most exciting
thing to come out of Android this year
in your opinion well I think the tools
part is really exciting tell us about it
and really just hit 10 as of yesterday
so I think this is probably wake up call
for everybody to just start thinking
about migrating to Android studio it's
time to let go of Eclipse and come over
to Android studio this is the future of
Android tooling it's time to to those of
your aunts crib and bring it out to
Gradle and start embracing this new set
of tools because the potential that
these tools have it's amazing so a lot
of the stuff that you used to have to
jump through hoops on eclipse or an to
get off the ground give me silly
examples things like continuous
integration and and things like
deploying alpha or beta builds from from
your your scripts dependency management
is a huge problem so a lot of people
used to use maven with some sort of like
an thing it's a grated covers oldest so
dependency management continuous
integration testing Gradle is great for
that so and in the fact that Android
studio works we create a lot of the box
so you get all that power for free
basically it's a great combination so I
think Andrew show your heating 10 it's
it's a great milestone for for Android
developers in general because now it's
time to start switching and and start
taking advantage of this powerful tool
do you recommend that for established
projects as well as new projects I think
right now 10 it's it's a release
candidate but as soon as as they have a
stable 10 I'm sure Google will do a
full-blown PR thing on it and I think
that would be the time for established
projects to move to it so I think people
now that the ERC's out you just start
exploring and seeing what things you
need to fix and what you need to change
to move over once the stable releases
out
now what about with lollipop of material
design if you started bringing material
design yet into your applications at
eventbrite yes I think it's material
design is it's really interesting for
developers and and for designers as well
and lollipop the art runtime it's really
interesting there's a lot of project
bolta on lollipop it's a battery
optimizing at strategy and there's a lot
of battery measuring api's now so you
can measure the impact your app has on
battery I think that's going to be huge
for a lot of especially long-running
type apps so you can be mindful of the
battery that you're consuming on your
user's device all that's going to be
really interesting we're starting we're
starting to look into material design
you get a lot of like if you've been
using the support library and using
things like the navigation drawer or the
the pool to refresh it has a different
name on the support library if you
upgrade to the new support library
version 21 you get all that stuff with a
material look and feel for free so
that's that's really convenient so we're
starting to explore and try to see how
it fits together with with our company
brand and our company the direction
we're heading on on the design front but
we're definitely excited and are going
to be embracing it really soon now we're
really curious as well what libraries
that are you guys using at eventbrite so
there's a lot of really great
third-party initiatives out there trying
to take some of the sting and pain out
of android application development and
it's a little overwhelming for somebody
just going out there and seeing a bunch
of them which one's the best what should
we be doing when it comes to development
libraries it comes to testing libraries
when it comes to dagger what are you
guys doing it Eventbrite um so I hate to
be really prescriptive because
unfortunately is not a one-size-fits-all
so libraries that work for for one
project are not necessarily going to
work for all projects but there's
definitely a lot of good stuff out there
definitely most of the of the things
that Square has open sores are greater
than I think most Android developers use
them or like most undeveloped developers
that I know use a lot of the stuff that
squared puts out as in particular we use
we use butter knife which is like a
lightweight version of
dagger only for for doing injection on
on view related things which is one of
the most painful things on on the
Android side there's a lot of
boilerplate and and you can get a lot of
advantages by using dependency injection
on so it's a lightweight version of
dagger it's still something that's
Square released with that in mind
there's people that don't need the
full-blown power of dagger they just
need a lightweight dependency injection
only around the bu side so it makes it
really easy for you to basically wire
all of your view code with your all of
your view layout with your hbu code
without having to ride out the
boilerplate all defined by ID and
getting all the controls and and
matching them to specific objects that
you can address on your code it takes
care of all that boilerplate it take it
takes care of boilerplate like writing
click handles you have to write a click
listener for each of your controls that
the user is going to interact with
butter knife takes care of that too on a
really clean way so it's it's
lightweight if you're not ready to take
to take on the full power of dagger you
can start with something like butter
knife and then move on to 22 dagger so
daggers great they have Auto we don't
use odor we use a vent bus which is the
exact same the same pattern but we made
a decision to go with the vent buzz for
certain reasons when should people be
looking at using either order or event
bus what problem are we using these to
solve event buzz is a it's a really
powerful pattern when when you have a
lot of broadcasts listeners and
broadcast senders basically on on your
app because it can it's it's a it's a
good thing that the the end of platform
has but when you're using it a lot it
gets really really confusing to follow
the code and the biggest problem that
broadcast listeners have and and and the
broadcast pattern in general is that
there's no type safety because you
basically put everything on a bundle and
you throw it out and then you have to
basically unpack it and then verify it
the biggest advantage of using an event
buzz is you have type safety because the
event buzz
requires you to put a type a specific
Java type on the bus and then any
activity or any component on your app
that are listening for that specific
type will get notified as soon as that
type is available in the bus so you have
you get the type safety you don't have
to check if the object that's in that
broadcast is what you're looking for or
not and that's a huge advantage and it
saves you from writing a lot of
boilerplate code and the code just
becomes a lot more readable and a lot
more easier to maintain the less code
you write the less bugs basically that
you're opening yourself up to so it's
it's it's a good when when you're
feeling that you have a lot of broadcast
and a network of broadcast that goes all
around your app that it's getting really
hard to maintain it that's when you need
to start looking at something like an
event bus and now looking forward from
where we are now where would you like to
see Android go in the next few years and
what would make your life easier as a
developer and an engineer writing these
killer apps how would you like to see
the Android platform support you I
earlier I'm really excited about tools
and one thing on the tool side and the
language side I'm really excited about
Java 8 and and lambdas and and and how
concise and clean the language becomes
so I'm excited friendly to adopt that
what we're doing now at least xandred
adopted yet pricing entry support java
he not not out of the box so what you
can do is and that's what i was
recommending people to just move on to
understood you it's on android studio
and I'm Gradle to you can basically
configure the the IDE and and and the
build system to use right now I think it
supports the java 7 syntax but i think
java decide they're out it's going to be
out really soon so you can use the Java
8 syntax so you can use all the grade
lambdas and you can use all on maybe not
the the splitter Raiders and the streams
and the all the fun stuff but at least
the syntax part and then the IDE and the
Gradle system will take that code and
then rewrite it for you on a nice job
java 7 compatible way so they can be
compiled on Android and and shipped on
the app's but at least the code that
you're writing on the
you can take advantage of all that nice
syntactic sugar and not have to to be
waiting for Android to adopt basically
Java 8 so you can take some of the
advantages by using Android studio and
configuring to to use the job I ate so
just to get that clear so what you're
saying is we can use the Java 8 language
syntax but we're still using the old
Java 6 and libraries in terms of the
actual API correct so I'm doing still
supports Java 6 so what the IDE does it
it rewrites that in a way that the Java
6 compiler can compile it and then put
it on on the on the Android device so
it's still running on java 6 it's still
when it compiles is still java 6 syntax
but the ID is doing the heavy lifting
for you and translating those idioms
into actual java 6 code that can be
compiling a droid excellent thank you
very much it's really always a pleasure
having you with us and getting here all
the great things you guys are doing an
event bright just sharing it with the
android community this is just an
exciting time to be an Android developer
well thank you very much for having me
thank you let's go enjoy the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
