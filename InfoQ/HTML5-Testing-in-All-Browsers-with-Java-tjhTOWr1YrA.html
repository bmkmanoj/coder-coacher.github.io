few minutes just does anyone kind of
brave enough to venture a guess at what
the solution is we have one yeah the
name of the method that would be printed
anyone else have a anyone else think
they're smarter than this gentleman any
ideas so if I told you that wasn't the
answer would that help so everyone's as
smart as this gentleman even if I tell
you okay all right no other guesses
anyone thinks it like doesn't compile
since JavaScript doesn't compile that's
a bad answer to so no other guesses
nothing okay so I guess we'll go ahead
and get started and I'll kind of jump
into things kind of jump back to the
beginning here and we'll we'll get to
the answer that in a minute so testing
in all browsers kind of taken html5 to
the next level or something like that so
what we're trying to do today is talk
about you know all the things we're
doing with html5 and all the innovations
in the browser but unfortunately you
need to test those kind of everywhere
and in talking about some some tool
chain to make that possible so I wrote a
Jenkins plug-in that I've used quite a
bit extensively to be able to test you
know writing automated tests once and
then letting that run in all browsers so
I'm going to go through kind of a bit of
that today so a little bit about me i'm
the vp of engineering it just me just me
is in the mobile social space with you i
phone Android html5 for myself my java
champion three-time java one rock star
so this is actually a java one rock star
talk so everybody loved it at javaone so
i hope you love it again today wrote a
book web 20 fundamentals and I run three
big user
groups that have thousands of people all
meet at Google the Java user group the
javascript meetup in the google
developer group so if you are local you
should think about attending those and
run events every month so but the last
kind of point there is I'm not a testing
expert I don't really you know testing
is not only thing I'm a developer but
with a lot of software is building I
kind of felt I needed these tools and
doing a lot of innovation in the web I
wanted to go out and kind of you know
make sure that my quality was there and
being able to know that it's there in
all browsers and those differences and
so that's why I kind of put the the
plugin together to integrate with test
warm and that's what we'll talk about
today so outline kind of look at some
background look at some old school stuff
kind of look at some of the more modern
stuff and then kind of next generation
stuff that that I'm kind of proposing
you work with and show you some of that
so puzzlers how many of you are familiar
with this book the Java puzzlers from
Josh and Neal so it's a very yeah
anybody read it yeah it's a very good
book yeah Mahesh has yeah so it's a
really good book very famous and there's
all these like weird edge cases that all
were in Java where you get these very
very unexpected results and wait till
you get closures and then you're like
really good I'm going to be full of
puzzlers so there'll be a whole new book
I'm sure on that but one of the things
with the nature of JavaScript you know
being a dynamic language and and and not
being statically typed there's so many
more puzzlers and the puzzlers just sort
of when you you know like I said you get
these results that are completely
unexpected so here's an example then we
had a few late comers that came in I'll
put this up and you can you can kind of
think about and look at I know if anyone
else has any you've had a while to think
know anyone so I'll give you a hint and
that is I so by default you know
variables or global scope unlike Java
where their function
scope right so the eye is here within
this a Xyz be XYZ XYZ is actually the
same I is what you have over here in the
XYZ method so anyway very very confusing
right so i can i can show you oops oops
not that way i can show you kind of the
q unit test that shows you we were
expecting the big long thing but we only
got the shorter thing so so there you go
so next let's get to a little bit easier
puzzler and we'll ask you to to to let
someone else teach me a little bit of
JavaScript so what is the length of my
should we say my array huh but anyway
what is the length of my array if I same
I've r dot length and everybody sees
that there's a trailing comma at the end
right so how many people think it won't
compile okay well good that's a good
anybody guess it's like undefined 34
he's thinking it's for depends on the
browser it's for everybody thinks it's
for anybody think it's three yeah so
what do you think oh he's not as
smart as he thought he was no it's early
he doesn't know all right so the answer
is it really depends so if you said
three you're right if you said for you
were right or we can look at the glass
half empty and you were both wrong I
don't know some days the glass is half
full I think today it is but because
none of us are at work but we're at work
we would all say or you're wrong so but
here at the conference i'm going to say
you're all right so the length in sort
of a modern browser is you know is very
very different right so i can take this
here and show you exactly what i'm
talking
about in chrome just if you guys haven't
used the dev tools and then later whoops
there later on I didn't write a test
thing for this so I wanted to show you
that the answer is three in Chrome but
then go run it in an older I Eli can I
e6 and you'll get the length of four
with the fourth element as being
undefined right so I don't know how many
of you have written some like a JSP or
some free mark or something like that to
generate JavaScript variables and things
like that and and you kind of do your
variable plus a comma and you do this
like I've seen this so so many times
actually out there in the wild so I
thought it was it an interesting very
very simple example to throw out there
oops let's go over here so you saw the
answer so evolution of the web we got
lots of interesting dates we get down
here to kind of Ajax world in 2005 we
start doing a whole lot more in the
browser at that point kind of making
JavaScript kind of this dominant
language and and then moving on html5
that we kind of have today and is pretty
widely adopted and just sort of show of
hands how many of you are doing a lot of
web development every day good good very
good how many of you are in testing a
couple very good all right that's great
how many of you here thought you were in
the lamb to talk nobody that's good that
stuff's confusing so I want to shift
gears a little bit and talk about why
automated testing is is is kind of
important and one of the things that I
think is very important is that
developers do their own testing
themselves and that's that's kind of
what i think is important so maybe you
have a QA department maybe you have a
testing team but i definitely think
you're going to get a lot of value out
of writing test yourself and it really
lets you know the second
things broke so if you think about kind
of your going out there and and if I if
you see a test case failure you know ten
minutes after you write the code you can
walk right in there and fix it but think
about exponentially how that cost of
that or the amount of time that it takes
you to fix it you know if you find that
two hours later you're not quite sure
what you what happened if you find it
three days later what do you do you
start pointing fingers it's a guy over
here it's this guy over here couldn't be
my code its back end its whatever it is
and it leads to a lot of a lot of costs
and a lot of kind of issues so sorry I
think it's very important you know that
early bug detection is is really a huge
thing and some of the other reasons I
like it you know is what we're doing is
such bleeding edge in the browser it's
really really important to to be able to
do that and every time you write a line
of code to be able to know you know does
it work and one of the things that kind
of at the bottom that I think for me is
very important is I want to be on the
bleeding edge next project i want to be
on the next big thing I don't want to be
on the old legacy project I don't want
to be hung around with that and so if I
can give the next guy confidence to step
into what I've built then I can move on
very easily so anyway that that for me
is helped me kind of keep on the
bleeding edge of what what I'm doing at
work so that you know I can move on okay
so testing I'm not the only one who
thinks it's important so Google has
something that they call kind of testing
on the toilet and it's early you're at
the urinal and sorry ladies i don't know
what it looks like in the ladies room
but and you're doing your thing and you
can see it up there and you can read
about ways of automating testing and
things like that so Google definitely
thinks it's more important than
concentrating on
your aim so so here I want to talk two
things I want to talk about is the
difference between manual testing and
automated testing so none of us are
monkeys and none of us want to be
monkeys right so don't be a monkey and
every time you write a line of codes
your kind of your kind of clicking
buttons sorry I'm doing mobile stuff I'm
doing all android now so I don't want to
be doing this all day or clicking kind
of being a monkey I'd like to be able to
start thinking about the next task and
let that run and come back and get my
result the other thing I want to talk
about is kind of the difference between
unit testing and integration testing or
functional testing you go into that a
little bit so here we talk about manual
testing versus automated testing so
manual testing has a great advantage
that you can catch some visual things
you definitely before you kind of push
it out the door you need to do that but
it's extremely time-consuming it's very
expensive and people always say you know
I don't have time to do any automated
testing and I have time to write tests
but if you think about every time you
write a line of code how much time it
takes you I can probably automate it in
the amount of time I could test it three
times but I write more than like three
lines of code i fix more than three
features and so so very quickly you're
getting diminishing returns by by kind
of standing behind that that excuse
another thing about manual testing is
because you don't have that time it gets
skipped and you you never test all the
features and you end up introducing huge
regressions and in a lot of kind of
embarrassment so automated testing much
less expensive there's a one-time cost
it's usually very small and you know it
doesn't it runs with no effort and you
can make that as part of your your
continuous integration if it's part of
the process it can't be skipped but it
you know definitely some visual things
need need human eyes make that possible
there's a lot of ways to achieve
automation so how many of you are using
tools you know things like Jenkins or
cruise control or bamboo yeah and full
of people so they're all kind of great
tools so let's talk about different
areas that you can kind of put in hooks
so you
there's different things like svn hooks
where you can say when something is
committed you can do it earlier kind of
at time of mavin you know you run a
build you run an ant script you run a
maven build and you can kick off some
kind of testing and you know when you do
that at the maven or aunt level it can
be really really annoying right because
when I write code it's ninety-nine
percent failure right my is failing
until I'm done and then I'm not writing
it anymore so what what I find is is
often i know there's bugs i know there's
problems you have to go in and
constantly be changing at ignores and
things like that so i really don't like
having it as part of mavin maybe it's an
optional step but i don't like kind of
you know that's the place that you run
it next piece would be get hooks or
subversion hooks and kind of trying to
catch these bugs before you share them
again but you know there's no way to
wait for multiple check-ins when you do
that and especially we get with local
versus remote branches and things like
that it's not always the best and the
method that I prefer is using continuous
integration you know something like
Jenkins is really really nice so every
time if you're not from anybody not
familiar with Jenkins know if you or not
okay so so Jenkins is just a kind of a
drag and drop tool kind of a web-based
tool that lets you run builds execute
commands it saves the history it has the
logs it makes them available on the
internet so that you can have a build
machine that that does your builds and
things like that and one of the most
interesting things that I did so I've
got two children I'm going to eight year
old and an eight month old I won't be
able to say that much longer but when my
eight-year-old was born I wrote a like a
nanny cam as a Jenkins plugin so that's
eight years that's the first time I've
ever kind of did something light with
Jenkins and it was just basically using
the cron feature to take photos of the
nanny like all day long and make sure
she's changing diapers and feeding him
and not holding them upside down like i
do that's only for dad but anyway that's
the one of the first things i do with
Jenkins so it's good for more than just
continuous integration so now let's talk
a little bit about unit testing versus
integration testing and I'm going to
give you a really really simple view
because I'm not a testing expert and
none of you are either but unit testing
is really looking you know internally
calling private functions kind of
calling these methods that aren't
exposed it's meant to run really really
fast and have no dependencies so not
have a dependency on a database not have
a dependency on external service kind of
mocking things out things like that and
you get a whole lot of value out of unit
tests is as you know in comparison to an
integration test which is more looking
at how all the pieces work together
looking functionally how things work
they can often be very time-consuming
you know some of them you know for me I
think a lot of times it's it's sort of a
five minutes or something but some
people get a little crazy and it's you
know it's it's a 30 minutes or something
it's not that uncommon so I see this you
know when i'm doing backend stuff i
think the most important piece for me is
often the unit tests but i actually my
own opinion is I get a lot more value
out of integration test the more closer
I am toward the client so I'm going to
share how many people agree with that
but I don't know is anybody have any
opinions there yeah nobody knows what do
you think everybody's afraid to say
anything to so I'm going to look at some
of the old school testing stuff kind of
makes you want to know put your head
through your laptop sometimes but so so
here's some of the things that I've used
in the past so I used j/s unit many
years ago and it was sort of porting you
know j unit over to the web and it's
kind of your in this this javascript
world but you're trying to write you're
trying to write Java in JavaScript and I
don't know it just felt very very
unnatural for me especially the more I
learned about JavaScript there's a
really nice tool Rhino which I talked
about project Nash horn
you know that it's coming out but but
Rhino is really nice because it let you
have JavaScript engine running in Java
so that you could run unit tests without
having to launch a browser or anything
like that and HTTP unit was built on top
of rhino but the one that I kind of
liked the most back in the kind of web
10 days was from canoe the canoe web
test does anybody use candy web test no
well it's a lot of fun you should check
it out and this is what it looked like
so it's kind of a XML like I would do I
think I'm doing some Google search here
and I want to invoke this URL and when a
verified has this title on the page and
then I want to find the Q which is like
the search box and from a search box
then I can type in a value click the
button that says I'm feeling lucky right
and and verify that the resulting page
has a title canoe web test so this is
kind of an example of a vaca new web
test I actually did quite a bit of stuff
with it many many years ago doing some
jboss portal stuff and things like that
really enjoyed it here's I don't know
you guys can read that at another time
so selenium how many of you are familiar
with selenium thank ya yeah there's a
lot of great things we're using
webdriver to launch browsers and things
like that what's more centralized so I
kind of progressing from some of this
old school getting a little bit more
modern with selenium so selenium you
have current a selenium ide that's like
a firefox plugin or add-on and you can
kind of right click and say you know you
can add your test in selenium and it
lets you write your tests in all these
wonderful languages like HTML like who
the hell wants to do that java c sharp
perl PHP python and ruby but what
language is missing javascript so all
the JavaScript developers out there who
are writing these great libraries can go
and I don't know
right there test in HTML I don't know
how that's possible but anyway that's
that's what selenium is and you know
it's it's very kind of a centralized
sorry i guess i'll talk about this now
so this is what the HTML kind of looks
like right so here it's the same kind of
thing that i did with a canoe web test
so it's an HTML table open the URL type
in q hello world wait for you know
Wikipedia to be available in the search
results and then a search that's a whole
hello world program right so that's what
selenium looks like you can export it to
Java and it's just equally as bad as
what like what you felt before and this
is kind of the model there so they've
got a tool selenium RC which lets you
run it in multiple black browsers and
multiple platforms and and we'll kind of
will kind of talk about the problems a
little bit right so like we talked about
already you can't write your tests in
JavaScript so you're doing these great
html5 widgets and things and you got
these great html5 developers who know
JavaScript and you're asking them to
learn you know python or something weird
to generate scripts or Ruby I guess it's
just a better example there so other
problems if you want to launch browser
it's a very centralized system where you
have to have a server that can have and
launch all these browsers so you kind of
have to maintain that you know looking
at things like now with the mobile
trying to do android and iphone it's not
possible with selenium it's really
really difficult so they're making
improvements to selenium to stuff but i
think it's not really that good you
can't do any unit testing whatsoever
it's really looking at the screen and
clicking buttons and it's you know it's
a black box testing tools you have no
idea what's going on in the internals
really really difficult so I've you know
when when I would do stuff with selenium
i would add hidden buttons to the screen
that like you got with a hidden you know
query string parameter and do weird JSP
includes to kind of try to make the
ability to call private JavaScript
functions and read values and trying to
hack in every way possible to make it do
what you can do with tools like like you
unit so so what is Q unit right so Q
units written by John resins part of the
jQuery so we all know everybody use
jQuery at least know what it is kind of
yeah lots of fun stuff there so Q unit
was written there you know with jQuery
is sort of hey I'm going to build this
great JavaScript library but I you know
things like j/s unit are not very good
and so this is an example of the output
so cute it actually runs in the browser
so all you do is inject a few a few
lines there and you can run that so
we'll go through some examples but this
is basic output showing a failing test
you know you hear that you have in the
various assertions that you have so
here's a quick example of a test so this
is called my first test passed it a
closure and say okay 1 is equal to 1
does everybody know what the answer is
everybody and then the second one 2 is
equal to 2 so 2 is equal to the numeric
to right so let's close this one so we
don't get confused and here they are the
first test runs and the numeric whatever
one numeric is equal to the one string
so did everybody know that in JavaScript
yeah that's very very painful right so
if you don't if you don't believe the
test there we are true and just to say
like I'm not bullshitting you like when
is is definitely false so any questions
on this kind of
so far no very good so jumping over the
next example a little bit a little bit
more advanced so so here we we looked at
different assertions here doing okay
talking about you know the first
character is this third character
testing the length so here you would
find a test so later I'll show this
running and kind of all browsers and
we'll see how I older I ease you get
different results than what you get in
the modern in the modern versions so
we'll jump over and look at the results
here so there they are right and you can
do things so I closed that other brow
tab the other tests had a failing result
in it no it didn't okay this one will
I'll show in a minute so this is our
kind of a third result or third test you
can do okay just hard coat of false here
so that you guys can see what a what a
failure looks like and and there's the
failing test you can hide the the
passing tests so that you won't see that
and kind of filter things down things
like that so it's kind of nice so that
is Q unit so you know it's a lot
different you know here you're writing
JavaScript something that the html5
developer very very comfortable with
able to move forward with that and in
you know the language that they wrote
they can call the private you know
functions that they have and it's it's
it's really the tool for the job much
much more so than an html5 table yeah so
what the question was is is kind of
what's the you know how can I look at is
this different in IE is this different
in chrome is this different in Safari is
this different in in you know my
androids you know native browser the
Android chrome and with qunit you would
actually run this so you take this URL
and run it on all of those loops you can
you can run it kind of in all of those
right so
I go out here we'll run this in Safari
oops and then you can get the same
result in Safari you can run it in IE
and that's very very painful right
because you have so many different
browsers that you want to test and so
i'll show how you can automate kind of
doing that in in all browsers or all
that you'd like to test how about that
all right so how do you do qunit right
so this is kind of what the code looks
like for doing that so I have a
JavaScript whoops down oops I should
look at this screen off that one so this
is my my test the only thing I have to
include is a div with the ID of qunit
and that's where the results can go ad
there qunit j/s file and that's kind of
what runs it and then this inject is
something for tests warm which we'll
talk about later so that's not required
unless you want to take these results
and ship them off to a centralized you
know certain server there for holding
pen oops your results so what are some
of the limitations right so as I just
show it qunit requires kind of a custom
page for testing right so if I wrote
some kind of a widget I would have to
write a web page to put it on right
because I have to be able to execute it
with an HTML page so that's kind of
sometimes can be a little bit annoying
you know I made a lot of like drop-down
widgets and all kinds of different trees
and all kinds of different things and
then you would have to you just kind of
build a little simple testing page for
that another thing is if you want to run
it on you know like your live page I
would often include kind of query string
to say test equals and then and then it
would include that something like a JSP
include to include
like the line of the test that you that
you wanted to to run so what are some of
the limitations right so if you're
writing a web 10 application like qunit
is not the tool for you selenium is the
tool for you because it doesn't live
through page loads right so if you
submit a form and come to another page
it doesn't you know the JavaScript all
reloads you get a whole new test and you
can't look at the value you passed in
shows up on the next page right so it's
kind of a major limitation so I
sometimes still did a bit of work with
selenium to kind of solve that another
tool I wrote was something that ran
qunit test inside of an iframe and you
could you could kind of run tests and
things like that so Q unit has no
dependency on jQuery or any other
library it's a standard loan library
that was written to test jquery so you
can test anything with it is that that
help yeah yeah so it adds methods like
the okay and things like that and test
so those bends through looking for all
all the tests and runs them so so here's
an example like some fooling around with
my website one time and and i added a
query string to specify a test and then
it would I put the the little div tag ID
qunit at the bottom so that I could see
the results and then you would actually
see it clicking buttons on my website
and then recording results down here
kind of live we should probably add like
an example that in the slide deck but
it's kind of fun where you see that the
page moving and you know you guys have
all seen that before but you know just
like I said just add the snippet of code
in your in your site and then the quarry
screen to get at it so now we'll talk
about another problem of kind of waiting
for things to bind and waiting for
results to happen right
often if I click a button and then
something's going to appear right you
have to wait a certain period of time
but you want your tests to run as fast
as possible so one of the things you
could do would be click a button and
then wait five seconds and then assert
the result right that's not so great
right so a lot of the work I did I use
something from the folks a tap into and
if you guys know a pen to but it's a
jquery's consulting kind of does support
and things like that did a lot of work
with them and they did something called
when available and so that you could
pass a jQuery selector which is not here
but you can pass a selector and when it
evaluates to true or when it's like
available when that returns a result
then execute the the block inside and
then it has a timeout and I look at that
and they did when available and I said
you know guys I really want win true
when something is true like you know not
just did I get a result but maybe I can
do some sort of assertions so we made
that available they haven't really made
it that available to the public I don't
know I think you can probably find it
but they don't talk about it that much
but this is another library that you can
use called funky in it I don't have that
much experience with it but I've heard a
lot of good things and i recommend you
know checking that out so basically here
they've got an autocomplete item near
the bottom and you're waiting for it to
become visible so if you go above they
found the input and they type JavaScript
and they're waiting for the autocomplete
to drop down and when it does drop down
with the options you're looking for
JavaScript that has five results right
so you can't you know you guys have used
auto completes you know there's some
kind of lad before things show up you
have to wait for that another thing
that's kind of important that to talk
about is you often have to wait for
things to bind click listeners and
things like that so if your test is
running as fast as like a computer can
possibly run which is really what you
want it'll end up clicking on buttons
before any listeners are attached so so
let's switch gears and talk about kind
of next generation so
oh we want to be able to test this in
all the browsers so here I've got some
kind of different different things you
know Safari and Firefox and things like
that but but really you've got all these
mobile devices as well so there's a
whole suite of things that we'd like to
be able to test it on and even if you do
have an automated test running those
tanks would take you a very long amount
of time so talk about tests warm which
I've kind of lightly introduced earlier
so what tests warm is is you can see in
this diagram kind of a server that sits
out there and browsers can connect to it
right so browsers connect so here you
see all these firefox 3 35 36 oops they
don't have that there but but and then I
six seven eight nine ten all these
browsers are connected so all you have
to do would be you know you call your
mom you say hey long you got a really
old computer I'd like to know if my
stuff works can you go to this URL so
all she needs to do is go to a URL it
sits on the page and her browser will
pull down to the test swarm server and
it's pulling through the test form
server and saying is their test
available is their test you know I'd
like to help you test right and then a
job can be submitted and then it sends
it out to all the slaves so all the
slave nodes then would run that test
does anybody know how they would run
them any guess how you could do that so
they run it inside of an iframe so if
you think about an iframe is basically a
browser inside of a browser or a window
inside of a window if you speak more
JavaScript and so they're able to run
your test in an iframe which has all its
own scope and it's independent so that
that helps quite a bit and that's what
makes it possible right so here's an
example of the dashboard and you can see
if I said hey you just wrote a line of
code can you tell me if it runs in every
version of chrome on windows XP every
version of chrome on vista and you know
and just go through the list and tell me
runs in all these places well doing this
is very very simple with tests warm
because all you have to do is go to a
browse you know go to URL you can have
everyone in your team you can send it
out to your company hey can everyone go
to this URL so i can tell you when i
when i first started using tests warm I
walked around the office and I saw a
bunch of old machines so hey can I have
that that's not even plugged in that's
not on can I have that and it kept
gathering machines and the reason I did
this is because I wanted to run ie6 ie7
i-89 and you can only run one version of
IE per machine right without using IE
tester but that kind of gives you
different results so it's not not really
the right answer so I end up doing that
and so then I stacked all this up
on my my my desk is very loud like you
know you can barely speak and a lot of
heat as well but I had all the dinosaurs
of the company in my cube so it was kind
of fun so kind of recapping selenium
versus tests warm test warm there's no
client config whatsoever just in
somebody URL right so you know that's
really really nice browsers support it
runs everywhere even mobile there's no
brow you know any browser that can go to
URL can run an iframe and you're in good
shape there it's open source JavaScript
support so can you write JavaScript in
the you know for your test and can you
call JavaScript functions yeah but not
that much adoption right so test warm
was also written as a mozilla labs
project which you saw probably in one of
these yeah in one of these screens also
by John Rezac you know crater jquery so
he saw the problem i saw the problem and
it was a good idea so selenium you know
you have to have this kind of
centralized server that kind of launches
all your browser's you kind of have to
own that and licenses and things like
that and it's kind of I don't know not
that not really what I want to try to do
it's really nice to keep those apart
it's open source
but you know JavaScript supports really
really limited and a lot of adoption now
yeah so all the qunit stuff that I 0444
test form so tests warm so i'll show you
the kind of a link here Oh test warm can
run qunit which is kind of what it was
originally you know a lot of the work
but it also supports running you can
read the list there even selenium so my
favorite is the screw unit so that's
kind of an interesting name at that but
mocha and the deck dojo a lot of
different options are available kind of
in that area so now we'll talk again
about Jenkins a bit scheduling builds
kind of both Crom style and it can pull
your your repo and kind of look at
things like get and say you know is it
time to to run a build you know have
people checked in code supports things
like quiet period where if you have
developers who tend to like check in in
blocks it can wait for five minutes and
wait for all their check-ins to go
through kind of happens a lot especially
with things like CVS where you have
different modules that have dependencies
and things like that so it can be used
to deploy web apps to test environments
run integration tests and for me I wrote
a test form plug-in right so i was using
test for my was real happy with it i was
using it and then manually kicking off
jobs and I kind of got a little bit
tired of doing that and so I said why
don't I just plug it in to this you know
i was already auto updating my website
why don't I at the same time run tests
with it so we're going to show a little
video here that shows kind of using
Jenkins with tests warm and then a
plug-in that I wrote so we'll kick this
off get ready to enjoy so here kind of
the first screen you can see I have lots
of differences the iPhone simulator and
then what we have Chrome Safari Firefox
and
this is android so i took my android
phone all these devices and kind of
connected them to my server here you can
see actually is the iframe where the
tests are going to be run and then you
can see kind of the results of its been
running it ran various tests earlier so
here if you kind of watch you'll
probably see oh not here what's that
yeah absolutely yeah yeah it's there to
run unit tests so if you don't write
unit tests it doesn't doesn't buy you
too much alright so those are the tests
there so this is Jenkins so there's the
job i'm going to open it up and then
here i can see kind of past results
right so we'll go back just a little bit
hopefully i can yeah so you can see what
was passed what was failed i had the
three tests that i that i was showing
you earlier passing and failing and you
can see the results over time for those
of you haven't seen jenkins and see kind
of details of all those results so here
down at the bottom this is the plugin
that i wrote you see the three different
tests where you're saving the results so
here you can configure one of the tests
to find the name kind of the title and
then specify the URL where that testing
pages that runs it and like i said
before the only thing that you do have
to include is that inject script in
addition to queue unit and the inject
script you know will be used to be used
for selenium or any other of those tools
so now we run the bill and then here
because all of doing is pulling the
api's that are in inside of tests warm
so here we can see kind of the results
of the various tests how it was going
sorry it's a little blurry but and you
can see it's going to wait a few seconds
waiting ten seconds it says to get the
next result on the right you can see the
test running now we're kind of looking
at the results boom that one just
finished right so it's kind of if you
happen to open tests warm right you have
a test form server and you have Jenkins
the this window here on the left is is
actually is actually the test form
server itself what you would get if you
didn't use you know if you just use it
out of the box you can watch it run and
it finished now you see that test that
right here where to go the test to right
so this is the first test the second
test in the third test third test always
fails the second test fails in ie8 but
passes in ie9 right so there's where you
kind of caught that that unexpected
behavior where you get a difference from
one browser to another there you can see
who failed if you click on it and then
here you can actually see the results so
even though it was run in a browser
maybe it's your mom's house you can
actually see the qunit results from you
know anybody who can access the the test
form server so that's it's really nice
that you can you can see that so now
what kind of click into that open it up
and look at it these are what the
results look like you get those results
is anybody familiar with kind of from
here down what those test results are
what that format is anybody know
I know if this is the best place to see
it you'll see little bit later so this
is it the thing at the top will give you
a real a good hint so it's tap does
anybody know what tap is no no okay
testing anywhere protocol so when I
wrote this I looked at using j unit xml
and i had written an earlier version of
a test swarm plug-in with old api's and
it was kind of but actually was pre api
so I was actually screen scraping test
swarm to make it work and I know someone
said and I all I had my output was just
console output and someone said hey you
should integrate tap or j unit I said
what is this tap thing I've never heard
of it but it's basically kind of a
standard for test results and it lets
you provide a lot more detail such as
warnings and there's a whole lot more
that you can do with it then j unit so i
chose to to have it output tap which is
a little bit nicer so i'll show you what
those results kind of look like you can
do sub tests and things like that as
well so this is actually kind of what
the results are there were 123 test
showing here the first example and then
what the outputs are the timestamps
things like that so and then lots of
things can can look at that so very good
so this is available in the in the
Jenkins repository so you can get it as
part of the Jenkins you know through
Jenkins with you know cloudbees kk
actually pushed the final commit for me
before the java one talk to make that
possible i had some problems and and
here's the official jenkins page for
that as well thank you very much and
thanks for having me mark
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
