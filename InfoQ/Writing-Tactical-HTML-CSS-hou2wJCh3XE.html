afternoon I appreciate it we're going to
talk a bit about working with managing
code a little bit about performance and
then just really focusing on how we can
also write code we enjoy briefly about
me that sets me it's it that's it's
supposed to be a catsuit it looks like a
mountain lion breeded with a rat uh but
um it's a mountain rat Wow I work at
Groupon I'm a user interface engineer
over there I teach front-end design and
development at the starter league which
is formerly known as code Academy has
anyone heard of that by chance yeah is
anyone signed up for it so we're a
different thing it was a trick question
we're an in-person school in Chicago
where we actually teach hands-on design
development ruby-on-rails UX things like
that I also helped organize refresh
Chicago as well ah and if you guys have
any questions feel free to shoot me a
message on Twitter or email at Shea it
groupon com or come up and see me after
the talk I'd be happy to talk to you
guys so I want to talk a bit about
writing your code and how many people
have that experience whether they sort
of feel like when they're working inside
of an application on a website that the
code is like just complete chaos and
real fragile right anybody I'm surprised
not everyone raised their hands you guys
must be good developers but for me
sometimes it feels like I go in and I
try and make justice was one small
change and it feels sort of like I'm
fighting just this storm I'm in this
boat and I'm in the ship and it's just
going down like we're taking on water
left and right and I had like just this
little small change but it's just
completely like just wrecking my ship
but we have like those good intentions
right and we want to do like the best
thing but troubles quickly arise
so kinda why is that I want to talk
about this for a little bit some common
problems I often see generally speaking
websites have a hard time of scaling
well right and over time basically the
code base because it's brittle it's
bloated and just becomes really complex
the more people that sort of gets their
hands on it I feel like I'm working with
spaghetti some days and i really like i
want legos right i want people things
that can just a plug and play and I can
work my way through it I don't always
get that and because of that sort of
just efficiency diminishes my happiness
does my productivity and that's just not
mine that's like the entire team across
the board so what's wrong right we have
some of these best practices these
perceived best practices they're not
exactly best practices anymore but rated
as rules or like they can't be broken
and we've never broken any rules right
we're cool there but our languages and
technology things have evolved and our
standards need to do that as well right
we've been told here that there are
these quote best practices and a lot of
these are focused at sort of separating
our presentation from our context right
getting our Styles out of our HTML and I
can get behind that but we've been told
to do things like avoid you know sort of
unnecessary elements in sort of
extraneous classes and and really
leverage selectors to do that right and
just take any styles and really dry up
our market just extract that stuff out
and this is good but but these rules are
a bit ambiguous right and often
sometimes they're taken too far or too
literal right like has anyone seen like
or heard someone brag about I made a
website i didn't use any classes or IDs
that's crazy to me that's like an
obscure and i can get behind sort of
removing like font and bold tags things
like that like getting those that are
strictly presentational elements out of
HTML but when we start talking about
like extracting classes and sort of
breaking that stuff apart I get a little
weary about it we start to do things
like this right we write these long
selectors and sort of really find ways
to leverage and get our content in there
without you know going too crazy but
this is actually a really bad attempt
separating our presentation from wrote
content right we're kind of doing
exactly the opposite thing here we write
code like this our styles are so tightly
bound to the document it prohibits any
change at all right I have this anchor
it has a class of button but what
happens if i move that outside of the
element with a class of feature right it
completely breaks so now I'm stuck
making changes in my HTML and my CSS
right what I was trying to do is not
couple those together at all that's all
I've done I've done in an even worse job
than i wanted to do before these long
selectors drive up the specificity right
and performance sort of starts to take a
hit and drag a little bit in modularity
of code it just it doesn't work it's d
crippled at this point so I say
specificity who knows what that is off
hand yeah okay for those that don't
specificity is sort of how CSS
determines which styles are going to be
applied to elements right so every
selector has a weight of specificity
right and the higher that weight is
those are the styles that are applied
right but the important thing to sort of
take away here is that we want a very
low specificity the lower the better and
that really is what what sort of creates
a sufficient code we're going to talk a
bit about this today as we sort of go
through so we have these ships right and
how do we get them in order how do we
sort of find that North Star of what we
want to accomplish with our code and
what's that baseline for this tactical
HTML and CSS that we can sort of get on
the right path and work towards right I
believe it revolves around
maintainability and maintainability like
at core right if our code isn't
maintainable what is it what could we
possibly accomplish without code that
that's maintainable right I can't scale
the site I certainly can't fix any bugs
I'm not going to improve performance
right I'm going to quickly take down the
ship every single time because the
site's not maintainable right Andy humid
South by Southwest last year he said
websites change we have to optimize for
change now sitting there I was like holy
crap like why didn't I think of that
like it's it's simple but it makes sense
we really think of websites is just this
estatic being we had to stop doing that
we sort of had to sort of think about
scale in extensibility and sort of this
reliable code and things like that and I
take maintainability and I've sort of
broken it down into these three parts i
have organization modularity and then
performance in 2 i'm going to go through
each of these a little bit today and
sort of say what i see to sort of be the
perceived best practices inside of each
one of these so I'm gonna start with
organization and I i start with
organization because it really sort of
sets the tone and drives in modularity
and then performance sort of wrapping
those two together and packaging this up
right first office is the approach right
we do this kind of bad and wrong we
think instead of pages right we think of
that static website and we sort of write
styles that way and we structure our
code based around but what does this
page need to do what do I have to get
done here right now we can't do that we
have to start a break that concept down
and think inside of components right how
can I start modularizing my code and my
Styles here across the board right we
start to take visual inventory of what
we have and so I identify those
components and abstractions I mean we
can build a library and start building
off of that and this is sort of what
bootstrap does what foundation does and
what we'll talk a little bit about those
two so I have my organization broken
down into these three groups and this is
this is purely sort of my stance on it
you guys can do whatever you want the
goal here is to just be organized and no
sort of how you're working on it and
sort of set that stone that seemed to be
that tone with your team and work across
that way but what i have here i have
base components and modules in the base
or sort of those those core styles for
everything they're going to be used on
every single page of the site no matter
what page that is and those are sort of
like a normalized maybe you guys use a
reset default styles for your typography
font sizes weights colors things like
that excuse me your grid and then
variables if you're using a preprocessor
of some sort you're leveraging variables
components that are sort of those user
interface concepts and things that are
driven out of the the UI and those are
the design patterns built into that so
alerts buttons forms things like that
modules that are our business logic
component
it's right header footer things like
that that are really dependent on the
site and couldn't be shared with really
anyone else or any other type of
application in these components can be
used inside of themselves they can be
used inside of modules really all over
the place but one thing we have to do
here is watch for sort of the
unpredictable right we have to sort of
like guess and try and see what the
future might hold I do a bit of design I
do a bit of front-end development but
there are people who strictly don't do
design and or don't do code specifically
and we have to sort of keep those people
on the same page right as a designer is
copping something which sort of work
from that visual library we've already
established and built right if I start
to see different styles for very similar
elements we need to unify those and use
that same style let's not reinvent the
wheel here and I try and get everyone to
sort of their instinct to not to be to
write CSS right like if we do this right
i should be able to go into a website
application and start writing HTML and
if i do that right it should inherit all
the proper styles i need basically
pulling from that library so i'm going
to use our do as an example here to sort
of walk through what they kind of have
going on for base you can sort of see
like their font sizes they have the
weight color here the grid inside the
bottom here their components might be
something like this there that the
unordered list inside the navigation
buttons pagination things like that
would be components right and then your
modules look a bit like this that header
that footer and notice how those
components are used inside the modules
as well as those base styles are used
basically all over the place so
modularity then how do we add always set
the tone for this right we put a lot of
attention and sort of work into the
Styles themselves right like this text
is going to be bold it's going to be
orange it's going to have this text
shadow and all that's well and great but
we don't really put a whole lot of
effort into how those styles are applied
right those selectors don't get a whole
lot of love so I want to work through
those a little bit
I think the first part of this is it
through establishing a layout right
using a grid and sort of building off
that foundation who here uses a grid by
chance yeah does anyone just curse grids
not one them at all yeah you all right
we can talk are you the only one really
all right let's get a beer I'm going to
change your mind I hope but the point
here is to sort of separate this
presentation from the structure right we
have this theme the skin to our website
but we sort needed abstract the layout
from it to an extent and i'll show you
what i mean by this who's written code
that looks like this is anyone sitting
there like yeah this is pretty good like
I write this on a daily basis and that's
okay because I work with people who do
this too and I I do this to all right
I'm know by any means of st. here but we
have a few problems here right we have
sort of that margin and with that call
them box model properties if we will we
kind of need to distract those out right
and our theme here that background in
those colors that could serve you pulled
out separately too we could do something
like this we separate the grid and then
we use this featured box class right and
now anything I sort of want to fall in
this grid right to be 400 pixels wide I
can reuse that class as much as I want
right and sort of expand and based on
that that featured box maybe I want to
reuse that may have a news modal I have
social media moment I want to have those
same styles I'm just sort of reuse that
class as I work along and I'm sort of
reusing these features without having to
overwrite anything neither right I'm not
duplicating any code as I work here if
the grid four becomes five hundred
pixels wide next week that's okay i'm
going to make that change in one area
not all across the code base some people
may be like man I don't want to put like
just nasty class names on side of my
elements that's fine you can use sass
scss different preprocessors to sort of
extend this right we can build this grid
for
as sort of a silent class so to speak
and then basically extend that inside of
that featured box to set the width of it
if we want and we can sort of do this on
a case-by-case basis as we sort of work
through things so we also need to
accommodate our content then right and
part of this is in removing that
container dependency right we have these
parents selectors we need to try and get
away from those when possible and just
style elements just outright in doing so
will sort of let us favor semantics and
allow for better semantics so we have
this again are you guys like this is
good yeah so we have some problems here
um we're really coupling that heading to
the featured box right and what happens
when that h2 changes we add more context
into that box and that h2 should become
an h3 we get a problem then right
because now again we're having to change
our HTML and our CSS we could do this we
just use a class on side of that and now
it's not coupled to the parent at all
and this can sort of adapt with
semantics as need be it could be in h2
it could be a div doesn't matter anymore
we're using a class to sort of expand
that and this will adapt as we need it
to and this is a little more performant
in the long run i might do things like
this to where we say hey we have this
featured box but if that featured box
has ever used inside an article let's go
ahead and change the styles of that and
this location based selector isn't great
either right because again we're sort of
driving up the specificity here and not
only that we're sort of overriding the
default so we're basically initializing
a style and then changing it right away
right it's like me telling Keith to go
get me a soda then when he get to but I
don't want anymore he's not going to be
happy with me so we're coupling these
styles to the parent we can we can sort
of get rid of that we could do something
a bit like this we could just create a
new class making an alternate so that
when it's used inside that article we
sort of change the style of it this is a
new class just branch from the original
we're not overriding any properties here
and we're really building that more
module
code inside of here I might do something
like this to where we have an alert
again is anyone like this is this is ok
I don't see the problem here the problem
here is becomes we have more than one
type of alert right could be a success
warning air right and we have all these
styles sort of bound in together right
and this doesn't allow for us to sort of
make that more modular and break these
apart we should do something a bit like
this right where we take those sort of
styles and break them apart for reuse
right those shared styles those ones
inside of alert that border radius and
padding subtract those that we can reuse
those across all the different types of
alerts we have we can create a new class
just for errors alert air and expand
based on top of that and change that
background color right those theme
specific styles just based upon that
specific error message so if this was
success or warning we might have a green
background in green text or yellow or
blue depending on what type of alert we
wanted to use here and again the same
way we did before if we wanted to use
SAS or something so that way we could
basically extend that alert class into
every alert message we could do that we
wouldn't have to use multiple classes
per element I'm a fan of doing it either
way really I think this is actually
pretty clean it makes sense to me so I'm
not opposed to doing it this way at all
I mentioned specificity and we want to
keep that low and one of the best ways
to do that is to be really explicit
inside of our selectors and one of the
best ways to do that is to use classes
right we have to understand high
specificity breaks the Cascade okay and
cascades like one of the most beautiful
parts of CSS right it's in the name but
what we do if we're creating really
specific selectors as we start to write
more styles below them inside the
Cascade they won't even apply because
they're being basically rewritten by a
more specific selector above it
completely breaks down to cascade so we
have to keep this low and there's a few
ways we can do that
we can avoid using IDs we can sort of
just avoid bang important at all cases I
don't think most people going to argue
with me about that and I don't see a big
difference between IDs and being
important right they're both explicit
nothing really Trump's son right these
tube in my book are kind of mutually
exclusive we can use these short
selectors right I try and keep them for
three levels less than that by all means
if I'm going past four levels it's time
to use a class hands down I can use a
class for that so we get something that
looks a bit like this right why you
would ever use two IDs and one selectors
is like beyond me right like just think
about it for a minute like it's explicit
we don't have to do that but this is
getting too deep right and the browser
is basically working backwards so it's
having the example for the first one has
to find that class of gallery then
locate the div then work backwards find
that ID find the next ID right and the
specificity starts to grow over time you
can see in this case how it just starts
to begin it just creeps out of control
right and before too long it gets to the
point we don't even know really what
selectors are taking presidents like
which ones are actually even being
applied right we get so crazy down like
this rabbit hole things get ugly we
could just do this we could just use
classes outright and we're being really
explicit here and these then can be sort
of traversed and use on other elements
anywhere inside the site right again we
don't have that parent dependency so it
doesn't matter if this is inside an
article at day of section anything of
that nature we can sort of reuse these
wherever we want as needed and these are
efficient right not only other module
excuse me modular but they're less work
for the browser to render to the browser
is not having to hunt down that sort of
dom tree and figure out exactly what
styles to apply based on those really
long selectors so there's this formula
so to speak for measuring specificity it
includes around counting ids and then
classes pseudo classes and attributes
and then elements right so if we look at
something that has a high specificity
if we count the number of ID's in the
selector right we have primary in Maine
so we'll put two on the board for that
then let's count the classes pseudo
classes and attributes well we have
gallery and then media right so we can
put two on the board there then count
the actual elements we have a div and a
figure right so we can sort of measure
the specificity as 222 right and it's
important not to think of this as 202
that's not true it's not an equal
representation of that if we look at the
clatter sued me the low specificity one
we just have that class right so we have
zero IDs one class and then zero
elements so we have 0 1 0 right and I
say these aren't to be interpreted as
222 or 10 this is more or less just a
general ballpark and gives you an idea
you really want to keep these numbers
low back to the matter that that in 10
it doesn't carry over that one wouldn't
carry over so if I had 11 classes that
doesn't equal 110 right I think we all
understand that 11 classes isn't going
to override an ID right an ID in this
example would have a specificity of what
you might call hundred right 11 classes
doesn't Trump that so we can't think of
these as actual numbers this isn't a
direct relation but more or less is this
is ballpark for us to keep a good idea
of what we're doing here so using
classes then right I think I've sort of
beat this into the ground a little bit
but there's some things we can do in
doing this right and we can use these
sort of understandable class names Harry
Roberts I think says it best he's like
class names are either sensible or not
sensible right it doesn't matter if
they're semantics it's not semantics
browsers don't look at class names to be
semantic right let's think of them as
sensible or non sensible and make those
developer-friendly right right those for
one another so that we can each
understand what it is and let's not
deeply nest or really combine these
classes together either again the goal
here is to keep the specificity as low
as possible so we might see something
like this we have this featured box with
the call out and then dot PR whatever
that may be and then we have this same
thing but when we have dot un and these
are kind of unrecognizable class
names right what is dot un and why are
these nested so deeply among one another
right why is the specificity so high
what happens if I want to take you in
and move it outside of dot PR what
happens right those Styles won't be
applied so we sort of have these
different levels of strength here as
well again this is compiling and as it
grows it becomes uglier and uglier and
uglier be better if we did something
like this we have two nests these inside
of a parent we could just do featured
box price featured box unit right we
have better names here i can understand
what these are and sort of recognize
those on the page as well as inside the
code and there's no added strength here
right these are sitting at the same
level price and unit it doesn't matter
that unit is actually inside of price
right I don't need to put that inside my
selector my styles are going to get
there either way so keeping these on the
same level again it sort of keeps that
specificity low for us and long-term
this is more modular more performant we
can do something like this we have dot
button dot large we can combine these
two classes and what our selector is
saying here that both of these classes
have to be applied to that element for
these styles that actually take effect
this isn't great either because again
we're raising that specificity and the
class name large is a bit ambiguous
right we're using it in the case of a
button here but perhaps we have large
images or we have large alerts right
large can be used all over the board
it's not great to use that same class
name on different elements for sort of
ambiguous reasons that we're not exactly
quite sure why it's as simple as just
adding that dash right just saying this
is but enlarged and being again explicit
about this with the class we're using a
better class name it's the same strength
so we've sort of decreased that
specificity by not combining these
together in the long run it's more
modular and we can get more use out of
this button so I talked a lot about this
stuff and this stuff was sort of
pioneered by Nicole Sullivan and
Jonathan snow the cold built basically
object-oriented CSS has anyone heard of
that
by chance yes cool has anyone heard of
smacks in the scalable modular
architecture for CSS cool these are
amazing they're basically raising the
awareness for everything I've sort of
said thus far they're advocating
maintaining ability at core right like
that's the heart of what a website
should be these guys are basically
destroying it right now I love
everything that they're doing so I
really encourage you to sort of check
them out and follow what they're going
on so we have performance then right and
performance as sort of that key it's
going to tie in our organization and our
maintain maintainability all together
right so inside of this i have a few
guidelines i like to follow and the
first one is just to reuse code as much
as possible right avoid any duplication
as we can if there's any stale rules
clean them up right like we're working
on these massive code bases and
sometimes there's so much code in there
that it might not even be necessary
right sort of clean things up as you do
it right um and so I think of my wife
when I do is like she's doing dishes or
like put like a dish on the coffee table
and then walk into the kitchen to get
something else both why don't you put
the dish back in the sink you're done
right it's really cleaning up after
ourselves as we're doing other things
yes she's going to be really mad at me
that's okay so we need to sort of find
these patterns right and remove any
duplicate properties if I find myself
copying pasting code like I immediately
stop I'm like what am i doing I should
never have to do that right I should
find a way to reuse that code make it
more modular another part of reusing
code or excuse me unused code is
deferred loading of styles if possible
right if your home page is the most
important page in your site and you know
that it gets the most traffic perhaps
defer loading the styles of some of your
sub pages until users actually go there
right only load what you need to up
front if possible so inside of code
reuse we might have something like this
and it's just like it irks me a little
bit these repetitive like declarations
it just builds really blow
code and over time this is again gets
worse and worse we could do something
like this we could create a selector and
we could just sort of extend it with a
comma and sort of combine these two
together what would be better those if
we used a better name a more modular
name inside of it we could reuse that
over and over as necessary we would
really have to go into our CSS and
continue to basically grow that one
selector based off of commas so the
other part to this is then minimizing
request right how many HTTP requests can
we get down I don't know where I heard
it or who told me but they said like
Shay what's the fastest HTTP requests
that's a guy I don't know I like the one
that's not made so we can do here is we
can combine files right any of our CSS
JavaScript let's sort of compress those
down into one file each where we can
write and reduce the code weight of
those we can reduce some of these HTTP
requests by using sprites and data URIs
and things of that nature too so image
sprites who's using sprites off and very
good awesome so this is kind of
repetitive for you guys but this is what
we do is we make one HTTP requests for
background image right and in this case
I use the icon class to sort of set that
on to these spans and then I use
additional classes to sort of set the
position of that background image only
to expose what we actually need of it so
the only thing being shown is that
unique icon what we have here so my
advice here though is just to sprite
common images and don't go overboard
right don't take every background image
you have on your site and condense that
down and enormous bright because then
you're sort of going back to that old
thing of just loading more than you
actually need to for users right find
one small sort of sprite maybe it's just
the footer of your page keep all those
components together and sprite
accordingly to those not across the
entire site data URI is anyone using
data you are eyes by chance yeah a few
of you guys cool daddy your eyes are
interesting because we can basically
take that data from an image and use it
in line right and this basically avoids
any HTTP requests at all and these work
both in HTML and CSS
the only problem here is we have to sort
of use these with caution right these
are extremely difficult to edit so if
this is an image that you're working on
or tweaking from time to time you're
probably better off using it as a
background image or just an inline image
outright we have converters to sort of
basically drop images in and then give
us the basic data URI out of that but if
that's an image that's constantly
changing I wouldn't recommend doing this
so use these with caution so compressing
files and caching files did anyone see
the keynote this morning about caching
was great and I can't echo what he said
even more so two things I I do I
utilized gzip compression I cash my
files and then I also lost ously
compress images and in lossless leaves
basically reducing the size of images
without like losing any of the quality
inside of those so who's using the html5
boilerplate yes great so there's this HD
access file in here and there's gzip
compression built into this for us
there's also cashing in here for us
right this works on most Apache servers
generally speaking you have the right
modules and things turned on but
understand it's also in your host is
sort of best interest to basically serve
up files as quickly as possible and as
small as possible for you as well so
doing some of this stuff we can sort of
cut down these file size dramatically
right I just quickly did a test and
again this is going to vary based on
what you do but here I'm cutting things
down about it around but sixty percent
right I'm going from 4.1 8 kilobytes in
my HTML down to 1.65 and you can see my
CSS again I'm cutting that down
substantially as well inside these
images is not going to work very well
for you guys because of the projector
but I do have my slides online you could
sort of go and see how this works but
I've taken this image and originally it
was 455 kilobytes and I've compressed it
down to 401 basically shaving off a
little over fourteen percent and the
quality this image hasn't changed at all
right the only thing these really
compressors do is sort of go in there
and remove comments and unnecessary like
color profiles that aren't being used
inside the image
there's a few programs out there that
can help you with this when I use quite
a bit is image Optimates where you can
see the screenshot here that's specific
to Mac so it's okay windows people I got
you covered there is PNG gauntlet right
and is anyone using code kit by chance
yeah code kid has some of this stuff
built into it too as well so we have
these ships right and how do we how do
we build these websites for the long
haul then right we're going to focus on
maintainability we're going to keep our
co2 organized modular perform it but
we're sort of a good place to get
started inside of this well we can build
a style guide right twitter-bootstrap
the foundation they've done really good
jobs as if go look at those and see how
they've done it and sort of copy what
they've done to an extent see what
they've done it adapt that for yourself
inside of your own projects where
necessary again that instinct shouldn't
be to write new CSS like strive to get
to that point where you can just write
your HTML and your styles that are
inherited on top of that review some of
these methodologies I talked about
object oriented CSS and the scalable
architecture for excuse me scalable and
modular architecture for CSS I'm going
to continually sort of test and refactor
your code use CSS lint the inspector
page be tools like that to really drive
up the performance of what you got all
right thank you guys
