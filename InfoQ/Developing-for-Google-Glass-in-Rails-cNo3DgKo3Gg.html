hardware since most people have not
really seen glass or plated less too
much this is something that I didn't
really know about so it's something that
I wish I'd known more about so in the
main part the focal part of Google glass
is this top right screen where you're
looking into that's where you get all
your information from now it's kind of
not what I expected it's really small
it's on the top right so you really have
to stare into it it's not like you can
focus on something in front of you and
the screen at the same time it's not at
all augmented reality there's no real
way right now at least to see what the
camera is seeing through that little
screen and even if there was it's kind
of too small in this iteration at least
to be used that useful for augmented
reality is at least as far as I've seen
and you'll also note that you can kind
of tell when someone's using google
glass because there's like a white light
right there so it's not that discreet
yet not sure if that factors into any
applications but it's just something to
be aware of so there's a couple ways to
interact with Google glass as a user the
first is this kind of touch pad on the
right side which lets you swipe left and
right and also up and down actions
though those aren't that used in the
current the current OS yet this you know
fits in very well to the way that the OS
is kind of presents the navigation right
now where everything is just kind of a
screen and you're just flipping left and
right to go past screens and you go up
and down to go down and up levels of
hierarchy the next button is just a
dedicated button right above the camera
and that just lets you take a picture
I'm sure that you can use it for other
things but right now it's only exposed
for pictures along with that there's
various other sensors that can be useful
there's a accelerometer gyro as Oswald
was saying actually the way to turn on
google glass is to move your head up so
it can actually sense that and turn on
or turn off google glass accordingly and
it can also respond to voice and there's
also this interesting sensor kind of in
the inside which looks at your eye and
tracks it Google hasn't really
officially said what they're using it
for there is one open source project
which kind of hacked it and use that
sensor to check if you're winking and it
would take a picture if you're winking
so that was kind of interesting it's not
clear if Google's going to officially
let users are let developers access that
but it's something to be kind of wary of
as Google moves forward with kind of
getting this ready for consumers so the
next step is apps apps are kind of
interesting because there are a lot
different than iOS and Android so I'm
just gonna use the example of New York
Times for a lot of these so for the new
york times app on iOS or android I'd go
to the App Store download the app and
right there I'd see all these articles
I'd go click one read it and I'd kind of
be done maybe I'd open that once every
couple days or once every couple hours
depending on interested i was on google
glass so there's no concept of native
installation there's no google glass app
store where you go to get your apps i
think there's a lot of in a lot of ways
is because the screen is just so small
it's really hard to navigate so instead
you kind of owe OAuth through so just a
simple kind of sign in with Google glass
on any website they kind of take your
credentials and the app is just kind of
added but there's no concept of you're
not pulling information from that app
once you have it it's all notification
based so it's all the developer chooses
to send a notification to your glass
after you've signed in so because Google
doesn't offer their own kind of listing
of all of the apps on Google glass
there's a bunch of third party sites
that kind of list all of the major ones
and allow you kind of link you to the
OAuth screen right there so let's kind
of walk through how the New York Times
lets you get their app so the first step
is you go to New York Times calm / glass
on any device meet your computer the
android phone and iphone that's not
linked to your glass anything and all
you have to do is connect my glass and
that just that's a standard Oh up to
Google prompt word asks for google glass
timeline and glass dot location
permissions let's say you accept that
and you're done kind of now the Google
the new york times app is on your google
glass whenever they choose send
notifications you will receive them
until you revoke access New York Times
kind of makes it simple it just success
and you're done but most apps i imagine
we'll kind of from here you're signed in
with your Google credential
this is a unique unique ID for that user
and there you can manage settings New
York Times maybe you choose I care about
this category this category not this
category and kind of all of these
settings or generally would be
determined and decided on on a website
that the user can access from anywhere
rather than a glass device itself so i
mentioned cards so the base element in
the google glass UI is a card so as soon
as you turn on your device by moving
your head up you see this card in the
middle which is just gives you the time
and ok glass so the way you interact
with this is it's a pure voice card so
you say ok glass search for X or call y
person and from here you can do all of
the voice commands you want that kind of
integrate mostly with search and other
Google products like Google Hangouts as
soon as you're on the screen however you
can swipe right and on the right side
you'll see a list of all the
notifications from the apps you or
you've subscribed to and these will just
be the newest to the oldest it's kind of
an infinite list it'll just go on to the
last one i think google images to seven
days worth of notifications but it's not
very clear and so the newest ones in
front so generally when you turn on
glass you'd kind of check for the new
couple notifications until you got where
you stopped last time and that it you're
kind of updated on what's happening
however an interesting part is that from
the ok glass card if you swipe the other
way you get a list of pinned cards so
these are cards that the user explicitly
is decided are important to them and
they want always to be there so that
they don't get swallowed up by a list of
new notifications that might come and
come in front so a nap so an example pin
card might be something like the weather
which is kind of updates automatically
when stuff changes so the user always
wants easy access to that to see you
know the weather so that's something
that they might pin and so pinnable
cards is the feature google allows in
their api that allows users to pin your
card and from there you generally use it
to make updates or you know use it to do
things like i want to send a new tweet
so go to this card and send a new tweet
so notification cards come in a lot of
shapes and sizes I mean they're all in
the same 640 x 360 bucks but they are
they look a lot very different so this
is Twitter which is just exactly as you
too
this is kind of what it looks like on
the website this is what it looks like
it's mobile app and now this is look
what it looks like on Google glass the
new york times though kind of chose a
different approach so they have this
pretty card with the picture on the top
you click on that and you get a list of
stories and you just can navigate
through all the stories by swiping left
or right the stories are on this the
second row and from any of the stories
you can click on them to read them out
loud and what New York Times is done as
has they put a longer snippet so they
can maybe show the title and maybe a
couple sentences in the card itself
because it's so small but they say you
know here's longer text I'll be read
aloud if the user so interested so now
moving on to the API so the base the
base object in the mirror API then is
the timeline it's a timeline card which
has some display content developers can
choose if that just text which Google
auto resizes to fit in the card or they
can just have arbitrary HTML arbitrary
in quotes because Google is a very
strict list of tags that are allowed and
not allowed there's no JavaScript
allowed and they have a limited you know
very small size but you still have a lot
of CSS three options kind of just within
the confines of the glass glass mirror
API proper but in addition to just kind
of supplying this HTML string which is
just rendered on the mirror on your
glassware you've got these a lot of
interesting interaction options so one
is display time so every card in every
card has a date like a created apt type
date but you can actually specify when a
card should be displayed so let's say
that you have an alert happening or some
to-do item happening in 10 minutes you
can say the display time is now plus 10
minutes and would actually that car
would always be in the front of your
notifications until 10 minutes passed
and after that it kind of start
filtering back based on other
notifications that pop up in front of it
you can also specify speakable text so
that's text that you want to be read out
loud with the card since a lot of times
and most content heavy apps will see
this you can't really fit most of the
content you want on the little screen so
you'll want to have some way of
extending that content be it you know
letting the user email to themselves or
just being able to read it out loud
there's also the option of bundling
cards which is kind of interesting so a
lot of times you might feel confined
very confined with just a soul card but
you can actually have a card that links
to a list of other cards which you can
then swipe through so you kind of saw
that New York Times where they have a
picture card and clicking on that
picture card gives another list of
stories from New York Times so these are
called bundles and they're one nested
list of cards so one of the more
interesting parts that kind of separates
Google glass from let's say like an
apple push notification Android push
notification is that you can interact
with it so Google has something called
menu items which are just you can
specify zero or more menu items which is
just a way to interact with it so Google
has some built-in like a reply which
will actually let you talk to that card
and it'll transcribe the text and send
it back to the server you can delete a
card read it out loud pin it if you want
but you can also create your own custom
actions on cards so you know Twitter
might have a tweet action New York Times
has you know could potentially have like
an email to me action if I'm interested
in that story so all you need for these
is kind of a UID that your server could
recognize plus a name and an image
Google's also kind of started testing
out States so you know default pending
confirmed and remove unselected but
these are kind of still new we haven't a
chance too much of a chance to play with
that in Google just doesn't have
documentation on these yet but I think
they're really evolving kind of how you
interact with it and making it more
complex and more natural for the ways
that you'd normally see on a website
where you know retweet might be toggled
as retweeted after you retweeted a tweet
timeline items can also have attachments
so these are videos images so an example
is you might have an app that shares an
image with somebody else in that case
that timeline card would just have an
attachment which is an image or video
the other base object in Google glass is
location so these are pretty typical to
give you the latitude longitude and
accuracy plus the address and display
name if possible and these are kind of
interesting because you can not only get
the location of a user if they choose to
share it with you but you can subscribe
to google and google actually ping you
in a you
moves at some frequency and you can also
check you know where things like time
line items were created so you can see
where let's say a photo was taken and
perhaps kind of react accordingly on
your back end so the way to kind of
listen now because you have these all
these actions you need to subscribe to
google by giving them a URL and Google
will just ping your URL when a user does
something to a card so they these are
called subscriptions in Google's mirror
parlance and they're really just call
back hooks so what you provide to Google
is just you know I want to create a
subscription for a user so an auditing
user so I create a subscription you pass
in a user token which is just anything
you want presumably like the database ID
for that user some verification token to
verify that this was from google and
google every time then a user kind of
interacts with one of your cards google
will just ping your server saying user x
did actions you know ABC to this
specific card and you know your server
can react accordingly what's interesting
is that they kind of batch these all
together a lot of times because the
mirror or glass rather can be used
without internet access so you get it
like an array of actions of the user has
done since they last synced up with the
glass from a development perspective
this is kind of interesting because one
you have to create a new subscription
per user it's not something you set per
the application so it's per user so this
user I want to create a new subscription
for them that points this URL with these
fields and then Google will send those
back rather than you know for this
application all updates from all users
should go to this URL and also the
callback URL is HTTPS only but Google's
added some tools allow you to kind of
deal with it better and development mode
so the API for all of these things is
pretty simple it's just a simple REST
API with the standard delete get insert
list patch and update patch an update
our kind of interesting from api
standpoint because you know i haven't
seen that too much in many api's
recently and patches just kind of
updating a subset of fields versus
update replaces that object with a new
object that you specify
by one of the really annoying parts
right now is that you can't use the
mirror API unless your google glass
owner so what Google is done is they've
kind of white listed all of the owners
of google google glass they've kind of
white listed all of their email
addresses so only those people can
access that api and the Google API
console so the workaround for now is if
you don't have a pair of google glass
you have to you know get someone who has
google glass to create a new google
project and then have them invite you on
it and from there then you can access
the mirror API which is kind of really
annoying and I hope that Google opens it
up so that anyone can use it or at least
tested you know if they don't have glass
so as I kind of alluded to before the
typical workflow for a google glass app
then kind of different from a regular
app is that the first step is just
authorization so you'll wat with Google
you'll ask for some particular scopes
and it'll just kind of work you'll get
this access token in a refresh token and
if you have cards that have callbacks
you'll presumably want an insert a
subscription right there as soon as the
user Ott's in with the app and you know
if you want to send a welcome card or
pinnable card with some action that your
app does right after they authorize
would be the perfect time to do it
because then they'd get it immediately
if they're wearing glass so then kind of
from there it's just kind of offline you
decide oh I want to send a notification
to this user so you have to verify their
access token if it's expired if it's not
working you can request a new one from
google with the Refresh token and then
from there you can just insert a new
timeline card update one REE bundle
cards kind of whatever that action you
want to do is after you send a card then
you have to be kind of watching your url
to see if the user does something so
typically what will happen is Google
send some packet that says user X did
actions y YZ on this card you'll take
that you'll return a 200 to google and
then you'll just do the actions on your
server and then update or delete cards
accordingly so now i'm going to hand it
off to han who will talk more about kind
of practically developing with the
mirror API
i'm going to give you guys a little bit
of context here i think this is very
right so this is a google glasses github
account and you can see that they have
you know several different repositories
these are quick start sort of bundles
that you can use to get started
accessing the mirror API I know this is
an Android talk just kind of funny
because no one's really specializing on
Android here but originally this talk me
and me and canal we spoke at a at the
San Francisco rails meetup and the
reason for that was because as you can
see here you have no Ruby and so the
point of it was you know to sort of
advocate developing for the mirror API
using Ruby but since you guys are
probably more familiar with you know
Java being Android developers something
that you guys probably want to know
about all right so I just kind of want
to get a feel for what you guys like
your experience levels I mean do you
guys have you guys developed web apps i
mean is android just a specialty or how
many people here have developed web apps
use json all that stuff all right cool
oh really
well that's that's great that's great
awesome then so the argument that I made
before was that you know I mean like why
would you want to even develop for for
glass right I mean no one has it how
many people here have it too it's got to
be like a percent right so all right I
mean that leaves pretty much 99% of us
out of luck right so I mean what is the
argument for developing for glass well
me and can all just randomly decide to
do it one day and it ended up taking us
about three days at the time I think
they only had two or three of these and
the documentation was a lot more sparse
so the situation is such that today with
the resources that are available it
should take you guys a fraction of the
time maybe a day you guys have apps that
you guys are currently working on
probably you guys are developers right
yeah so you guys have like you know a
back-end service that you guys might
think about creating a new platform for
right well I mean just the fact that the
mirror API is just ridiculously easy to
use should make it sort of an easy value
proposition for anyone here right
alright so the mirror API is just kind
of a fancy name for a very limited
version of a web app I mean what you're
essentially doing is creating sort of a
diminished version of a browser
experience I mean what you're doing is
you're sending in a JSON request to
Google snippets of HTML this HTML is
parsed by Google and then insert it into
a Google Glasses Google users or glass
users
device and you have restrictions on the
amount of CSS you can use as well as
well you can't use JavaScript but it's
kind of makes sense considering the
device right i mean it's not a huge
screen interaction is rather limited so
the way i think of it is you basically
have a little browser right here the
menu items to me I think of them as
links that's all they are there are ways
to interact with the app right your
server will process this response user
clicks a link they'll send them back
some sort of interaction whatever it is
that you have decided to do right so I
mean it should fall within that comfort
range that you guys already have you
know developing apps or whatever right
so that's so the value proposition yeah
well if you're using the mirror API I
believe writing a native glass app that
would be untrue probably get server
interaction through a native glass app
pretty sure I mean you can probably just
make an HTTP request simplicity I mean
it just it's but what are you going to
do with that exactly i mean like let's
let's just think about some of the
possible yeast cases because i think the
success of glass I mean comes down to
you viable use cases right i mean like
what are you going to do right i mean
there's a little screen here it's not a
HUD so let's dispel that myth you know
like it's not overlaid on your eye
you're not seeing the identity of the
person in front of you you're not you
know evaluating you know how tall they
are or you know I mean nothing like that
right it's just a little screen in the
corner of your eye
right I mean so like I mean the
potential benefit of JavaScript to me I
think anyway is very limited here
because the interaction is limited I
mean form validation implies that person
can actually use a form you're right
yeah absolutely absolutely I mean so no
no i mean like okay think think about if
you were on the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange you had pair google glass
you were getting real-time updates about
events that were occurring across the
globe now everyone else is screaming
they're buying they're selling you're
getting these little updates and that's
queuing your ability to buy yourself yes
it's so it's like it's imagine Twitter
only it's right there in front of you
all the time yes Twitter on steroids
that's exactly what it is that is
exactly what it is I mean that's just
how I think of it it is it is an
activity feed right it's a way to get
updates location-based apps are going to
do the exact same thing they're going to
give you updates right so yeah I mean
like you know in one respect you can
think of google glass apps as being sort
of a restricted sort of diminutive
version of an ass on the other hand I
think of it as personally being very
liberating because this is a new
experience it's hard to imagine the
different possibilities for it and the
fact that it's so confined makes it
easier for me to think about things the
different combinations of things to make
right and the different use cases that
are possible from it but that's me so
min can all developed for google glass
it took us three days but we had the
intention of extracting what we had made
into open tours Jen that's a like a ruby
library so that people can develop stuff
for easier now there's a lot of
resources for for glass right now I mean
there's google has their own sort of
libraries which allow you to interact
with the various libraries api's but
none of them are tailored specifically
for the mirror API which is something
that me and canal had worked on so show
you exactly how easy it would be to get
going with
a glass app so this is rails if you guys
never mix if you guys have not familiar
with it it's I'm just creating a new
application here
now you need to have obviously user
account so I'm going to include a ruby
library which allows me to create that
here I'm going to create I'm going to
install authentication here's my user
model
now I'm going to install sort of the
interface to the mirror API this will
take a second it'll generate some stuff
for me so in order to interface with the
mirror API you need to have
configuration keys which can all point
it out you need to have a pair of glass
floor now there's a way to circumvent
this I mean there are in fact glass meet
up so you can go to the glass meet up
you can talk to somebody who has a pair
of glass if you sweet-talk them they
might be willing to you know lend you a
pair of API keys for your app if you
wanted to get started right away would
be nice though probably the way to do it
so
ok
so I have now created a basic rails app
which has a user and it has the gem
installed I have this other rails app
which has the actual keys so obviously
you need the pair of keys and I didn't
want to do that live so I will just
start here I'm going into the console
i'm going to show you exactly what it
takes so let's say this is me this is a
user the user also has a google account
which is generated by this gem right now
what i can do is i can create a model
which represents a timeline item which
is a card which is something that you're
going to be posting to a user with class
stock price right how to make sense oops
I have to make sure that's migrated
sorry
so here we have our glass top price
which I just created
so now I've created a timeline item so
let's say I wanted to
okay so
so when you create a glass app through
the mirror API I mean what you are
actually doing as you can see here is
you are inserting HTML and you're
posting that to a user each of these
templates here that we have generated
for you
our predefined by by Google these are
the basic templates which they tell you
hey you should adhere to these templates
when you're using the mirror API right
here's one with just text here's one
that auto resizes here's one with an
image in the background right and so
here image full that's the image with
the background image left with the
section right image left with the table
right so these are all pre-generated for
you if you guys are using Ruby now might
be a good time to convert so let's say I
want to insert into I don't know the
table or here content
right some sort of notification because
the stock price has gone below or
threshold right because that would be
important to me I want to know if I'm
losing a bunch of money
but why can I not copy that
here we go
you know if I want to insert into the
mirror API which uses a rest interface
so they have the expose get put update
post right I mean you guys are all
familiar with the stuff insert is
essentially post
alright as you can see I've just posted
to a theoretical timeline now you can
write all the logic that you want for
this but the use cases are very simple I
mean like if you if you already have an
app that deals with stock prices that
you know queries a bunch of AP is for
them then here you go right you can get
started five minutes you're good to go I
mean it's not going to take you very
much time that's the value proposition
developing for the mirror API is going
to be very quick yes yeah i just made a
post request using the gem that we
created me and canal and i just inserted
that for a google user now every like so
when you create a mirror API app you're
going to have to have each user
authenticate through Google's the
playground represents the timeline so it
will basically it's sort of like a
limited version of glass it will show
you the things that would have been
posted to your glass so I don't have a
pair of glass I just received my
invitation this week so I mean soon
hopefully I will have a pair of less of
my own but currently I do not and so
what I have to do is I have to make do
with the tools that they provide me
which is the playground and API keys
which I managed to you know talk someone
into lending me right yeah
I mean partially so you you can't do
everything that you want to do that's an
excellent question it's very limited I
mean like the the native menu actions
like reading aloud if you use the mirror
API in a very specific way you can send
text that can be read aloud to a user
all right this is a native built-in
capacity you can't do that using the
playground you can see that the JSON has
been sent correctly and when me and
Kunal we're building our app we intended
to use this function and I remember
inferring from the fact that i saw
speakable text appearing in the JSON
here in this area here that it actually
worked of course can all was skeptical
but I was correct so huh as you can see
you can inspect the result of whatever
it is that you're posted to google ah
but and these are you know just cards
which have been posted by the app that
me and canal mate and so you can see
this is this is the timeline that a
glass user would be seeing they would be
swiping through this left and right if
they were to click on this they would
have these options here you can email it
they could like it they could dislike it
but even more than that as you can see
there's a speakable text so if they
click the option which does not appear
here because it's limited they could
have this section right here read aloud
to that and it's not bad actually i
think the reading aloud function is
pretty cool google also has a native
capacity for you to speak into it and
have that transcribed into text
obviously this is sort of error prone
because you know speech to text is error
prone it's kind of a cool feature to be
able to take advantage of but yeah
so while you're developing for it if you
have bowed keys this is going to be your
primary tool ah yeah camera you know it
has a camera so you can make so many
cool apps is there a way to get data
from the camera and so you want to be
create a HUD light you you want the HUD
like capacity but it's just it's not
really there I mean like you can
possibly do that natively I think that's
probably going to be your best bet but
it's probably not going to be everything
that you think that it's going to be uh
I'm not even sure if they're versioning
it to be honest enough to get the
ballroom I mean I don't know what
they're doing behind closed doors right
I mean how much they're working on the
playground I'm I think they're probably
focusing on glass right I mean it's very
beta if you've ever used glass when it
was first released it was quite buggy
there's quite buggy it's improved quite
a bit now but the original versions word
you know you could tell that they were
beta devices so I'm sure their focus is
trying to get out you know their first
commercial release yep
I mean like I encourage like you know
bold experimentation whatever but
honestly I think your best bet is going
to be finding like the best use cases
for this very experimental device and I
think the mirror API while limited is
somewhat freeing in that respect because
you don't have to think about all of
those possible things you can think of
that use case where a person can receive
a notification any time I'm telling you
that ended of itself that capacity is
insanely valuable yeah so there's
there's a maximum number of cards and
they will expire after a set amount of
time you have a limited amount of
control you can actually delete a card
in fact you can update a card to
represent a new time so for example
whoops uh yeah
yeah you could because you could update
the display time and it's visible until
enough cards have been created that it's
pushed to the very back or you know you
have sent the post requests updating the
time which caused it to be moved back to
the front so there has to be some
control mechanism it's in place and
that's actually a very that's that's a
good observation because that's
something that you do want to think
about I mean I think that's a very
relevant design concept which is going
to be you know very important developing
glass applications as you can see right
here i've just updated it and it has
updated it automatically to the time at
which i've updated you can actually
specify a time which can be in the
future in fact
well the glass device doesn't actually
stay on so you're not going to I mean
like you're talking about creating like
a movie with timeline cards I don't
think that that's actually practically
feasible I mean yep you have to think of
it like Twitter I mean if you think of
it like Twitter it's like you don't
really have that control right and
that's exactly why the Twitter analogy
is so strong i think in my head I mean
it's just it's all about what is
currently happening what is currently
being pushed to that user well then I
mean that's just what the price come
down and also how how can you get a
google glass well people are getting now
well you can sign up for it on the glass
side yeah I mean whenever their cue runs
up to your name I guess so there's that
the $1,500 yeah it's steep um they're
doing R&amp;amp;D on their developers which kind
of sucks but you know what are you going
to do I mean like it's a very exciting
thing how many times in your life do you
even get an opportunity to experiment
with it a new device like this I mean a
new platform right you know Robert
Scoble I'm sure you guys have heard of
them and seen the picture of him with in
the shower I mean very mellow guy I've
spoken with him he's actually very nice
guy you know he thinks that the price
range will probably be between two and
five hundred dollars because of just the
cost of class I mean if you look at the
pieces not super expensive and I think
if that price range is true I mean I
personally feel like that's going to
have a lot to do with
you know the initial attraction of it
right i mean if it's like a few hundred
bucks I feel like people will just buy
it but you know that's just my opinion
matter I mean I'm going to be honest
with you guys I don't know how complex
it is to create an Android app but I do
know how complex it is to create an app
for google glass using the mirror API
and I'm telling you cost-benefit very in
the favor of actually just doing it
because it's not going to take you very
long right so I mean that's just sort of
my pitch to you guys yeah so questions I
guess yeah no I mean like I'm open to
questions now I guess yeah so so the
form elements are represented by mere
are the menu items I mean like I've
never actually tried to implement a form
element in a template
you they actually give you back the text
from the the reply action so the reply
action is a built in action I can't show
it to you on the playground because they
don't support built-in actions but when
you hit reply you can talk to your glass
it will record it it will translate that
you know as best it can into you know
written English and it will send you the
content of not only the audio recording
but also of the translated text and so
you can do something with the translated
text say I imagine or even the recording
if you're committed to you know
reinterpreting it or whatever you know
like in my sort of exposure with the
mirror API I mean I I didn't really mess
around too much with that stuff I also
didn't mess around too much with the
location stuff which is actually I think
a very interesting aspect of it but I
believe there is a way that you can take
I mean not live camera and putt but
things that have already been taking
pictures of and send that stuff tethers
to your to your phone yeah well it's
well currently in Android is probably
better because it can actually duplicate
the screen on the Android device I
believe so
you know I actually I don't know but I'm
you can probably just take a picture of
that and then do whatever you wanted
with that so I mean like I imagine a QR
code app would be very easy to make
actually exactly exactly so you can
already think about I mean like the
limitations are not really limitations
once you start thinking about the ways
that you can process information yeah
exactly exactly exactly uh you know I
just think that Google is sort of time I
they have a thing against review or
something I don't know it's all right i
mean like obviously I mean I'm enthused
enough about glass so that it didn't
really stop me so any more questions all
right thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
