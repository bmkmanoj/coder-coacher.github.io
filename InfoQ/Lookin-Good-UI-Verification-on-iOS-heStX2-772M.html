coming to this talk so this is called
looking good UI verification in iOS my
name is John I work for Yelp yeah so
this talk is like mostly technical we're
going to go through some coding examples
if you're not technical and want to just
get up and leave I won't be offended
that's totally cool so i'm going to show
you guys something that i've been
building mostly in the last couple weeks
it's to address a specific problem we've
been having it yelp so with our so i
work out our iOS apps and sometimes
we'll have stuff that will just break in
the UI and nobody will notice for a long
time so here's a recent example we had a
release where you can't see it very much
but there's a get directions button
there and it just disappeared I forget
what the bug was caused from but it just
disappeared and we didn't find out till
a user was like hey how do I get
directions on the iPad and we were like
oh we have that feature and we looked
and sure enough it wasn't there so we
have these big mobile apps they're
pretty popular we have 5 million monthly
uniques about a third of all Yelp
searches come from mobile and our apps
continue to grow in complexity as we add
more and more features so there's just a
lot more things to test and to look at
so in the past oh we've kind of tried to
juggle that is with a bunch of debug
views will have views that we can put
mock data into and tap on and we see the
view with the mock data and we can just
manually say okay this doesn't look
totally broken so this was kind of our
past system but frankly there's no way
we're going to be able to look at all of
them and even if we did it's likely that
we'd miss things that were subtle so
maybe even these like small background
changes or I don't know if any of you
guys ran into the background color
change on iOS 5 for group table view
cells but stuff like that that's really
subtle
so I started thinking about what we
could do so I began by checking out what
other UI testing framers existed and
seeing if any of those would do what I
wanted which is check and see if the
view looked right I'm not as interested
if it works I think in fact in the case
of that get directions button it was
actually there I think it just had zero
frame or something like that so it would
show up for functional UI frameworks but
it obviously didn't look right so I
started looking at a few i looked at UI
automation the apple sanctioned one it
looks kind of scary to me they use
javascript to script all their UI
interactions looked pretty heavy I'm not
sure if there's a way to run them at the
command line but didn't look super
attractive and didn't do what I wanted
also checked out squares pretty
cool-looking UI automation stuff and
that's pretty neat I like it because
it's all in objective-c you write your
test case in the objective c you control
the interactions with Objective C and
they provide easy hooks to script then
to control the UI but it's still it also
doesn't check and make sure if things
look right checked out there's Frank and
cucumber and they kind of they try to be
selenium for native iOS apps but they do
that by checking if an element exists so
like checking if a certain cell is in
the list there's also a phone monkey
which looks kind of cool you can
actually write UI tests from your from
your device by I don't know I don't know
how it works by magic I guess also you i
spec but i didn't find anything that
would check and make sure that it all
looked right I didn't find anything that
would have caught that case of the
button existing it just being too small
to see or it being hidden um so I don't
know how many you guys are familiar with
a zed shaws programming methodology
called programming motherfucker but i
like it
the thesis is that you should be able to
do most things related to programming by
programming so I set out to solve this
problem that we had of stuff
disappearing in our views with
programming motherfucker so Yelp um we
use this framework called gh unit it was
written by let's go to order here is
written by this guy Gabriel Hanford and
he's a Yelp engineer you can see maybe
he's wearing the same jacket I am and
just a really awesome engineer a really
smart guy so he built this open-source
testing framework called gh unit it's in
objective-c supports mac OS x iphone and
ipad but what it didn't do until about
5am this morning was view verification
so i wrote this piece that go that is
now as part of GH unit that renders
views saves images and allows you to
compare against previous runs so you can
see exactly what changed so here's a
couple screenshots from the UI the left
is the test runner view you can see all
the tests show up in a table view in a
view failure you can tap through and see
the to the old and the new render of the
view and it will raise a view to a few
gh view change exception then you can
tap into those and see a more detailed
view so here you have all kind of all
three steps you have the tube side by
side and then you also have the image
viewer that allows you to easily with
this control on the bottom tap between
the original image the new image and
then as you can see on the right the
image diff so it's really easy to see
what changed between your two runs a
little bit about how it works so we have
a script that you include is your build
process when you're running tests that
copies images from past runs that you
have approved into the app bundle in
your test you call gh verified view
what ghv are verified view does is it
renders your view to an image checks to
see if there's a previous image if there
is no previous image it'll raise a view
unavailable exception so you have to
approve it the first time if there is an
image it will compare it to see if it's
different if it's different it'll raise
an exception if it's not different the
test will pass yeah so we find this very
useful for refactoring so we have a lot
of shared view code that we use across
our code base that I'm always terrified
to touch to modify in any way because
I'm unsure if i change this thing in our
in our yelp kitview class what am I
going to break I could break any view
across our whole code base and so in the
past there wasn't an easy way to see
that I'd have to use our appt a lot and
see if anything looked broken but now we
have this so let's do some code I'm
going to run through an example of what
it looks like to use gh unit for view
testing purposes
so this is just a stock sample project
that comes with GH unit the only changes
you have to make to get gh unit set up
you have to set a couple build settings
that are well documented you also have
to add this build step that runs the
prepare UI test script so you copy that
somewhere into your project and run it
and what that does is it takes past
images that you've approved from past
runs by default those are stored in your
project directory / test images and then
it copies those is the app bundle so
that it can see that whether the view
has changed since the last time you
approved views so let's just run this as
it is to take a look
where is my iPhone simulator
you
okay so you can see here if I run them
everything passes everything's cool so
to take a look at my view test case here
for test ipad view controller let's go
to my view test so you can see all i'm
doing here is i'm instantiating a
version of my view controller here and
i'm calling GH verify view on it so
let's see what happens if i change that
so i have here this guy what if i throw
some buttons and maybe a segment to
control and a label on it obviously
broken you out here and we run it
we run it and we see that it fails so we
can go down here and we see the old
image and we see the new one with the
broken you I you can click through and
see and toggle between the new and the
old and then also see the image diff so
the image diff is actually taking the
first image or rather taking the second
image inverting it setting it to half
half alpha and then overlaying it on top
of the first one so that everything
that's not different cancels out and
becomes grey everything that is
different becomes some other color
that's not grey so if I'm like oh ok
yeah that was exactly what I wanted I
wanted a you know segmented control up
here a button label here that's cool
with me I can click the approve this
change button and then in all subsequent
runs it passes so one thing one caveat
here is you have to then save save that
new run back to your version control so
I have a script for that I added it as
part of my makefile to just run this
script here so let's let's just bypass
the make file just for clarity if I run
the script it looks up your simulator
directory it uses it was an interesting
script to write I can tell you more
details if you're interested and then it
set looks for all files in the test
images in your documents of your
simulator app and then copies them back
to your local version control so then I
can do git status and see that Oh in
fact that view has changed and that I
can commit it commits it back to my
version control and then everybody
that's sharing this repository when they
run it again they'll they'll be able to
see if it's changed against this new
canonical version so let's see let's
write a let's write a quick test case
from scratch so let's create a new view
controller new file UI view controller
subclass
my new test view controller let's just
do it for iphone for now I don't know
last one is iphone let's do iPad so you
can run iPad view tests and iPhone
simulator and run iphone view tests and
the iPad simulator that works just fine
as you'll see in a second so let's put
it in my iPad folder so i have my new
test view controller here let's add some
UI to it do some more buttons maybe a
text field maybe a segment to control
and then let's write a test case so
writing test cases is pretty simple as
you see from here but just to be
explicit let's go through the whole
process so we'll do new file it's going
to be a subclass of it's called GH view
test case we'll call this my new view
controller tests we'll save that two
tests our convention is generally to get
rid of the header files from the tests
you can do whatever you want but i'm
going to go ahead and remove the header
file and just put the interface
declaration in the m file itself
we need to import GH unit oops
then we need to import our
viewcontroller we want to test kill this
guy
so then all we have to do is write a
selector or write a method with a
selector that includes tests at the
beginning pretty standard for test
frameworks test my new view controller
view so will instantiate instantiate one
of these
and then we'll just call GH verified
view on the view controllers view we
make sure oGH unit iOS that's why I
didn't autocomplete so then we should be
able to build builds fine great so let's
run it
so now we see my new test here we run it
and it goes yellow I set all the all the
exceptions that are gh view on available
exceptions go yellow so that means you
don't have a previous image saved for
this view as said and the reason here so
I can check it out I can this is a
scrollview so again we're doing an ipad
view in an iphone so it takes up more
space than we have on the screen but i
can look around be like okay that looks
pretty right this is a button doesn't
these guys don't really do anything i
can then approve this change and then
all subsequent runs will use that again
i have to copy it back into my version
control if I want future runs in the
simulator to have that image as a
reference but then after that any new
time I run it
it'll pass because I have the saved
image and likewise likewise if i if i
change it just like any of the other
things
you'll fail so we can see oh this is
it's kind of hard to see so then let's
hit the diff let's look for what changed
oh there was a button here that changed
yeah so that's what it does that's how
it works switch back here and that's
what it is we think it's going to be
very useful for testing our code base
and it may potentially be useful for you
guys as well gh unit is available at
github com / Gabriel / GH unit you can
just search GH unit I think it's pretty
high in the Google results very very
useful for making sure that things look
right and that's all I have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
