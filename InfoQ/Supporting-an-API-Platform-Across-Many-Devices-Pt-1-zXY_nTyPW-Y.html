Director of Product Marketing I've been
at mastery for about six months before
that I was the product manager of the
skype developer program so i'll be
talking a little bit about some
experience at skype as well as John
explained like the API powered future is
here it's not only devices we talked
about as mobile you know at mastery our
sales guys used to go out and talk about
refrigerators that would have your apps
on them and I think maybe they sort of
three-quarters believe that this this
refrigerator was being advertised on the
today show about a month ago and there
are two mastery clients on it that one
is the AP and one is weatherbug both
supply their their information to this
refrigerator through their web AP is
neil ket car was speaking earlier today
in this room about Roe v zp I rovi as
you may know like started out as TV
Guide and through a whole bunch of
acquisitions and mergers became this
this company that owns a lot of the
metadata around TV and music and they
just released a product with logitech
where essentially turns your ipad into a
remote control that's fully functional
with all the TV information all its up
and it's fully powered by their API
happens thrown through mastery naturally
runs a business of api's conference
every year in San Francisco New York and
London I was talking with the guys who
run the USA Today API at the one in New
York about a week or so ago and I was
asking me oh so how much work how much
development work do you guys do to make
something like this happen and they kind
of look at me like you know what nothing
so when you have an epi
means that of course there's some work
on the Samsung part and of course
there's the contracting and the business
relationship but development work none
once you expose the API I was also just
down you know I was down in the session
around around cars just before this one
and of course you know the panel was
talking about how way but api's are
powering just about every application on
cars as well so it's it's happening you
know what's the what's the benefit of
this so John said you know there was
this sort of misprint about revenue but
you know really there is in the end of
the day there is this this benefit
that's gonna that's going to turn into
revenue and we'll talk about I want to
talk about why so traditionally the the
exchange the interaction that took place
between a customer and a business
happened in the context of the business
you go to the store to buy something you
go to their website somehow it's somehow
the customer is going they might be
drawn in through a marketing but they're
going and what's happening now is people
are bringing their own context and
that's of course mostly through mobile
devices but it's through devices in the
living room and all kinds of devices
that are update that these are
surrounding themselves with this quote
comes from the starbucks CEO that that
book he wrote that's in all the
starbucks that you know he realized
there's this there's this place hovering
above the stores even the even the
customers in the store we don't control
that context around them used to be you
know you could be locked the door to the
store that customer can't really talk to
anybody or have any interaction with
anybody of course not true anymore and
so the incredible opportunity and the
requirement really for all businesses is
to enter that customer context that's
created by all the devices that they're
surrounding themselves with and how do
you do that because there's there's so
many different platforms it's
complicated
we get a clue from economics so one
interesting thing in San Francisco even
a couple years ago it was very rare too
if you want to go rent an apartment that
there would be an agent or broker in the
middle and now it's rare not to have a
broker H in the middle why well the
market changed a little bit first of all
the prices became very volatile over the
last couple of years so negotiation
skill becomes important the supposedly
there were some laws around eviction and
how you do the contracts that change and
became more complicated so
intermediaries step in you see
intermediaries in a market where it
becomes difficult to reach customers and
we want to get these our goods and
services our brand on to all these
devices and as you said before the best
way to do that when it's difficult to
reach customers is through
intermediaries the intermediaries that
we see in our world for reaching devices
are basically developers and we see them
in three kinds we see them internal
developers so the folks in your own
company who are building apps and
building touch points to the customer
that are branded by yourself we're
seeing strategic partners so a great
example of that is Netflix where Netflix
is being distributed by all kinds of
large companies with close relationships
to Netflix you'll hear a lot about that
from daniel later and of course public
developer api is where anybody can build
an app using your api and companies we
find use you sometimes open all three
sometimes there's more of a focus on one
or two of these an api of course is i
think everyone would agree here the best
platform for reaching these
intermediaries for enabling them mashery
provides a platform for doing that i
won't go into that too much
but it's not the only thing that you
need in order to to reach them because
developers like all intermediate
intermediaries are investors they're
investing in your platform they're
investing their money of course their
time a bunch of stuff space so you know
that they may have a panel with a bunch
of apps that much of logos that has
limited space and then they're going to
be devoting that to you and they want to
return they want revenue they want in
some cases additional brand power there
may be some kind of technology expertise
that you deliver that you add to their
solution that makes it more complete so
of course like this isn't just for
devices but for attracting these
intermediaries who are investors in any
case you know let them try it out so
twilio has this you know try it for free
button they give you a little bit of
credit and you can try the developer can
try out that API really easing the
introduction for that developer tell
them this is how much you're going to
pay be really upfront about it coolio
does it really well or how much you'll
pay them so a lot of API programs that
will have affiliate models this is our
do the music service if you built an app
and you deliver them a new user you're
going to get paid for devices there's a
bunch of technical things I'm not going
to I'm not going to spend too much time
on the technical design of the API I
think some other panelists are going to
talk more about that but just to go
through them quickly if your API allows
the device to take as much or as little
data as it needs then you can you can
really accommodate a lot a lot of
different types of devices if you
encrypt the traffic it makes it harder
for folks to sniff keys you want to know
what types of devices are using your API
and so if you can somehow encode that
probably with the key or out there are
other ways to do it do that so you can
track what's happening what who's
actually what kind of machines are
actually tapping into our stuff of
course you want to have points of
presence near the devices for fast
response and caching responses where you
can if your content is cacheable then
that speeds as well but like I said I
want to focus on stuff that's on the the
real non technical side of getting api's
onto lots of devices which i think is
really fascinating this is a page from
the skype developer portal so one of the
things you have to decide what do you
have to realize is you know this device
is going to be that that you do not own
it usually and do not control is going
to be largely determining the user
experience for your users so determining
the the brand experience and all that
and a lot of companies are will create a
kind of certification program to make
sure that that experience fought it goes
the way you want it to I was just
downstairs at the car talk car talk the
guy from Pandora Lawrence Kennedy was
saying that they have a program where
though the OEM that builds the screen
that has pandora and it has to send that
to Pandora they'll run it through some
tests make sure skype I find this kind
of a kind of enjoyable so you have to in
order to have a skype davai davai
seeeeee approved by skype certified by
state you have to send two of them to
this guy Pavel in Estonia he then you
have sent two more to this other address
in London with all the packaging and
then there's a there's the
this is just the video one it's a 93
page this is up just the the table of
contents here it is a 93 page
specification of all the things you need
to do to make sure that this thing is
going to pass skype certification this
is this the video the audio is another
143 pages and then there's a UI guide as
well so that's a lot of hoop you know
for for a partner to jump through is
that wrong I'm not going to say that it
is it it's just an indication that skype
it's it's just so important to them to
control this experience and be and and
certify the partner if you can help with
the UI as well so show the partners how
can i how can how can you show my brand
in all kinds of different formats so
this is from clouds developer site where
possible give me give guidance to those
device developers on how to build for
that device so this is from skypes
developer site again it's a skype on
your TV guide so skype has a it's
actually an sdk called skype kit and
they have general UI guidelines for all
kinds of devices but they realize what
TV is kind of special and has these all
these interesting requirements so they
built a special you i guide just for TVs
they also did something really
interesting on branding so they have
they actually created this new brand
called plugged into skype if a product
is plugged into skype then it's not
really skype is is that is the reasoning
so if that and the sort of hidden
message to consumers
is you know don't don't get too mad at
us we haven't really checked these
people out there might be problems but
if you go through that hundred forty
three page audios back and you meet it
and the video spec and the UI is back in
a lot you can use the Skype logo and
your skype certified and in that case
it's kind of like authorized dealer you
know anyone can sell you know Volvo but
if you're but only some dealerships or
service centers that pass certain
requirements that Volvo checks out can
be authorized sort of similar kind of
thing how many people in the room know
what PCI compliance is few so retailers
just what do you guys do but I would who
raised their hand would you guys uh-huh
and what kind of company how do you know
about pci like what where is it coming
your credit cards yeah so it's it's
typically where we're a credit card is
involved especially large companies will
go through this audit by this group to
show that they are complying with a
whole bunch of standards on how they how
they deal with the information their
security policies all these kind of
things so mastery is a fully PCI
circlips PCI compliant level one service
provider which means that if you API
runs through us then it is you are PCI
compliant up to the to the device so it
makes it easy if a company cares about
that stuff they want to roll out a new
device whether it's through mastery or
however you do it if your PCI compliant
then you are taking a large bit of
liability of work away from them to to
have two so they don't have to audit
that whole pipe to your device if
possible get your API into tools that
make it easy to build out so there's at
naturally we just announced a
partnership with that Moby so a lot of
our api's are available through these
through that what they call their XDK 44
devel
uppers also if you have marketing
resources do co-marketing so netflix of
course on it is their front page their
advertising the device partners that
they work with an interesting thing
happens with support that's different
from just building a device see on the
iphone if you if you if someone has a
problem with the device on iphone they
might not go to apple to to get to get a
fix probably some people do but most
people don't know oh this is the the app
that's a problem device it becomes
different you know if someone someone a
TV or a car they have a problem with say
you know pandora they might you could
imagine a lot of people going to say
Samsung first and say hey there's a
problem with my TV so this example is
from Samsung basically they say hey we
don't deal with it Yahoo deals with that
if that's a problem so as the supplier
of that API that information et Ã 
believe as customers that way and to
have a clear line with the device maker
on how you're going to handle that terms
turn out to be one of the hardest things
for companies to do when releasing an
API clout did an interesting thing below
this on the web page they have the
actual legal stuff this is the kind of
human language hey the kind of be nice
with our API it's it's it's more
readable I think it you know it's still
pretty long and dense but it's a little
bit better than reading through a whole
contract skype for skype kit you can't
use skype kit to build a mobile app a
mobile on a mobile device so that's a
pretty big big one so you know be
upfront about these things deal with
them so to conclude to get on devices
think about these intermediaries these
developers these partners as investors
and if they are investors then you can
increase their return
through a bunch of levers like a
co-promotion all kinds of guidance and
you can reduce their risk by adding but
by being there for customer support
providing PCI compliance and as
providing all kinds of developer tools
thanks that I'll turn it over to Daniel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
