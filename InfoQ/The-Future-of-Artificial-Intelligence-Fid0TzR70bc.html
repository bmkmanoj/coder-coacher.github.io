around last panel of the day on the
future of AI exciting topic my name is
Jessica groopman I am an independent
industry analyst am also a principal
analyst with track takur research
specializes in AI and I do a lot of work
on deep learning as well as blockchain
so I'm excited to be here today to talk
about the future of AI and I want to get
started with just some short
introductions so I love for each of the
panelists to take let's say no more than
a minute and tell us about what you all
do and just kind of your context within
the AI space my name is Matteo Rashad
I'm the founder and CEO of deep view
deep view is a start-up based in
Berkeley we're focused on AI for supply
chain intelligence and optimizing
margins for manufacturers we are an sapa
partner for supply chain and we work
with manufacturers globally hello I'm
Carolyn Greer I'm with IDC I'm an
industry talonnet sorry analyst I work
in the cognitive AI systems as well as
content analytics including rich media
and also data providers and brokers just
to give you a little bit of background
just I know I only have a probably 15
more seconds but I come I've been with
IDC for just over a year come from a
more academic background where I was
working on publications and and projects
involving natural language processing
machine learning and on predictive
analytics thank you so my name is bill
Reichert and I'm managing director of
Garage Technology Ventures Garage is a
seed and early-stage venture capital
fund we invest in two guys in a garage
or two gals in a garage or guy in a gal
whatever the case may be that's our
focus I did my first AI investment back
in 1989 I have been a long time AI
enthusiast and you know that's a really
tough
to take hey so my first day I invested
was 1989 my most recent one of my
partners we just invested in one two
weeks ago so in that span there's been a
lot of you know ups and downs in the
industry and I'm look forward to having
that conversation this afternoon hello
I'm Michael I work for a company called
Prudential where financial services
provider as active globally and I lead
all our machine learning in a our
activities alright thank you
now I want to get started today by first
conceptualizing what is future of AI
because I think we probably all have
different definitions of that so the
question for the panel is where are we
now and what are your distinct kind of
individual visions for where this is
going for what a future would look like
not that it's a destination but how you
envision a future when will we maybe put
differently kind of go from on the
enterprise side just tweaking business
processes to really transfer more
transforming business models we can just
go down the line I actually did drop out
of Stanford around the same time the
Google founders I find it hard to
predict point in time given what humans
and we know about enabling the neural
networks to to predict right so as an AI
technologist I shouldn't protect okay
but just to comment I think every at
least I can only speak for manufacturers
since the companies were focused on
every executive c-level as level at a
manufacturer realizes the importance of
AI deep learning machine learning there
is not a single executive who hasn't
heard of this or hasn't realized that
they need to adopt these technologies
they are just thinking right now and
scrambling to find out what to do and
how to start and people the look of team
or the partner out or new company
and so forth so I think the realization
already happened in the market it's it's
the thinking process right now and how
fast and of course the agility varies by
size of company and geography and so
forth and then it's the it's the chaos
period of what should we do do we hire
three PhDs and get started that way or
do we partner and and and you know the
build versus buy decision and so forth
so I think we're in that stage right now
I'd have to agree with my friend over
here we are there's no way to really
pinpoint it I know we'd all love for it
to be not necessarily be West world you
know where they take over but I mean
that's that's something that's you know
light-years away but right where we're
at right now is yes everyone is
realizing that it's something that they
need to get involved in what they need
to do but it's a matter of what they how
to get involved and and the steps they
need to take and I know we will address
that specific question a little bit
later in the panel but where I think
that AI in the near term future is going
is it's the idea and the needs of
productize AI platforms it's the the I
it's where we need to start looking at
the data and the business intelligence
side that we've all grown to know and
love and rename with the data bases and
the data repositories and and start
looking at it from the perspective of
implementing these AI platforms where
you're enabling not just the subject
matter experts or the developers or the
programmers to handle this you know a
handful of them to handle this
information for data that they're going
to analyze and draw insights and obtain
recommendations you're going to need to
be able to enable people who are very I
guess the general workforce individuals
who don't have this specific skill set
to be able to
do the same thing so it's a larger
population that's going to have accesses
information but be able to do the same
things that these skilled individuals
are currently doing at this time great
thank you so I'm gonna disagree with my
esteemed colleagues here because I think
we can make some very definitive
specific predictions about the future of
AI based on my experience in this at
least two definitive predictions one is
that all of our enthusiasms in all the
different domains of AI whether it's
voice and speech or autonomous or deep
deep learning all of those applications
will take longer than we expect or think
or hope right so that was a cheap that
was a cheap prediction right
so the second the second cheap
prediction guaranteed that the that what
turns out to be most compelling or
exciting or dominant five to ten years
from now will probably be something less
exciting than what we think today that
you know the hype around what we're
excited about today probably AI I think
is going to sneak up on us and become
common and prevalent in other aspects of
our lives the way the Internet has the
way mobile has and that we didn't quite
expect and that that may take further
thinking my third less less cheap
prediction I know it maybe it's cheap or
not but I'm not sure if it's certain is
I think I think AI will become
increasingly invisible over time I think
that it will become simply an a tool
inherent in our infrastructure rather
than a thing unto itself and so for me
as an investor my challenge is is how do
you invest in AI because I'm not sure AI
is a thing that you can invest in AI is
something that gets implemented
in a whole bunch of different ways and
long ago and far away you know a
possible analogy in the in the olden
olden days there was a there was a time
in in the valley here where the next
hottest thing was called it was called
multimedia and the mirror and the really
big ideas could you imagine you know
developing a software applications that
you know included things like images and
video and sound and voice and that was
multimedia that was so exciting and but
you couldn't really invest in multimedia
per se I mean there were some tools but
that became sort of trivial compared to
the application of the tools so
prediction number three is that AI will
sort of disappear it would become part
of our sort of underlying toolkit
predictions are hard especially about
the future but the last bit I can I can
actually agree with I have three sort of
separate predictions one very much so
from the technology side and that is
that we'll finally have tools and how to
apply the kind of techniques like deep
learning but not only that to
unsupervised learning problems and I
think that that's going to be the really
hard problem and that's going to keep
researchers busy for the next ten or
twenty years but that once we have that
breakthrough I think that we will all of
a sudden be faced with a completely
different paradigm the the second one is
picking up bill to cuss in that sort of
the ubiquity I think the the frameworks
that were on the top line of the last
slide of the previous speaker that
enable us to - all of a sudden apply
deep learning in a way that even idiots
like me or something I can just write a
couple of lines of code and make it work
that that will change everything and
that will lead to I becoming like
electricity is no point talking about
that you Ridgid
contains electricity of course it does
how otherwise would have work and the
same very of course it contains the I
what you wouldn't want to have anything
that doesn't and that that's innate that
the ubiquity will be enabled by
increasingly simplified tool sets and
frameworks and I think that's a very
very exciting area to watch and the
third prediction really comes from it's
kind of a consequence of the second
third is that for the first time
companies will look at the eye not just
as sort of part of high personal ads
which is sort of excusable at this stage
but more than just some simple way to
get more cost out of a business process
or treat your customers in a better way
you will find that next prospect for
that visit you're trying to sell
slightly easier whatever it is but all
of a sudden we realize that they not AI
will enable them to really transform the
way they need to think about their
business as a whole and for the first
time we'll have companies that have you
know closed feedback loops learn from
the things that they actually doing and
not happen having to institutionalize
some kind of knowledge sharing or
learning programs that are based on
human learning behaviors which of course
never really happens so for the first
time we will have companies that I
effectively closed feedback loops that
bring the real experience of the
production line or the customer
experience whatever it is to to a closed
loop and learn from that I think it's
those those three areas one more
technical one more esoteric and the
third one fishbowl thinking around
company is actually doing something
interesting indeed it's it's interesting
how when a technology begins to work it
becomes more invisible we think of it
more as infrastructure right and I think
I yeah that is especially the case for
AI but also IOT and as we have seen
social media for example is sort of now
table stakes in terms of a
communications program I want to look at
the the landscape of this market which i
think is really interesting compared to
some other technology markets you have
you know giant technology vendors really
paving the way with their massive data
sets and their incredible computer
processing power
you know startups and innovators who are
more agile but also relying on open
source frameworks you have academics who
are doing tremendous amounts of research
and so the question I want to pose to
the panel is is where you all see this
market going and really evolving I mean
look at MySpace look at Netscape you
know these were market leaders at one
point will googles and Facebooks and
Microsoft's and Amazon's etc etc and
videos be the leaders in the space 5-10
years now do you see voids for for
startups to be filling or just be
curious how you see this ecosystem sort
of unfolding over the next five to ten
years okay I'll I'll jump in because I
am I am highly anxious on this topic
about you know sort of the cycles of
disruption and at least today I don't
know tomorrow or yesterday but today I
think we have a risk of oligopolistic
control of our advanced technologies and
you know so everybody you know sort of
an instinct here in the valley to say oh
no no no because you know we you know
entrepreneurs they can disrupt and they
can knock out the Giants but back in the
day the Giants weren't here in Silicon
Valley right they were these legacy
lumbering dinosaurs right and so we had
this conversation earlier today around
around voice around speech-to-text
right so so in the olden days you know
98 99 2000 arguably arguably IBM had the
most advanced technology dragon speak
you know speech to text and they were
the smartest guys on the planet
and then along came all of these Silicon
Valley started all these startups not
just Silicon Valley but all these
startups that were doing speech-to-text
and this company named nuance seems to
have won at some level
and how nuanced is the goddamn giant
right I'm sorry is there anybody from
nuance in the room I should so okay so
we'll see now and and and interesting
there's a funny couple of
characteristics around this AI deep
learning stuff one is is you have a
disproportionate advantage if you have
access to infinite amount of infinite
amounts of data and so you know God
bless there are these third-party
sources of infinite data maybe that'll
help us you know the entrepreneurs
compete with the googles but googles and
Amazons and these guys they have this
unbelievable unfair advantage and the
other aspect nobody talks about is that
these companies are different in
structure to your point they're
different in structure than the old
dinosaur legacy companies that we
disrupted because all of our new
generation monopolies whatever
oligopolies they are ecosystem companies
by definition you know so you know
Google and Apple and Amazon they aren't
stovepipe companies they build on top of
thousands or tens of thousands of other
companies that depend upon them to
reinforce and and reinforce their
oligopolistic position in their in their
respective markets so I worry that you
know in in this new world of of
innovation ironically we've become more
rigid in the structure of our corporate
dominance and that it's gonna be harder
to disrupt this generation than it was
to disrupt the last generation because
worst case we just co-opt absorb an aqua
hire you and then they just become
stronger so that's my aim i I'm not sure
I want to be public about the fact that
I'm I'm worried about this conspiracy of
the giants but yeah I think it's I think
it's something that could relate to the
future of AI on this technology it's
very ironic
yeah anybody want to you know anybody
want to knock mice you know knocked me
off that one okay Wow so much to absorb
there I don't I I I'm a conspiracy
theorist hi I knew NSA was spying on us
from the very beginning way back you
know before we had cell phones and
everything I'm like they're listening in
you know keywords let's drop them and
you know in the conversation but I don't
necessarily believe that there's a
conspiracy about there of this of you
know building up these the the big three
you know with Amazon and Google and
Facebook I think what their their
business model is very smart they are
they're staying at the the top and
following these trends and trying to
stay ahead of them to their benefit
which I think a lot of you know
companies in the past that are are no
longer existent or I kind of have become
less prominent they they fell behind
they were very complacent in what they
were doing and where they're what with
where they're in the market and at this
point what going back to us saying with
their that these these companies now
that are leading the industry they
understand that there are these startups
yes primarily based in this area it
seems like what looks like a new and all
like national language or machine
learning startup every day
they but they they keep an eye on the
industry they keep an eye on who's doing
what and they end up purchasing and
buying out these companies you know it's
like with you know the buy of tensorflow
and the one comes to mind and of course
everything else just went out but but
they're absorbing these technology to
the end and they're often
taking what they're able to from these
different companies and incorporating it
into their their new products and like I
had mentioned before that you know
they're beginning to productize all of
these different machine learning you
know AI platforms you know but some of
them are also buying companies and just
letting them sit there and not do
anything so I think in that way that is
different than what we'd seen before you
know I'm not saying they're conspiring
actively I think it's it's it's
structural or systemic the way you know
the way they exist in the marketplace
versus the way the private previous
generation of dinosaurs
I mean exist so but basically it sounds
like you're agreeing with me that they
have this unfair advantage which is
going to change it one or I mean you're
saying they're smarter because they pay
attention I don't think any of our
league IBM wasn't paying attention
I don't think IBM was complacent I think
IBM was trapped in sort of an innovators
dilemma or whatever but and they're not
dead yeah just to know I know they're
there one of your big clients and you
want to make sure that was terrible
but no I said IBM she did not say IBM so
a comment is not agreeing or disagreeing
right so in principle I don't think any
company is invincible I mean I wouldn't
be an entrepreneur if I thought the big
guys can be taken down right I think the
differentiator with the four horsemen or
whatever you want to call them some
common some say three right I think it's
four is actually the data set the
differentiator is this massive data sets
they've built the obvious case of course
Facebook 1.7 billion profiles right
Google with all the search traffic
Amazon on the
the commerce graph right so and that's
why the open source some of the amazon
doesn't open sourced a lot but but you
know google and facebook open source a
lot of stuff why because they actually
want to share algorithms so they get
algorithms back because they know
they're sort of their data set is the
treasure right but that doesn't mean
that there is a hold on the market that
they have and somebody can still build
the massive company that does something
around them and still gather a very
valuable data set which what we're
trying to do on a manufacturing side
right so I I think I think they're not
invincible if you don't compete with
them you can still do it if you find the
right investor right and I think they do
contribute to the eye space obviously by
you know opening up some some some
algorithms and some packages and and
encouraging the ecosystem and of course
acquiring and so forth so yeah and I do
agree that they are smarter than the
previous generation in that they are
paying attention more closely and they
are run by smarter people in my opinion
right there
I remember what kind of models I built
and on what kind of infrastructure I
built them before those big companies
came along and I'm really glad they're
here one of the dynamics I see is a and
I'm not sure how it will play out from
an ecosystem perspective is you know the
role of academia not only from a
research perspective but from one of the
horsemen perhaps this this massive void
of talent and people who actually know
how to do this you know I mean
Microsoft's acquisition of Malouda this
week was a big research acquisition deep
mine was obviously a big research
acquisition so there may be something
cooking in terms of partnerships from a
talent perspective from a research
perspective that will influence you know
both startups or or maybe what what it
goes from academia to startup and then
goes to two large technology vendors
speaking of challenges I wanted to ask
the panel what do you all see as let's
say your biggest challenge facing AI
market in the next couple of years
this can be technical this can be you
know structural governance related
ethical everything's fair game biggest
challenge every wants to go first so
from my perspective as an investor there
are there are two huge challenges so the
first one is to figure out who the hell
is going to win from the front end you
know so as a seed and early stage
investor you know these extraordinary
teams bubble up I mean so by the way my
my you know thesis about the new world
does not suggest that innovation won't
happen it doesn't suggest that
entrepreneurs should not startup
companies I totally believe there's huge
opportunities to do that I'm just you
know I'm not sure we're gonna that's
going to result in the disruption of the
big guys but so I think there's a ton of
innovation opportunity an investment
opportunity but in this particular
domain you know
nature of the tools is such that so many
people are jumping on this bandwagon so
quickly you know the comment earlier
about another NLP company being launched
and funded every day right I mean it's
amazing so how does an investor figure
out you know who do who to invest in
who's going to win and then once we
invest then the second big challenge the
second big challenge is every time we
invest in something cool that we think
is unique and compelling and has an
unfair advantage all of a sudden there
are 10 venture back competitors that
have been launched you know not just
here in the valley but you know on the
East Coast and you know in China and in
Berlin or whatever right and so you know
for an investor you know huge challenges
you know participating in all of this
it's my turn again not going to argue
with him he is an expert in the VC world
kind of going to Jessica's point about
the challenges in terms of integrating
academia I think we've all seen that and
I'm a little biased like I said have a
background in academia I think we were
were seeing that a lot of in the
academic world there there was a lot of
of projects and research that was
looking at what we're calling and and AI
in cognitive and you know with a lot of
the VR systems you know oculus I
remember we were super excited like I
think it was like five years ago when we
got one and it was you know expensive
and now they're giving them out for free
I think there is a shorter gap now in
between and we need to recognize that
and we need to look toward academia and
or you know the research but there's a
shorter gap between the the crossover
from the research side and the studies
that are being done
and it coming into more mainstream and
being going into the private markets and
I I believe that if we're not paying
attention in that world and integrating
more of the the research side businesses
and vendors and organizations are going
to be in a lot of trouble so that is one
of the challenges I think that that the
industry has a whole faces in
understanding how to do not just do open
source and not just support new foster
or a specific community but realizing
that there is a lot of crossover in
there's cross disciplines and
everything's converging so that needs to
be addressed and that needs to be
understood how we're going to to
integrate that so that there's a
smoother transition I actually think
that it's going forward is that the
companies are draining up academia that
is just that hiring all the professors
one after the other it's amazing what's
happened over the past 18 months we have
a professor I mean with all the poaching
that's happened Google Facebook Baidu
and so forth it's it's just unclear
who's gonna graduate next rising stars
you know there's sound there's
definitely I do want you know masters
and PhD level people in in machine
learning to hire and it's it's
incredibly hard to hire in the bay it is
actually a really bad place to be in the
Bay Area right now if you want to hire
deep learning people actually or not
because you are competing with the Four
Horsemen uber it is like there there is
at least 10 companies who can out with
you you know 3 X - 1 and then all the
other startup stuff right so it's that
is a gridlock and in
in the talent recruitment space right
now
hence the emergence of China yes Wow
innovation over the next couple of
decades will come from that part of the
world all the exciting stuff I'll throw
in the challenge into the bucket which
is I think a cultural one my background
is actually anthropology and I can't
unsee a lot of well I shouldn't say I
can't unsee because we haven't seen them
yet a lot of the consequences the
ethical implications of Virtual
Assistants being able to digitize
everything you know does the trip does
the autonomous car choose the cliff for
the person or the old lady etc these
classic conundrums there's no precedent
for this never mind if we do get laws on
the books how to actually enforce them
so I would like to open that question up
of where you all see some of the most
important stickiest ethical or maybe
beneficial societally beneficial ethical
implications as well as cultural speak
cultural implications for this
technology particularly since we're
talking future what I'm I think one of
the concerns that I am seeing in this
industry especially with these Virtual
Assistants these chatbots is there is a
move to hide that there is a jump to
with not not completely and totally but
there are some companies out there and
some services that are being offered
where they're providing assistance and
the people don't know and that they're
even they're actually talking to a
chatbot further interacting with
something that is a machine as opposed
to a person and I and so in terms of an
ethical from an ethical standpoint
that bothers me that worries me that
that is something that's going to come
up in in kind of bite them in the butt
but at the same time there is that point
that not a lot of people want to
interact with necessarily machine but
there that you know there's a lot of
comments and concerns that like oh you
know I wanted this human experience but
there also have been studies that show
that when given a choice some
individuals prefer to talk to an
automated system because they're just
like it'll go faster and then I don't
have to deal with the human and and you
know the different errors they could
possibly make so my concern is for men
from that specific standpoint you know
we have to decide what is acceptable and
what's not are we going to be deceiving
individuals are we gonna be deceiving
the customers or the clients and what
kind of you know there are no actual
best practices or guidelines currently
that established you know that are
established at this point so
specifically that is one of my concerns
I'm sure bill has plenty of comments so
I'll go ahead and pass Mike directly to
him are you calling me opinionated so
actually I I well I think I think a lot
of the talk around AI and the dangers
and threats and scary things about AI
are way way way way WAY overblown
I mean I think you know when it comes to
privacy boy that ship has sailed
right that ship sailed a long time ago I
mean it's I mean you know it's just
stunning how many emails get bounced
around with all sorts I mean and not to
mention Facebook but I mean the the
whole privacy ship is is is so far gone
that yes AI will contribute to it you
know it will contribute more you know
more intimate data being collected that
can possibly leak out and so but it's
not like it's all of sudden ooh a new
problem that we have to worry about its
you know the other the other the other
aspect that I think is legitimate for
you know anyone who has kids you know
you have this you know I have this I
have this anxiety around clearly the
brain gets wired differently if you
spend your time
privately interacting with a machine you
know in in the in the olden days my
parents worried about me watching TV
right because you know oh my god right
and you know so look how I turned how
did that you can go either way on that
one so but you know I see my kids being
wired a little bit differently and I did
I do worry I don't know if you can
measure it I do worry about the true EQ
of of children young adults coming up
learning social interaction from a
machine and I see you know I I got I
love Gebo I don't know if anybody have
says seen the Jibo demos we haven't seen
a lot of the machine shift yes but you
know these social robots that you know
are coming down the pike and they're
adorable I mean and it's they would be I
can you can see they're gonna be totally
addictive I think I think we're gonna
have these addictive experiences in the
same way that you know the last
generation ie five years ago was
addicted to Grand Theft Auto or whatever
right I maybe I guess that was minecraft
and then ten years ago was Grand Theft
Auto and then whatever right all the way
back to pong so but so we have these
addictive machine technology we have
these addictive technologies that are
gonna get more and more and more
addictive now you could are it's
possible that you could develop more EQ
with AI then than we've ever seen in the
past or it's possible to develop a sort
of you know unbalanced personality I
don't know do we need more unbalanced
people than this
so on is it I'm less worried about sort
of the legal you know side of things I
also think the whole we're gonna lose
all jobs thing is overblown I you know I
think there's so many forces that are
gonna be so much more dramatic affecting
our employment jobs creation economic
platform than AI or even technology
broadly I think there's a factor there I
think net net net technology innovation
will improve economic development and
jobs not hurt so I'm on that side of
that particular debate but so that's
kind of where I am a novice
I think the ethical implications are
fascinating and I I think we actually as
a society we have a duty to take
initiative on that I don't think we
should just leave it to government
especially tomorrow but but I seriously
think that we should have a partnership
between the industry stakeholders and
civic societies in NGOs that start
thinking about exactly situations like
Jessica alluded to on autonomous cars
right you know do you hit the sacrifice
the old lady so that you don't damage
your car or whatever right and there's a
lot more in that in fact you know in my
talk is just talked about automated
forklifts in factories right I mean
factory workers am I getting that pay
that much you mean we have decisions
there's to me so I think that that needs
to be front and center for a lot of
people in society and not just assume
that the the DMV will handle this in an
intelligent way you know we actually
talk to I hope nobody hears from the DMV
the second question on privacy I mean I
grew up in Alexandria right the original
one not Virginia right so I just assumed
growing up that there's always somebody
listening right and then
I immigrated to the u.s. to study AI by
the way and then I stopped because it
was BS and then right and I just assumed
that whenever I emailing and texting
somebody there's somebody sniffing and I
don't know if it's the good guys what
about guys however your definition of
the bad guys all right so then you know
I never really worried about privates
you could just assume it was taken you
know and then we realize it actually was
taken right so so I think I definitely
would build that that privacy you just
assume it's gone right whether we have
AI ubiquitous or semi or you know in
only in certain areas right but I think
the ethical implications do require
thought and contributions from everyone
in their own capacity so when I when I
look at this from the point of view of a
financial services provider so know that
I don't actually understand the a lot of
the sort of ethical dilemmas come from
and why they are seen in the way that
they are seen because actually I see it
almost 180 degrees the other the other
way I think AI will enable us to serve
our customers in a way that is not just
regulatory compliant as it's never been
before it's never been achievable by
human efforts but also it will be able
to we will be able to extend that to a
population that was never that never
enjoyed those kind of benefits that
we've seen that we've been offering been
able to offer before most most of us
sitting here in this part of the world
are thinking about the world as if it
was just a half billion or so people who
are enjoying all the comforts of the
developed world but for the first time
and I will enable us to offer products
and services to the remaining six and a
half billion people of mankind that we
just cannot serve this current
approaches and I think that that is a
major game changer
I think if you think it's not Justin
from a financial services company point
of view but it also if you think about
what happened then famous alphago was
deployed as Google this publicized a
couple of weeks or whatever months or
whatever it was ago you know for the
when they up apply it
alpha the alphago approach to their to a
power consumption and their data center
they managed to reduce the power
consumption by 15% now these are the
world's most optimized data centers
there's nothing like as as efficient as
a Google Data Center and they managed to
tune that down but whatever it is 10 or
15 percent imagine having a I applied to
the global energy system or the global
transport system or the global food
production system or the global water
system or the global climate change or
whatever it is it's just staggering what
could lie ahead of us
and it's very nice to think about the
privacy implications of the half-billion
privilege but I think the opportunity is
really in all of a sudden looking at the
world and the compute from a completely
different perspective it's it's a it's a
dual an ambiguous nature of technology
right is obviously some things can hurt
large populations of people and other
things can absolutely mobilize and and
elevate individuals who have never had
access you know whether it's the blind
being able to actually use more
technology or billions of people who you
know don't have access to internet and
network services the way that we do and
take for granted every day I want to
save a little bit of time at the end for
your questions but I'm actually gonna
give my last question Ben turn around
so my question for you panel is what
should I have already asked you or maybe
put differently what do you think people
are not talking about enough when we
think about the AI market just kind of
going so I think that we are not talking
about what we just were talking about
was privacy I think that is still just
because people are giving that away and
not necessarily you know it's like hey
that's out the window everyone's sharing
everything now
want to sharing everything as as a
Michael had indicated and yes there's
there's uses that are good and one of
the things that I think that needs to be
done is those individuals who don't that
you know this generation that's coming
up who's sharing everything that put
their lives online for everyone to see
don't understand that that that doesn't
go away you know that's gonna be up
there you know that Walton nearly
forever we need to make sure that their
rights are being protected in terms of
privacy as well so you know with the
financial implications we still have GRC
issues we're governance risk and
compliance that that is something that
needs to be addressed and I agree that
we're not there yet and a lot of the
reason is is because our technologies
and our ability to do a lot of what
we're doing is lightyears ahead and the
the governance and the policy-making and
the compliance are light years behind
because of the type of red tape that
they have to go through so that's just
one comment I wanted to make on that and
I think an another thing that bill
touched on was that's your name right
bill okay was the jobs the you know the
concern with the jobs there are I think
it's dichotomous there are two different
groups who are saying two different
things
one group of individuals is saying you
know this is a bad thing we're going to
be displacing a lot of people and and
then there was another group saying oh
we're actually going to free these
people up to augment the skill set and
they can stop doing these menial tasks
and focus on something different I don't
think we're going to be there yet within
the next five or ten years but we are
going to get there and that's something
that needs to be addressed now and the
reason is is that five to ten years now
you're saying okay we're going to take
the people now and we're going to you
know augment their skill set or we're
going to allow them to do something
that they weren't able to do before but
these individuals are going or may not
necessarily have the skillset that is
transferable to these new jobs that are
that are going to be created we you know
we no longer have to wait in the DMV
line to register our vehicle or get a
driver's license and that is something
that needs to be focused on is the
aspect of you know what do we do with
this is this a training issue is it's a
retraining issue there's already a
dearth of of talent from our nice
Stanford dropout and poacher about that
so you know how are we going to fill
this gap and how we're going to deal
with this workforce you know that a you
know another kind of to throw another
iron in there is it's like is this going
to be a new Industrial Revolution where
we're we're going to be strengthening
the infrastructures so that's going to
free up the people to to actually work
on in in girding up the infrastructures
that are currently a little not
necessarily unstable but but that need
to be strengthened so that we can
continue to advance at a fast pace that
was great
it's so I got I'm gonna I'm gonna bridge
carry and Michael here I hope I got a
try because I think you know Michael's
point I think is the big point and I'm
so I'm gonna end on the Omni on the high
side on the optimistic side on that that
you know what we're not talking enough
about is the potential for these new
technologies to address and make a dent
in our Grand Challenges on this earth
and so we're getting glimmerings of hope
you know we've been getting glimmerings
of hope for a long time but you know
hope with with with some good fortune
and hard work by all these innovative
entrepreneurs we can make dents in a lot
of these Grand Challenges jut not only
in our own you know country but around
the world and at the end of the day to
the extent that we make a dent and we
bring more people into
the quote-unquote modern world that we
lift up the six and a half billion that
still need to be lifted up at some level
then we have added tremendously to the
capacity and capability of this planet
now it does mean however there will be
disruptions as there was in the
industrial revolution
you know there will be people whose jobs
trance you know get trends get
transferred to someplace else and whose
jobs get eliminated so you have this
disruptive effect at the micro level of
individuals but at a macro level you
have a huge wealth creation and so that
is the ultimate grand challenge for us
as a society can we capture that value
and figure out a way to you know build
the social the social contracts that
enable us to you know maintain the
coherence of our societies around this
this disruption and unfortunately you
know we're sort of seeing it going the
wrong way right we're sort of seeing it
going toward toward nationalism and
divisiveness as opposed to globalization
in our own nationalism and collaboration
but to be optimistic you guys the
technologists the innovators will be the
ones to create to bring to create value
to create wealth to bring more people
into our society and hopefully net-net
that will result in good things dan
please contribute if you'd like so I
think what we should be what we should
be talking about what you should have
asked us is how can we all become
Central's so mine so just to show them
really nuts
so 1997 20 years ago this year I was
obviously the famous year when deep blue
beat Garry Kasparov and the thing that
Garry Kasparov realized was that the
best chess player is not human and it's
not a machine that is
actually a combination of a human and a
machine and the best chess players these
days are called send tools and their
combinations of people and chess
programs and I think the question that
we should be asking ourselves how can we
all become centaurs and augment
ourselves with artificial intelligence
in our own various ways maybe in our
private life in with whatever the next
generation or fitbit's or whatever it is
but also in our corporate life our
working life how can we become better at
what we do by using the various types of
artificial intelligence that are
available to us great answer yes please
I do think that we should talk more
about the future of work I'm obviously
an optimist and I'm building a start-up
right but I'm also a realist and I I do
recognize that more automation will lead
to decline in at least the low-skilled
jobs right so it's obvious in
manufacturing is not with the factory
every day but you do visit you know
Safeway and Target and you see the
decline in the number of issues do I
think it's a dignified job for a smart
human even if they're you know education
is only a high school level to just scan
your cereal boxes no but you can just
drop them off and leave them hanging and
I think Jessica alluded to that so I
think we do have a duty to take care of
workers that are getting displaced by
automation and every company that is
doing automation should should think
about that and then actually as society
again I don't think we should leave this
to the government either is we do think
we need to think about this concept of
universal basic income if at scale s
emphatically the number of jobs
available in every country will just
shrink by you know a huge percentage
over the next 20-30 years then that idea
should actually be studied and
and unsought through in my opinion so
many so many topics we could go on do we
have time for a question or two let's go
for it although I realize for as long as
you guys want to say although I realize
were standing in the way of you and
refreshments questions from the audience
please in the back
so what's exactly the question I'm not
asking if causal modeling can be used in
industry level implementation and she's
specifically asking about childbirth
right I'm not touching chatbots I think
it's a great question and I absolutely
see a future for causal models in an
industry in particular from those areas
where we need where correlation is not
enough and as there are there if some if
somebody calculates the radiation dose
that I received for cancer treatment I
still want to have a causal model behind
that and there's a lot of a lot of
places exactly like that and I know
there's there's a great area for
application don't say it quite so
drastic let's go for another question
right here yeah
yeah those are not the only two data
points they just represent they just
represent the endpoints in multiple data
in between and you know and and we made
reference to it before that that AI you
know it was booming in the 80s it was
the future it was you know everything
was going to happen and pretty soon we
were gonna have the fifth-generation
computer and everything would be
autonomous and it didn't quite happen
and and so a I went through this nuclear
winter and no self-respecting
entrepreneur or academic would actually
used the term a I write because AI was
discredited so natural language
processing that was okay machine
learning was kind of your backdoor a way
of talking about AI without using the
phrase AI and then it sort of it sort of
came back a little bit in the bubble but
not not that much and then you know and
then in the early 2000s with you know
cnn's and sort of this deep learning
emergence and all of a sudden we saw
some real effects so so I've seen a lot
I mean I've been continuously interested
it's been very painful uh-huh but in in
in the technologies and the evolutions
of the technologies and so I don't it's
not I don't see today as being all of a
sudden in the last year there was not
suddenly this emergence of a new
technology that was going to transform
the world it just represents sort of the
emergence and media credibility of this
evolution of technologies over 60 years
I don't know when do you consider the
birth of AI you know
touring ready Alan Turing is the birth
of AI arguably so it's it's it's been a
long ramp and not very steep ramp it
feels like today
it's extremely steep but my experience
suggests that it's not as steep as it
feels that's but tons and tons of really
exciting interesting applications for it
so well this is not my domain but but
just to challenge slightly I mean we
don't know that humans know right I mean
so I mean there's this whole field of
neuro linguistic programming that says
right you think you know you think you
have the evidence that demonstrates for
certain that it's a cause but okay I'm
somebody smarter than me needs to answer
this question
yeah I'll thrown on this because I
actually just wrote a article about this
this is a huge issue and one when I
began looking at this space was sort of
the glaring hole from so many
perspectives from an accountability
perspective from a governance
perspective from a legal perspective
from a disenfranchised perspective from
a isn't an erroneous model perspective
there is not a single answer today there
are more and more developments in this
space we've seen a couple of different
startups cropping up that are targeting
just this running algorithms on the
algorithm there are yeah there's a few
universities doing research on this it's
it remains a huge issue and what I've
found in my research is depending on who
you ask some people think this is a
non-issue some people think this is the
number one issue but from from many
stand points the ability to see into
these neural networks is important that
said I you know can we fully explain our
decisions sure if it's something simple
like an image or an octopus perhaps but
when it comes to complex decision
makings about abstract topics you know
humans are not so great at introspection
in fact it's sort of ironic that we are
demanding this of our machines based on
you know the brain anyway go for it
you've had your hand up
and then you know combine that with the
next generation of AI and I don't think
we can just leave it to the morality or
hoping that people are going to be right
and right very big questions um thank
you for that comment I think I think
we're over time please join me in
applauding the panel thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
