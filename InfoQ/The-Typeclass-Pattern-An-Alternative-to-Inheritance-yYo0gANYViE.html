Northwestern University in Chicago
although I actually live here in
Cambridge so I worked for them remotely
I've been programming in Scala full-time
since since 2008 I'll be talking today
about the about the type class pattern
and my hope is that this should be at
least reasonably accessible even if
you're relatively new to Scala so feel
free to interrupt even even with what
might seem like fairly basic questions
about code and so forth I'm gonna start
by explaining the the con some concepts
that are relevant to type classes then
I'm gonna go through an extended example
with actual code where we'll we'll be
applying type classes to a problem of
serialization and then I'll close just
talking about you know what's good about
what we just saw and some some cautions
or downsides now so this is the the
scala symposium why are we as scholar
programmers in particular why would we
be interested in type classes this is a
word that doesn't necessarily come up
when you first learn the language the
standard scala book by oder street
vendors and spoon the
word type class isn't even in the index
or or in the glossary but my my own
sense is that particularly in the last
in the last couple of years that this is
becoming a more and more common word
that comes up in discourse around scala
so this is something that you will
probably want to know about in order to
follow mailing list and Twitter and some
of the other talks today that that will
that will touch on this the like big
software engineering concerns on that
this is about that aren't particular to
Scala our polymorphous
and decoupling so I'll define different
kinds of polymorphism in a moment but to
kind of sketch it broadly we are at the
same time we're trying to build our
programs up we're adding new types of
data we're adding new operations we want
those operations to work on these new
kinds of values that we're adding so
we're kind of piling on our programs are
getting are getting bigger and more
complex so at the same time we're trying
to like tear it back down to tease it
apart and to keep our programs as being
built from small independent pieces that
can be independently understood and
independently tested and so forth so
that's that that's decoupling
the term polymorphism refers to when you
can use the same operation and have it
work on different types and there's an
there's an old distinction dating back
to the 60s between parametric and ad hoc
polymorphism parametric with parametric
polymorphism the operation works on
different types but it ignores the
difference between the types so for
example like taking the length of a list
that you want a length operation that
works regardless of whether it's a list
of int or a list of string or whatever
the difference doesn't matter
that's parametric polymorphism type
classes address the problem of ad hoc
polymorphism where you want the
operation to do something or potentially
do something different for the different
types of values that it accepts
type classes originated in the Haskell
language they were included in the the
first national standard in 1990 Haskell
as a language was the the goal was to
unify work that had been done previously
in functional programming language
design in languages like Miranda and
standard ml and kind of unify them into
a single language that the functional
programming community could kind of
unite behind so it mainly synthesized
previous stuff but it did break some new
ground and type classes in particular
have been called the principle
innovation that happened in Haskell if
you want to investigate the history more
this paper from 1989 by wobbler and blot
is is the the first the first real
write-up of it and we see them referring
to ad hoc polymorphism in the title now
type classes come to us from Haskell
Haskell as a functional programming
language is this a talk about functional
programming yes and no or actually
really more no because when we when we
talked about functional programming
we're thinking about you know that the
issues are immutability we are using
functions as values and in pure
functional programming we are coding
without side effects those are the big
issues in FP type classes don't really
touch on any of those issues not in any
major way the the issues instead as I
said are decoupling and and polymorphism
now nonetheless there is some overlap
with functional programming this is
important if you want to get more deeply
into functional programming
for example in the Scala Z library which
is the the library that people doing
pure functional programming in Scala use
um almost everything in Scala Z is a
type class ma nodes monads applicative
functors these are all these are all
defined as as type classes and scholar Z
so though i'm not really going to talk
about that but this is kind of
foundational material if if you were to
investigate that a brief note on
terminology in Haskell type classes two
words so hostel doesn't have any other
kind of class it's not an
object-oriented language so there's no
there's no confusion between on the word
class or on the word instance in the
hostel we also have instances of type
classes in Scala which is which is which
is object-oriented we already have
things called classes and instances
there's a danger of confusion a type
class is not a class so Scala people
usually write it as one word to help to
help emphasize that and in Haskell this
is a language feature in Scala it's just
a pattern it's not something that that
it's not a word that appears in the
language standard it's just a particular
combination of
Scala language features and I'll show
you which ones are going to be relevant
so when Scala we actually have a lot of
different ways of achieving polymorphism
already in the language we can overload
methods so that a method of the same
name can accept different kinds of
inputs the the the really big one in
object-oriented programming is
inheritance we get ad hoc polymorphism
by overriding the the behavior of a
method in a subclass and in Scala we
also have pattern matching where we can
we can look at a value at run time and
do something different depending
depending on the outcome of this runtime
test I arced those three with minus
signs because we're not going to use
those in the type class pattern at all
the language features for polymorphism
that we are going to use we're going to
use traits or interfaces as they're
called in Java and we are going to use
type parameters also known as generic
types so we'll see that in the code in
in a minute the example that I'm about
to start working through is about
serialization but you will see the type
class pattern in other places the two
that you're most likely to see in are in
the Scala standard library numeric is a
type class which allows you to abstract
over different numeric types to write
write code once and have it work on ants
or lawns or doubles and so on and
ordering is also is also a type class
that that lets you specify when you're
sorting data you can specify how you
want it ordered and you can you know the
same type of value can be ordered in
different ways at different times
another really really common example of
when you would use this is for typesafe
equality the Equality operator in Scala
which is mainly the same as the one in
Java with only a few tweets it has this
kind of pitfall which is that it will
let you compare values of any type and
if the if the types don't match then
then you'll just get false this is error
prone because you may write code where
you you you think you're comparing
- values of the same type but if you
screw that up the compiler isn't going
to tell you it'll it'll just always
return false at runtime so if you want
to look into it later there's a link for
a fairly small amount of code that will
give you it a typesafe equality operator
and you know as I mentioned lots of type
classes to be found in Scala Z for this
serialization example we'll need a
couple of domain classes so these are
just you know person and restaurant or
what we use they both just case classes
with a couple of fields now there are
lots of different ways to serialize data
we could serialize to JSON serialize to
XML we should do serialization the way
that the to string method does
automatically for case classes lots of
different ways for taking our data and
reducing it to some sort of stream of
characters or bytes a first naive
attempt it at a serialized method that
works on both of these types of data
would be to just use overloading but
this really doesn't help us very much
because with overloading there's no
connection between these two methods
other than the fact that they happen to
have the same name overloading it all it
does is save you from having to choose
new names all the time but other than
that these are really two completely
distinct methods I can't call this
method without knowing already which of
the the types that I'm using so
overloading is really not much help but
object orientation can help us on that
the standard i/o way we would do this is
to have is to use inheritance so that
our person in restaurant classes we
extend a superclass and then override
the override the abstract method in each
superclass so this works fine there is a
small problem here which is that we can
only have one superclass but that's easy
to fix
in Java we would use an interface and
Scala we use a trait and now we can say
it stands serializable with and we can
list other traits so that this now is
the the kind of standard object-oriented
solution to this and this is a perfectly
fine solution there's nothing I mean
this is something that you're still
often going to reach for but it does
have some disadvantages in particular we
have a coupling problem here where the
person class the the information about
how each of these classes is to be
serialized has to be actually in the
class so particularly if I have if I'm
wanting to support multiple types of
serialization or if I have lots of other
operations then my case classes which
used to be nice and simple are going to
get heavy with with all this stuff and
in order to add more traits and in order
to add more overridden methods I have to
control these classes these have to be
mine I have to be free to edit their
source code and recompile them
Scala offers an alternative approach
which is to avoid inheritance and simply
pattern match at run time on the type so
I can if I do it this way I can leave
the person in restaurant classes alone
they know nothing about how they are
they're serialized instead I have a
serialized method that knows about each
of the classes that I want to serialize
and uses pattern matching to
discriminate and then if I want to do
more than one kind of serialization I
can have more than one such method where
with its own match with its own list of
cases so we we fixed the coupling
problem that we had but we've given
ourselves a new coupling problem now
which is that these methods need to know
about all of the particular classes that
we want to be able to serialize so I
can't add new types of out new types to
this unless this is my method I control
it I can edit the source code and
recompile it yeah in in era eric has a
somewhat longer I think talk about about
type classes that I'll link to later
that presents an additional solution
which is to use reflection and that has
its own its own problems as well
so we're gonna solve both of these
coupling problems at once with this code
which is we're almost at the type class
pattern here we're still gonna refine it
a little bit I'm defining a trait called
serializable and what what an instance
of this trait represents is it
represents the knowledge of how to
serialize a particular type of value in
a particular in a particular way so the
type parameter T is the is the type of
value that we're serializing so now for
example the here's how we represent the
knowledge of how to serialize a person
in this this form which you know
resembles the what the standard two
string method does I put this in an
object that extends the trait I specify
the type parameter and I'm done I can do
the same thing with a restaurant and now
I can call this but I have to have to
supply this additional parameter to the
serialize method that that has the
knowledge of how to serialize the
particular class so the this is really
this is this is not so nice we would
prefer to have that be automatic and we
can do that by using the s' College
Scala language feature of implicit
parameters so this is the same code from
the previous slide but simply with the
word implicit added we've moved the the
serializable parameter to a separate
parameter list which is implicit and
when we declare this object that knows
how to serialize a person we declare it
also as implicit and that that says
this object is now available to be
automatically filled in whenever we have
an implicit parameter that with a
matching type and we've now our goal we
can simply call serialize on a person I
only need to fill in the first parameter
list the compiler fills in the second
parameter list for me
it runs and this is typesafe if we pass
a type of value to serialize that it
doesn't the compiler doesn't have an
available implicit for then it will
complain at compile time we can refine
the syntax a little bit if we like on
Scala provides a shorthand where if you
find yourself having to add these
implicit parameter lists to many methods
you can shorten it like this by just
putting a colon after the type and then
saying what what what type of implicit
you you you want to that you need that
you require for that type so the example
here is I have a method that will Syria
that what that knows how to serialize a
list of any serializable type that we
that we already know how to have that we
already have and and here's an example
of using that on a list of of people
here the context bound syntax is
convenient because we don't actually
need to use this value explicitly in the
body of this function so serialized here
there's a invisible second parameter
list the compiler is filling a is
filling that in for us with this this
unnamed
value all of that that code just sort of
drops out another optional syntactic
refinement that we can get if we want it
is if we would prefer to write
serialized as a method call on the
object rather than as a function that
takes the object as input we can do that
using an implicit conversion this is the
standard this is the standard pattern
for adding so-called extension methods
to to Scala classes so I won't go over
that in detail but you you you you have
this option of making this syntax
available to whoever's using your code
so that's the serialization example and
to recap we have type safety this is
checked at compile time we have two
kinds of extensibility we can add new
types of data that are serializable we
can add new new kinds of serialization
like json or xml and it's extensible in
both of those directions in in a
decoupled way where when we add when we
sort of you can imagine a matrix of like
possible types of input possible types
of serialization every time we want to
like fill in a box and that matrix all
we need is a to add a new independent
piece of code rather than altering
existing code oh yeah so the the the the
question is what if I were wanted to
serialize to something other than string
I did hard code string in this example
but you could imagine making that an
additional type parameter to handle to
do bytes instead or whatever yeah you
could you can imagine even more
dimension so if
of variability for this with what I've
shown we this is even a little more
flexible than what you have in Haskell
because although normally it's
convenient to have to have these
implicit parameters filled in
automatically by the compiler you can
also fill them in manually in case you
need to override the default for example
and this is using ordering the ordering
type class from the standard library I
might in the same piece of code want to
sometimes sort person objects by their
name and sometimes by their age if I
have implicit sin scope for both of
those kinds of sorting then if I try to
sort something the compiler which help
will tell me it's ambiguous but I always
have the option of filling in that
implicit parameter list explicitly so
these two kinds of ordering don't you
know don't need to step on each other's
toes the the big difference the really
big difference between this and
inheritance that you need to understand
the other the other solutions I
presented using either inheritance or
pattern matching in both of those
solutions the the the decision of what
code to run to do this serialization is
happening at runtime this is not true in
the in the case of type classes this
will only work if the compiler has the
knowledge at compile time to know which
implicit to fill in so that means that
there are lots of this is not a drop-in
replacement for inheritance because
there are lots of kinds of code that you
might that you would expect to work with
an inheritance that won't work this way
for example if I have a heterogeneous
list containing more than one type of
value like a person and a restaurant in
the same list if I try to serialize that
list the compiler is going to come
plain because the the specific type
information for the specific values in
that list are lost when we when we stuff
them into a list I don't have time to
get into detail about the various
interactions with inheritance but I do
have links to a couple Stack Overflow
questions that have good answers about
what happens when both type classes and
inheritance are in the same picture some
so that that's the the big like - or
difference if you prefer from
inheritance some some more minor
downsides the syntax is you know there's
a certain amount of boilerplate here and
when you see this boilerplate it doesn't
necessarily jump out at you that that
though this is the type class pattern I
mean I see implicit here implicit there
like what is this anytime you're using
implicit for anything there's a danger
of obscure error messages it's it's
harder to call higher-order functions
there is a kind of tax for for using
implicit sub any kind tools like Scala
doc and I des are kind of expecting
normal methods they're not expecting
methods that are coming from type
classes so it can be harder to learn an
API that uses this and there may be some
performance overhead I'm adding extra
layers of method calls the resolution of
the type dices does take place at
compile time so you don't you don't pay
for that but there may be some there may
be some performance penalty Eric on time
has been studying that in the context of
the numeric type class so the that's if
you are interested in numbers on that
you should look at his forthcoming Scala
days paper on the subject there are some
proposals out there for helping you
either with the performance or with the
syntax or with both
the implicit classes and valued classes
proposals would both cut down on the the
penalty of extra extra objects being
created and Josh also has another
proposal which is like not which is less
on the fast track
you have to like write him to ask for it
but he has a proposal for making for
reducing the amount of syntactic noise
that using this pattern requires so if
you'd like to read more there's a very
short treatment of type classes in
Josh's book with a different example
different from any of the ones that I
mentioned Eric slides mostly go over the
same material that I covered but it's
just it's like a totally different
presentation so it might be interesting
to get a different take on it and that's
all I got
