how would you make this one be better
what's the what with what could we do as
in addition to to what we've done so far
um we could we could make this crawl
right so the way to make this scroll is
to wrap your large piece of text in a
scrollview okay so i usually do this
from xml because it's easier they're
basically there's something called the
scroll view control space yeah i've been
using control test for a while so and
whenever whenever you in text which can
just do control space and it gives you
you can start typing in there right and
then for example the two properties that
we always must have are the width and
height so you can copy paste with in
high life for example from here right
and then the key is to surround the text
view with the scroll view and then
reformat everything daniel they should
look like that right so the wastrel view
works you can put only one thing inside
those 12 you you can put multiple things
you can instantly its complex you would
put it into a lay autumn and put that
one layout into the Thames also love you
yeah you can so you know it does go your
nest and and scroll you basically gives
you scroll ability right so if you look
at it now
so many of family I can now scroll and I
can see all the day them it's very cool
huh you can now charge some money for
this right seventy-nine cents okay so so
we basically have the so we've got it
one better so this actually kind of I
mean works you know more or less it's
little jerky and all that but but that's
a different story well so I'm any
questions in this so far in this version
so what's the problem with this version
what it doesn't update what so it
doesn't update the data is data changes
in the database right okay that's one
problem what else
anything else I mean to let me introduce
you to adapters let's say you're
building a system like this let's say
it's a gmail for instance right so you
have a data source some place where you
got your data it's in the cloud probably
presumably it could be a local database
and let's say you are like me and you
have probably 10 maybe 10,000 unanswered
emails right now you want to show them
on the screen and you have a screen of
123 let's say 10 items okay so what you
want to do is you're gonna glue a data
set of 10,000 items to a tiny little
screen of 10 items so what our algorithm
right now does is it goes it fetches all
10,000 items then dumps them into the
screen right when you scroll view all
10,000 items and shows the user the top
point one percent or whatever that is
right right so user has to wait for
10,000 items to get downloaded over slow
connection just to see that point one
percent right not very efficient at all
you agree right it's a pretty common
problem i mean like giving you to our
little twitter maybe does it have twenty
to ten thousand items but it you know
very quickly it's gonna be in thousands
you know if even if you have just
hundred friends you're following or
something really quickly it's gonna
depend too pretty for it's gonna explode
right so the solution to that is to use
something called adapters adapters
basically manage this communication back
and forth between the the this data
source and the view right got it
so what you're going to do is we're
going to rewrite our example using
adapters so first list to you and text
you are going to be gone you can comment
this out or delete it maybe I'll comment
it out for now just so that you can
compare the notes later on but you can
safely delete it okay what we're going
to introduce is going to be a list view
okay and this list view is going to have
just couple properties it's going to
have an ID made if it's easier for you
well it's probably easier to get like
this android ID because we care about it
programmatically so i'm going to put
some atlas ID / list
and it's going to have those properties
those two properties that we always
universal in must happen so that's that
oh yeah thanks
right so we now have a list a list you
guys know what the list widget looks
like right you see it all the time it's
like that thing that you see if like for
example in settings and so if you go
into system settings well this is a list
right
cool so now that you get this list again
just list view and copy paste ID wait an
ice cream somewhere now our timeline
activity no longer has text view text
out we absolutely that but instead we
have a listview call it lists okay also
we no longer search for text out we
search for lists and this becomes list
view and this becomes dot ID means going
to be a list so far what we've done is
we can simply ripped out scrollview
textview replaced it with list view
right in subsequently in time and
activity we found at list view now this
this algorithm of go through all the
data in appended to text view is now
obsolete so I'm gonna you can delete it
I'm going to comment the dog just to
compare notes later on but that will
eventually delete it so there's no
reason to keep it around action
okay now that we have the list and the
cursor so we have the list we have the
cursor what we need as the glue is this
thing called adapter okay adapters there
are many adapters but basically they
fall into two buckets one bucket is the
ones that attach to the array based data
and the other one is a bucket attached
to cursor based data right arrays are
more like predictable sighs and cursors
or not right so so what we're going to
do here is we're going to create we're
going to use an adapter called a simple
cursor adapter you know look as the name
says it's pretty simple so I'm going to
define the simple cursor adapter adapter
organize imports
ok now we're going to create it so we're
going to say adapter it's going to be
new simple cursor adapter now if you
don't remember what all the parameters
are you can put the mouse on it and let
the clips add the arguments ok and then
if you don't know what the arguments are
you can put the mouse over it and it
tells you that the the first argument is
the context the second one is the layout
cursor from into ok so context is going
to be what sure layout well lay out and
let is going to correspond to in this
let me explain the solid so remember the
data that we're getting is in a form of
a raw data right it's got its ID we may
have a little bit of a this is created
at user and text right so it could be ID
created at user and text rate now what
adapter needs to know is what does this
guy look like let's let's pick one one
here what does this guy look like how
many fields does this guy have right you
know initially could just have one or we
could do we could use two fields right
so in that case which one do we want to
map where so for example if you use the
one with a two so we could have this guy
map to a field up here right and then
have this guy map to a field like right
here or something like that make sense
so the layout corresponds to this layout
of this particular one item one single
row that's what the layout is the nexus
so eventually we can create our own but
remember system ships with a bunch of
stuff remember there are like Android
resources which ship with Android so
let's try to use one of those so Android
dot are just makes it match we haven't
done this before dot layout and then
let's see what we've got
see there's something called to line
list item on what it looks like but we
can try it right make sense
yes we can ultimately usually get to see
the way oh yeah ultimately will create
our own layout mm-hmm now we're almost
there we now need to provide the miata
cursor that's easy now this was the
front and this was the two and if you
remember the front was a string array in
the two was an interim well those two
things define is the mapping from string
being the database table column names to
in being the IDS of the widgets right so
basically what we are doing here is
we're mapping if this is a database then
each column is going to have its own
name like user and if this was a widget
here right this one is going to have its
ID such as you know r dot ID dot txt one
or user text or some like that right so
that's the mapping we need to define the
binding so we can define those as
constants I could actually do something
like this static static final string
array from going to be a string array
and I can say static final int array two
I'll be in in today
you know for from if you just stick to
the basics who said what right so the
column names we have defined in status
data so status data dot user in status
data dot txt
now the question is what are the IDS of
those two lines that we have in that way
out I think they are called text one in
text to him that's usually how it is
it's usually sound like this android r
dot ID dot and then i'm looking for
something called texts on texts
I'm like that something like that yeah
if you are unsure we can easily open up
that file so if you remember our file is
in tools as they came this will be my
lair this will be my research looking
for a layout and we're using the two
line list items i'm looking for two line
list item this is the tech center and
yes ID is text one and text to make
sense
so remember we said those XML files that
the Android our resources are under
platform regularly using flattened data
and then resources and then I went into
into layout and fun with cool run that
let's see oh there's actually nothing to
run yet there's something missing that's
right so we need to tell the list to use
this adapter so we basically need to say
list dot set adapter adapter
bind view done yeah we're going to be
using vine you later on so if I go my
menu timeline crashes
926 small point exception
I think my my column is now my cursor is
now oh that's right I forgot the thanks
from and to yeah i forgot to define him
but forget Blackman
so many of them online woohoo it's
better right to ignore my colors you
know this is not that bad so we have
basically column for each thing but it's
also intelligently you know it so the
data is being pulled as data is needed
not all at once mm-hmm so if I have ten
thousand records yeah so if you have ten
thousand records here but you have only
one two three seven fields it may full
pull ten fields down you know just so it
has it for like the next one is the user
kind of keeps scrolling but then as the
user keeps crawling it's automatically
going to paginate go and fetch more and
it's actually in the process of doing
that it's going to reuse the UI
components so it's going to use these
components into whatever they were you
know before so it's not going to be
creating a lot of empty java objects
what are you throttle reportedly to sort
the seat is getting the data under that
same summer because this is let's say
you've got intent on the record right
sometimes you don't want such good value
is awesome how do you start of that room
so well this guy doesn't it just got so
for this guy it just got the data source
in a form of our comfort go right this
is just adapting to whatever the girls
from right yeah at the close of the well
I mean we're getting the cursor from
status data so which however this works
you know you can throttle it I mean this
is a limit basically yeah you could yeah
you can do that you can just settle on a
tear yeah and the data doesn't have to
come from a database it could come from
a cloud so you can influence whichever
logic you want for getting the data
right the point is we're waiting we
would you sell today each of these
people music aah you can mean the nature
of each of these predefined so yeah well
you could amis Matt Matt as a matter of
fact you could probably just edit in
here as well limit limit by but you can
also do it in the you can also do it in
selection selection arcs so all these
just basically get built into a sequel
segment so you could introduce limit
yeah so yeah so you could do it you
could do it and then in order by
you know you could do that
now you can just you if I just say limit
5 yeah yeah yeah just one second let me
just run this test and then I'll come
help you and then yeah yes yes yes sorry
yeah you see this worked yeah well
alright so what we did so far is we just
use the layout that we got from system
right this layout we just got from your
system you know bald piece of text here
and and the rest of the text here but
there's oniy I mean system only provides
a simple line item in two line items
right but if you want to keep tree line
items like we want to put a date in
there as well I think we're going to
have to create our own layout so so
let's create our own layout that's going
to represent a row right so now what
you're creating is a layer before you
create the layout for this entire thing
right right now you're creating a layout
that only corresponds to a single row
okay and you're gonna have a piece of
text here maybe a piece of text here
which is going to be a date and then
you're gonna have maybe the entire text
here sounds good yeah yeah there are
different layouts not so different
layouts here there's the linear layout
which we were using quite a bit right
there is something called relative
layout where children are relative to
each other this one is a more efficient
because it doesn't require use of
nesting layouts night within layout so
there's also something call
tavola extreme framelayout family that
is kind of like a deck of cards things
just go on top of each other its use for
like tabs and things like that all right
let's try i mean let's let's give it a
shot so if you could close all this
stuff so if we create a new layout i'll
call it throw dot XML and show you want
to try with the relative layout
and you may have three pieces of text
right like maybe a large piece of text
maybe a medium piece of text and maybe a
small piece of text something like that
if i look at the xml very nice actually
this and this is like this make this new
new UI this new UI editor makes
designing your linear layout you're a
relative layout super simple just maybe
like way too simple right so just drag
them whichever way you want done
so this is going to be our Rho dot XML
how do you change it you can rip out the
other one or just context and like go
here and say I don't like Ralph I just
changing corrected yeah ultimately just
text yeah but that's this basically what
we've got right so far and as you can
see a relative layout basically
positions things relative to each other
so basically for the first piece of text
it said you know a line parent left
aligned parent top and that's what makes
it top glued to the top left corner the
other one is a line parent top and align
parent right that's what makes it go to
the right corner right and then the
third one it says align parrot left
through a long time right through the
textbook gives it the entire width right
and through an layout below and it says
it's below layout one so that's kind of
how we're relatively positioned it
compared to the other got it
so on now does the text in this case
matter the default text it doesn't you
could safely remove it but if you did it
be extremely hard for you to visualize
what this looks like so thi usually do
in this case since text doesn't matter
actually make it look like something
that I like you know actually I can't do
it from here huh I gotta do it like this
so i may say for the first one you know
i may say the text is you know an actual
tweet maybe slash dot right it may be a
text medium text is something like 10
minutes ago right and maybe the small
text is an actual let me pull a tweet
from slashdot let's get something real
right slash dot am so let's see what /
dad says
anything with a android nothing we have
to try and read and i'll just pick
something ok Google engineers built
ultimate land party class cool so I'm
going to pull a person like that and and
put it into my again just as a matter
just piece of text damn so now I can
kind of visualize what that would
actually look like on the real thing
make sense
so what so the text doesn't matter on
this layout what does matter what
property doing care about suicide idea
because we're going to need to
programmatically bind the values to this
right because we're going to
programmatically change this it's not
going to be of course heartfully to
slashdot right so i'm going to edit ID
and I'm gonna call the first one text
underscore user well we'll just gotten
there I did oops edit ID text underscore
created I'm score at and then this I'll
say text underscore thanks
well
so I signed my IDs to these three
widgets that I have in my relative
layout
yeah can you generate layouts are good
organic quickly of course everything
remember that everything that we do like
it's just basically the matter of
inflating the XML right so we inflate
the XML here and then we can do
programmatically what you want we don't
even have to do any XML at all you could
do everything from scratch right so XML
is just there to kind of like get get it
going make it easier like take care of
some basics that are static that don't
change but yeah of course you could
build the entire UI like you're doing
Java with a WT or swing now cool so now
that we have this one I'm gonna open up
my oh I should've left it open I'm gonna
open up my timeline activity right so my
front might tune our changes it's not
it's not going to be text1.text to right
but it's going to be r dot ID dot txt
user gamma r dot ID dot txt txt gamma r
dot ID dot txt created that right so my
tools are now mapping to my guy with
those three things right
and so and now we're getting status data
status text and we are also getting
status data dot clearly that because we
need three Nino needs to be matching so
basically this guy is going to go into
this guy this guy is going to go into
this guy and then this guy is going to
go into this guy right Romilly right
it's nothing they need to be aligned
cool so now that you have that the only
thing that's missing is changing which
layout manager we lay out we're using so
supposed to our layout la to line list
item which will no longer make sense
we're going to use our dot layout dot
Rho
many Italian voila almost faith almost
there
and will you got it so far so what's the
problem so let's just review what we
just did here right so basically what we
did is we before we got a cursor and
then we went through that cursor line by
line to get the data rate to and get
each line item in print it out this is
that dumb you know start at the
beginning go to the end wherever the end
is a loop right so that's what we
obsolete it with more of an intelligent
list plus adapter so I'm going to remove
that obsoleted code right and other than
that we in row we define the row we
talked about that and what else did we
have those obsoleted in timeline before
we have the scroll view plus text view
it was basically a gigantic piece of
text on a scroller right we now replace
that with just a list here it's a minute
more simpler yeah so far so good so um
so that's that is that so what we are
going to do next is fix this problem
what's the problem with this now date is
implemented as the number of seconds
since night in Miami it's a number of
milliseconds since January first
nineteen seventy in london england right
so i mean most humans don't have
capability of reading these numbers
right I'm sure there's there you know
there's a whole gig subculture where
this is the you know how is pressed time
but was there doesn't mean much right
it'd be much nicer to say like 10
minutes ago half an hour ago 24 hours
ago right on that calculation
calculating that is easy like doing the
conversion from from that number to a
relative time that
for that I'll just give you there's a
helper function they just give it this
number and gives you the relative time
that's right so that's pretty
straightforward what is not
straightforward obvious is what we
injected logic so if you remember our
design that if you remember our diagram
here right we catch something like this
right and we had four items 1 2 3 4 and
then we had a piece of you know a piece
of text here row right and we have one
item here we have one item here and then
we had one item below right and then we
said take this item and go in here take
this item and go in here and we said
take but so you know this was going in
there and this one's going writing like
that yeah that's fine if you just go
straight straight forward straight from
one to the other but the question now
was 44 if we have that again for
specifically the created at which was
this item here and it needed to go here
we can't just go straight inject it yeah
we need it we need to somehow put some
kind of business logic here to modify
I'd like I said that mrs. gallaccio it's
going to be a one-liner you call
somewhere and gives you a relative time
that's not a big deal the question is
more how do we put it into this place
how would you do it any wild ideas
create our own field computer
differences put in adaptor we could do
something like that I mean me being a
Java guy what I would typically do is
that with the outgoing I would rip apart
my time and this simple cursor adapter
and create a single time line adapter
right and just figure out which method
actually does that binding right and
then change it in then implement my own
well that's what they do in the book
first and then I realized oh there's
actually a much easier way much better
way somebody actually thought of this
there's something called a view binder
and a view binder is basically designed
to do exactly this provide the binding
between these two things so we only need
to do is create a view binder then
assign it to the onto the adapter more
elegant this way so that's what we're
going to do is we're going to create a
view binder it's actually going to be a
final static static final your binder
view
organiz import when you organize imports
make sure you get the right import
because it may be confusing so we're
getting one from simple cursor adapter
and then add unimplemented values a dime
criminal methods so we are creating a
constant called a view binder okay and
this view binder is basically going to
be responsible for binding values from
the database to the view with us having
the option to inject the business logic
so far so good
let's get this so a couple arguments
that don't make sense like arg0 should
really be a view everyone should really
be a cursor and r2 should I be only legs
so basically what we want to do is we
want to first of all figure out if what
we're getting is what we care about
right so the view is going to be so
what's going to happen is this your
binder is going to get caught for every
single column that we need to bind to w
right um now you can return one of the
following two values true or false right
so let me show you so basically Mon
truth the data was bound to the view
false otherwise so in other words if we
are going to bind the data we're going
to return true otherwise we're going to
return false so what we can do here is
we can first check are we being called
for the column that we care about or the
comp we care about is the column where
the it's the created that column so we
could do two things we can check it the
view for that column is the view that
you care about or we can check out the
column index is the column in exit we
care about it's up to you right so we
could do something like this if you know
if not or let me do this if u dot get ID
the idea of the view is equal is not
equal to r dot ID so i thought ID dot
created ah
the view that we're looking at is not
the same as we care then we're going to
return false that basically says look do
whatever you were going to do anyway
don't bothers else we're gonna do
something else ok let me neither else I
can just say good time and then we get
to handle it somehow com index
corresponds to the index of that
particular item in this cursor so in our
case the index would be the index you
know each of these items in the cursor
itself so status data text indexing song
yeah yeah yeahs an alternative way to do
this would be to say if curse so if
purser dog to get call get column index
for call name of status data dot column
beta naught equal to fall index
alright
so I mean one of these should actually
happen we the same check so first one
checks that the view is not equal to pay
that the other one checks that the
column index is not the same as the
cursus colony this is not the same as
the curtain politics regarding they want
to
so it's good
what next now that we know that we have
a data to care about we can actually get
that data right so could say long time
is going to be or so but yet long first
good poem index
it's com index for status data.com pet
now that we have the time we cannot
convert that time right so I could have
strength relative time is going to be
and then this word the utility comes
from I think it's called date a date
date you tails and then get a relative
time span so context and then from you
know seconds
I spend sense oh yeah we'd only
important yeah and then this time Erica
okay i'm going to relative time to
charge sequence that's fine so it's not
stringing such as signals
so far so good
so what is the next thing that we do we
got the time so we got the original time
from the database this is our you know
milliseconds we converted a time into
relative time we got now a good time
what do we do with it set the view the
view is now going to be our that this is
really if we're being called for the
text created that then we know that this
is really a text view right right so i
can say text view view right i can cast
it right and i can say set text to Vera
lot of time oh my god
so the only thing that's left is to
attach this adapt this view now to
adapter so adapter dot set peridot set
new binder view binder oops and as you
get nothing you can test it and see if
it works
menu timeline two hours ago two hours
ago two hours to go to three hours ago
then go back menu refresh menu timeline
two minutes ago three minutes ago four
minutes ago 15 minutes ago and so night
much better right so let's do is a very
common component right and as such there
are certain things that system actually
gives us for free so let's do the
following let's convert our activity to
a list activity right so right now what
we have is we have an activity that has
a list view another way to do this is to
be of the list here so they're basically
you can make this a list activity yeah
so we're going to basically convert this
to be a list activity as opposed to be a
at the activity whether list here right
so let's activity is not gonna have
let's see source methods aren't any to
control shift our first to import it
okay so let's take the written them so I
list activity you don't need to import
the time the list rate and or you can if
you want but then the list itself isn't
it it's going to be it's better if you
define it as opposed to our ideal list
if you define it as Android dot r dot ID
dot list that's going to find its
internal list or you can also do a get
is to get this view get list here you
can also say get list view simpler
right so as a matter of fact we can now
get rid of the time in the timeline set
content view all together and we can
actually say we can basically not not
use it at all and since i only need
lists here and list here i can actually
simplify this a little bit but they're
moving your list removing the list and
just basically referring to others makes
my code little fighter we formatted it
organizing ports so if i run this I'm
not gonna have I'm not gonna have the
title go menu timeline I'm not going to
have a title it's gonna look like this
right but there's some neat things that
you can hmm there's some neat things
that you can do with the list right so
so basically i simplified it you can set
text assume it let me show you the
documentation or like quickly like again
this is just an alternative away
ListView so let's not leave at least
activity so let's activity is a special
activity that's that includes list right
so you can do you can set text if you
want right and that's the text that's
already its list and empty you can
actually specify what happens in the
case of empty and let me see so that's
pretty much what we do only confirm at
it so you can set select so you can set
position set list adapter right so
that's what we do as a matter of fact if
this can even be simpler like this that
list adapter they do the same thing as
opposed to get list view you know you
can do it like this to set list adapter
um but you can also set
I'm pretty sure you can set on empty and
stuff you can tell it what to do when
it's empty and you can set title there
are certain things that you can do you
see title uh-huh these are the methods
that are inherited you can set title
Seth Tuttle color right and so on so for
example if I wanted to configure some
certain things I could say I could say
set title right and I can actually point
to r dot string dot timeline the title I
just ranked just we did ask for that
like to be replaced by the way so
hopefully hopefully sometime this week
yeah see now it says timeline there
others the list activity now our layout
well we're still seeing what to use for
our row layout but the list just
basically takes the entire space yeah
that's correct so we somewhat simplified
so we remove this file altogether right
so I'm gonna literally delete it all
right so I have a little less control
but they have a little more standardized
insane streamlined to you i right so you
notice that a lot of system apps
actually work this way right they don't
go crazy with like wrappers around the
list the whole thing is a list right
usually yeah you can set the title i set
a title to timeline i could just let it
be the EDF name so i could say it's the
dot app name right and then it's just
gonna say yamba on but yeah that's my
list
um how would they form at the title I
don't think you can format the title I
don't think you can can you you can get
but then but you get what do you get
when you say when you get get title you
get a charge sequence you get just text
or you can okay so let me see the then
saying the documentation then this is
what the title looks like so true so the
title would be somewhere but I can set
this is the ID empty so if you want to
set the empty message you can do this
this is a nice little feature of the
list I can for example set in case it's
empty I can set this I can say is it
okay I can text you it's gonna be a
simple way but this will work fine view
by ID android dot r dot ID dot empty
right so i could actually set this guy
to something set text and i can say
empty online so for example if i go and
blow up my database right so delete star
from status of the elite from so the
lead from status that was a good
database right dump see there's nothing
there now so if I relaunch my app
minium timeline oops look at lock at
their died unable to start now pointer
exception first line of our code there
are nothing monster keep on going yon
bon create line 28 now pointer what
could possibly be now here well we don't
have this right that must be now find
you by the Vice time of your piety i
guess i guess i would have to always get
to provide for that one i'm sorry
there's no such thing it's not it's not
an empty view but it's sent ascending
the empty value so optionally you can
custom you can eat your custom you can
contain another view object of any type
to display when the list is empty this
until is notifier must give an idea hon
ok so yeah so my eye i would have to
have a custom viewing of this right so I
could still we could still have time
line it was still a cap timeline dot XML
if you wanted to with the last activity
but you know talk to you I'm just gonna
take it out and then you can that Dutch
point or show the message of empty right
ah you would yeah yeah so yeah so in our
timeline like think I can on I don't
think I can undelete that probably not
but yeah you can you can have that
timeline view contain a view it doesn't
have to be a piece of text it could be
anything else um okay so did you get
this is just a nice little k by the way
you should know about list activity as
well as a special
kind of activity now how would you make
lyst activity beat the entry point after
all that's probably what we would like
to be the entry point into our
application all right so that manifest
file
so all that stuff that we had on the
string activity like for example the
filter oops the intent filter that's the
meeting me know on you would move that
to Timeline activity
right
and if you want I mean orientation and
stuff that's not important level you
could but then you would have to have
the xml file the timeline but this I
just wanted to kind of like hey you know
if you want to just do a straight
streamlined you I that just gives you a
less because it's such a common thing
right like if you look at even the
system you know if you look at the Scout
system applications work settings well I
guess settings actually now has that
custom thing up there right so actually
it doesn't this is the theme this is the
way this is a theme for settings this is
using the hollow team so check this out
if I now launched our app like this
change the theme this is the since
android 14 or even if I changed in a
manifest file the minimum to be Android
14 but the team got all dot light
well
you see what is my you can Tanguts my
period but I what if I down on the light
yeah which it's not you know I think it
may have to do with a minimum SDK
because it wasn't available until 13
know until 11 until so let's try now
actually may not even need this because
I think it's a default
right
so now it's just ice cream sandwich so
that was a default team so if you put
this to be minimum SDK I think even 11
that's the default theme is too hard the
hour that bluish kind of theme and you
guys know where this icon comes from
right yeah that that python is that icon
that we put in the in the application
yeah I see launcher so it's this icon
here right so if you have a better
looking one like I think I think I have
a
mom
bathroom so if i take this and pop it
into my age right and then I presumably
I would get the other ones coffee age
and
mostly a cobbler yeah probably low into
a medium is the medium right here copy
so then I now have two icons so now I
can just change this to I think I phone
look for a nicer now the the other
problems we have are the buttons way
many of them now I've got no data no
buttons there I get that looking good
right but I got no data and I got my
buttons yeah yeah well we could now make
this be our main main entry point and
just get this guy have the buttons so
what I can do is it can go to Stannis
activity simply yank the last two
methods the menu stuff cut it right and
put it into into timeline activity drop
it somewhere at the bottom
yeah so another way is to create a basic
tivity but the problem is that now I
could do that if i didn't get the last
activity but if you have a base activity
then right and i have one activity one
preference activity and one list
activity so what's with the base
activity be a base off the problem you
could would you implement an interface
what's that yes I see this is not the
menu that looks like the ice cream
sandwich menu if I click on refresh
that's going to gather data and all that
yeah the problem now is that there's
another problem here is that we do oh
this editor refresh but nothing happens
right why doesn't this get to be painted
yeah if I reorient that's correct if I
do f 11 there desu it works did I feel
oven again it works actually it's going
to cool huh Oh another minor thing that
you can do wouldn't be nice if these
were links that's super simple in our
row you can go to this guy and you can
say oh no it isn't here but basically
you say so that's that text the bottom
one right you can say android auto auto
link all
so I and II that line to my text text
and there it is now we're looking at
like you know maybe not 99 cents but
we're getting close right for everything
yeah you can choose you can you don't
have to do all you can do email web
address phone etc there's a call list
yeah yeah exactly
got it
well so you have your ice cream sandwich
yamba well not quite but it's getting
there so let's uh let's do the social
break</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
