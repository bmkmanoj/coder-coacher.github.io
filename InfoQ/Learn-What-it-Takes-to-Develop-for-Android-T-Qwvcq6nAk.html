student at UC Davis I do work on our
related issues for embedded systems and
in particular mobile systems I'm
embedded software engineer worked for
Motorola and BMW in the automotive
industry and summer I was working for
broadcom on Android platforms and I'm
also i also have my own consulting
company so I do training book reviewing
speaking that sort of thing so I've been
doing Android for basically since the
beginning since you know I'm PhD student
I have the time for that so I like to
think I have a pretty good handle on you
know the different layers of the
platform so hopefully I can answer all
your questions so briefly i'm going to
talk a little bit about how android is
different from the other platforms one
of the biggest differences in my opinion
is the great documentation for
developers so let me just give you an
example here when you're a developer the
api reference is definitely your best
friend so if you go to i'm reading this
one off of my computer right now but if
you go to developer.android.com they
have a javadoc style reference to all
the different packages and the whole api
here so it's really easy to go around
and find find information on what you
need straight from the API so let's say
we're looking for a bluetooth for
example see if we can find out here
right there android up bluetooth so you
click here they give you a link to the
bluetooth developer guide and basically
you're off to the races and if that's
that's the simple documentation there's
also quite a bit of sample code
available
that you can you can play around with
some tutorials there's quite a few
articles a lot of these come from blog
postings that the Android developers
have put up on their website so that you
can follow along with them and they'll
give you advice on best practices that
sort of thing there's also tutorials
that would be a great place to start if
you're a brand new developer I
especially recommend the first to hear
hello world and hello views and they
also tell you how to get in touch with
other developers on IRC on Twitter and
if you have technical questions so
everybody would like to have somebody
next to them that can answer all their
questions right stackoverflow is
probably the closest thing we have to
that unknown on the internet and the
Android developers actually go on there
and we'll answer your questions many
times so or sometimes I will if you're
really if you're lucky so definitely go
to stack overflow sack overflow post
your questions and very often people
will reply to you and you don't get
snarky comments or anything like that
I've had a very good experience with it
so that that is the documentation for
for me personally I think that's the
greatest advantage of program for
android there's also background tasks
that was probably one of the most
interesting features when it originally
came out lately Apple's been making it
more popular two or more available
rather to get background tasks running
on iPhones as well there's the android
market where you can just submit your
application and it's immediately up on
the market you don't have to wait for
any review process you do have to follow
the market guidelines so google takes
the approach of they trust that you've
read them and that you're following them
until you don't and then no pull your
app down very quickly and if you're
lucky they'll tell you why but at least
it's up there right away so you know
most people don't have a problem with
that so your time to market is going to
be much faster but with that said
there's a lot of absolute questionable
quality on the market so as an app
developer you're going to have to keep
that in mind so that you can get usage
to come browse for your app because
you're going to be competing with apps
that might sound like they have a sim
our purpose but in reality they have a
lot less content than you do so
definitely something to keep in mind and
what I have up here right now is the
website where you can publish your app
so i just want to show you briefly what
what the web page looks like so you know
it's just like the iphone system which
is the only other one I'm familiar with
you you know you put up your promotional
graphics but of your screenshots give
them a license title etc copy protection
and then you have to agree to their
guidelines and your publish it and
before you know it it's up on the market
there's also other other markets
available amazon just came out with one
that seems like it's getting some pretty
good traction and there's a few other
smaller ones out there but it was ons
probably the biggest one that I'm aware
of so you can always look at other
options to publish your applications and
you can actually go straight to the
consumer you can put the APK file on
your website or whatever and just let
somebody download it you don't actually
need to go to a market unlike the other
platforms that can come in really handy
actually but you do still have to sign
it so that the the consumer knows where
this app actually came from and the
other big difference is that there's
extreme platform heterogeneity in
android with what i mean by that
experimentation basically so there's
lots of different types of devices big
ones small ones keyboards cameras dual
cameras some have the new NFC readers so
when you're developing an application if
you want to develop a good application
you either need to make limitations on
what your app can do and what hardware
needs to support it or you need to keep
in mind all the different variations
that are available so for example a good
application like say a Twitter for
example should be able to run reasonably
well on a very small cheap phone that's
being sold in the third world or on you
know the latest and greatest dual-core
processor that's coming out from
Motorola
for example so there's quite a diversity
in terms of what what different hardware
is available so now I just want to talk
briefly about the Android stack and give
you an idea of how the platform is built
up just so you can get an idea of what
you're interacting with so my favorite
part personally is the bottom of the
Linux kernel but I won't bore you with
those details it's basically the Linux
kernel with some extra patches built on
top of it and then they have a bunch of
libraries most of them are open source C
C++ libraries those are the ones in
green and you can actually go and get
the source for those if you want another
big component is androids virtual java
virtual machine it's not a true java
virtual machine because it doesn't
actually run java bytecode actually runs
something called dalvik bytecode but but
the way that android set up the
toolchain you develop your app and java
it's compiled to java code and then it
gets sent to the dalvik virtual machine
and actually run so from your
perspective it really doesn't matter but
what that means is not every single java
library out there it's going to be able
to work correctly on this virtual
machine but I'm not if I'm not aware of
any big ones that aren't supportive and
then the blue section second to the top
is the application framework as an
application developer this is we're
going to spend most your time android
has one pattern that i think is most
pervasive which is the manager pattern
and what happens is if you want to talk
to any sort of shared resource you
usually end up talking through us
something manager so for example if you
want the location of the device a good
location manager if you want to send a
note notification to the user you go to
the notification manager if you want to
bring up the phone the phone dialogue
you go to the telephony manager and so
on and so forth so if you're trying to
figure out how to do something on the
platform a lot of times you'll be asking
yourself which manager do I need to talk
to you and depending on the service you
might have to get permissions as well
the the security model for android on
the a player is
basically they give you I personally
think they could do a better job on this
but that's the way it is is when you
install an app it gives you a big list
of what permissions the application is
asking for and then you agree to all of
them and the application can do it all
the time which is a little different
than the other platforms which might ask
you more than once okay another big
difference with Android is what's called
the activity lifecycle so for those of
you coming from desktop platforms or
maybe from the web this is quite
different and the reason that there's an
activity lifecycle is because power and
network connectivity that sort of thing
is is very scarce on a mobile platform
so an Android application has a few
different states that it can be in so
the I like to pair them into threes
because I think they make sense because
all three pairs are coming in and out of
a certain state so the effects to on
create and on destroy that is basically
when you create the application at the
very beginning and when you destroy it
and remove it from memory so you see how
those to kind of go together then
there's on stop and on cert that is when
the application is actually shown and
then not shown to the user and then
there's on resume on pause which toggle
based on whether the app the activity is
hidden meaning it's behind another
activity or if it's fully visible so the
activity lifecycle i think is really
confusing for new developers but if you
think about it in in those three pair of
two methods i personally think that's
the easiest way to to deal with it okay
so for those of you that are just
getting into this game i and you want to
get some hardware i highly recommend
that you get one of the android
developer devices the last three are
shown here with the Nexus Nexus S on the
right being the newest and the Google I
on being the one on the left is the
oldest and the reason I recommend
getting one of these three phones is
because this is what the Android
engineers used to test all the code so
if you want one reference platform where
or you know your application works on or
if you're only going to test in one
phone this is probably the best these
are probably the best phones to use you
can obviously use any phone that you
want to do testing and depending on the
manufacturer and what you're doing with
the application you'll you'll have mixed
results but sometimes you can run into
little idiosyncrasies because the
software isn't implemented 100% to spec
compared to the Google reference
platform so these are basically the gold
standard so I'd recommend that you
acquire one of these if you want to do
have some hardware testing okay so we're
all different kinds of developers and we
all like to write in different languages
so here's the different languages that
are supportive Java is obviously the
main one and the best supported there's
also Java plus C or C++ and that's
supported by something called the native
development tool kit or the NDK so
basically you you write your Java code
and then you use the Java Java native
interface to create a bridge between
your Java and your native code you can
also write the whole application in C++
That's Gary new I'm not sure how how
well it's documented but the reason that
they added that option was for Game
Developers so if you're a game developer
you want to go with that option writing
all in C++ especially if you eat OpenGL
and really hardware intensive stuff you
probably know if you're one of these
people then there's you can actually
write applications in HTML CSS
JavaScript using a web view you're not
going to get as good performance
obviously is native code but maybe you
don't need that maybe that's the
quickest way for you to get an appt up
or port where you already have or
something like that and then lastly
there's also community support for
scripting languages so if you're
interested in scripting languages you'd
want to check out all this website here
I'll show you it's a just google android
scripting and you should be able to find
it and what it is is someone else has
gone out there and created them some
infrastructure to help you write in a
few different
bring languages Python Perl JRuby Lua
bean shelf JavaScript TCL and cell so if
you want to do some scripting now like I
said with that I usually had the
question before you are going to have to
deal with the lack of official library
support so you might have to navigate
around a few sticky points but if you
just want to port some existing good or
you want to get something simple up and
running scripting can be very effective
for that because we all know Java takes
a lot of typing right so sometimes
scripting can be more effective and the
the image I have over here is just
showing you how the dalvik bytecode
execution is different than the regular
Java so if you look on the left side of
this picture this is your typical Java
running on you know phones servers
workstations that sort of thing so you
take the java source code compile it you
get java bytecode which is basically
portable assembly and then the jungle by
code goes and runs on the Java Virtual
Machine with Android we still have that
that initial step of creating the java
bytecode but then we have a translation
step where it goes and it says ok java
calls you know adding and i don't know
an unsigned integer this we're going to
call up this and then they change the
bike routes and the reason that that's
done is so that they can save memory and
customize the execution for a mobile
device that's mainly the idea the other
main reason they did that is because if
you get j2me then you have to pay sun
microsystems now Oracle licensing fees
and they wanted to give the OS away for
free and now there's a legal lawsuit
going on and lots of drama there so if
you want to know more about that
situation not the lawsuit but
I'm not alone but if you want to know
more about dalvik you can look at my
article in jax mag if anybody's
interested i can give you the link
afterwards the article about why they
chose to do dalvik some of the
differences i was whole thing oh there
we go you know some of the differences
between regular Java and the dalvik java
and different things like that and
that's available on Jack's mac JX m.a.g
but the most part you can basically
ignore that you're not using the
traditional java virtual machine you
really shouldn't be a big issue for the
vast majority of you all right now i'm
going to talk a little bit about the
development tools so one nice thing
about android development is sports all
three of the major operating systems so
you don't have a Mac you don't have to
have windows you can even run linux if
you want to because the development
tools the officially supported ide is
eclipse and eclipse runs on those three
platforms so all you have to do if you
want to get setup is you go to eclipse
org
and you go to downloads and then you can
either get i believe the officially
recommended one is eclipse classic some
people also prefer the Eclipse IDE for
Java developers it really doesn't matter
which one you take so go and get your
clips download it install it and then
once you have a Clips up and running you
just go to help install a new software
ad and then you add a web page of a URL
to where the plug-in is and you can find
that address on once again on that
reference page that I showed you earlier
so you just go under here so I'm under
the SDK tab and then it's under it's
called the adt plugin for Eclipse
Android development tools and if you
scroll down here you just grab this URL
and put it into this box that's true
yeah so thanks for bringing that up
actually but there's another one that
you can use motorola development studio
so motorola took the eclipse code they
also they add in some stuff from the I
big is it called Sequoia I believe
square project and they basically have
all the android stuff already installed
for you plus some really cool utilities
like there's a localization tool which
will allow you to take your your xml
file that has all your strings in it and
you just click the language you want and
say you want to translate to chinese it
calls google's translate engine
translates all the strings and plus it
in there that's pretty cool right so
there's also some some skins for the
motorola products and some other nice
features so i highly recommend that you
check that out as well but Liz
motives to do
yeah there we go so if you get this
motorola development studio you don't
need the other eclipse because it's
giving you it's basically eclipse with
extra stuff added in already with
plugins so you can also add in all the
other eclipses plugins that you like as
well on top of this okay so some people
that aren't here lives just said that
basically if you already have Eclipse
installed you can install this
functionality as an extra plug on top of
the clips and add some other nice
features like running inside the clips
so let's see here and then there's also
the Android NDK which is what you'll
need if you want to develop C C++ code
and that's here under the same tool as
we're sorry the same tab is where you
got the SDK from and it's called native
development tools so to use the native
development tools you download the NDK
and then what you end up doing is making
a make file inside your application that
make file creates a shared library
inside your application and eclipse and
then when you install your application
on the phone it's going to take that
shared library put it on the phone and
then it'll have your native code as a
shared library that gets linked at
runtime and there's only certain api's
that are supported by the NDK there
should be a list here opengl is one of
them for sure lid z is another one you
see I know there's a list right here so
what I did is I went right under where
you download the NDK and it says what is
the NDK so this list right here the C
library math library etc those other
interfaces that are all guaranteed to
have backwards compatibility as Android
changes over time so if you use any
other libraries Google retain retains
the right to break your code at a later
date
and probably will so now i'm going to i
have a few pre-baked applications that i
can run through but i was just going to
open up for questions first and if we
don't get enough questions and i'll go
to that so does anybody have any
questions at this point over here can
you modify the native code and the
kernel code yes you can so if so of
course you're not going to be able to
modify anything on the user spoon I'm
sure you realize that but what you can
do is you can download the source code
for the whole operating system remember
the shark here on Android get Colonel
org the instructions on how to get the
code or right here at the top and yeah
you can get the code the latest release
us up there I believe with Gingerbread
they haven't released honeycomb yeah and
you can download it compile it there's a
google hired a guy named jbq john
baptiste crew oh he's an Android Open
Source developer liaison so they've been
getting much better at documentation and
support for the open source project so
you should be able to just download it
go and make and then build the whole
thing but at one point that wasn't true
so yes you can submit patches hmm yeah
his question was can use in my code yes
you can submit coat and you're very
likely to interact with that individual
they accept quite a few patches but if
you're submitting to a project that's
upstream from Android so but what I mean
by that is another open source project
likes a sequel like then you'd have to
go to that project to submit the patches
but yeah they welcome patches and they
are they integrate them in readily I saw
some more hands user jerk so the the
gentleman had a question about profiling
so there's a few different kinds of
pro-family we can do i'm assuming you
mean cpu memory maybe power see I not
that up on the database profiling stuff
unfortunately but I do know about the
the built-in profiling tools let me get
that it's not easy to type with one hand
I can show you Mike sorry I'm blanking
here I'm trying to bring up my open
source project code so that I can show
you their this I can show you those
tools so what I've done here is that
site i showed you just now with all the
code for the whole project Oh actually I
don't need to go there sorry
all right keep going to different
directories keep forgetting okay that's
what I want to be and you're okay so
this is the so this is the SDK directory
and then we go under tools and everybody
can anybody see that let me make the
font substantially bigger this is the
SDK directory / tools and we have a few
different profiling tools under here one
we have is called hierarchy viewer very
useful you can get some really big
performance gains by optimizing your
view hierarchy so this is a java app and
will run on all three of the major
platforms basically what it shows you is
oh well it's even better than last time
I looked at it what it does is it gives
you a tree overview here of your of your
view in memory so right now I'm showing
you the status bar review so that that's
the the top of my phone and it's showing
me all the different layouts that go
into that view and the reason that
that's really useful is because a good
at like this one will not have a very
deep tree so when when the Java code
needs to traverse the tree it doesn't
have to go that far but a bat slow
performing application I'll have a very
big tree so say for example you use a
ton of nested linearlayout that's really
going to affect your performance because
your codes going to have to keep
searching through the spine views but if
you use something like a relative layout
instead you can shrink the size of the
tree and then your Apple perform better
so hierarchy viewer is a really useful
utility another good one also related to
views I find the name here
it's called layout opt so layout opt-out
not share federal rank acceptor into
royal layout yeah no it's not going to
it's not going to run for me with auto
layout but basically what Leia op does
is it gives you suggestions on your
layout so you load up your view with our
key viewer your trees huge you're like
holy crap how do i fix this you go to
layout opt layoffs will give you
suggestions and so in 10 so that's I'm
sorry that's not really optimization but
I just got excited because I found it
optimization if you if we go over here
to the android tab inside eclipse you
can see the information on the threads
that are running the heap heap yeah
there we go the heap you can also look
at the allocations and if you want to
get if you want to get cpu information
what you need to do is run the you just
you you put a little snippet inside your
code that will dump all the trace
information to a file and then you run
traceview right here and i will bring up
a nice gooey that shows you all the cpu
information so if you if you're
interested in these utilities which i'm
sure you will be at some point there's
information about them here on that same
website yes here it is so if you go
under dev guide developing tools it
talks about all the all the utilities in
that directory in detail and let me show
you the the one I was just talking about
so you can see what it looks like
I'm blanking or is it Tracy it's not
here otherwise oh there it is great well
if you go the real internet is there
yeah so that's basically will and I'm
aware of that's available and then
obviously you know you can use other
offline tools just like any other any
other platform and if you are making
your own Android device you can use your
traditional valgrind and all those other
fancy tools 7 to your question ah
fragmentation question I have a picture
for you sir so he's asking nextag meant
that i'm not rich i don't have a ton of
phones what should I develop for and
there's a really nice picture there it
is it's under resources so resources
platform versions and that's your part
to rid their sir so tells you that
android 22 is quite a big slice of the
pie android 21 and then the rest are
quite small ok so the question is are
there differences in the api's and other
things you have to trade off between the
different age jack yes there are pretty
big differences from version to version
for example the older phones don't
support bluetooth so via bluetooth app
you have to have a minimum version one
nice way that you can deal with that is
if you go to the reference tab here you
can actually select the api level and
what it'll do is it'll ghost out
anything that's not available in that
api level so you can very quickly find
out when it was available at sounds your
question great thanks these questions
are working out good keep them coming ok
jenna is asking about custom roms you're
doing about cyanogen that's sort of
thing yeah they are based off of Android
Open Source Project some sometimes what
they have to do is they actually have to
take files off of your phone such as
proprietary drivers and then put them
back on your phone so for example the
the GPS library each
each manufacturer has to implement their
own implementation of the GPS library so
usually what you end up doing is just
taking the lip off of the phone flash
the phone and put the lid back on but
cyanogen does it all for you in the
background you won't even realize that
it's happening signage and in particular
is very well documented they have a nice
quickie where you can step through
rooting your phone installing the new
rom and then tweaking it out and things
like that so I don't think there's any
big Forks right now of the android open
source project but i haven't heard of
any so they should all be coming from
there you in mexican ok so the gentleman
singh emulators slogans everything
faster a phone that's basically uh
unfortunately the reason and compared to
a platform like the iphone which is much
faster the reason that it's slower is
because it's an emulator another
simulator and the difference is that an
emulator actually runs all of the same
code as a real phone but a simulator
take some shortcuts to make it faster so
unfortunately there's no easy answers
there most of time an i do development I
will fire up an emulator and then just
keep it running the whole time it never
hurts to have extra memory I mean we are
talking about Eclipse and Java here so
unfortunately I eclipse Android
development as RAM intensive well it's a
great question so the online person is
asking about when android apps will
catch up in terms of quality what's
driving that process said it well I
think we'll drive that process so what
he's alluding to is what I was saying
before that there's a lot of Johnson's
basically on the mark on the market and
there's a lot of people just spamming
for keywords basically so you type in
some like for example if you type in
citibank i'm trying to get a citibank
out the other day you get a bunch of
spammy apps that aren't the real
citibank so in terms of quality i think
the reason that that is suffered is two
big reasons I can think of off the top
of my head one is that Android
android owners don't spend as much money
on apps so it's a well known fact so the
mark the the market is huge right
there's there's way more people using
android than iphone but the market of
people that will hey ten dollars for a
nap is much bigger for the for the
iphone but i personally think that will
change as i mean at some point you gotta
have so many people that even that small
piece of the pile become bigger okay so
the the audience person was common thing
that google checkout isn't that great
maybe that would help go to itunes okay
what uh and then the other thing was joy
is there anything i can think of that
would drive that another thing i could
see driving that is the other people's
markets such as Amazon I can't think of
anything but maybe they'll innovate in
some way that will make it more
attractive for better developers to come
along for example they could give them a
much lower they could take a much lower
cut because Google takes about thirty
percent of your app sales i believe
which is the same as iOS and or at least
lessen my used iOS and if somebody came
along that only did ten percent and
could actually get your app sold that
would definitely help out quite a bit so
the gem wants to see structure of a nap
alright thanks so much for the questions
guys mix makes it much more beneficial
for both of us so here's so one thing I
want to show you is how easy Android
makes it for you to get really
interesting views without a lot of a lot
of code so for example here is an
application that just brings up a map
view so I'm going to run it here in the
background and then I'll I'll go through
how it works so what we have here is my
Clips project the source code we just
have one Java file that Java file is
extending so it's us it's basically
subclassing an activity that's in the
API called map activity and then there's
different hooks that we talked about
earlier such as one create on start on
stop that sort of thing where you can
add in your code that will then alter
what the user sees on the screen because
if you don't touch anything all they're
going to get is a map that they can't do
anything with so what this code does is
it sets up the view sets up the controls
get the location listener so like I
mentioned before with the managers to
get your location you have to talk to
the location manager location manager
asks do i have permission to get
location and then we'll give the
application a call back when it has the
location and so in terms of Java code
you can do quite a lot just in this
oncreate method you can think of it as
being analogous to a main on a platform
application and then similar to what the
previous poker of the previous speaker
spoke about with model-view-controller
they separate the view logic from the
business logic or the logic that's
actually doing the work and so the way
that that's achieved is by putting the
view in XML
so this is the map view this is all
that's required you basically add a
layout and so the layout holds of you
and then the viewer holding inside right
now is a map view so it's just these two
elements of XML and this is another one
of the reasons I think that Android has
really taken off is because you don't
have to do as much coding to get really
good output so you just have these two
two little tags for XML and then there's
also a very important file called the
manifest what the manifest does when you
install the application it tells the
Android system things that we need to
know by your applications such as which
activity do I start fares what
permissions do you have was sort of
intense do you support an intent is kind
of like a signal to your application I
want to get into that it's kind of a new
concept so anyways you got the manifest
you have the XML for views and then you
hear you have the Java so this line
right here setcontentview r.layout.main
is what loads that XML file there's a
Java phone called our Java that's
automatically populated with constants
that represent your XML files so you're
basically going to that Java file and
saying load load this constant which
represents the xml file i just showed
you and then if you run it you can see
it's not working cuz the internet i can
show you on my phone here application
you can see at the at the top here it
says map demo and so i was running this
on my my phone when i was on my way here
and that's really all it takes to get a
map view up and running so you have to
go get a map key I didn't cover that but
that's all it takes to get a nice little
map you hear that your user can play
with so you could toss a few on top of
that I make a nice little app without
much coding at all you could easily do
in under an hour once you with used to
the process
so leave them out of time right okay so
thanks thanks so much for your attention
and I'll be out there in the hall at the
oven</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
