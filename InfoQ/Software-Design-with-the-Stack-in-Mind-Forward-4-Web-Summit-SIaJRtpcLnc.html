talked a lot about javascript in the
front and I've done a lot of that up to
a couple years ago basically ending with
like angular 1 and since then I've been
doing a lot of work on the back end but
I still kind of like Pekin and watch how
things are going and changing because in
a lot of ways the architecture on the
front end is kind of a derivative of
what we do on the back end couple years
into my career rails came out so before
that you know we really had to piece
things together and every project you
went to was completely different and so
rails kind of brought some of that code
is people idea that we might have heard
a little bit about earlier which is you
know make it really easy to do the right
thing and really hard to do the wrong
thing and so that that was kind of you
know from a design perspective that was
very good but also from just getting
going 0-2 blog in 15 minutes that was
like that was amazing because before you
know you kind of had to set up an Apache
server you had to figure out if you
wanted mod PHP or CGI etc and now you
just have this this thing where you just
type rails go and you connected to port
3000 and you wrote a blog so that's
that's the perspective I'm bringing to
this talk so basically I work for a
company that does pub/sub stuff so I
really see lots of use cases lots of
different applications we have we have I
think like 80,000 applications running
on our network I do lots of course stuff
so I'm not interacting with customers
but it's you know a tea person teams so
really get to like see what use cases
are and like talk with a lot of the
architects to work with our customers
about what customers are doing with our
system etc I'm not selling any of that
basically we do a lot of projects at
work I have a lot of views about how
things should be done rails brought us
this opinionated development thing at
least web development and so this is
basically something I've put together
for the last few weekends and been
thinking about for the last two
about like how would you build software
that lets you you know do a lot of the
things we've been talking about today
share code across you know the different
parts of your app and also you know stop
working against the stack like in a lot
of ways we do things like to a data
binding that we have elegant solutions
to but the way that I see kind of the
data center going and and indirectly
through some of the trends that we're
seeing from client libraries you know
things are changing and I want to
explain a little bit about why that is
so basically I was going to cover the
history in about five minutes talk about
ten minutes about like you know how
things look now and how that's
influencing the new libraries that are
coming out so I'll kind of go through
this quickly on so we started out kind
of in the stone age of development and
there's like no naming system to these
ages is just like whatever I put
together so we really had prototype and
there was probably a couple things
before that but that gave us the map
function and it gave us the Ajax
function like um there was a time not
long ago when people hated JavaScript
and didn't want to use it in their
projects and thought maybe maybe form
form validation is okay but otherwise
it's like not really a real language we
can't do anything real with it and we
kind of saw a lot of flesh and flash
intros and you know things like that and
with prototype came script oculus which
gave us a little bit of like css-based
animation in the browser that was pretty
legendary on my time lines are a little
bit foggy i I really spent a lot more
time putting together the demo than the
slide so my apologies on that but um so
jQuery and jQuery UI came out and those
are like much more complete those
started giving us like the ideas of
components and let's not repeat
ourselves too much and finally on rails
came and rails had
all of these opinions and a technical
stack to build them upon like everything
was assembled it was no longer
whiteboards and slides and people
talking about stuff it's like here's
rails like let's let's do something cool
so I think it warrants a lot of a lot of
thought I mean it's it's definitely
still relevant and it still solves a lot
of the problems that it was designed to
solve very well but it was actually made
when javascript was uncool it was made
you know 10 i think this last July there
was a posting at have been around for 10
years that's something that really got
me like thinking about this idea a lot
and so like what is it about the
libraries we see now versus libraries we
saw then like why why why wasn't that
good enough why didn't we just stay with
that and keep going so so you know rails
came out and and we also started seeing
like a lot of really neat things coming
out we saw like Gmail which was one of
the first like full page applications
where you could read your email you
could you know do everything without you
know clicking clicking the title and
waiting for a new page to load it just
kind of popped up and in my view
it's like also meebo meebo was much more
you could you could tell on because of
the nature of email you know it's still
kind of asynchronous you send it off and
maybe a day later you get a response
back but instant messaging in the
browser in my view was was that was very
game-changing that's when I really
started to take the web seriously I've
been doing a lot of Java server faces
and things like that and you know it's
cool they got the whole request-response
lifecycle and stuff but like what if you
don't necessarily need that anymore so
we started seeing a lot of Ajax and
eventually like Twitter release
bootstrap and now we have all kinds of
css3 and html5 but like that hasn't
always been around so um pretty soon
after that you know that this is a span
of ten years this is probably like five
years in like node came out like 2007 or
something and from there what really got
my attention with node was you could run
j/s everywhere there was this idea of
isomorphic code it was like really big
in the beginning but people kind of like
gave up the idea of trying to use the
same libraries and the browser and in
node which was kind of disappointing to
me and actually just seeing seeing that
there's two almost identical package
managers Bauer and NPM for example it's
like you know it's it's it's kind of
diverging beyond a point i think is
acceptable like given given all the
enthusiasm about isomorphic code in the
beginning there was one very awesome
project that did this extremely well
it's the first relevant thing AOL did in
my career like I got my career started
actually as a preteen making things like
kick people off the internet like by
crashing their ions so like it's kind of
cool that I saw this in about twenty
time this framework called socket stream
which actually gave us a lot of what
closure the script does now which is you
had a shared code
module and then you had your server
module your client module and all the
export sort of mapped from the server
side into this kind of exposed object on
the client side that you could just call
and got free RPC and they were also like
very pub sub oriented message driven
unfortunately the project seems to have
not lasted too long by 2011 or so it was
gone so oh yeah I had to do it cool
because the 80s we're talking like late
80s Haskell type ideas started coming
out you know in the on the kind of like
rails evolved crud front we still had
angular and amber going but they're
still getting like this really advanced
data binding and things like that
exposing a lot of like functional nature
being probably functional inside but
still kind of like hiding it but on the
other hand we start we also have like
Elm bacon jas and d3 which I think are
interesting for these contributions
which MLM is like all in bacon is sort
of like you want some frp you can drop
in this library and d3 it's just
completely different thing for graphics
domains but I think it it brings a lot
of cool ideas on like just reacting to
you know you got like a loop of change
and render you didn't actually write the
loop it kind of handled that machinery
for you so you know it's it's not to
class it is just to say I thought it was
on you know a significant lot feature I
guess of a framework to do so now we're
in the age of the stream I'm sure
marketing would approve of this slide
but I can't help but there's two
paradigms in distributed computing
there's shared memory and there's
message passing and I think as that sort
of like the driver we talked in the
panel earlier about you know like
concurrency is the killer application
for functional programming well yes
definitely true we've kind of hit that
the edge of progression of single core
speeds we're getting laptops with 248
plus cores you know
it makes more it makes a lot of sense to
be able to take advantage of these
optimizations so we're doing it we've
been doing it for quite a while longer
on the server and we you know we see
these pretty you know reasonably mature
like streaming frameworks like spark and
st. Sam's is pretty new but it's for
doing like huge scale processing of
these events that go through on the back
end and just kind of across the board
you know we see even Amazon instance
types kind of turning into you know like
we've got the graphic instance the
compute in since the memory and since
the disk instance all of these things
mean that you're going to have a bunch
of parts of your applications that do
different things running on different
machines and you know as a result we've
got all these different API backends
you've got all these load balancers this
is an interesting one if you've been to
then any of the functional react the
functional programming talks I feel like
this is worth pointing out because it
was kind of alluded to earlier but these
two things end up with the same results
you'll have a you start with an a array
of 0 to 9 Abby array of 1 to 10 because
you're taking everything in a and adding
1 to it but these things actually kind
of Express different things one is one
implies more than the other this one
actually implies a serial ordering you
have to do 0 to 9 in order so if you've
got you know a laptop that has eight
cores you could do that in two or three
cycles but now you actually have to wait
10 still it's it's a lot harder to kind
of like make this code parallelizable
automatically so this kind of what I
mentioned earlier these are like the
properties of these two kinds of systems
so shared memory is where we've been
with JavaScript see you know all the
imperative class of languages which is
you know you've got that array of memory
and you're assigning things and it's all
you know it should be continuous blocks
or may be linked lists but sort of as
soon as you have more data that can fill
on one machine you're kind of out of
luck like there's some some offerings in
kind of the enterprise space and
probably an open source
one I can't remember what it's called
but you know it offers you kind of a
virtual way of sharing objects across
Java processes but you know it's it's
sort of like again like data binding
it's it's kind of taking a problem that
you shouldn't solve and solving it well
but really you know message passing
makes a lot more sense like user moves
the mouse that's a stream of events they
click on something now you have a stream
of clicks you can handle this in various
ways and you know you can you can map it
all onto memory segments and use locks
and things or you can kind of do these
things as these pure functions that
everyone talks about let's see so
deployment and data centers are changing
automation Big Data business
intelligence analytics everyone wants
hooks into your applications everyone
wants audit law audit trails everyone
wants to be able to me recreate
scenarios for bug reports etc event
driven systems let you just record this
stuff and offers it all out of the box
you know I we've got alcohol after this
I'll talk all night about this stuff to
you if you want a one-on-one this is a
very interesting finding network and
disk access re basically equivalent in
terms of latency in the modern data
center that's like extremely profound it
means you know they're both very fast I
see about 125 megabytes per second
matching when I run like a kafka server
on so you know and I had mentioned like
the different instance types I know I'm
over time I'm just kind of like trying
to get to my conclusion as fast as
possible so I also do a lot of like
reading about business stuff so we've
got these new ideas like lean startup
continuous delivery just humble wrote
this awesome book it's kind of like the
Bible of how software is deployed none
of it really matches the single machine
model that we've been working with for
so long so you know you're going to have
an influx of new tools as well that
you're going to be working with I do see
this concluding in business and
engineering or talk
getting better like this is all you know
software is people so all of you know
you've got these engineering solutions
like functional programming business
solutions like agile lean and then kind
of things that say like okay this is
what we have let's maybe define a on
interface that we can work together with
so how do we respond kind of take the
right path architectural ii i really
wish i could have talked more about
specifics one thing i like kind of the
point of this i open source the project
today that's kind of demoing a lot of
these ideas based on closure everywhere
blah blah blah drank the kool-aid a
couple years ago and i wanted to share
that so senior developers have special
roles on teams in my view like there
there has to be at least one
forward-looking person on every team
that's why we're all here because
otherwise you just kind of see like
really stagnant apps especially if you
go into a company that you know kind of
has a lot of a lot of old code you just
see it just piles of crap and no one
really knows how to fix it or if they do
on you know they they don't have the
clout to within their organization so
you know some organizations are better
than others like especially being in
like a technology software as a service
type company we have a lot of room to
like experiment with these things and
our technology is our business value so
business is very inclined to listen to
us so you know we've got a lot of room
there to experiment with things on where
you wouldn't be able to if it was kind
of like a web agency or something and
your clients had very small budgets I
was going to talk a little bit about the
choices I made actually I've got a
pretty big read me for the project so
you guys can find it all there it's here
harlan g / closure seed it mostly works
like it kind of broke a little bit today
and i checked it in its broken so if
there were see I would be failing sorry
like i said though it's like a weekend
project so that's going to be the state
of it but you know i actually it's it
takes a lot of things that java did very
well and takes them without throwing the
bathwater out
so I just want to like going to keep
kind of developing that more and using
it for myself if you like closure you
should definitely check it out there's a
lot of cool stuff I can show you more
later I'm Way over time so thanks
everyone
