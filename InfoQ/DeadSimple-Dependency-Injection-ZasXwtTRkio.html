be talking about dependency injection
from my point of view we don't have a
lot of time so I'm going to jump right
in
it's a little bit about me first I'm a
software engineer at Capital IQ right
here in Boston I contribute to the Scala
z library and I'm currently writing a
book about functional programming in
Scala and the early access program
formatting was was put online today and
so you can go and check out the first
chapter there's a couple of chapters
that you can you can check out already
and if you use this promotional code
here I'm told that you can get a 40%
discount cool good thank you okay so
let's jump right in um so here we have
you know a Scala method that updates
some some data in a database and you'll
notice that everything here is kind of
hard coded it's self-contained but you
know I have hard-coded the the sequel
Lite JDBC driver here and I have a URL
that's hard-coded so this isn't very
very reusable or anything like that you
know fine for a little little toy test
but it's this is not how you want to
write actual actual applications so one
thing that people might might do is that
they use some kind of global Factory to
provide the database connection so you
have this connection factory thing and
it can give you a connection now you'll
notice that on the previous slide I was
closing the connection at the end but
here when I'm getting a connection from
this connection factory is not really
clear whose responsibility it is to
close the connection and so this is a
really bad idea for other reasons as
well it introduces hidden dependency on
this global object and it requires this
initialization stuff like you can't call
this method before it that object has
been initialized somehow and yeah that's
all I say about that
so the solution to that is inversion of
control which is really just a
pretentious way of saying taking an
argument so so here I'm taking an
argument I'm injecting or you know I'm
taking taking this argument C which is a
database connection right no injection
going on here yet but so you can see
that I don't care where this connection
comes from I just accept that I have one
and I'm just going to use it and I don't
I don't care how it's discarded so I
don't have to know how to obtain
connections I don't have to know how to
discard connections when I'm done with
them I just assume that this connection
is open but you know you might you might
object and say well what if the thing
that knows how to create in this card of
database database connections is way up
here in Maine and then you know down in
my my call graph I have some code that
actually needs the connection do I do I
now need to pass the connection all the
way through that's going to get pretty
cumbersome and so the solution to that
is Korean and I'll show you show you why
that is here so this is what my code
looked like on the previous slide and
then I'm going to curry this this method
and that's what that looks like so
instead of passing in the connection
right away
I'm simply going to partially apply and
so what I'm going to return instead of
you know returning unit I'm gonna
actually return a function that accepts
the connection at a convenient time and
so you can see I'm returning a function
literal it takes some connection C and
then it does all the things that I was
doing before in exactly the same way the
only difference is that I'm delaying the
actual passing of the connection and we
can capture this in a data type this is
just for for convenience you may or may
not want to do this in real life but
this is just to show you and so this is
just a wrapper around this type
connection to a for for a type a so DB
of a is like a database action
given in connection you can it can
produce some value of type a I have an
apply method to make it convenient to
call and it you can have this this map
method on it which will allow you to
take any exist existing function for any
types a and B if you have a function
from A to B you can promote it to a
function that operates on these database
actions so you'll notice that your
existing code doesn't have to know
anything about database connections you
can just simply take all your existing
code and kind of lift it so that it
passes the connection along now you'll
also notice that the implementation of
map is just function composition and in
order to combine two actions so say I
have some action that produces is there
a question in the back
I may have I may have been assuming that
there was a implicit conversion from
yeah so yeah just assume that there's an
implicit conversion from from connection
from function 1/2 DB so anyway what what
happens here in flat map is that we get
to combine two actions so if you have an
action that produces some some value of
type a in our case this and then you
call flap map with a function that then
consumes that a so requires depends on
it wants it inject it if you will then
you can you can flap map that function
over it and that will give you one
combined action so you can you can
combine two database actions together
using flat map and this thing is a monad
because you have flat map and the other
component that you need is this pure
method which is really as simple as it
could be take some value of a type a and
wraps it in one of these database
actions that proceeds to ignore the
connection and having map and flatmap
methods on this thing allow us to
sequence it through Monette
comprehension using the scala for syntax
so you'll notice that here I'm not
actually talking about the database
connection at all none of this code
actually mentions the connection it's
just assumed and it's all threaded
through this code for me by the fact
that that it's a monad that I have map
and flatmap methods that are implemented
a certain way and so at the end of the
day you're going to want to pass a
database connection to one of these one
of these actions that you've composed so
what you want to do is have some
abstract class that provides a
connection and and here that's just it
takes a database action and gives it a
connection and extracts the value of
type a
and I have a concrete constructor of
that here make provider takes a driver
and URL and then connects using that
driver and that URL passes the
connection to you know a given a given
database action and then closes the
connection so really simple and here are
a couple of concrete instances of that
like you might have a couple of
implementations of your of your
connection provider interface and here
are two implementations one is like a
test database in sequel Lite and the
other one might be a my sequel
production database and so how do you
select between these two like you want
at you know when you're actually writing
your application you'll want to inject
to the correct one right depending on so
something and for instance here is a
program that needs a connection provider
it it asks to have a connection provider
injected if you will and so you'll
notice that I'm doing the exact same
thing I was doing with connections I'm
just currying so this thing requires a
connection provider are and then you
know does some some stuff to interact
with the user and then it calls our
change password method from before which
is a database action and passes that
action to our and it will then receive a
database connection it will be injected
into it if you will and you know
everyone will be happy so the injection
actually occurs like this for instance
if I want to run something in test I
simply pass the test database to it but
want to run run something in production
I pass the production database to it and
here's an example of a main where I run
my program programmer on the previous
slide in tests by simply passing the
program to do my running tests and so
that's really simple and so here is your
dependency injection framework
it all fits on this one slide it's I've
stacked AddThis a little bit so now
it's a reader from C to a instead of
being you know a database reader or or
something something concrete whereas
before our C was like a database
connection now it's NEC and you see that
you care to to inject or pass around you
know it has the same implementations of
map and flatmap as before the only thing
that changes is the type and then we
have pure making this whole thing a
monad and we can use it in Monette
comprehensions and here's our my
implicit for Daniel my plus it that I
omit it earlier okay so things that that
I like about the reader Mona are its
well is really as simple as it could
possibly be it's literally just function
composition all the dependencies are
explicit they are they're advertised in
the type and you can't not pass
something it's dependencies it's not
possible you can take any existing code
any existing function and lift it into
this monad it doesn't have to know
anything about your dependencies
beforehand there are no frameworks that
download no jars to drop into your class
path there are no annotations no XML
there's no magic initialization step
like you have to you know build this
injector framework beforehand and it
doesn't rely on any advanced language
features like dependent method types or
or that kind of thing so it's really
really simple now you know it's not all
a win so there are certain things that
that are made a little bit difficult
like first is if you write a lot of code
in monadic style like if you if you use
a lot of other monads then composing
composing the reader monette with your
existing monads may get a little may get
a little hairy I might get verbose it's
not necessarily difficult this is that
you might have to write more code than
you like and you can see an example of
that if you look at closely in the
scholar Z library which is a reader
monad transformer also juggling multiple
configurations at once so if you have
you know some some set of programs over
here that require say you know an a and
then you have a set of programs over
here that require a B then composing
those together into programs that
require both an A and a B or either an A
or a B that can be it can be awkward
it's not you know hard but it's a little
more awkward than I'd like also you have
to start writing programs in magnetic
style which you know I'm fine with them
I'm writing programs in magnetic style
anyway so it's you know it's not
terrible and the Scala already provides
you know monent comprehension is for us
so it's not really not really a problem
and there's no it doesn't have any of
this auto wiring like for instance if
you have something like juice juice will
it'll sort of wire up all your
dependencies for you in this in this
magic initialization step that happens
at the beginning and you never have to
sort of mention the fact that you're
passing dependencies into into this
thing that requires them but implicit
scan actually compensate for that so
with any dependency injection framework
you still need a configuration file or
whatever
or something that is specifying your
instance whether it's the code or
whether it's some XML file yeah yeah
Paul comments that that with any
injection injection framework you'll
have to have some kind of configuration
where you actually do talk about all
your dependencies and so it's
essentially the same as as mentioned
name explicitly okay so that was the
reader minute now I want to take this
idea a little bit further so imagine for
for a minute if you want to inject or
you know pass in something like a key
value store and this is this is a
side-effect II interface a key value
store has these capabilities where you
can put get and delete so you can you
can you know put a value under a string
you can get the value under a under a
key then you can delete the value under
key and so if this were done in the
reader Monette if you write this method
modify that requires a key value store
then you say you know you return a
reader of key value stores and here's a
little program that you know gets a key
he stores it in a value and then puts
the modified value back you know that's
that's great that's reader mana but once
you'd imagine for a minute if instead of
accepting a key value store and then
proceeding to manipulate it why don't we
instead return ah
return a little program that tells the
caller what we might do to a key value
store if we had so don't give me a key
value store I'm going to give you a
program that you're going to run once
you have a key value store and so that
part that little language might look
like this so we have a sealed abstract
trait KVS and it'll have three cases you
can put get and delete and you'll notice
that each one of these guys has a hole
of type a and and what is that what is
that value of type a four well it's so
that we can nest these together so we
can put
of a yet of a delete so kind of like a
list where we nest list within lists you
know there's a head and then the tail is
another list in this case a KVS is one
of these instructions and then another
one of these KBS's for something like
this if you want to modify from our
previous slide we have this this monadic
is for comprehension but using this
little language it simply becomes you
know get K and then given the value that
you get out of it v put F of V and then
terminate with unit right pretty
straightforward and so we return a
program that kind of looks like this now
there's a problem and the problem is
that this thing returns a KVS of a KBS
of unit not exactly what we want and if
we you know get get get get put get
delete then it's going to be k vs of k
vs of KBS with KBS of KBS etc and that's
not what we want so if only there were a
way that we could combine KBS of KBS FA
into just KBS if a have you really cool
now what would that mean exactly
well it would mean that KBS has to be
what anybody
omona thank you so here is a data
structure it's called the free mo net
and it actually generates a monad given
any functor and it just what happens
that our KBS thing is is a functor and
i'll show you that here in a minute but
what I want to draw your attention to on
this slide I know it's sort of dense but
what I want to draw your attention to I
said we have this class free and it has
two cases it has to you know
implementations it can be either done in
which case we have a value of type a or
it can have more F's in which case it'll
have an F of you know recurs recursion
so we want to recurse so for instance
you know you might have a more of more
of more of more of done and that will
still just be a
free of FA okay and you can see that
this is a monad and we could use it in
for comprehensions because it has a map
and flatmap implemented I will go into
that so a functor is just something that
has a map method so if we have you know
a function from A to B then we can turn
that into a function from F of a which
is our a here to F of B and I told you
that KBS was a functor and there's
there's proof of that and the
implementation of this functor is simply
you know pattern match on on the
structure and pull out the the actual a
and apply F to it and and then put it
back together right really simple and so
we can now get a KBS monnet for free so
you see that these methods put get and
delete actually return a free of KBS and
and a you know unit string and unit
respectively and they're just they're
constructing these little programs like
there's more you know put the K with the
value V and then done and then get it's
just more get K and with the V say done
V right so so we write this is these
little programs and now we can implement
modify in monadic style by saying you
know for and then assign v2 to the value
under the key K and then put F of V into
K and that is you know a free of K BS
unit and we don't you know we don't have
to worry about this nesting anymore
because it's a Moana and yeah so what
you want to do is return one of these
guys and then at the end of the day
you'll want to pass this thing to an
interpreter I hope you're seeing a
pattern here the other day you want to
you want to actually you know give this
thing some kind of key value store to
manipulate and so here's that method
this is this is an interpreter that uses
an
immutable map to interpret our kb/s
language and it just perceives by
pattern matching on on the value so we
have a free of kb/s which is our little
program and then we just match on it and
if you know if there's more and it's
it's pudding then we simply add our key
value pair if there's more and we're
getting then we simply you know apply
our function and and recurse you know we
get the value out and if there is a more
to delete and then we remove the key
from the table and if we're done then we
simply return the table okay awesome so
conclusions so Scala is not Java right
so like like Joshua's saying and it's in
his keynote don't you know don't don't
feel compelled to necessarily bring all
of your old Java habits into Scala
because it's it's a much much more
powerful language and there are so many
more things that you could do and you
know this is not necessarily best
practices that I'm giving you here I
just want to say that there's so many
other things that you can do then the
same old stuff that you're used to doing
in other languages and so I just want to
know I just want to give you like a
little guide from how to how to move
from the old and busted to the new
hotness so you know where you're used to
using frameworks factories and magic
initialization steps try to frame your
systems in terms of functions from
inputs to outputs and I promise you that
every system that you can imagine can be
framed in terms of functions from inputs
to outputs and then instead of
dependency injection why don't we use
you know little languages we're used to
doing this with with monads
I mean with with options and lists and
and other things like you don't you
don't inject something that like has two
methods one for empty and another one
for for non-empty you just return an
option right and that's a little
language so we're basically doing the
same thing here
and instead of having many
implementations of an interface that you
then you know pass into things have many
interpreters of your language and then
you don't have to pass anything around
right all right I'm going to open it to
the questions in the back the question
is whether I have suggestions for
debugging now you do it the same way as
you do anything else yeah Daniel okay so
the question is if you can get a monad
for any functor what is the distinction
between a functor and a monad why aren't
all functors monnet well it's not the
same so every Monette is a functor right
but the free monnet of a functor is not
the same functor as the functor that you
start it with it's the free monent is a
recursive structure whereas the functor
that we started with was just a simple
you know a simple wrapper right so
that's the that's the difference and you
know if you're if you're curious to
learn more about you know free
structures generated by by functors and
by algebra then you know read up in your
on your category theory you know okay
it's a very very deep subject yes you
had to slide a several slides back down
about reader for the lose read it for
the loser yep
in which generally multiple
configurations or combining with other
Moniz can be awkward so one point of
reference that I have for that is if you
see this web print look for Haskell I
have not looked at now the idea is that
there's there some state and a snap
won't have essentially reader yeah and
answer to a priori
you have to basically pre compose it
into some sort of big data structure all
of the safety you care about is that is
that something you considered best
practice or a hat or or like how would
you suggest yeah so if you're working so
the question is you know if you need
multiple things how do you how do you
sort of depend on on a structure that
might be can might consist of a lot of
things and yeah I think it's really best
practice to to consolidate your
configuration so I mean if you're you're
talking about it's a configuration to
your program then yeah I really think
that you should consolidate it into like
an actual class or type yes
proportion of the state you care about
proportion of the entire
care about that gets you your that's
actually the snap
there's an answer from Edmund
yeah so you can use type lenses in order
to to drill down into the portion of the
of the configuration that you care about
I'm going to take was there I saw some
hands in the back here yeah oh the snap
framework it's a it's a web framework
for Haskell yeah yes sir okay so the
question is do do dependency injection
frameworks in other languages like
spring and that kind of thing do they
compensate for lack of language features
I don't know the answer to that it may
be that they compensate for lack of
imagination did you follow up well
you're asking if they if they provide
any additional value and well the answer
to that is that value to whom I mean
they don't provide any value to me but
they might provide value to you and so
it really depends on what it is that you
value
I don't know the answer to that I don't
know what you want out of a framework
like that
but I can tell you I don't use them and
because I don't I don't get a value out
of them but your your mileage may differ
Josh no free mo nets no free candy
there's free monads okay
okay cool thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
