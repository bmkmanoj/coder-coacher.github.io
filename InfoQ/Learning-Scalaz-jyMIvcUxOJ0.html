style and not use a microphone so if you
can't hear me I only yell out I guess
hey Josh so I'm using um or ev3 si9
where you design the uh so I'm kind of
via nights and weekend Scala programmer
ah for my day job I actually could you
know investment solution in dotnet and
JavaScript and Delphi and stuff like
that and so I have some pet project
Scala XP Treehugger stopped and the like
a dozen SVT plugins that I've inherited
from other people or I just kind of came
up with and the uh I like to kind of
contribute to some of the tools I like
using so big shout out to the Nathans
pamphlet so that's the documentation
stuff that the current learning scholars
ed is using and it's a really highly
recommended stuff essentially you can
write stuff and mark down and then like
types it and this is a really beautiful
static page that you can just like you
know pop it into like a github or your
website and so I contributed several
function that I wanted to have in the
pamphlet like the bilingual features and
stuff like that so I started coding
Scala in 2009 like I said I was doing
more like a Windows II stuff at work and
I kind of want to do explore different
aspect and 2010 I kind of started the
Scala XP and right around the time is
when I joined the New York scholar
meetup and to me that was kind of like a
mind changing event because before I
would just kind of code things at work
but with Twitter and with meetups and
like conferences like this you know I
get to meet people so the coding became
more like a social experience that I
could get inspired by people who is
doing a lot of cool stuff so I started
joining more meetups groups like a
functional meetup and kind of you know
tinkered with like lists and Haskell and
things like that and then I moved to
Amherst Massachusetts
in 2011 for my wife's PHP program and
kind of like all the sudden I was caught
away from the this whole meetup saying
so once in a month I'll get on to you
know the mega bus to join the developer
meeting and one of the books are
carrying my backpack we'll be learning
how scale for great good and I will
think okay I'm gonna read this category
theory of how scale on the bus but a few
pages and somehow I can't concentrate
get really sleepy and then if you have
experience riding the bus and reading
it's kind of like that like it's either
too easy or it's just like it's it's too
abstract and doesn't make any sense
and that's when that's the time I
started the series of blog posts that
became the earnings cows ad so that goes
to the the first rule sort of of the the
learning scholars ed series or those
learning in general I think is that
you're probably not gonna learn scholars
ed by reading my blog articles and the
related second rule is that you're
probably not going to really learn known
as either by reading someone else's blog
articles so tureen like learning
required some sort of like emotional
engagement it's kind of similar to like
listening to someone talk about like
calculus in the lecture and you think
okay I got this I got this and then
someone makes you like do some tests and
you have no idea how to do it right so
you have to get your hands dirty and to
me the quick way of doing it is like
someone gives you exercise problem you
try to solve that stuff using whatever
the skill set you have and to me that
was kind of like Scholars ed was kind of
like right at the point where I could
try to use this stuff and then express
whatever concept that's presented in
learning has going great good and ripple
really is a key in this because you type
something in and you if you can express
it in the ripple then you get the
feedback right away you see the type you
see the values and writing the blog or
any sort of Apple you know even talking
to your friends or coworker is really
good way because you kind of have to
understand enough dangerous enough to be
able to talk to people in public or
write about it
and the good part is that you get the
feedback and the good feedback is like a
someone is retreating my stuff but the
best kind of feedback is when the
authors or someone who knows this
stuff's comes and say hey you made a
mistake right there and then you really
learn you know and you get into this
whole thing and the third thing is that
oh I'd say buy books on even if you
don't read it all right that's that's
the kind of the best book is that it's
slightly at the edge of your
uncomfortability so if I talk about
books I'm gonna probably spend thirty
minutes just talking in the books I'm
just gonna click through so this is like
a key book I started with and right now
I'm kind of working through this one I
wouldn't recommend it right away about
this is pretty good book um just a few
words on this one if this one was out I
probably use this to go through a lot of
concepts instead of they're learning how
scale but still do the house scale book
is pretty good yeah here are some of the
books I use probably to kind of like go
through the blog stuff yeah I use this
sometimes of the reference so this one
also is a pretty good introduction it's
a little too like wordy so like the
first few chapters are pretty good and
then I skip over the other other one so
let's this is kind of like a lot of
overlap with the the Daniels stuff so
let's think about what we do as a
programmer right so we have this stuff
called problem don't hang the actual
real world so called like car insurance
restaurant whatever you do and the stick
figure right there is a domain expert
and we in the middle we construct some
sort of a model of the real world that
can somehow feed it into the computer so
we can't always always think about the
learning process and the communication
of what's in the middle of what we can
kind of construct and then that computer
thing and one way of thinking about are
like sci-fi movies is that you know you
can somehow express some of the time
paradox sci-fi movies using the
libraries like you pass the message
around and you have this basically
anytime there's a time concept involved
or you get into this big mess so another
way this is kind of like what the whole
talk
is that you can construct the data model
that's independent of the time sequence
or the time axis and take the snapshot
of the data so like example will be like
the time machine and Mac backup right
but you have that's exact staff sort of
what happened and if you can express
your model in the data type and connect
these two data types using operators
essentially you're creating the mini
algebraic system that you can feed it
into computer but at that point you can
almost think of computer as the
evaluator of the whole lambda calculus
thing this is kind of like a new way and
the really interest or thinking and the
one benefit of this is that
automatically what you do here you can
deduce what's going on at every single
time point of the time so the debugging
becomes really easy and that the every
single level from the high level all the
way down to the you know tiny expression
it becomes composable because everything
is a module basically so we can kind of
think of scholars dead of getting there
so what is cause that so if you go to
the website scholars dad would say
library for functional programming in
Scala so I'm gonna steal a little words
from Josh's book yeah
and I think his take is the functional
is actually programming with expressions
right so you're constructing expressions
and in Scala I think is the key point
that's slightly different from just
thinking in functions that the Scala
gives you the type system so it's
actually programming with expression
making better use of the type system and
I'm gonna kind of focus on this and to
understand this you have to understand
currently go into this concept of
soundness what soundness is a concept
from logic that says a argument is valid
and also the arc the premise of the
argument is true so let's think about on
our particularly valid argument that's
not true or the Wikipedia article I
found was the
all cups are agreeing Socrates is a cup
therefore Socrates is agreeing that
logical connection is valid logically
but the premise of that you know logic
is not true so it's a valid but unsound
argument so a type system you can kind
of consider it as a lightweight proof
system in which you are basically
excluding certain bad behaviors anyone
know who said this the method for
automatically checking the absence of
certain iran-us behaviors yes so let's
think about soundness so double quote
one equals equals one this compiles in
Scala 210 or 211 as false so in my
opinion this should not even compile
because I think this is a good example
of a valid argument you have two inputs
a and B in this case single quote one
and one and then you're trying to get
some bullying out of this but it's
unsound because you're now comparing
things that will never ever be true
right so in my opinion equality should
be expressed as a function of two things
that's a and B or a1 and a2 that comes
from the same type so this is what
scholars add basically this is what
scholars it defines equality as and you
can basically deduce the triple equals
operator from this and you can import
scholars add and the big scholars that
basically imports the older goodies and
the type class instances and all these
things that you can basically get it
automatically if you want to get a
piecemeal there are other ways to do it
but basically you can see double quote
one triple equals one and this doesn't
compile so this is immediately a win and
any programming it doesn't really matter
if
you do the whole functional style purely
on or somewhere in the middle from the
object oriented towards functional you
can use this to strongly enforce the
other type so before I get into more the
type class thing or talk a little bit
about the expression problem so imagine
you have a dinner table for about the
language designers and then you know
that one guy says okay I just came up
with this language that does a plus B
that supports integer and what do they
normally talk about is that they're
complaining that you know people are
sending us poor requests are messing
with our source code and you know it's
completely dirty I don't even want to
use it and this guy is sending like one
that does the multiplication and the
other guy is sending the one that does
the double so expression problem is an
attempt of basically creating a system
in which you don't mess with the source
code of the original but you can append
either a data type or a function without
breaking the static type safety so that
means no recompilation or no casting and
in a way you can think of it as it's
essentially statically typed plug-in
system right this could be useful so
this is what type of class gives us with
the implicit in scholars so before you
even bother learning scholars ed this is
really powerful concept you really
really learn because that's what
scholars that provides us is the a lot
of the plug-in basically interface kind
of stuff so this type classes and in
places you should really don't know this
called so kind of relates to the whole
concept is if it's useful give it a type
so don't use like string and all that
stuff so if you basically extend this
idea all the way down to the behaviors
and different things on so that gets to
the you know a little bit of a repeat
but so there's different ways of
thinking about the polymorphism and this
is the parametric form orphism in which
you have the head a and you pass this
list this is interesting function
because this works
for any lust it can't work for a list of
integer list of apples and I actually
took this example from the NIC portal is
uh you know the scholars at introduction
it's in de zero look another way of
thinking about poor morphism is the
basically subtype polymorphism this kind
of is similar but the limitation is that
you need to have the access to the
source code right because you're
inheriting straight from the the equals
so this basically doesn't work for
solving the expression problem so the
goal here is to get here this is the ad
hoc polymorphism which you have the type
class the contract right there and then
you can derive the actual usage out of
the this part basically and you get the
you get the evidence from the context
bound and you know so let's talk so this
is a contract and in order to supply the
capability we prevent our present D or
the instance so this is how you can do
so in whew equals you can say equal da
equal and then you pass the function
that does that capability and there's a
shorthand in scholars and that's is
equal a and in order to use this like I
said you get the context bound and
they're automatically creates the whole
the evidence thing which Heather and
Daniel both talk to right so another way
of thinking is inheritance is that
you're born with a functionality where
as a type class is that you can acquire
the capability even after the the
particular data type is born so what
does scuzzy consists of are scholars
that consists of is the basically it has
the type classes for a lot of things
that's already common and you know so in
a way you can think of it as you are
acquiring the common vocabulary that you
can talk with other people and the the
instances that's useful for the existing
are data types so there's a con law
syntax is basically their lingo for ye
are he enriched my library or method
injection path
that gives you the operators and there's
really useful functional data structures
you can use and some of the more syntax
on the standard are data types so let's
talk a little bit about the again the
type class thing so for this really good
example of you know you have this
collection and you can shrink it down
into one so that's really interesting
concept I think and if you kind of pay
attention to what's passed into the fold
left so you have this thing called zero
and then you have this you're the odd
part right so if you can extract the
pattern or interface into the fold left
on you can basically extract this thing
called mode so the zero part becomes
zero and whatever you passed into the
curly brace becomes what's called a
pound so by extracting it out you don't
really have to understand what I just
said in the whole Mahanoy thing which
basically goes through go on you know
yeah you're not gonna learn monoid by
listening to this you should probably
like read the books and do the exercise
yourself but what's interesting is that
you can extract out things that can be
folded as the concept of non Oi and
you're basically extracting out the
concept of int and on top of the
addition so by doing this basically now
you can pass the sum and then list are 1
2 &amp;amp; 3 or you can say bullying you can
form or moloids by using or or or or and
and and and in this case we're using
this just comes from sources or so this
immediately like I think you've you know
in any day-to-day program you thought
man like I'd like to have this thing
that you can just like shrink it up and
then normally a lot of time is the
answer because you can then abstract out
not just bullying an integer but your
own data set that you can fold it in and
shrink it so this also provides us the
the operator you can you know build this
is a little bit of the whole you know
schools that you know things or people
use or you
whatever symbols and stuff you don't
really have to immediately use this but
once you learn the concept of them all
night and you kind of like see what it
is then you know you can think of it as
you're basically implementing a lot of
type of plus operator so like once you
learn and I kind of remind myself Oh
which type course is that one I use I
just have this page called do scholars a
cheat sheet and basically let's tile
plus one and then okay okay I'm talking
about zero and plus so once you get used
to it this is actually pretty useful so
there's this thing with more laws so
it's not just zero and the append but
you have to satisfy some laws but don't
you don't really have to memorize this
now I don't memorize this because I kind
of think of it
so again this you don't really have the
immediate you get into this but Molloy's
basically is a category that has one
object and the in order for it to be on
an object there is three axioms I needs
to satisfy which is the left are there
in the right entity identity and the
associativity and this is what pretty
much what monoid is doing so because
monad is or monoid in the category of
the endo functor it's also the same
thing so so the actual stuff I wanted to
get into more is in the so II booing for
example Scalzi introduces the some
pretty interesting stuff so if you say
you know one less than 10 and then
option 1 and even that would actually so
I think there was time that you're
thinking like you have this some sort of
bullying stuff but you want to turn it
in to the option so you can like map or
flatmap over it so this kind of extends
that stuff and one the song and the nun
is pretty interesting because like I was
saying the the whole concept is you want
to use type as the proof checking right
so the fact that the song and the nun is
using this subtype inheritance thing is
actually kind of they are not useful
because in algebraic data type
you want to think of some and none as
data that value so you want to have it
to have the type of options so you can
compare those two things so you can use
the triple equals so one that some
returns or someone that actually typed
to the option end and none does the same
thing so pretty cool stuff is like for
example if you do you know get or else
kind of stuff yeah you can do one the
song the x and y and that will basically
return the X and similar thing you can
do the Gator where else
this is map and then get where else
right and then one that Sun bar 2 gives
you the gear or else so here's some neat
trick you know you just just again you
can use this type of thing even if you
don't do the purely functional stuff so
the validation is set to be sometimes
the are kind of gateway drug into this
so imagine you're building like a
website you have to validate the first
name last name and what did I say
password right so you don't you don't
want a website that says you submit
something and it's like you know just
one page long and then you're missing a
password and you're missing out you know
the last name and one by one you have to
keep clicking to find out you want to
get this whole errors in a single shot
so if you say success Nell Nell stands
for the non empty list the non empty
list is able to basically accumulate
your air state on the left side so you
say first name okay success and you
probably don't want to use string in
real life but I'm sorry about the last
thing failed and password the password
fail so if you basically use this
applicative style thing to basically in
this case I'm just like summing these
you know strings up it basically returns
a failure that contains both that you're
lasting failed and your password failed
another common example it could be
useful in any programming will be
memoization which so in if you're doing
a lot of the functional
and you once you have tons of data the
there is situation where this branch of
the data and that branch of the data
kind of the start you know like the
duplicating itself so memorization could
be pretty useful tap type this is uh I
think it's invented by Miles Savin and
then I think Jason's all came up with a
shorter notation by using this whole
double out so this again goes back to
like type stuff if it means that right
so what does integer or double mean it
doesn't almost means and nothing right
but we use it to pass it around for all
sorts of things but if it really means
something like kilogram because in the
kilogram this international unit or a
pound or Fahrenheit or whatever you know
calories or something then you can tag
it using this thing and I think if I'm I
could be wrong but at the wrong time I
mean actually dot Java you know a
virtual machine doesn't think of it as a
type it knows it's a double it basically
complies away but when you're compiling
you know when you're typing the code
this will basically reject so in this F
F would only take integer or double
that's tagged with the kilogram in order
to do you create this kilogram amount
you put this on you basically define the
clorium function like that so this is
pretty neat function I think it isn't a
scalzi so all these were in skeleton
State this is a little more advanced
notion but yeah imagine you're making
like a functional Tetris or something
like that right the one way of thinking
about Tetris is that you have this
concept of the block and then you're
trying to make like an AI of the Tetris
which I did in another series called
your think tetrax and Scala or something
like that is you think of it as one
state so you have the state that
represents a block and then once the
rotation and the moving to the left and
right there are translation those are
basically your basic operators right and
then you're sort of forming like a mono
door like this what data type in which
one block goes into the other state
eventually would you know
want to race the road so state monad
lets you construct a series of state
transformations like left left left left
and then rotate and then all the way at
the end in here run you past the initial
state of the this is what your current
block looks like so you can basically
apply series of five or six or how many
ever state transitions and then shrink
it up into one so this is a common
enough pattern that comes up there is a
basically a data type slash Mona I think
with state Mona's so this is pretty
useful and again I think statement alec
comes up enough that if you're
constructing a bunch of case classes it
probably will be useful if you're not
even into this whole you know completely
doing a pure and using io and stuff like
that so again dr i think there's a lot
of useful stuff in scholars that but to
me the biggest win is that you think of
the world in completely different way
where you think of the programming world
in a different way because you can now
think of it as you have this state the
data type and then you can construct
certain capability based type class that
you can express your you know one move
to the other so that's all I have today
thank you
you have formats for questions I think
anyone who is a serious scholar
programmer should really buy this book
and so this is your this is a really
good introduction of the SQL YUM so
basically to me this was like the book
that I really understood like the moment
but it kind of gives you first from the
phungster to the appropriative to the
monad so I think basically by going
through a series of coding examples and
like you know funny jokes and like the
illustrations you know you kind of learn
this whole thing be this so a lot of the
category Theory books like the first few
pages pack a lot of information so this
is a little intimidating just getting in
so that's why I first recommend using
this one and this one I use in like day
19 so it uses basically a fit theory as
a basis so you're thinking more in terms
of a lot of more concrete examples for
the category so I think this book really
understood what category actually is
with this and then after I understood
that I kind of like shoved that book
aside and I moved into a lot of more
higher level stuff because that one
could be a little more useful if you're
thinking about the the problem is that
the functors and monads and all that
stuff is all the way at the end
out of these books because it's a little
more advanced so you want something
shorter you can go through so this is
the actually written by the authors of
the scholars yet so it's highly
recommended it's I think it's not in
print yet but you can get the early
access program and really are PDF and
the author's will also we'll be
presenting today this is by Josh so when
I want to read about some like implicit
or some detailed topics this is pretty
good you know I you know I go here to
kind of consult on the details and it
also talks about the use of the ripples
and the using expression kind of as the
of programming this I think even if you
may not need it I highly recommend this
book because your it kind of gives you
into the kind of like a window into what
the academia is doing and you know if
you think about like concept like types
and stuff Auden kind and stuff like that
you know this book what kind of gives
you what the kind is and stuff like that
so but by this book even if you don't
get it
I thought this is pretty good
interruption to have scale before the
other book was on so yeah so that's kind
of like the book but you know just pick
whatever book you think you know it's
kind of like fun to read I guess pick a
book you don't understand I guess it's
my point
yeah any other questions all right thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
