in fact fully occupied there is no slack
there are no idle engineers there's
nobody sitting around waiting for some
executive to have a good idea yet
executives want to believe that's true
and so the idea that we have to have
exclusive or discussion is painful but
true welcome to the real world
if we think of the intro to audience
technical leaders technical influences
how do they have that conversation with
the product leadership people in their
organization it's often a hard thing to
have right because depending on the
organization and the power structure and
whether people are excited to have that
discussion I would approach it obliquely
I would approach it sidon which is lots
and lots of questions about who it's for
and how we know we have the right metric
and what are our success criteria and
how will users judge us and what's our
rollout plan at some point to the good
product management folks and the good
folks on the business side will
eventually be embarrassed by admitting
that they have no idea who it's for why
it's important how they're gonna measure
success or how we know we're in doing a
good job and then we can all go out for
a beer or favorite beverage and ask the
question of why we're doing this thing
and that's safer atmosphere it's endemic
that some business unit will demand some
piece of technology and have actually no
metrics no criteria no KPIs for how
we're going to put it into use or know
the exact value on one item because I
want one I want one and I have budget
and if I think of IT as and I have a
piece on my website about this but I
think of IT the way I think of the
sandwich counter at the local deli shop
and I walk up I have money in my pocket
and I say I'd really like an extra large
ERP system with a side order of API
let's hold B on premise because I wanted
in the class right and I have budget for
it and there must be engineers hiding
behind the counter waiting to build the
thing I want right there image is
beautiful and I'd love to tell you I
invented to myself but I just listed
that from half a thousand conversations
with folks who feel themselves stuck in
the deli counter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
