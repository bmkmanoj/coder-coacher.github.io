programmer my day job is web
applications mostly with Python and
Django I'm actually freelance I work for
a company called energy solutions in
Oakland for the bulk of my work and
they're kind of mmm data warehousing
data mining stuff we do stuff for steady
Californian PG&amp;amp;E that's related to
energy efficiency big data sets and one
of the larger Django application that I
know of
way too many lines of code and it's been
around since before Django 0.96 so it's
one of these you know gradually evolving
kinds of things um I've been doing
Python work full-time for about five
years and before that had played one
with Python a little bit reading games
PI game and it's interesting to me how
people end up coming to Python a lot of
times it seems like there's an
interesting app or library that people
want Jango is kind of a hot one the web
framework people learn the framework but
a GUI tool like a tcl/tk so people know
the framework but then maybe are a
little vague on the language which
describe me for a little while at least
and my background I was a computer
science major and I've been doing
programming full-time for since 98
whenever whatever that makes whatever
that makes this um go ahead and pull up
this is just a page from my blog some
additional resources that we're going to
refer to and bookmark this page we
probably won't touch it too much on the
first day and but lots of references to
additional documentation and some
additional labs they were going to do
the next thing I was going to just touch
on real quickly so everybody's got
Python some version of too installed
windows by default when you install it
and we're going to be running Python
from the command line a few places if
everybody would just make sure you open
the shell on whatever operating system
you've got and type Python and make sure
you actually get into the interactive
Python show and it probably won't work
on Windows and I will help you at the
break at a Python to your path variable
okay if you'd go ahead and download the
link is up here in the browser assuming
franklin comm slash python -
fundamentals i dot PDF
that's an 80-page PDF so I'm sorry if I
I don't think I got that sent out to the
class but
or hand to review so go ahead and
download that and let's just walk
through the topics we're going to cover
while you're doing that um I hate to
hear myself talk all day so our classes
are kind of structured about half lab
and half lecture feel free to interrupt
me at any time going to be very relaxed
about our interaction I don't want
anybody to get left behind it's four
days we're going to cover about a third
of the curriculum the first day
hopefully will slow down after that but
if at any point anybody isn't clear on
anything we've got on a flex time
built-in to stop and make sure
everybody's caught up today's topics
we're going to just talk about the
basics of running your Python programs
review the interactive interpreter
running scripts make sure everybody can
do that and we'll talk about variables
and the simple built-in types for Python
discuss syntax which with Python doesn't
take very long branching and looping and
then we'll get into the advanced
built-in types that'll take us a good
chunk of the rest of the day but kind of
hope to cover all that this morning so
let's let's get started with running
Python programs and make sure that we're
all kind of set up for that everybody
tried from a command line that type
Python and they got something you should
have like three little arrows and if
you're on Windows you can also if you're
on Windows you can also run the idle
Python shell which should be under the
Start menu so if you check out the Start
menu and all programs your new Python
install up there as idle which says
Python GUI but funnily enough is
actually just a Windows wrapper around a
interactive Python show and the other
thing I should mention I guess like
Python 101 so you go to python.org the
download Python Python comm at least it
used to be with some infamous porn site
so I actually have that my host file now
not to pull up um you can actually with
a 2.7 is the newest 2x release so
anything newer than 2.5 is good yep yes
and you can download the MSI installer
which is down a little bit just scroll
down a touch and for everybody else I
think you can type the hello world is
the first quote-unquote lab here if you
pull up your PDF we're in section one
point two and just note the the basic
features of your interactive interpreter
so if you are from a language that's
less dynamic or you haven't seen a
repple loop before you just type in code
and it executes one line at a time it's
got a few niceties for when you're doing
things like defining functions and not
to execute code immediately and it
evaluates everything every expression so
if you type a string value for instance
it just prints out the string value
evaluated the expression and there's a
few built-in special variables like the
underscore variable in the interactive
shell is always the result of the last
expression that's run aside from that
Python has really rich introspection
capabilities so try typing a help and
parentheses ster and I'm going to do
this on the screen where everybody can
see while we're waiting for that one
more Python set up to run
and string is the base class for Python
strings we'll talk about that at some
point in the future but just to note all
Python objects and classes variables
instances are kind of introspective Oh
help is one of the standard ways of
looking at a Python object of some kind
and it has a nicely formatted a
description that tells you what you can
do with whatever it is that you're
looking up
it's also worth knowing about der dir
which will also look at the string
built-in which is a much more terse it
just lists the members of der and and
these are both built-ins just a couple
more things to play around with in the
interactive shell built-in function
locals tells you every every name that's
defined in the local module and there's
also a corresponding Global's that'll
tell you every name that's defined
globally not just in the local name
space and the first little lab thing to
make sure that everything was working
right was to type hello and notice that
it prints hello um throughout the class
are going to be playing in your
interactive interpreter typing in Python
code samples figuring out syntax seeing
what works and doesn't for all the labs
though we're going to edit text files
and run them with Python and so let's
make sure you can do that so if you've
got a code editor of some kind or a
plain text editor works if you're on
Windows like I said notepad plus plus is
a good choice open up a file called
hello dot PI and you might as well make
yourself a directory you're going to
work from and because we're going to
have a bunch of bunch of labs in the
same directory and hello dot PI can
contain any valid Python code I'm just
going to print hello
yes there is and we'll talk about that
in just a second
and you should be able to run your
script you've just made your text file
with Python code in it by typing Python
and hello dot PI and all the Mac people
should be able to do that for you
Windows users I am going to caucus with
you at lunch time we're going to do a
replacement console but we're actually
ready to get started now
one other way which is only I guess for
the Mac people but very common
convention writing Python scripts is a
starting with a pound shebang line that
specifies and what interpreter so if you
would type in your Python script at the
very top only applying to Mac or UNIX
people and if I could type so people
have seen that probably on Mac or UNIX
systems it specifies what program to use
to run it and if you make the script
executable you can just run it directly
then you wouldn't have to say Python
pull it up I yeah so exactly which if
you're on Mac is probably not at use
your bin Python and I'm on Ubuntu Linux
here and if you're on Windows this
doesn't work at all but UNIX style
systems let you run scripts and specify
the executable that will run them and
this is the this is the common
convention yeah so let's talk about what
we can actually put in our Python
scripts we're going to talk about the
basic types in Python and manipulating
them and kind of the one thing you need
to understand about how Python manages
variables so there's a bunch of types
when we write programs we want to do
things like manipulate strings do math
and those are our basic types Python has
strings you've already done a string
with quotes around it someone asked
earlier if there's any significance to
the quotes and you can make strings in
lots of different ways in Python and me
you can use single quotes you can use
double quotes you can use triple quotes
and there's a bunch of specifiers you
can use before any quote mark at all
that have different meanings the
significance of the different kinds of
quote marks one is just convenience if
you're going to print a string that has
a single quote in it you can't do that
that makes sense to people write a
string and surrounded by quotes and then
there's kind of a quote mark in the
middle and so Python gets confused and
doesn't understand how to parse that
line so for convenience you can put
double quotes and order is restored to
the galaxy single quote single quoted
strings will allow you to embed
characters like new lines with slash
escapes EE and triple quoted strings
won't and if you already know what that
is you know it's a useful feature if you
don't we'll talk about it here in a
little bit numbers Python numbers are
integers by default and they don't need
quotes you just type them in all your
common mathematical operations work as
you would expect them to with one
exception in Python 2 and this will trip
you up at first what do you expect to
happen when I hit enter you would think
that it would say 4.5 because that's
actually the answer and but by default
division in Python 2 works as integer
division it rounds it to an integer yes
down it's a floor if you want actual
float division one of the you want
actual float division the divisor has to
be a float type and we can specify
floats with a decimal point just like
you'd expect to arbitrary levels of
precision more or less pythons
internal display make sure a number is
Inuk
affected format so you see I typed in
2.01 and it responded with two point
zero zero nine nine nine etc this is an
artifact between going back and forth
between binary numbers and decimal
numbers it doesn't affect the precision
very much it was a built-in decimal
module in case you're doing things with
finances that need that need exact
decimal places so you need exact
representation of decimal places and we
might talk about that in the last day as
well yeah so by default it's showing the
native representation if I wanted to
constrain it I would change it to a
string and the strings have a string
formatting language that has like if you
use the printf or S printf functions in
a variety of languages C C++ Java Script
and similar type specifiers we'll talk
about that later as well so don't let
that throw you very much
and one other operator to get in there
real quick 9/2 did the decimal the % is
the modulus operator people familiar
with modulus basically the remainder of
a division operation and it's frequently
used for looping so 9 divided by 2 is
actually 4 with a remainder of 1 and
it's giving you the remainder one other
note on operations with strings the
default operator in Python is string
concatenation so this is the way to
concatenate strings with the plus sign
but it actually works just fine if you
take the plus sign out the assumed
operator is actually plus which is
concatenation for Strings floats we're
skipping over complex
but that's our basic types strings
numbers and numbers can be integers or
floats and then here on the first day we
throw out what makes Python kind of
interesting special different probably
than languages that you've worked with
people familiar with the labels hmm
static typing dynamic typing strong
typing weak typing okay so in other
languages that you may have programmed
in you have to pre declare your
variables right you say VAR int X or a
char star xxx string buff you say what
the variable is going to contain the
type of it so Python doesn't have that
concept at all you don't pre declare
variables and which means that it is
dynamically typed and these are
important time to write them on the
board so a lot of languages I've heard
people say Java C C++ are statically
types to declare a variable you specify
what kind it is and maybe how much
storage space it's going to use
beforehand Python is dynamically typed
so just saying X is equal to string
creates a variable that's equal to the
quoted string you don't have to worry
about pre determining how much space
it's going to take up or what kind it is
and you can say X is equal to 5 a little
later on and this is not an error as far
as the language is concerned it's
dynamically typed there's a related
concept strong versus weak typing and
don't be confused by the fact that I've
written it tying up its orthogonal
concept in some ways strong versus weak
typing is basically whether the language
implicitly handles changes of type for
you or not so as an example and many
languages let you use all sorts of
variables in a boolean context you can
say if X and X can be a string it can be
a number can be a list it can be an
array and it will come up with some sort
of true or false value for you that's
really useful that's an example of weak
typing in action
it sometimes is a big gotcha languages
like JavaScript the Equality operator is
really hard to a Matt to manage because
you can compare two objects of different
type and the
time will automatically figure out what
types they ought to be to compare them
so you compare a number zero to a string
zero and it'll say I think you're doing
string comparison here so I'll put
quotes around the number on the left
hand side and yes these two things are
in fact equal
that's weak typing strong typing on the
other hand requires that you manage the
types of your variables yourself and
while python does have support for
evaluating things in a boolean context
it is strongly typed it's dynamic and
strongly typed it's kind of this column
here which means some languages will
automatically let you do this I have a
string hello plus the number four and
Python says hey hang on you're making
some kind of mistake I have a string and
an int I don't know how to add those two
things and if you want to treat it a
string concatenation you have to specify
yourself manage the types of your
variables yourself and in this case I'm
converting my number to a string so it's
dynamically typed there's no pre
declaration you can change the types of
your variables at any time but it is
strongly typed the type of your
variables does matter as we'll see
and then a couple of quick notes on
internals so you may be used to
languages that lets you manage your
memory use for instance you pre-allocate
how large a string variable is and
Python doesn't really let you do that it
in fact gives you very few tools for
managing your memory it has a reference
counting garbage collection in the
default implementation it does give you
a few things for looking at your
variables and let's try a couple of
those out so everybody that statement
line 23 makes sense I have a variable
whose name is X and I set it equal to I
signed it a value that's a string hello
ID is a built-in function and this is as
close as Python comes to pointers and
references if you use that from other
languages it's depending on
implementation more or less telling you
where in memory it is storing this
particular variable and interestingly
you'll notice that the ID for two
variables in a row is exactly the same
the runtime engine is able to say I have
two variables they're both pointing at a
immutable variable type and so I'm going
to have them both point to the same
thing you can't access these pointers
you can't change them you can't do
Python or you can't do pointer
arithmetic in Python but it does let you
check and peak on what it's doing under
the covers this is the other important
concept to get from day one okay and
you'll have to put up with my crappy
illustrations here but variable
assignment when you do variable
assignment you don't have to worry about
references and pointers you do have to
worry about mutable versus immutable
types in Python and the difference is
mutable types can be changed and
immutable types can't be changed
five integers are an immutable type in
the sense that five always is a five you
can't make five be something different
and variable assignment in Python works
by labeling when I say X is equal to
five like I did down here what the
Python runtime engine has basically done
is put a 5 in storage and added a tag to
it that has the name of my variable when
I said it added a tag to the exact same
variable and why can it add a tag to the
same variable 5 is immutable it's fine
if both x and y are pointing at the same
value because that value cannot change
so let's talk about some mutable types
confusingly to people from other
languages strings in Python are
immutable so I can do the same ID thing
and actually your strings aren't
guaranteed to be in turn to the same
location but they may well be
it means this value won't ever change
we're guaranteed that five is five and
it doesn't even make sense to your mind
to think how can I change five but this
will make it a little bit clearer what
if the value I had was a string hello
and I said X is equal to hello and that
means it puts a tag upon a particular
location hello lots of other languages
have mutable strings so I could in
another language change this e to an i I
can't do that actually this string is
immutable I can create new strings I can
create copies of strings but I can't
change a string once I've created it and
that also allows Python to enter in all
strings to the same location and if I
put another variable assigned to the
same constant string it'll probably end
up pointing at the same memory location
nope
it knows Python knows what kinds of
variables are immutable and when you
create them it does different things
based on whether they're mutable or
immutable so last example here looks so
jumping ahead just slightly let's talk
about lists this will be our first
mutable data type the syntax for it is
square braces and a comma separated list
of items in this case I'm putting a
comma separated list of integers and I
have a list we'll talk about all the
things that you can do with lists in
just a little bit but lists are mutable
I can say and that's assigning to the
one position of my list a new integer 9
and it changed the list in place and
what that means is if I say X is equal
to a list of 0 and 1 and Y is equal to a
list of 0 and 1 the Python runtime
engine does something different than it
did with just integers or strings it
doesn't apply the same label it doesn't
apply to different labels to the same
variable to the same value because it
knows that the value could change so it
actually creates two separate lists and
apply two separate variables to them and
again yeah this isn't something that you
can change but it is something that you
need to be aware of and there's a bunch
of kind of gotchas coming from other
languages that we'll see as we go along
just all the concepts out here early
you're guaranteed that if you do an ID
of X and an ID of Y that they'd be
pointing to different spots they really
are different variables
and the other kind of basic type that I
hadn't yet mentioned is boolean so we've
done numbers which are integers and
floats strings and boolean z' Python has
two built-in boolean z' true with a
capital t well you can kind of think
about strings as containing more than
one variable and lots of other languages
let you assign to a particular index in
a string and python lets you look at the
indexes of a string but you can't change
them you can't do in-place editing of a
string basically you have to compose a
brand new one
and the whole mutable immutable
distinction plays into variable
assignments so my line is 39 and 40 here
I made a variable called X it's pointing
to a list and then I made a new variable
called Y and assigned it X what's the
Python runtime doing here
I changed X and that also changed Y yeah
and again I don't want to get confused
by saying reference with the implication
of any sort of pointer stuff going on
but the first statement I did made a tag
called X and assigned it to a list the
second statement
y is equal to X says the value of the
variable X gets a new label put on it
that's why say that again so it is still
mutable mutable and immutable is
determined by the data type and has
nothing to do with how its assigned and
in this case since this is a mutable
variable I've got two tags on it if I
change it by using one tag the other tag
will see the changes it doesn't make
sense when you come back to this context
to say how do I change five if I say X
is equal to 5 y is equal 5 X is equal to
6 I didn't change this value I took the
tag X and put it on a different value
someplace else and so Y will still be
equal to 5 that makes sense and and we
kind of automatically think through that
with integers
I say X is equal to 5 and y is equal to
5 and then I say X is equal to 9
nobody really expects Y to be equal to 9
like that I changed the 5 itself into
something different because it itself is
an immutable variable that kind of
instinctively makes sense to us but in
Python strings as well are immutable
which is the only surprising one and our
immutable types are lists and
dictionaries that we'll talk about in a
little bit but let's finish up boolean's
and a little bit more syntax first and
so boolean zai said that there were two
predefined values for true and false and
that's it those are the only things that
are actually true or actually false
there are a variety of operators that
work on true and false like you would
expect there's equals equals people
familiar with this operator from other
languages
it's an equality check to the thing on
the left hand side is it the same as in
some sense the thing on the right hand
side and if I can type here
it just no it's not you can do it
without but Python syntax there's a
Python is actually very anal about the
look of the code for reasons we'll
explain in a second and but generally
the convention is to leave spaces around
operators and there's actually a big
long list of how to write beautifully
formatted Python code there's also an
operator in addition to Python is case
case sensitive yes
ah
do it
which you actually can't use Derrick
lien of boolean context there's an odd
operator there's an is operator which
you can use in if statements although
you can't directly evaluate them boolean
context there is equals and not equals
and there's the concept of truthiness so
we mentioned earlier strong and weak
typing and the idea that you can
implicitly evaluate some things in
different contexts Python if you cache
things to boolean like a number or
return either true or false and it will
do some implicit casting for you in if
statements for instance branching
statements there's a table in your
curriculum on page 6 of truthiness and
only true and false really are equal to
true but lots of things are kind of true
the-- so 0 evaluates to false 1 or any
other number evaluates to true
it isn't actually true
so true versus true fee if I say is nine
equal to true it is not only true is
true only false is false but can I
convert the value nine into a true or
false value yes I can and it's true can
I convert the value zero it's false
every other number is true including
negative one so if you're coming from
another language that has slightly
different semantics for integer values
that might throw you strings
yeah so go back to line 61 I asked is
nine actually true and it's not the only
thing that's true is true and if you do
a comparison say if my variable X equal
equal true your variable X better
contain a boolean that is true but if
you cast it to a boolean type it'll look
at the content and say oh yeah there's
there's a number there so I'll treat it
as though we're true well and the next
thing we're to talk about is branching
so if and else statements and this is a
good time to mention basic python syntax
so what is the number one thing that
people hate about the language Python
anybody have any guesses really enough
it's also the number one thing people
love about the language Python
indentation denotes blocks and this
really bugs some people so you're coming
from C C++ Java used to putting braces
around blocks so you have an if
statement the body of the if statement
is denoted by curly braces opening
closing curly braces you have functions
the body the function is denoted by open
and closing curly braces Python denotes
function bodies if statement bodies any
sub statement by indentation no curly
braces which makes it important that
your indentation remain consistent it
also denotes all multi-line statements
with an ending colon so I'm going to do
a an if statement this is an if
statement if X colon colon ends a
multi-line statement and it means the
statements below must be indented Python
doesn't care how you indent if you want
to put a single space that's fine if you
want to put a tab that's fine as long as
you're consistent Python programmers are
not so forgiving and we demand that you
use for spaces as a tab in your favorite
editor don't mix tabs and spaces because
that leads to all sorts of ugliness and
most editors that are set
Hanako by default insert four spaces as
a tab if you prefer tab actual tab
characters you can use them but at some
point someone else will edit your file
and use spaces and you'll have different
levels of indentation and Python will
complain and you'll be confused so an if
statement here and you'll notice on my
interactive console when I hit enter I'm
still indented it's going to let me put
multiple lines it's got little dots
beside it if I was in a I'm using
ipython by the way which is a more
convenient interactive console but the
same thing applies to the default
console the dots there are allowing me
to either indent or hit enter and if I
hit enter now I've got a syntax error it
expected some indented lines underneath
the multi-line statement if I indent and
if I hit enter again when I've got dots
I'm back to the regular console which
means that the previous code now is then
executed and look at my if statement
there are no parentheses around the if
condition again coming from other
languages you might be used to that
they're optional there are occasional
use for a couple of reasons we'll talk
about later but they're optional
I didn't say if x equals true
which I know for sure would always be
false because I assigned X a number but
I did say if X and if X is something
that we'd be truth II it'll print so if
X is coercing X to a boolean type
I don't explicitly say I have to say if
bool X and I'm not doing any comparisons
here how is it is it cut off
and do this
sorry about that I've got to monitor up
here and it's it's good on this one okay
everybody can see what I'm doing and
maybe you're trying this out on your
console yourself so our most basic unit
of branching is conditionals if and else
if and else if you've used other
programming languages Python doesn't
really contain any surprises here except
that else if is typed a LIF all one word
so be a typical if/elif/else
tree and you've probably all done this
but we can go line by line through this
to evaluate so X is equal to 1 and
looking through our code and this
reminds where I use the other one
because I've got line numbers built in
if X what is that statement do say that
louder you Lee it it doesn't say is X
equal to true it says if I cast X to a
boolean would it be true or false so
it's doing that cast for us implicitly
here it's checking the truthiness of X
and if X is true the-- which X was equal
to 1 so X is true the-- it would print
if which it did in fact print if right
there
it would then pass down to the Elif
condition and it would not execute the
check so if an elephant ition is Matt
met it skips the else ifs and the else
right people familiar with out from
other programming languages if I wanted
the X equal equal true to run no matter
what I just make it a simple if instead
of an else if but else if and if our
exclusive and let me switch back to my
high python for future stuff how do i
what
so if I want
if I want X not to be around it's kind
of what you're asking right I mentioned
locals which shows you all the variables
that are in the local namespace and I
just ran that function and it returns me
a key value pair of all of them and I've
got x equals 1 here in the namespace
setting it to a value 1 actually cleared
out and there is no integer value to
which I can set it there is a built-in
nil value in pass
I'm on page 11 there's a lab and you can
go ahead and edit the hello a file that
you already have created that already
runs is going to use the date/time
function that's built in and some if and
else if statements basically to check
whether it is morning or afternoon and
it has the code there to get that far on
page 11 of your curriculum but let's go
ahead and do four point seven which says
fix hello to apply to handle evening and
the midnight case so evening first the
script looking at it line by line the
first line we haven't talked about this
at all but it is importing the date/time
module and we'll get to modules and
namespaces in a bit one of the cool
features of python it's getting the hour
of the current time with a built-in
date/time function it's checking to see
if the hour is less than 12 and if it is
it's creating a time of day variable set
to the string morning else it's saying
the time of day is set to afternoon you
should extend it to work for evening and
also for midnight which should make you
wonder what the hour value of midnight
is and to do this lab let's just
remember the stuff we've already talked
about
it is yes it is Python is known as the
batteries included language it has a
really extensive standard library to do
tons and tons of stuff and it has a
richly expressive syntax for managing
modules and packages of code and you're
exactly right there is a module called
eight-time that defines a bunch of
different functions like date and time
date/time is one of them so we're
importing the date/time module from the
date/time package here and stuff we've
already talked about if you're curious
about how date/time works you could use
the help function on date/time and it'll
tell you all about it it's a class that
you can initialize with a date it's got
some built-in methods you can ignore all
the methods that start with two
underscores we'll talk about those in a
while those are special but after that
it's got a bunch of methods like time
and it tells you what the time method
does here in the help listing if you are
using a nice editor so the default
Python editor is not a particularly nice
editor I'd encourage you if you're on
Mac to install ipython if you're on
Windows you're using idle which has some
of these features built in but I'm using
ipython here so I'm still in the
standard one I'm using ipython here
and ipython uses pythons introspective
capabilities to do nice rich
tab-completion so I type date/time dot
which is how you access a member and I
hit the tab key and it shows me
everything I could possibly start typing
and I start typing it shows me what's
left tell them that's a built in method
that I can call and what it does if you
can upgrade yourself to ipython on your
Mac systems I'd strongly encourage it if
you're using Windows I'd strongly
encourage using idle and said of the
built-in Python shell to play with
thanks and we'll take a break for 10
minutes and come back and you can work
on the lab and I'll kind of circulate
and see where everybody is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
