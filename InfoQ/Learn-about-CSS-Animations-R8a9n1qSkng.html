Michael Bellini
I run feta and run products and
marketing there for what since she does
is basically create JavaScript
frameworks and tools and connected
services so we have sent you touch which
is a JavaScript based framework for
building cross mobile applications and
heavily leverages CSS transitions
styling and a lot of css3 and html5
stuff I'll give you just a tiny look at
it but most of the time we are also
working on XJS which is a desktop
JavaScript framework that just came out
in version 4 I don't know if anyone uses
it is it's pretty popular so without
further ado I will dive into tonight's
topic which is CSS animations so I'm
going to be stuck behind this side
rather high desk all the time but I feel
like I'm in church actually it's weird
okay so tonight we're going to talk
about CSS animations and a little bit
about SVG and smile or smell everyone
says it's supposed to be a smile but I
think it should be pronounced smell so
when you're looking at actually before I
go to this yeah when you're looking at
web animation choices you're basically
looking at six choices right you're
looking at animated images animated gif
or if you have an Firefox only audience
animated pngs you're looking at
JavaScript animation you're looking at
canvas which is available in html5
capable browsers you're looking at SVG
and smil you're looking at CSS
animations are you looking as flash so
on the desktop particularly if you're
addressing kind of edge browsers or
you've got a limited audience you have a
ton of choices and a lot of these are
you know pretty good canvas has a
strength JavaScript animation has a
strengths animated image it's not so
much but when you look at the animation
scorecard overall you can see that if
when you choose these things you
basically kind of look at you know how
ubiquitous is the browser how compact is
the format that is being delivered so is
it a low download load basically how
high performance is that what are the
range of effects that you can create
with the animation technique is it
scriptable and is it web native and as
you can see there's a lot of strange in
the weaknesses look like you're doing
animated images obviously it's support
animated gifs are supported everywhere
but they're not particularly compact you
can't script them and the effects are
pretty limited right it's just frame
after frame after frame if you're using
smell smell is basically not working
really anywhere except except Firefox 4
which has done a fantastic job on smell
and SVG support but they're really the
first ones out with good support there
it's a very compact format it is fairly
high performance it has a decent amount
of effects
it's very scriptable and it is web
native in fact can anyone well that's
one of the questions for the end and I
won't to ask it now because you'll guess
but and css3 animations you know pretty
ubiquitous particularly on mobile you
know has been around for about 3 years
since Apple first put it out in Safari
pretty compact
great performance particularly on mobile
the effects are decent but has
limitations scriptable but not as 50
other things I'll talk about that you
know in as part of the presentation
obviously web native JavaScript and CSS
you know can get pretty wordy the
performance is good but can be kind of
jerky and jittery and I'll go into that
the reason for that the effects are
pretty good it is obviously scriptable
because it is JavaScript web native
canvas a little bit limiting browser
availability not particularly compact
you know it is a pretty low-level API so
you get to write a lot of code to get to
do effects performance fantastic on ie 9
and fantastic on
reasonable on safari reasonable on
firefox and basically not workable on
mobile fantastic effects you know it's a
low-level bit oriented format
highly scripted that's how you do it but
native flash you know pretty ubiquitous
except for the major exception which is
iOS and mobile really actually in
general very complex right they've done
a lot of work to shrink the format down
as much as possible
reasonably performant except the mobile
that's one of the reasons why it's been
kept off mobile so long
fantastic effects you know very
scriptable not web native when you go to
a mobile web animation you actually end
up with a lot fewer options right you
can do animated gifs great but they're
probably the worst form of animation you
can do javascript has timing issues and
it's pretty jittery and i'll go into the
javascript i'm luciene just a second you
know stephanie can smell not available
at all and Android 2.x so it's just
available on honeycomb it's actually not
bad on honeycomb but also kind of
limited support in general for the types
of effects that are manipulable with
declarative animations canvas pretty low
performance actually the the rim
PlayBook has fantastic canvas
performance and the iPad 2 is not bad
flash obviously any iOS devices and it's
pretty low performance on the other so I
don't know if you've we tried our CSS
versus flash ads on the zoom and
we actually we just couldn't believe
that the flash the flash results were
pretty bad so so it's not pesum in tooth
for honeycomb yet so basically the the
result is is that that you're facing CSS
basically only so let's talk about
javascript timers on mobile because this
is probably the first thing that people
go to when they want to do animation on
mobile so on desktop when you and this
is these are the results from genres
eggs timer test that he put out a couple
years ago at the time the reliability of
JavaScript timers in terms of like if
you set a set interval or set timer
what's the actual real time that you get
was pretty awful but then I think partly
as a result of those tests actually the
desktop browsers became a lot better
to the point where ie nine JavaScript
animation now is like butter smooth it's
incredibly smooth but the same thing
happens it hasn't happened on mobile and
as a result that when you use JavaScript
animation using set timeout or separate
set interval on some of these phones you
get really really inconsistent results
and as a result you get pretty jittery
animations so the iPad 2 you know ten
milliseconds plus or minus 1 millisecond
that's actually fantastic and it's as
good as desktop iPhone 4 not as good 10
milliseconds but a big band of plus or
minus 5 milliseconds the playbook the
set timeout interval is our set interval
time is 30 milliseconds plus or minus 3
milliseconds so if you are using or if
you're trying to set an animation using
that you can get lower frame rates and
then occasionally you'll get spikes
where your animation just jumps to where
it should be because it hasn't been
updated smoothly blackberry torch very
very inconsistent it doesn't have a GPU
doesn't have a floating-point unit and a
fairly low powered CPU so you're looking
at 15 milliseconds basically plus or
minus 15 milliseconds that the range of
performance you get around
the mean is is pretty huge the zoom is
is worse it is 10 milliseconds plus or
minus 10 milliseconds so you've got a
huge timing range around the the middle
and Android to just slightly better than
honeycomb but it's also 10 milliseconds
plus or minus 5 milliseconds so and you
can also get very bad occasional outlier
spikes so the iPad 2 for example has a I
think 25 24 levels our 24 timers it must
do some sort of it triggers some cigars
collection event because you actually
get a massive spike like hundreds of
milliseconds in response of the set
interval so you can sort of reliably
anticipate a little bit of jitter in
your JavaScript at that point now
there's there is a proposal for Mozilla
called requestanimationframe which is
intended to solve some of these
synchronization problems between
different types of animation it also can
reduce the amount of work that your CPU
has to do if you're just trying to peg
the CPU as fast as possible with set
interval based animation so that
basically means that really for mobile
web animation today you need to look at
CSS animations fairly seriously as the
main go-to for web so what do CSS
animations look like well I've prepared
a little bit of a demo so we first got
interested at Sencha in in web
animations a lot about this time last
year when we said you know you can
probably take a lot of advertising and
just if I have Wi-Fi you know whatever
you're doing in in flash you can pretty
much sort of duplicate in CSS animations
because the kind of sprite based
animation that most people do is pretty
CSS animation friendly so in the first
one who thinks the left hand
is a flash animation and who thinks the
right one is a flash animation okay come
on guys okay I'll play it again
okay who thinks the left is CSS who
thinks the right is CSS okay yes the
left to CSS next one down let's we'll
give you another replay I'll give you
top the CSS bottom is CSS
and then you know css3 so hey not bad
good for CSS yeah other examples of so
this is a Bruce Lee quote it really
should be set to audio but if you've
ever worked with html5 audio you'll know
that it's really hard to synchronize it
with anything else so be like water
Bruce Lee
and this is using web fonts to get that
nice chunk font lots of all 3d effects
and swings
so you know pretty rich gratuitously
gratuitously fancy effects you can also
do you can't do an animation demo
without a page flip that's just the rule
so here's the ubiquitous page flip and
then one more ad because it seems like
everyone's working on ads these days and
this is actually we cracked a flash ad
and you pulled it in and you get a nice
steam effect that steam effect is
actually a css3 hack that I'll go into
and it's all made possible by the folks
that the television workshop and css3
okay get in timeout okay so that's just
the sample of like what what you can do
with CSS animations so how do you build
them well that is what we go and talk
about next so how do you build
animations it's really built on two
building blocks one is transitions so
the ability to basically tween between
properties so to go from one position to
another or one color from another or one
you know font size to another etc it has
discrete state changes so you can jump
from one to another you can also easily
move from one to another as well call it
with easing curves and transforms which
is the Four Horsemen of transforms which
are the ability to move or translate the
ability to scale to rotate and to skew
that's out in both 2d and 3d form and
I'll talk a little bit about browser
support in a minute you can also specify
the transform origin with respect to
which all these transforms are performed
so this is a super simple transition
example you know it's just an absolutely
positioned div the opacity is one top is
10 pixels WebKit transition property
opacity top we're going to move the
opacity
at two seconds we're gonna move the top
position at four seconds when I hover on
it I'm gonna change the opacity zero and
top forty five it's going to give you
something like that and we can look at
the live code I've got a jsfiddle you
know same thing basically when I hover
on it it goes down and when I hover on
it it goes back up so that's a super
simple transition example any questions
about just the basics here no
you can transition as much as you want
yep basically so it comes back up so
these are the this is a range of stuff
that you can do transition according to
the spec I actually haven't tested all
of them and I know some of them are not
transitional in some browsers things
like you know the stop position for
example is not transition transitional
but ideally you should be able to turn
the transition almost anything that you
can style there's very few things that
actually are not transitional in the
browsers so for things that are
continuous properties it basically
tweens so it will tween on a color
circle between your star color and your
end color for things that are discrete
like z-index it doesn't sort of blend
forward quickly it just literally after
two seconds it moves to the front if you
do a hover so this is you know 2 dev
divs the front div and the back div the
top is the index 1 the back is the index
0 but when you hover yeah I'm going to
move to the index to where the
transition property is a z-index
and the duration is two seconds and you
can look at sort of the live code here
two seconds until you hover I'm going
back and it flips to the front so you
can do just quick z-index flipping that
way
so next the first advanced topic which
is transition using curves now in all
the browsers are out there right now
there are easing curves so basically you
can specify how fast the transition
happens and you can do it with a couple
of built-in effects or you can actually
specify your own custom easing curve so
the default if you don't specify an
easing curve is basically it starts slow
and it ends slow so you get this nice
kind of smooth transition from one to
another linear basically doesn't even
transition so the state is tweens evenly
across the time period you can do easy
in or ease ease in ease out which is
actually equivalent to the default or
ease you do easy in which gives you a
slow start and then kind of more even
and ease out which gives you a fast
start and slow end new hot off the specs
presses in w3c CSS 3 enter draft status
so you heard it here first is step start
step end which is very exciting because
the ability to actually have
discontinuous changes in a property is
really handy before this you had to
specify keyframes that were like right
beside each other and hope that people
wouldn't notice that it actually was you
had a tiny bit of tweening in the middle
of stuff but now you can step so you can
have the transition happen at the
beginning of a time period the end of
the time period or you can actually
specify a number of steps that it takes
in between so a really cool effect and
live code
I have more space on my home monitor but
basically this is a bunch of you know
transition properties left linear
ease-in ease-out so when I hover over it
this gives you a linear progression this
gives you a ease so slow start slow end
this gives you slow start in the fast
and fast start slow end and a fast start
slow middle middle and a fast end now
that last one is a custom easing
function which I'll go to in just a
second so that is the range of easing
functions so the last one is custom
transitions so how does that happen
that happens oh right I did everything
in yeah so these are custom easing
curves and you specify a custom easing
curve with this syntax so you basically
give it four coordinates the XY of this
dot and then the XY of that dot and as
you play with things it will actually
give you a different amount of timing so
that's great how do I have a great
mental model of a cubic Bezier curve so
I don't need any help but thanks
everyone so you know you really need a
visualizer so let me reload this
okay it's still downloading I'm gonna go
to my go-to browser for SVG just in case
it is Chrome
okay somehow this changed over the
weekend let me go to animator so I
wasn't going to go to this this early
but I'm going to go to the timing
function here and so basically this is
what you you play with this is this is
our animator tool which I wasn't going
down yet but I really want to show you
that the the curves so basically you can
specify the easing you know with these
two coordinates this is P 2 X P 2 y this
is P 1 X P 2 y so you can see here that
this is slow start super fast middle
slow end and you can move these two dots
anywhere you want if you basically let
them line up it's basically linear and
then you can do like really crazy timing
functions like this
so you know the built-in ones are pretty
good going to custom easing functions
you kind of need a good reason to do
that
um those are basically transitions and
easing curves are there any questions
about kind of easing curves okay awesome
so 2d and 3d transformers you basically
have four verbs to work with translate
skew rotate and scale and out of these
four verbs you can actually get a pretty
big amount of mileage so this is the
syntax for translate and why your web
WebKit transition property all
absolutely transition generation three
seconds you you specify a WebKit
transform which is you move stuff down
by a hundred pixels and it will move
down by a hundred pixels
what and I have a fiddle for that as
well but I think it's pretty
self-explanatory now what's really
important to understand about transforms
and there's actually a bunch of things
to understand about transforms but
transforms transform the entire
coordinate grid so that when you and
nested transforms which you'll use a lot
if you're actually doing anything that
is a real sort of animation scene rather
than minor effects they accumulate so if
you you know scale something by 150% and
then want to move it by 10 pixels it's
not going to move by 10 pixels anymore
it's gonna move by 15 pixels and this
means that it's actually really
difficult to keep track of where the
heck everything is when you're doing a
CSS animation particularly if you've got
a lot of different if you're doing
custom transform oranges but if you're
wondering why your stuff is is is not
where it's supposed to be anymore
it's probably because you haven't taken
into account the fact that these
scalings
accumulate the other thing is that
translates don't change the top and left
property of an object so if you query
or left you'll be surprised stuff using
translate you will be shocked to find
that it is in it tells you it lies to
you it tells you that it was it's still
in the old position and it hasn't moved
at all so you can't trust your left and
top queries when you're using transforms
second topic on transforms transform
origins by default if you scale
something by a hundred fifty percent it
will scale it around the middle if you
don't specify a transform origin it will
it will take the middle of the Dib it's
in if you do specify a transform origin
you can specify it in either pixels or
you can specify it in percentages of the
computed size size of the current div so
if you give it one hundred five hundred
it will actually use the bottom right
corner of the block to scale things if
you give it zero one hundred percent it
will use the bottom left if you give it
a hundred comma zero it will use the top
right and if you use zero zero it will
use the top left 50 percent is the
implied default now what you can also do
is go outside the box and start to give
a transform origins that are outside the
block content and that way you can start
doing sort of crazy things like having
having it just through a rotation it'll
still just be a rotation but will
actually move through arcs any questions
about transform origins ok so why do you
use scale and translate versus dimension
or size transitions and why do you use
translate versus position transitions
there's really a couple of reasons the
first is that you can try and transition
font sizes but they typically will
because they're discrete properties they
will actually jump from one font size to
another so you'll get nine point ten
point eleven point 12.13.12
you know it kind of rear Enders the font
while it's doing the tweening it's kind
of odd the other thing is that you have
things like border radiuses shadows
strokes will Auto scale when you scale
in using a transform rather than scale
using positions if you scale using your
kind of sizes and you've got a two pixel
border the border will stay two pixels
everything else will blow up if you use
the scale the border will actually stay
in proportionately the same as the block
content why do you translate for some
position transitions well you get high
frames per second and you also get
really good sub pixel tweening from GPU
accelerations I talked about how it
doesn't affect the original page
locations for the elements that's what
you do it so 3d transforms which today
are available on desktop Safari iOS and
the rim playbook the rim PlayBook has an
awesome browser by the way it's really
it's really cool basically allows you to
arrange your 2d block content in 3d
space and there's a couple things that
it requires it requires a special WebKit
transform style called preserve 3d
without this the Z access differences
are flattened and they're projected into
the XY plane and I'll show you the
effect of that in the next slide and
you've got a couple of optional things
that you can do so you can apply WebKit
perspective which adjusts foreshortening
so it automatically puts you into a
scaling space you don't have to manually
scale things as they move away and
towards the viewer and you can adjust
that to have kind of extreme sort a
comic-book foreshortening so you can
have you know that the old fist coming
out of the comic that looks like this
big and prospective origin it will
actually adjust the viewpoints to which
the the the the perspective is is
trending so you can draw those nice
who's a guy invented in a Western
perspective
someone's gotta know this okay his lines
so some of the examples of what you can
do in 3d space I mean the most familiar
one is you know the Apple type gallery
this is just content that's that's been
arranged in the z-axis as you can see it
has pretty good perspective because the
ones that are behind are much smaller
than the ones in front and it's just
basically rotating it's a rotating div
with the the content flipped up in the
y-axis I think I've got another example
pretty well because if there's no
transforms and it doesn't understand it
you just have to make sure that you
position it correctly before for people
without that so you can have just a you
can just have literally a film strip and
then use transforms to put it into a
circle I'm you have to be a little bit
smart about it but it's not hard so
these are the effects of a 3d rotate
let's say we want to post your wall the
other nice poster walls that kind of go
back in the middle and then you approach
you at the sides if you don't use
preserve 3d and you're rotating you know
the left-hand side so basically we're
creating trying to create this effect
I love 3d examples because it's so hard
to demo so that's basically what you're
trying to do but you know it without
preserve 3d you're basically just
projecting this onto this plane and
you're projecting this onto this plane
so you're not getting the benefit of the
hard work you're doing to do at 3d
rotate so this is what you get when you
do preserve 3d and you put it in
perspective of a thousand pixels so it
starts to actually look properly 3d it's
it's it's
bowing out at both sides this is with
perspective 300 pixels and you know at
300 pixels you're starting to get kind
of a really silly effect it doesn't
really look real anymore typically
anything under about 500 pixels starts
to look a bit comic book-like so
anywhere from five hundred to eight
hundred or a thousand is pretty good by
the time you get to about 2,000 pixels
it starts to look really flat actually
and then this is with moving the
perspective origin so you've moved the
origin down so you're now looking up at
the poster wall and a little bit to the
left so you can see more of this than
that perspective origins are you can
animate those so you can actually as the
mouse moves around you can have the
poster wall sort of look different so
it's kind of cool so those are two in
the zoo and 3d transforms any questions
on on transforms I couldn't agree more
these are just tools you can use a
hammer to kill someone or to hammer in a
nail
yeah you know CSS animations don't kill
people designers do yeah it's just you
know I look upon this as the one flash
first started getting ubiquitous and
there was all these crazy flash splash
screens that really just distracted
people when you just wanted to gather
the content and you know over certainly
I haven't seen any of those in the last
five years so they kind of went to
extinct pretty quickly I have started to
see some gratuitous CSS animations out
there for sites that you really don't
need it we do a little bit of
transitions and transforms on our
website really just to bring attention
to certain things like a little wiggle
and a little pop but you got to make it
pretty subtle and it's got to be brand
appropriate as well so the question is
can you achieve section 508 and
accessibility basically requirements
using CSS animations yes because this is
all readable this is just a stylesheet
so the text is still there in regular
HTML and if you're using screen readers
or using visibility software the
accessibility software you can add your
own style sheet and you the screen
reader certainly can just read off the
content so that is the actually the
great part about CSS emanate animations
which they're just styles that the
content is still there so CSS animations
build on top of transforms and
transitions and it basically the goal of
an animation is to affect properties
during the execution of the animation
there are six elements that you can use
in an animation the first is how long
does the animation go on for and you can
chop up the animation into multiple
stages using percentages what's the
easing or the steps that I'm going to
use for each section of the animation is
there a delay it can be either positive
meaning you know delay five seconds
before you start this animation or it
can be negative meaning behave as if
this animation had started three seconds
ago you jump in at three seconds and go
forward
pause run
it's a property you can set it's pretty
buggy I wouldn't use it there's film
mode which is a little bit he's a little
bit of explanation you can set the film
mode for forwards backwards or both
forwards basically persists the end
keyframe at the end of the animation
otherwise compliant browsers are
supposed to move the object back into
its original in underlying property set
backwards basically says if you've got a
delay at the very start of the animation
I want you to jump to the first keyframe
even though you're the other play the
play state is supposed to the delay for
a couple of seconds and you can also
have normal or ultimate iterations
normal basically says repeat the
animations x times alternate says repeat
the animations but you do it in Reverse
every other time so CSS animations
though here we go
I explained it so this is how you write
a CSS animation you go at WebKit
keyframes and soon hopefully you know at
- Mo's and at - Oh an - at - MS you name
your animation move so you can actually
reuse the same animation pattern across
multiple multiple stylesheet are
multiple objects and this basically does
a four stage transform from 0 0 to 30 0
to 30 3200 and you you you refer to or
you activate the animation by going
WebKit animation named move in the
particular style or a class for that
object so in this case it'll move it
over will move down move back the
iteration count one timing function
linear now you can sort of play with
this a little bit
and
do other things so you can specify you
know if you want it to steps
step
okay I got this in tests wrong would you
get the idea so that's the basics of of
animations yeah sure did - Papa Papa -
five seconds
delay
sorry five seconds this is Chrome I
think it works there see jump to the
first so that's what the delay does yep
yep
yeah film mode was probably it feel much
forward
ah back okay so you know ideally you
want this to be scriptable from
JavaScript here's where CSS animations
aren't that great
it basically gives you three events that
you can listen to animations start
animation end and animation iteration it
also gives you a incredibly unhelpful
function called window get computed
style which returns the current
transformation matrix so I know you've
all been waiting to practice your linear
algebra I know I've been so thank you
browser manufacturers and spec makers
for making us relive math 21b so this is
what you get when you query get computed
style you've on on something that has a
2d transform it basically you get a
matrix that represents the current
product matrix product of all the
applied transforms so you've done
separate rotates or skews etc they will
not give you back you know rotate you
know 20 degrees they'll give you this
very helpful matrix back so you
basically need to do some linear algebra
and if anyone wants like a little
JavaScript library that can write you
have something to extract meaningful
data from get computed style will be a
nice thing you know this you know this
is how you do a counterclockwise rotate
it'll give you the the cosine of in
radians the negative sign in radians etc
that's how you kind of it work back from
what the rotation was this is a scale by
basically it takes the various skews
rotates scales etc and lund you see them
to fewer values so it's actually hard to
extract what the current scale is for
example now you can try and go interpret
it by just figuring out well if I'm two
seconds after I triggered the animation
I should be here but if you're not there
this is the way that you you figure it
out so animations are awesome but they
do have limitations they're essentially
sprite based right you have a block you
can do stuff to that
block you can move it you can scale it
you can rotate it you can move it behind
other stuff you can skew it but that's
it
they're pretty verbose but the good news
is that they're gonna compress down
nicely when you serve you content on
your gzip enabled web server everyone
does have their webserver gzip enables
right right Steve suitors for high
performance websites
I shall gzip my content right there's no
guaranteed synchronization with audio or
other mechanisms so you can trigger
stuff off at the same time and just hope
your timers work out but you can't
resync stuff get computed style
obviously not a friendly format and then
you can personally having you've done a
bunch of these animations personally you
know I where's the transform origin like
stuff is not working properly
where's why is it rotating in that weird
way because after you nest a couple of
these things and they're moving around
and scaling you just completely lose
track of the of the start so you can't
use it to do animate or deform shapes
themselves beyond a simple skew you
can't do progressive drawing and you've
got no motion blur which I know all you
flash artists and developers will say
you can't do an animation without motion
blur man so but you can't without SVG
which does have directional blurs and
you can actually see it live in Firefox
4 which is awesome so let's talk about
some cool animation hacks that you can
do because you're playing with the rest
of css3 typically when you're doing
animations highlights and lens flares so
because you've got gradients and you've
got now got an alpha Channel in in
ingredients you can do that nice effect
you know in in CSS you can also do shape
blurs transparent fills text shadow blur
in a transform you can also do movement
on a curve and I will attempt to show
you a couple of those things
in action so this animator you're seeing
a really late alpha so if it crashes
it's not my fault so here we've got
basically three divs nested in in each
other a top-level container and then a
next level container we're going to
attempt to show you the crazy stuff you
can do by hacking timing curves into
motion curves so I'm going to move this
top-level container here in this
keyframe over here and I'm going to move
this container down here so when we play
it back it's going to look like that now
the cool thing is that I can play with
the easing curves of each of these
things and make the motion
pretty crazy that's for that one and
that's for this one let's see and you
can start doing sort of motion on the
path by varying the timing curves that
both of your keyframes are working with
which is kind of neat so that's a way of
hacking motion on ik on a path even
though you only have linear transforms
to work with in CSS by nesting basically
to differentially times divs hacking
awesome shapes so you don't have blurs
to work with in in css3 but you do have
shadows that you can blur so what you
can do here is something pretty fund
which is you can set the color of the
type to transparent you can put a stroke
in let's say a two pixel stroke sorry
I'm not gonna put a stroke and you can
put a shadow and you can make the shadow
and you want let's make it
yellow and then you can blur the shadow
let's do a 20 pixel blur or 15 pixel
blur and then you can do a skew or
rotate
on the blur so you can do a 45 to V blur
and you can actually sort of play around
with these crazy blurs so that if you
want to do things like a steam effect
like we did in our in our think that's
steam I want to show it to you again
because it's kind of neat I close it
that steam was basically a two and a
five shadow blurred and skewed and kind
of differentially rotated so you didn't
actually even know that it was a two or
five the cool thing is that if you
combine this web fonts and
non-traditional fonts you can basically
get sort of any blur shape that you want
which is crazy so crazy it's crazy CSS X
so where can you use animations today
CSS animations you can use it basically
well rad is ie
that's shock to everyone I know Chrome
10 doesn't have 3d transforms it sort of
does but not really
SMIL is kind of an amber alert stage in
chrome 10 Safari five doesn't have
inline SVG or WebGL Firefox fours is
pretty good but it doesn't have
animations or I think reflections or 3d
transforms are still missing
iOS 4:3 doesn't have smile or inline SVG
but your PlayBook honeycomb have all the
rest at least you know nominally Chrome
versus Safari there they both support -
WebKit but they have a couple of
limitations if a frame is missing a
value that you're animating Chrome will
try and interpolate that Safari will
actually go back to the intrinsic
property which is sort of the correct
way to do it
although the spec is not entirely clear
so that's one of the things that they
rewrote if you have two transforms on an
object so far our chrome will try and
transition a Safari will only apply the
last transform which is correct because
you know that's the way CSS works chrome
will drop anti-aliasing and has no GPU
acceleration for the most part so far
a mobile safari do a pretty good job of
retaining anti-aliasing and have GPU
acceleration I think it's because
particularly mobile safari just
basically snapshots the screen and moves
the image around under the covers the
PlayBook has your kind of Safari quality
animations as well so that's it for CSS
animations are there sort of questions
about CSS animations before I do a
really really quick SVG and smell thing
okay so SVG and smell who knows SVG okay
SVG XML format drive you crazy because
you keep on forgetting to your closure
you know close your close your tags it
does maintain fidelity but zoom it's a
vector graphic format it's really rich
you can do complex paths shape strokes
all that stuff smell is also a rich
complex language it has great layout
capabilities you can embed multiple
media you can actually synchronize
everything together it's widely used but
in very unusual places like smell is
actually the format for doing mms for
rich texts it's in Netflix and Netflix
playback viewer and a couple other
places I believe I've heard that but it
has pretty spotty support the thing that
it does have that you want is that it
has shape animation you can do a lot of
other stuff in CSS animations but the
one thing you can't do is alter the
shape so the rule here is that from and
two shapes have to have the same number
and order of path types lines arcs
quadratic and cubic Bezier curves
basically you can transform that into
that using smell and SVG and this is
what a shape deformation looks like you
basically do the obligatory name spacing
you have to ID your group you create a
path with a fill and a stroke and then
the drawing is actually the D equals you
move to 200 200 and then draw a line
from 28 100 to 100 200 to to 200 that's
after etc this
at the end just basically closes the
curve and then you do the animation by
basically giving the same set but with
different values separated by semicolons
so what this looks like shape animation
is you know this is what it looks like
when it's working correctly which is
something moving around from one to
another it's actually pretty smooth
across all the browsers the issue here
of course is that the phillotson
animating correctly in general there's a
lot of even though something like a
moderniser will say yeah smells there
use it chrome actually is pretty spotty
support so when you go to Firefox which
has you know really good smells an SVG
support you get this which is how the
fill is supposed to properly animate but
it's a key missing part of CSS
animations and it's what whereas ouija
can do really good stuff
other stuff that you can do in SVG is
just purely through a declarative floor
mats and stuff like this if you want to
view the source of this you know it's
pretty actually easily understandable in
smell you can reuse stuff pretty easily
by just referring to a annex link and
you can pick up smell via the relevant
parts of smell and SVG I think in about
a day and a half from scratch and it's
probably worth doing although it's
actually far easier to do something like
Raphael so this is someone else so this
is what you get when you do kind of an
insane amount of SVG animation this is
not flash it's just using your path
deformation this is a guy called Daniel
Rodriguez who's in Venezuela and it's
super cute
am I going
am I going okay go back yeah okay come
on get the browser get the mouse get the
mouse get the mouse so fine with SVG now
the easier way by far than learning Ross
mill and SVG is to use something like
Raphael or use X draw from XJS basically
animates instead of using smil
properties to animate stuff you just use
JavaScript to change SVG properties
directly and Raphael actually is an
abstraction there on top of SVG and VML
so you can use it on top of Internet
Explorer as well and a couple of the
things that are neat there you know
this is export charting this is using
SVG because we're on Chrome and you get
really smooth animations radar charts
and this you know we use vml on ie6 and
97 and 98 so this actually works across
browser but that's kind of neat and then
Raphael demos are pretty awesome
so we we sponsor the development of
Raphael as well you can download so you
can do kind of neat stuff with Raphael
what are the other kind of cool stuff
yep so you can move stuff around very
smooth very high frame rate and the good
part is that most of the stuff will work
on mobile as well so you can get smooth
animations on mobile cross browser
except for Android - okay
so cease animations so summary is that
CSS animations are here
SVG shape animation is near-term usable
you really do need to test it everywhere
if you're going to use smell easier to
do things in SVG like motion on the path
versus CSS you really have to do a lot
of cross browser testing smell
translations are incorrect in chrome
negative text offsets are ignored in
Safari filters only work on the playbook
and Firefox 4 there's a lot of things
you need to test with if you're going to
dip your toes and smell probably better
off to use your favorite framework you
know tools can help I would not advise
anyone to hand craft SVG paths you
should just throw them and Inkscape and
then extract them and that's basically
the state of CSS animations and SVG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
