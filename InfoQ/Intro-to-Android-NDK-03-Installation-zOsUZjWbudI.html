will use in decay or I guess when the
quite next question is how do we get
started
so again on D deranged calm under the
SDK tab there's a section on the and
decay right here and so this actually
offers links to download a version of
the NDK in this case the actual latest
version is seven B or are seven BS it's
called for the particular host platform
that will be developing on so I've
already downloaded one for my Mac
operating system so I'm just going to go
and expand it I'm going to go over here
into my terminal type tar jxv F then
download which is where it is and then
Android NDK hit enter and you'll see
that it'll essentially uncompress the
sources the toolchains
sample code documentation a whole bunch
of things into the Android NDK folder I
also like to create a symbolic link to
this folder on my machine and then use
or add the the final pseudo directory
into my path so that I can execute shell
scripts from within the NDK directory
essentially from anywhere on the on the
on my system so here's what I'll do I'll
type Ln - as Android NDK and the K of
course on you know Windows environment
this is not something you would do
but I'll what what is useful is to be
able to essentially add NDK to your path
in this case what I have is the
somewhere here there should be in the K
and they can add it to my path
I guess it's right here okay if you
haven't done so you may want to consider
doing that because it will come in handy
later
but ultimately we now have the NDK you
can see this is what we'll find in the
directory the main script if you will
that will use is the NDK - Build
although we'll talk about other sorts of
tools later on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
