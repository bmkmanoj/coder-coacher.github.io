database and nowadays it's even more fun
to have object relational mapping so
let's make use of one of the many object
relational mapping frameworks that are
there for nodejs and it is simply called
ORM - so we will do NPM install ORM at
the version 2.1 save that in our
dependencies and because this is a
prototype and I know all the cool kids
are using MongoDB I'm gonna use
something simple I'm gonna use sequel
Lite 3 because it is the easiest thing
to get up and running right now we'll
install that we're done compiling we can
go back to our code which has been done
for us already by the magic of cut and
paste I have created a file called DB
j/s that's inside of a newly created
source folder this folder has nothing to
do with the basic skeleton that we
created earlier it's a new folder and
instead of here I put the minimal things
that we will need for our application we
are going to manage a table of what
we'll call breadcrumbs which are
locations of where the user was at we
are model having each breadcrumb be at a
particular time at a particular latitude
and longitude and a particular address
we're going to create the table and
we're going to make sure that everything
works also we have plugged this in now
this also starts to show the complexity
of our application as in at the top this
is not complex we added our we required
our new database module but at the
bottom this is where you start to see
both the beauty and the potential
maintenance concerns of working with
nodejs we have callbacks within
callbacks within callbacks
so the chunk of code that we have at the
bottom here simply initializes our
database create that's the tables if
they don't exist and then starts our
server and the managing of this code
sort of goes outside of the scope of
this particular discussion so I hope
you'll forgive the callback
in callbacks now let's go try it out
voila it works refresh with a gut we can
check in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
