with the lead quality engineer for or
when I say lead it means I'm actually
one of the first test and test engineers
for a fledgling product that started in
in late 2011 called boot to gecko so
originally um I've been living around
Europe I'm traveling around it worked
for skype when it was a start-up in 2004
set up the certification program there
worked a bit with QA and in some other
functions as well got a lot of traveling
and before that I was in Finland that
kind of where I got my my start of my
career is hanging around all these
really smart finished people working for
this company called f-secure in the late
1990s and I was able to take like kind
of everything I learned and move it over
to Estonia and then teach people there
because when i when i moved to Estonia
and basically 2001 the tester was a
person who made the coffee you know so
there really wasn't much of a career
there at the time and I got a chance to
sort of plug that and evangelize it and
be hopefully a little bit enthusiastic
about it at the same time and get get
people excited around the idea well
sooner or later I came back to the
states and ended contract here in a
contract there and eventually Mozilla
and I found each other and it's it's
been a it's been a great time ever since
so in late 2011 I moved out to exciting
and star starstruck Milpitas California
and and it was approached to do to do a
bit of work with this thing called of
web api's and I'll get a little bit more
into that but that's that's a little
introduction to me stepping back what is
what is Mozilla different from other
things over nonprofit and we're fully
open source right if any of you guys
ever seen the movie code rush so there
was a movie around 1998 called code rush
that was a moment in time when on
Netscape actually diverged the code and
decided to make some people at Netscape
decided to make all this Netscape code
open source it is at the time as you
know Netscape wasn't doing very well you
had exactly one choice of browser
and it was it was Internet Explorer and
they wanted to make more choice so
that's kind of the whole point about
Mozilla and I've gotten this
conversation with various people what's
that what's the point in Mozilla we
don't dominate the market well it's to
create more options to create more
possibilities for people out there so
that was that was one of the things we
try to do there so you know we're coming
out of Netscape AOL doing the
open-source thing Aladdin was it with
Mozilla leverages this community
contribution right so we have people all
over the world who are very enthusiastic
about what we do and they want to
contribute they want to they want to
join us in write code and write patches
and write tests for us and these are
people who are doing it out of the love
of doing it and that's I want to say
that's one of the things that kind of
set sets us apart obviously we're a
strong proponent for web standards so we
got this great lecture from Rebecca
earlier she was talking about web
standards I mean a lot of our guys
underwear skull yonas siccing sit on
these standards bodies Brendan Eich who
works with us was one of the creators of
JavaScript actually he was the guy who
more or less invented it the guy who one
of the guys who worked with the selenium
Dave Hunt is actually sorry Dave burns
is actually one of our people as well so
we have a lot of these things that are
sort of starting here and in going going
out into the world and it's a very
exciting place to be because you see you
see the genesis of a lot of ideas and
then you gradually see people getting
enthusiastic about the ideas and the
ideas take root and they go places
Mozilla exists of course to promote
innovation in choice on the internet we
want there to be more possibilities we
want more people to have more more
opportunities to do more things
including that guy who is yawning back
there he can jaan because that's his
right to yawn so let me tell you a
little bit about Firefox OS so in late
2011 I was doing this I was doing a
contract and it sucked and then Mozilla
came along and they said why don't you
do this thing with web api's so what
I've been doing a few months before that
or maybe half a year before I was over
in Finland working
for nokia and i was working on the my mo
operating system in my job god help you
if you were subject to it was to make
test applications based on different you
basically based on different API so
we've given this list of AP eyes and say
make a make a test application and
demonstrate some animation make one that
demonstrates drop-down list and all of
these things we'd make these corny
little applications with basically one
control on them and we'd have the
automation bang on them and so what I
was going to do when I when I went to
the web api thing was to do the same
thing as to make a test that test
applications that work with instead of
C++ it was JavaScript which of course to
me was completely new and I had no idea
what I was doing which of course that's
a challenge right so cool so I got to
work on the web api's and suddenly we
discovered that were I discovered there
with all these web api for things like
telephony and SMS and all this and what
does this have to do anything with a
browser well we'll get to that furia
faster fast-forward or should I say real
wine a few months back to July of 2011
Chris Jones and aundrea skull and
Brendan Eich or were sitting around us I
know this sounds like a punch lines
coming and they were actually working on
PDF jas so that the PDF handler for
plugin for browsers and they started to
realize you know when we add more
plugins to browsers a performance the
Browse browser actually gets worse and
worse and gets crappier and crappier
because right the the plugins are
actually amending what's what's
executing in the browser's you have the
browser there's all this code executes
all these things with any of this plugin
up there that says no wait don't do that
do this instead and every time an
amendment is made every time you add a
plug-in you're getting kind of worse and
worse performance for the browser so
somebody had the idea why don't we take
a lot of what's in these plugins and
just plug it right into the Gecko engine
of the browser and make it a little bit
more performant so suddenly out of this
PDF j/s people started to think well
wouldn't we had a telephony api what if
we had this thing could run on a device
and you can access
same things that you would use to make a
phone call we used him you would use to
send SMS we would use to access your
accelerometer on your device so they
started getting thinking about making
all these api's to fill in the gaps and
it was a flurry of activity and a bunch
of specs were written and w3c stuff
happened anyways there you go one in a
1.5 years later we launched at Mobile
World Congress we announced 17 carrier
partners who wanted this thing so it
wasn't just a whim it really took off
and it seems to be that I'm riding the
wave of another thing that's going
meteoric again so I can say that we have
at least three oam is something like 17
partners it's it's really moving so that
brings a bunch of interesting questions
though because Mozilla is
community-based OEMs tend to do things
in a proprietary way though don't they
so how do you merge the two worlds here
it's it's quite a challenge we have OEMs
you want to do things proprietary in
some cases we can't even name them or
talk about them we might say the keepers
of the real you know to avoid actually
saying the name but we have all this we
have all these people who you know are
doing things in a different way we have
this all these cultures sort of
combining two to test this product and
how do we do it how do we leverage
everything and that's kind of what I'm
what I want to talk about a little bit
let me give you a little bit about what
that originally was called boot to gecko
now it's Firefox OS what the
architecture is so you can kind of get a
sense of how everything works on the
very bottom layer we have our kernel
it's the gonk layer we call it gonk it's
the colonel it's the stuff that directly
access is the CPU and so forth directly
on top of that we have the same
rendering engine that we have in our
browser so an analogous to WebKit is our
of course our gecko we have obviously
all of the same JavaScript API is that
were there in a browser before all the
same HTML
five rendering stuff going on of course
we've also added a few other things
we've added obviously the web api is for
all the things i talked about like SMS
telephony the vibrator api and so forth
accelerometer you name it there's more
than 20 of them there's also a
permission manager as well so if you go
to your browser a new type about colon
config at least in Firefox sorry I
shouldn't assume everyone uses just
Firefox but if you type about colon
config in your in your browser you're
going to see all of these security
settings it can be toggled on an awful
or security and other things as well
this permission manager kind of works in
the same way right you obviously don't
want a web application coming from some
strange place in the web and suddenly
accessing your dialer or accessing your
camera and taking a picture of you in
opportune times there therein lies the
usefulness and utility and a necessity
of the permission manager of course in
the very top of that is Gaia Gaia is our
user interface so Gaia is written in
html5 CSS and JavaScript unlike iOS
unlike Android there's no basically
application stack in the middle it's
just the colonel the browser rendering
engine and then everything in the UI is
written in HTML 5 and such and it's kind
of ironic because the browser half is
actually an html5 app but it's it's
using the same browser that ships with
the device right why is this become so
so interesting and useful well a couple
of a couple of doors seem to get open
with this and one of one of the doors
open is well carriers you know people
like Telefonica or at least a lot or
georgia telecom for example they want to
be able to have more control about the
user experience that they're presenting
to to the to their customers maybe
telefonica wants to offer three
different for example they might want to
offer like three different packages like
a premium package and a regular package
in a cheap package I mean whatever the
proper sales terms for those
things are they want to be able to
control that user experience right
instead of taking what you know what iOS
gives them and saying well you don't
really have any choice you can't change
it you can't customize and make it look
so the carriers have more choice when
you consider also that I mean how many
iOS developers are there in the world i
would i would guess they probably number
in the thousands I mean there's probably
hundreds of thousands if not millions of
Java developers as well but how many
html5 our HTML developers web developers
there's infinitely gazillions of them i
don't want to say infinite but there's a
lot more right and so that's one of the
one of the compelling things about this
is opening the choice is suddenly more
people who can develop it there's
suddenly the carriers have more more
choice of what they want to present so i
think if you were to asking why did this
why did this take off and not like you
know webos or something like that i
think this is why it was it was designed
to open open the market and was also
designed to drive standard as well but
this is a bit about the architecture
just a bit about how we do things sort
of concurrently when we're when we're
working through the things we have
actually several different builds build
processes and in validation processes
going so well well development is going
on here we have 100 101 and 100 we have
obviously different testing activities
going on and I'll talk a little bit more
about those more specifically we have
bills we have to test we have OTA
updates over-the-air updates which have
to be tested every patch that gets
checked in whether it comes from
community or whether it comes from one
of our one of our partners sorry we have
a review and approval process and it's
the same one it's the same process
that's that we've been using the
preserve the Firefox browser for all
these years and keep it keep it running
reasonably well so it's it's kind of a
it's kind of a useful and proven
strategy in some ways although not
perfect there's always things that can
be done better and there's always
mistakes we can learn from
it our partners actually the ones who
drive our bug triage is so when any of
these development trains are going on we
have partners also working concurrently
with their own forked versions of for
example gaya and the Firefox OS so they
can drive for example prioritize the
bugs they want fixed the features they
want in there are specific
implementations and we try to sort of
offload as much of that as we can write
because Mozilla the core people at
Mozilla is actually very small and while
we do rely on community we can only
expect community to do so much so we
want to get more control to the partners
but that means it has to go both ways
right so here are some of the testing
frameworks that we use there's a
continuum there from functional to
non-functional and you'll recognize
certainly many of the things here XP
sheet XP seashell tests mochi tests our
regression tests written against the
Java API si2 ticker obviously or
performance tests we have JavaScript
unit tests we have web api JavaScript we
have mozz trap which is our basically
it's a repository for manually executed
test cases so we still do a fair bit of
work manually and this is always the
first when you have a features that are
brand new for example a GUI that isn't a
GUI that isn't frozen yet or an API
that's not frozen yet it's often useful
to tinker around with a little bit of
manual or semi-automated testing before
you commit to the automation I mean this
doesn't replace obviously a JavaScript
like unit test if you will it just
complements them right it's just another
way to approach the same problem we have
marionette tests which are written in
JavaScript breath tests which Rebecca
was good enough to talk about which we
do obviously a lot of those and these
balls by the way approximate the actual
size of the test base that there is so
our mojo tests which are you know
analogous to mochi kit written in
JavaScript and testing dumb and in
JavaScript api's
some of the some of the biggest tests we
have so when we had all these tests we
had something like 80,000 of them
already running on firefox browser which
it was a matter of flipping a switch and
we were able to report them and then
suddenly run them on Firefox OS as well
so we didn't have to re-engineer a whole
lot of our test base from scratch only
for the new API and this is um that I
mean I thought this was incredibly
powerful actually that we were able to
do that with very little adaptation
obviously crash test is another thing
that's here here's an example of mochi
test actually this is the this is the
HTML portion of it you can see that it
loads a window when the window is loaded
it does a simple test thing sorry it
does this is running a simple test call
so I could I could show you the code for
that but you basically see that when
this when this window is launched its
running a test this one also is doing
something about the enabling the
security privilege as well so that the
tests can run right so that's sort of at
a glance what the security model might
look like in code a marionette test is
actually our automated functional user
interface test so this you will see it
looks quite a lot like selenium we
obviously got a lot from selenium we're
able to immediately almost immediately
leverage it to test user interface
elements against the against the
different versions of guy that we're
coming up with and now obviously what a
lot of our work is it's not only getting
community to contribute tests but also
training the partners out so that they
can write the tests as well so that's
what that looks like
to give you some idea of like the depth
of the testing we have and this this is
of course right across community it
spread across our OEMs our carrier
partners as well and are different
contracting groups I mean we do the user
stories to test cases things we still
work with real requirements we have
daily smoke tests we have one batch of
daily smoke tests which we're actually
wanting manually and this gives us a
this gives us a perspective on how this
phone is going to / hey behave on a
given day so while we do automation of
course and pretty pretty comprehensive
automation we still do a fair bit of
manual testing just to see what things
look like to get a sense of that and
then we still take that that work
actually very seriously quite a few test
runs full functional test runs between a
code phrase and code complete cycle
these are of course both automated in
manual tests and happening at all levels
we have test results for both the
rendering engine gecko as well as for
the user interface Gaia in our in our
case it's called Gaia right now but
there could be many different user
interfaces performance metrics as well a
crash reporting and so forth obviously a
lot of a lot of doing is a lot of what
we do has to do with identifying bug
blockers so filing these block or bugs
you know finding these things that
prevent us from working filing them and
verifying them verifying them across the
range of phones that we support and so
forth and obviously a dog fooding
program we have people beta testing the
devices we have the key on geeksphone
now which is one that we're using this
brings us another dimension to that as
well our test coverage is literally kind
of happening on this project all over
the world and this is no longer a
complete picture anymore because you've
added a fair bit more but to give you a
typical idea we have the stuff we're
doing in mountain view which can you
know includes API automation the UI
automation as i mentioned performance
testing obviously studying features in
defining the test case
is working with a product people bug
work and almost all the coordination
happens from mountain view as well one
of our partners here telefonica does the
features that they own right some of the
same things but they still rely on us
for coordination they're doing a lot
with the communication apps that cost
control of course their own their own
triage is their own bug work and so
forth we have a team of contractors in
Kirkland Washington and we work with we
also have a branch in Taiwan that's
working with a lot of the radio
intensive features as well in addition
to this I just came back from a
certification round in Chile so now
we're certifying a bunch of phones for
all the other Latin American countries
and this of course brings another
another dimension to this to this model
as well so a lot of that stuff is driven
and run by the OEMs but it still falls
on us because in a way we're the only
ones kind of sitting at the center of
this puzzle who can see the whole
picture and that's why why it's
interesting and useful to us so where
does community fit into all of this we
do some of the kind of things in some
way like the test the web forward that
Rebecca was talking about earlier on we
reorganized hackathons and meetups and
groups and things like that but it's a
matter that the big challenge is keeping
people engaged I mean how do you weight
it when you need you need somebody with
with a lot of money to come and find you
and you need to protect their
proprietary secrets and all of these
things but you also want to be able to
leverage your community and keep things
open at the same time I mean this is an
ongoing challenge and one that I don't
have necessarily a very good answer for
but it's one of the challenges we deal
with every day so it's a little bit
about our localization as well
localization is by the way one of the
ways that community is most involved
with us so for example we have 90
languages covered by 24 teams I think
there's
actually more teams now and these people
are spread all over the world of course
in addition to doing a translation you
know l10n is also involves a bit of
coding documentation and testing and all
of those things as well so they they
contribute a lot in that way obviously
we prioritize our targeted the countries
that we're targeting first right this is
a look at our tinder box so this is
where we're running some of our
automated tests and you can see this is
for example our try build system so i
can for example code a patch committed
to this tribe build system generated
building my own and then flash it to my
device and then try out the specifics of
this build without affecting anything
else in the infrastructure anyone
mozilla has a possibility to do this to
generate their own tribe builds you know
with with all the other pieces in the in
the puzzle kept uniform it's it's very
useful to be able to say well with this
particular commit and when I add this
patch then I get these results and so
forth this is an incredible incredibly
useful way to work actually all of these
all of these continuous integration
systems tied together in Jenkins and
Jenkins kind of gives us the big picture
and I'm sure you're quite familiar with
this it's nothing new here so do you
have any questions or any comments a
simple question about Mozilla and your
partner's their carriers
for this hammer mmm the nonprofit open
source essentially are they be like
funding was delighted away except a
model for this in a way they are that
that's absolutely true yes if if a
carrier wants to go to market with
something I mean I can't comment on the
specifics of what they commit but they
do they do commit resources and in
addition to people i mean there's also a
financial aspect there in some cases
they may help us bring bring the market
they may help us with obviously their
driving the certification with the OEMs
through their own channels so they're
contributing in a variety of ways
mozilla is in a way sitting at the
center of this but obviously we're not
the one funding at all and we rely on
those on those partnerships to make it
go forward obviously so the vendors can
make changes to the way less work
buddies are they any guidance on the end
make the experience that they can make
it as bad as they want because they're
the ones who are going to be selling the
phones they have to live with the
consequences of those choices right so
if they made it look bad it would
ultimately make them look bad i mean if
you consider like a typical a typical
support call right how does it work now
so for example i have this verizon phone
if i have a problem with the phone the
first people i'll call as a carrier if
it in this case if i have an eye i phone
you know and i have a problem with the
phone and I called verizon well if
there's a bug in the code there's only
so much that the carrier can do about it
so the carrier then has to go back to
Apple probably file a bug probably
escalated support requests and hope to
god it's something actually gets done
about it you know and that's the thing
in our case we're giving them the code
and saying well okay your first line of
defense is you the carrier so you get
you get a bug request you you do you try
to fix it as much as you can if you need
to escalate something then you can do
that that gives them a choice and we
hope that we hope that it makes it a bit
working a bit better yet any larger
format tablets in the works of you guys
or you just focused on smaller incense
on your characters right now we're
focusing on smaller handsets in a
developing market so one of the one of
the other points I should have brought
forward is I think one of the advantages
of Firefox OS is it can run quite well
on a very very cheap hardware so we're
focusing a developing world we're
focusing like second world countries a
lot of Latin America right now making a
build target isn't a trivial thing as
you can imagine so it takes quite a bit
of engineering reworking the colonel and
and then you know we re working the
build scripts and so forth to make all
that happen you say bill target is that
curve device or is it just for size
projected
circulation
I can only throw a number out there I
know that the first the first launched
they're talking between 30 and 40
million and that's going to be in the
middle of the year so I think at the end
of quarter to beyond that I can't say do
you see a future for about 10 more
modern devices like tablets and emerging
markets personally I do and if it were
my decision to make I would do something
about it too I see a future for it I
think that things are things are going
to go the cards are going to fall where
they're going to go so they're going to
get they're going to try the path of
least resistance to get the single
market right which is the cheap phones
in the developing market I see actually
more more competition with with other
offerings that are out there when we
start to head toward tablets and things
because there's obviously a whole lot
more players there and the question is
are we are we up to that you know and I
can't say that we are or we aren't but I
see a future in it yes but I think we're
going to stick to what we know at first
and try to make the best of that and
then see if if over time this makes more
sense to expand to those other devices
is there do you set an easy way to just
play and you are and the pipe are always
two other enjoy based device design your
connector again it's a matter of making
a new build target so somebody is
basically somebody has to go and look at
the colonel and saying there's this is
Colonel work on the device and then they
have to they have to optimize the build
script as well right so the Gecko needs
to be built against whatever whatever
kernel is there and that Colonel needs
to be built against developed against
whichever hardware another another
variable piece it makes it kind of
complicated it's ril the radio interface
layer so that in many cases is a whole
lot of proprietary code being driven by
OEMs so in order to do a bill to do a
new device you need to consider a build
targets you need to consider your
Colonel you need to consider your radio
interface layer you need to consider
also optimizing the build script and so
forth to point to all of those
so it's it's not trivial and takes a bit
of investment and effort to make it
happen but it's doable in fact I think
that in a get cold we'll get a coach
based on enjoy enjoy a platform yes we
use adb for example for debugging so
when i use debugging i use Android debug
bridge that's that's no secret there so
yeah we're based on the android colonel
very much is there any idea that i am 41
long should work by the phones Firefox
OS actually yeah the whole the whole
point of the web app thing and I should
have talked about that thanks for
bringing it up is that the idea of
writing a web app is it's
quintessentially write once run anywhere
so if you write a web app in html5 say
you'll write a game or Twitter app or
something I mean there's different
levels of apps too and we can talk about
that but basically the whole idea is you
write it you write it once and you can
run it anywhere so you can run this not
only on a Firefox OS but you can run it
in a desktop browser you can run it in
an emulator you can run it in another
device or the Android stock browser even
the idea is write once run anywhere this
brings up actually another very
interesting point about leveraging
bandwidth and leveraging the footprint
of the video the applications right you
can have an app that writes it's written
completely in CSS html5 and JavaScript
and has all the functionality there and
when you're getting when you download
this app they're getting the whole after
getting absolutely everything indexdb
storage it's all there on the device you
can also write an app in such a way that
most of its running from the network so
all you're really getting is an iframe
and it's pulling the rest of the network
what's interesting there and where
there's some some focus our loci of
control there and what's compelling to
the carrier is is if you're in a place
like Venezuela for example or Brazil
where the networks are generally
god-awful slow it's better to ship the
device with a bunch of stock
applications and are already mostly
there and are only occasional
from the network and refreshing their
data instead of trying to have only an
iframe they're in a country like Poland
or Estonia which are very well-connected
countries with very good web
infrastructure for example it makes more
sense in many many cases to have just
the iframe for the apps and be pulling
down most of the application content
remotely so vendors can control that
carriers are very interested in being
able to say well or network kind of
sucks here so we're going to make most
of these apps available and just refresh
the data or if there are enough in a
place where the fan with tends to be
have more throughput than they can do
obviously to do it differently but the
point is that they can scale that they
can control that and that's I think why
it's caught on with them so much how
about the stores Anderson
and assigning so the whole plan is not
to have one proprietary store anyone can
set up a store so there's not just one
app store and you have to spend a year
of your life writing an application and
then have enough Apple tell you out
screw it go away anyone can start their
own store anyone can create their own
store and host it remotely hosted on the
devices to do whatever they want by way
of example so the first devices were
shipping with the store was done by this
everything dot meet its Israeli company
that actually did a pretty good job of
creating in many cases or just I frames
for like Twitter and Facebook apps and
stuff but they also have a nice mix of
like full blown Web Apps there as well
and quite many of them so they put
together a web store we also have the
usual Mozilla marketplace which runs on
these but the point is that anyone can
create their own store and in populate
this store so we're trying instead of to
create a closed silo we're trying to
open things up so on the app popping
since you're getting this government
away how are you going to ensure there's
no malicious your last bill
I think that that's going to be that's
going to be the same kind of the same
kind of effort that we've seen with
malicious apps in the browser ecosystem
so if you consider with with data
security companies like f-secure do is
they get threats from variety of places
they assess those threats and they make
like a disinfection or a cure I kind of
think it's going to work the same way in
Firefox OS if I can hazard a guess
there's people are going to write people
are going to do bad things that's the
nature of humans right we can't really
prevent it but we can try to do is
provide as many variables for
controlling the things for limiting
possibilities for these things to do to
do much worse and then enabling the
bigger community I mean we're still
going to depend on whatever the data
security companies whatever the
communities out there or finding know to
help that happen i don't think that
Mozilla is in any place whatsoever to
offer like a complete security model for
a phone I mean but we can put it out
there thank you very much for having me
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
