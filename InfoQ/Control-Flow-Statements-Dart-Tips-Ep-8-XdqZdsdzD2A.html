this episode of dart tips today we take
back control and look at darts control
flow statements all the greatest hits
are here if while four and switch plus
I'll show you a helpful tweak that
should make web developers very happy
join us right now in dart tips first up
if announced no big surprises here the
conditional if statements can be
followed by zero or more else if
statements and can end with an else
statement here's an example however I do
want to point out that the condition
must resolve to a boolean in dart only
the boolean value true is true although
the values are treated as false consider
this example here the variable name is a
string of course as strings not a bull
and therefore the else block is run
here's the correct way to write this
code you must be more explicit but the
advantage is that the rules for truthy
and faulty values are very simple to
remember for very simple conditions you
can write an if statement on one line of
code here's an example you might use
this pattern at the very beginning of a
function when you need to check a simple
condition and fail out early most of the
time dart style prefers multi-line if
statements with explicit curly braces
for looping pun definitely intended dart
has four loops like if statements for
loops look quite familiar here's an
example let's consider a more complex
example here callbacks are created
inside a for loop each closing around
the loop variable I after the loop each
callback is run printing out its number
the question is what will print out or a
better question is what would you expect
to print out unlike traditional web
programming languages dart will print 0
and then 1 why is this inside a for loop
each iteration gets its own variable
this prevents common errors when using
closures inside of loops if you want to
iterate over collection or any iterable
and you don't care about the loop
variable you can use the for in style
loop here's an example of a for in loop
the for in loop is just syntactic sugar
for the longer iterator form either form
works but I'm partial to the for in as
its shorter and shorter means less code
and less code means less chance for me
to get it wrong when he wants a loop
while the condition is true you can use
the while and do-while loops
unlike the for loop
which counts up or down or moves through
collection the wall in do-while loops
more simply run a block of code until a
condition as false here's an example the
while loop evaluates the condition
before the loop and repeats the loop as
long as the condition is true the while
loop is a good choice if you want to
check condition before entering the loop
for the first time the do-while loop
however evaluates the condition after
the loop this means the loop block is
run at least one time you can control
loops execution with break and continue
use break to stop looping here's an
example if shutdown requested returns
false the program breaks out of the loop
you can use continue to skip to the next
loop iteration here's an example you can
usually use if and else statements
instead of continue but sometimes it's a
bit easier on the eyes these continue
this example wants to work with only odd
numbers so the even numbers are skipped
I'd consider continuous sometimes
statement use sparingly finally in order
to help with efforts support old code
over to Dart there is the switch
statement while the syntax looks
familiar
there are numerous caveats worth
mentioning you can only compare integer
string or compile time constants the
compared objects must be instances of
the same class and not of any of its
subtypes and the class must not override
equal equal one surprising aspect of
switch and dart is that non empty case
clauses must end with break or less
commonly continue throw or return that
is non empty case clauses cannot fall
through you must explicitly end a
non-empty case Clause usually with a
break here's an example you will get a
static warning if you omit break
continue throw or return and the code
will error at that location at runtime I
keep saying non empty case clauses why
is that it turns out that dart supports
empty case clauses which do fall through
here's an example the deny entry method
runs for both closed and locked the
closed case Clause is empty and thus
does not require break as with many
other switch statements you can end a
switch statement with a default Clause
he's an example if no case Clause
matches the default Clause will run I
