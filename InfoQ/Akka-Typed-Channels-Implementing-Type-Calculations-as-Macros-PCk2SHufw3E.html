the aqha project working for typesafe
and today I will tell you about how I
use macros to implement type channels on
top of ARCA actors that is a project
which I hoped doing since quite a while
it was sparked during last Scala days by
talk by sign Payton Jones talking about
Haskell in the cloud and so on and all
the nice things you can do there and I
thought that must be possible but
thinking about it and I talked to two
miles about doing it in a type system
and so on but that seemed too daunting a
task so I waited until macros became
available because that makes it the
implementation basically trivial it's
still a bit tricky but it would be a lot
more tricky without macros I'm sure so
what is the problem I'm trying to solve
the problem is a line like this so we
have some actor and we send it a message
that's command one in this case this is
supposed to be a command which is
understood by that actor that is clear
but either it was someone was lazy or
something what got refactored because in
truth this does not send a command it
sends the companion object to the case
class which would have been the command
and the compiler cannot warn about this
the compiler cannot help you with this
and flag it as an error as of now with
untyped actors because the bang operator
or the tail method takes any as a
message so what we'd like to have some
kind of operation i'm using this fancy
left pointing arrow just because i
didn't know anything better up to now so
this sends the message which is on the
right to the actor which is on the left
and the compiler will actually yell at
you if you try to use the companion
object that it will not work that is the
idea that the compiler forces you to do
the right
what that means is that the actor rift
which was on the left somehow needs to
know which the type is which is allowed
for the message only then can it can the
compiler check that the message is
actually a subtype of that and that it
works actor refs are produced by an
actor system or within an actor system
using factoring methods and they use
actor classes so class implementing the
actor trait as a template so in the end
it must come from there nobody else
knows so the actor must declare what
it's allowed input types are then when
we have that we can verify the message
type against this at the call site
innaka we have something else every
message send is accompanied by the
sender reference so there can be replies
and these replies are it would be really
nice if they could also be typed so I
imagine we have the ask operation I have
the ? in this arrow here for to signify
this normally you would get back a
future any because the compiler does not
know better with what the accra might
actually reply but in this case we have
the knowledge as a programmer we write
this actor when it gets a on it
gives you back a response so it should
be a future of response and out of any
what that mean needs is that the actor
if not only needs to know about the
input message type it also needs to know
what possible reply type might be and
that again means that the actor traits
needs to be parametrized with these
types and then at the core side of the
ask operation we can extract the reply
type out of this ref to for example get
get you the the right future or to check
when an actor does this end and then the
reply comes that this actor will
actually be able to understand the
response there's one problem if we just
allow one type though so if we say we
have a new actor f which takes a tee and
gives you back a you for exam
all if you have actors which wrap other
actors one example would be the reliable
proxy pattern which is in acha itself or
you have a message throttle ER so you
have some actor which you give the
target actor if and this actor takes the
message stream which would go there and
transforms it in some way either by
delaying by dropping messages or by
transforming the messages and this outer
actor needs to process two types of
messages the real business ones and some
management channel coming from the site
telling for example of throttle ER what
the message rate allowed shall be and
these types on general not related at
all they are written by different people
possibly in completely different places
and the common supertype will be any
riff for all practical purposes so this
means that in order to avoid this loss
of type safety incurred by wanting to do
two channels we need to have really
lists of types and with the reply types
so an actor might reply either with a
positive or negative response for
example and you want to model that so
reply types could also be lists of types
and that means that what we need to
compute is not simply subtype of
something and then the corresponding one
will be the reply type no we will have
to implement something I could type map
and that is I asked Martin or esky about
it whether it would be good idea to try
that in the type system and he said you
know I don't know so he was not entirely
confident and this is why i said ok then
i'll have to wait for macros to do this
when we have this I thought we can do
something a bit better even than we have
today and I thought it would be more
natural if if we want to model message
flows that the message actually flows
from from left to right so the first
step was to turn
around these operators I have the
message on the left hand side and then i
have the ask operator to ask to send the
message to the first actor which will
give you back a future with the reply
and then that future can be used as an
input for the second ask the second
actor which gives you back a new future
and that future can be used to send back
to the original client at some future
point of time in time another thing in
there i mean the second line
demonstrates possibly very common use
case that you have an actor which is
actually the target of a spray route or
play route or anything like that it asks
some back-end service and then it needs
to transform the reply coming back
making it an HTTP ok response and then
get it back to the whoever call the
service and in this sense i would say
since this all of this is now statically
typed checked just like you have your
map flatmap and and so on operations or
collections and everything is type check
these are also completely type checked
like composing functions the first one
then you compose the functions of the
two actors you wire them together and if
you look in the sense of the the pie
calculus if if I'm not mistaken there
and this can be done from the outside to
make actors actually compose and the
result of all of this would be that you
can compose your active systems in a
type-safe fashion that you do not need
to rely on for example tests to verify
that he didn't make some stupid mistakes
in your match statements I recently
started looking into actually reading
out and buy calculus because I'm just if
it physicist sorry I didn't know about
this before I just wrote that and then I
think yeah Miles said yeah are you doing
distributed pie calculus and started
reading up on that and I have not yet
finished reading him the first book but
I came to the conclusion that actors
might actually become composite
processes in this
in this calculus and the important part
is that their types are structural and
not nominal I think you'll see what that
means in on the Meccans next slide and
as I showed you we can do process wiring
in a situational way at least but all of
this is a pretty embryonic state of my
understanding of pi calculus and actors
so if if you have inputs or what like to
discuss it I I would love to do a
session on that tomorrow if someone is
interested in knowledgeable and and we
can we can get a discussion going I
wrote up all the design rationals I had
for this on in the acadecki this has
been merged into a car masters so you
can try it out if you build from source
or you can wait for the first milestone
off to the two which comes out in a week
or so now let's I mean that was the nice
and easy part now let's descend into the
underworld so let me start by showing
you the types I'm using first of all we
need type lists as I said so that's the
console of a type list right there with
the colon plus colon which takes first
of all the head of the list which is a
pair of in and out message type and then
the tail obviously and there is a teen
ill accompanying it as usual that is the
basic type which which I'm operating on
a channel ref is a value class wrapping
an actor if whose only purpose is to
carry such a channel list so we can do
computations on it and then there is an
actor mix in called channels so you can
say actor with channels and that
actually has two such type parameters
one for its parent you can you can send
to context or parent and one for its
self channel which it can hand out to
others as there can be many possible
reply types not just one for a single
message send the future which comes back
would either have to have the least
upper bound only or it needs more
specific type and that's what the
wrapped message does this is only
necessary because scholar does not
support type unions natively I think if
you have ideas we can talk later so the
idea behind all of this is that all
these checks are done at compile time
and they just vanish the bytecode
produced shall be as close as possible
to not having used any of this to not
lose the performance so in the end it
will go ship simply it will be tellin
task after the type check with the
possible exception of actually needing
to wrap wrap messages so how does such
an actor look like this is an actor with
channels which is a slightly strange
echo and the first parameter which is T
nil here the type parameter that is the
description of the parent channel this
actor does not talk to its parent so
empty list the real one is the second
one and it says it accepts messages of
type string and it may reply with
strings this does not imply that it must
reply with with a string now it just
confines the replied type to be at most
strength there are basically two ways of
writing it down when you say channel for
string then you need to give it a
function to and the reason for that is
first you need to get the message in str
in this case which will be typed
aesthetically as string here and the
sender and that is necessary you cannot
just use context at center or anything
because that is untyped i wouldn't know
how to attach the changing reply types
if there are many of those otherwise so
i send in the sender reference and this
center reference will only accept
strings and that's why this this echo
works you can also I mean it's a
function to Z so you can implement it
using partial function syntax if you
wish
now these lambdas post the first problem
lambdas are they are parsed and then
when type-r sees them in a scholar
compiler the type of phase it will d
sugar them into an animus inner classes
implementing function to in this case
the problem is that that happens before
macro in invocation if this would be an
argument to the macro and then the macro
would be able to compute all the types
but you couldn't apply the types of the
closure anymore because the closure has
already been the sugar that means well
the lambda is not an argument to the
channel method it actually is an
argument to the apply method of whatever
is returned from channel that was the
workaround I found yeah so this shows
you I call the behaviorists for want of
a better name that's basically the thing
which is emitted and which has the right
apply type and what you have here is
some arbitrary things so the macro will
calculate this R and it's completely
free and what it what it calculates
there it could also be a function one or
anything else and the compiler would
then type check whatever comes after
channel in the right way this is pretty
convenient I have this code in here for
another reason so I want to get the
runtime class because dispatching the
messages at runtime will need to operate
on runtime classes and to get the
runtime class of some type it is
advisable to call not due to not use T
here simply which is a type what the
call widen on it because otherwise if
you use singleton types like you have a
case object a you say a dot type and you
put it in there it will give some weird
exception now let's look at the macro
itself I mean this is just the shell of
the macro so what we see here we have
this is the implementation of the macro
and then it has a
lot of type arguments type parameters
that this maybe not always the case but
it is the case we in here because I'm
doing type calculations that that's what
I'm doing you see two different types of
arguments these are normal ones now they
don't have any type tags the first three
and then you have the one with type tags
the one with type texts they are input
parameters so I get the type tags from
the compilation of the the call side of
the macro so i can calculate with them
and the other ones are as we see as we
will see output arguments so to speak
need to be declared there as well then
one thing the context on which this
macro is invoked is passed in here and
you can restrict the prefix type to be
just something very specific that means
that this macro can only be used on
something which is a channels and it has
the benefit when I splice here see thats
prefix that supplies it will actually
have the right type so this this does
type check if you don't do this then
there is no type here and you will get
you will have to cast another thing is
and if you ever have tried this you can
before the dot splice you can put any
expression which returns a tree and you
could be tempted to put an expression
there which contains a refi at least I
was tempted at some point don't do it
I'm using eclipse and there you get
these yellow pop-ups when you do
something wrong and they have a little
font displaying the error message and
this pop-up filled the whole screen and
it had three dots at the end so this is
something which is apparently not
supported so yeah so I have this prep
tree here outside and then I can splice
it in here that that works another
interesting thing is that type tags work
if you
use the right universe yeah you have a
universe that's not shown you that's C
dot universe which is no actually not so
there is in see there is a universe and
if you try to use that it will fail
because there is no implicit type tag
for that path to get to type tag
universe here is actually the runtime
universe which you need to use and then
re if I is smart enough to transform
this to transport this type information
across the reification step that is
pretty neat I'll go more in detail about
that later and then how is this wired up
we have this trade channels which has
the parent and our self channel type
arguments I'm preferring a self type
annotation for this one that has nothing
to do with the reasoning Daniel
presented this morning it's just to
force people to write actor with
channels because that looks so nice if I
would just extend after then you could
write my actor extends channels let's
yeah so I'm I'm being a bit of a bitch
here so channel is just a normal method
which returns some function type yeah it
returns something which has an apply
method and the most general thing I can
return due to contravariance is the
function nothing to unit it's not any to
unit that would be the most specific one
and then we call this macro these first
three just need to satisfy whatever type
bounds were declared here now this is a
channel list this is not restricted
apart from that that's not checked and
there was one thing here I wanted to
create this new behaviorist but calling
new on this in a class does not work
because I would caught need to call new
on sedar prefixed art supplies that's
not valid valid scala syntax
unfortunately this is why i had to
introduce this
method here which just wraps this that's
to get around some some syntax
limitations and then the macro will
return something which conforms to this
this is important here that needs to
match this one this one needs to be a
subtype of whatever it is to get the
macro use side and then whatever is
reified needs to be a subtype of what i
intend to return there are many type
checks at play when writing macros next
topic let me show you one simple type
calculation just to show you what I mean
when I said I waited for macros because
I think that would have been much harder
to write purely in the type system so
first of all we always need to pass
around this universe types and
everything and symbols and so on they
live in a universe in the compiler so
this channels is universal type and
required is a list of such types and
then I just iterate so tail recursively
across this this type list so yeah I
have this consoles colon plus column
they have to type arguments so I'm
always interested in the first type
argument and there that was a pair of in
and out i'm only interested in the in
this match is here I think this match
statement will look a lot nicer once we
have quasi quotations for those this
manual deconstruction of type ref that
is quite kind of de the ugly part but
apart from that it's just normal
collections operations right I I filter
not and I yeah take out so every type I
encounter here by traversing this type
level list is removed from this list of
required types in the usual fashion so
that's what I wanted to show here
there's one quirk I felt a ticket for
that if you could say why isn't why is
this inner method necessary it is if you
could just make this one tail recursive
that actually crashes the compiler it
doesn't work so mixing tail recursion
specifically with these path dependent
types doesn't seem to work this is why I
import the universe members here and
then access them in here that is not a
problem anymore this can be this is a
normal Terry cursive thing now type
calculation the point was to return the
type so to actually get the type back
into the calling context and at first I
thought okay this is weird refi is about
trees but not so much about type trees
and how do i return this thing and I the
first try was to actually write down c
dot applied type and all these ugly
thing is there was screen full of
implementation for that until I
discovered that so I i declare here
reply channels I have an implicit valve
which is of type type tag of reply
channels and that will be picked up by
refi when I use this reply channels
anywhere so I left these dots in here to
show you this is nested in some other
types now it sits down inside them some
composite type and it still figures it
out and takes this type tag when it
encounters that and puts that into the
refi tree and then you can put here any
type you want you have calculated
channels is a you doc type and it's just
in there and that transports it across
the barrier into the macro hispanic
expansion and that simplify the code by
an order of magnitude at least there's
one little problem i encountered next
that is i have an operation narrowing
channel revs so i can remove channels
for example input channels without
violating any constraints and that is
done by a macro but at runtime i can
also
that you could look up actors using
active for and then you don't get any
type information so i have implemented
in operation where you can send a
message hey do you implement these types
is that is that you and that does the
same thing the same check only at
runtime writing the same code twice is
ugly of course and i just reused it this
I X so it's short this would be the
missing channels or something what I
discovered is I have a talk at runtime I
have a type tag from the runtime
universe and I pass it in here the macro
universe is not a subtype or anything of
of the runtime universe it is a more
general universe but that should work i
mean i have a universe right just by
losing this information that we are
dealing with statically known the
runtime universe the compiler got very
confused and I got runtime exceptions
what you need to do in this case you
need to make an importer from this
universe to that universe and then when
you want to use types like here reply
channels need to import them even though
this import is just from the same
universe to the same i am not sure what
the bug there is but yeah something
which needed figuring out you don't need
to do this dance 4 types with come which
come with this color library though like
nothing that just works the last topic
but not the least important is how to
test this and i thought there this is
going to be complicated there are
sometimes questions on the main list how
to fake such a context and so on to to
do it but if you just decide I want to
run some the compiler on some code and
see what it does that is extremely
simple it just needs gala compiler on
the classpath and then you can ask the
runtime mirror to make you a toolbox
giving some compile-time options and
then on this tool box you can invoke
power
for some string of code and then you can
invoke evil on the resulting tree to
evaluate it it's quite simple you just
need to give it the right class path so
it will find everything it needs and
then the test looks like this yeah I
just come right down my code as I would
with the import statements and then I
have here a channel ref which accepts a
return c and i try to send it Abby and
that's supposed to fail with the
specific error message I think that's
quite straightforward so that is
basically or I thought should go in half
an hour thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
