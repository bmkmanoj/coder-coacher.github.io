Python programs we're going to use PDB
which is the Python debugger it's
included in the Python standard library
I'm gonna walk you through some slides
and talk about PDB a little bit and then
we'll demonstrate it on some code and
you can see how we can explore the
execution of our code before I tell you
how to use PDB it's worth saying there
are times when it's better not to debug
as students you're sometimes curious as
to exactly what's happening and it's fun
to explore totally code step through
your code and see what's going on but it
is worthwhile sometimes to stop and
understand think about what's going on
before you just kind of blindly follow
the path of execution it's also
worthwhile to note that PDB is not the
best Python debugger
you might investigate when PDB for a
good GUI debugger that works
cross-platform works on Windows Linux
and Mac Python the debugger is always
there it's in the standard library and I
frequently have used it from a console
to debug remote servers it's it's kind
of the fallback and so it's worth being
familiar with even if you don't plan to
use it in your day to day work so
launching PBB to get into PDB there's a
couple of ways if you're investigating a
crashing script you might do post-mortem
debugging you can launch PDB by
specifying the - M command - your Python
executable which takes a module name and
the module name for PDB is
unsurprisingly PDB and specify your
script and that will start your script
under the control of the debugger
you can tell it to run and it will
resume debugger control when your script
crashes so if you're expecting and
expecting a crash you can start with
post-mortem debugging and you can also
do that by from a interactive
command-line importing your buggy script
importing PDB running the functionality
of the mixture script crash and
launching the post-mortem command of the
PDB module what's again will transfer
you to PDP command control at the point
where your script crashed you can
investigate the crash we're not going to
do that 90% of the time when I run the
PDB
module I do it by importing PDB and
inserting a set trace call at the point
in my script I want debugger command to
takeover which frequently is not right
at the beginning once I've switched to
PDB I have a console shell that says PDB
and I have a bunch of commands that I
can type this is a list of all of them
it looks kind of imposing many of them
are doubled so it's not quite as
imposing as it might seem for instance
see command is the same as continues
there's not quite as many as it looks
and in daily practice actually you'll
use just a set of small commands L you
can just use L o type the full list
command it shows where you are in your
code in steps to the next line of
execution see leaves debugger control
and execute your code normally s steps
into the next line of execution
including into function calls if they
exist are steps to the end of the
currently executing function and B sets
breakpoints which we'll see in a moment
and it's important to realize when
you're debugging that from the PDP
console you can type in any valid Python
changing variables or execution flow of
your program and inspecting their values
so that's that's actually what you spend
the most time doing and then use a few
simple commands so let's go ahead and
run a Python program and use PDB bubble
sort is one of the slowest and stupidest
sorts that you can write and but just
reading the code it might not be obvious
what's going on so we're going to step
through it interactively
okay so I'll stick here and stay in the
console
so this is my bubble sort and I'm going
to uncomment my pdb line so when I run
this Python program again the PDP
console will take take control here at
the set trace line so let's do that it
goes ahead initializes my array with my
random integers and now I'm actually at
the PDB console you can see that instead
of having a typical Python console that
says PDB in parentheses if I don't
remember the list of commands I can
always type question mark or help to see
all the commands but let's try a few out
L or list shows my current execution
point you see there's a little arrow
beside line 28 and I'm about to call a
function called bubble sort so let's go
ahead and step into that function with
the S or step command steps on to the
next the next line which is the
definition of my function bubble sort
and I'm going to next a couple times
here let's look at our code again and
this is the bubble sort itself and
bubble sort is basically a as dumb a
sort as you can possibly write it says
look at grab the first object and
compare it to every single other object
passing it up the chain if it's larger
until you've gone all the way to the end
of your objects and now you're
guaranteed that that one object is in
the proper order now go back and grab
the next the next object in your list so
it's got a pair of nested four
statements and if I'm not really sure
what my current passes left is I can
evaluate it and see that it's currently
18 if I want to look at my list I type L
and you'll notice that actually showed
me some code again the only limitation
to valid Python is that it can't
conflict with PDB built-in commands so I
want to look at my list whose name is L
I have to say print L to get to it list
shows the code but it doesn't
necessarily show where I am if you
continue to list it'll page down you can
specify a line number to list so I'm
going to look around line 20
I'm currently executing on 18 where
always shows your current execution
point and that includes the stack trace
so I can see that
no doubt in on line 28 in bubble dot pi
I call the function and I'm currently
executing line 18 in in the sub function
so let's go ahead and set a breakpoint
and because we don't want to step
through all the loops and let's make the
breakpoint be line 21 I do that with the
B command and I'm specifying the line
and if I list my code again listing line
21 you can see my current execution is
on line 18 and the breakpoint is
indicated by a B on line 21 and I'm not
going to type the C command to continue
and that runs down to my breakpoint
including however many trips to the for
loop were necessary and I'm now
executing line 21 over to my breakpoint
I'm back into PDB control let's step
into display list and display list is a
simple function that just for each value
in our list prints a string times the
value and we're not really interested so
I'm going to use the r command which
runs until the functions return point so
i'm now at the end of my display
function and i've resumed pdb control
and go next back into my bubble sort
function and i can continue to step
through checking and potentially
changing the variables if i wanted to
not really debugging here so i don't
have a problem to solve
so i'm just going to continue to the end
and notice I'm hitting my breakpoint
again so I'm going to quit with Q let
should be enough to get you started with
PBB PBB is not a sophisticated debugger
it doesn't include features you might be
used to from graphical debuggers like
watches but it's worth investigating
some of the tricks you can perform with
the commands function on breakpoints you
can get a surprising amount of mileage
out of the console application and its
best feature is that it's always there
so I hope you've learned something and
thanks for watching this Python how-to
with Maracana hope to see you in class
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
