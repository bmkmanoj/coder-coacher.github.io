right one enthusiastic individual about
ice cream what about dataviz who hears
pumped to see to talk about data viz
right now okay sweet I mean what gets us
excited about data visualization maybe
it's just interacting with the
information visually querying it finally
I can see you know what about the tools
d3 right it's it's awesome and insanely
popular I mean so much so that like
people are starting to say that d3 kind
of rules everything around us and people
make some great great visualizations and
even better some of them are interactive
take this piece where I have to guess
what the distribution of this data set
looks like to get the information for uh
and understand what's going on drawing
the individual in it's just like a
couple years ago this just felt so new
Mike Bostock would create something and
it looked like it's never been done
before cross filter is a great example
like I'm looking at a huge data set up
dating a ton of district at different
distributions in real time but like
honestly the reality though this this
kind of stuff is existed for a while
like data visualization has been an
integral part of graphical user
interfaces since the beginning and to
prove it I've got a little excerpt from
the mother of all demos demoing the
mouse in 1968 so there's no audio but
I'll just scrub through here you can you
can see it's this is the one of the
first if not first graphical user
interfaces and it's clearly got a node
link diagram in
he's talking about how this kind of
representation helps people understand
information in new ways and like if you
look even further this is the 1968
version of Google Maps like this is this
is revolutionary right back then and
even now if these kind of interfaces
just feel revolutionary what what like
why have we not made this like this jump
we're like this is just normal for us I
think I have this theory that like
really the web took us back several
years in interfaces effectively like the
best we could do was just render an
image spew that image from the server
and put it in a div so we went from this
to something like this ignoring the
little gap this it's extremely dense and
like looking at a ton of information
also at the same time there's this term
big data that came around so well well
there were a bunch of different
interesting things happening and in like
visual data visualization the venerated
data scientists would just kind of
showcase problems that we didn't know we
had and solved them for us and like
these storytellers would create a
visualization that just made it
completely obvious what's going on
underneath so by now you're like who the
heck is this guy my name is Miles
McLaughlin and I've been part of this
community for a while I've all we're
going to help to organize SF data mining
and buried III user group for the past
couple years and prior to that I studied
human computer interaction and machine
learning and right now i'm working at
facebook building data visualization our
products leveraging data visualization
and some just really great models
we're hiring so if you're interested
come talk to me afterwards but that said
like before I jump into interaction
design for dataviz let's let's define
these things what is data visualization
well I a business person will say it's
that chart the button they press in
Excel a designer might just say it's a
new medium for them to play or like an
artist might say it's a new medium for
them to play in a designer might say
it's a way of giving tools for analysis
so that users can take more actions an
engineer might say it's a way of like
increasing the amount of information
density that you can give to one user in
one single view the root of this though
like data visualization is an integral
part of communication this whole not a
concept of mapping information to a
visual plane like we've been doing this
for a while again nature like we've we
try to understand ourselves looking at
nature to even just making Maps one of
the earliest forms of visualization like
think about it if you had to understand
what the world looks like just with your
own tools what would you do you'd walk
you couldn't even get through like most
of San Francisco in your lifetime let
alone an entire continent but when you
ask people what what the shape of the
world looks like what are continents
look like you see a distinct pattern in
that data like the distinct knowledge
that these individuals have so that said
like this visualization is existed this
type of visualization is existed for
millennia here's one example from 600 BC
on the earliest proven one that I've
heard of is around 4000 BC so what have
we been doing for the past thousand zuv
years visualizing information honestly I
have this theory that we're trying to
boost our understanding of
the world around us so that we can focus
on new new problems that we didn't know
existed but I mean recently like 60
years ago or so or longer we came up
with this thing called a computer so
information or pictures could react to
what we're doing it it's magic right and
from it it created this concept of a
field this human computer interaction
design or like user experience
interaction design in itself what do you
think the goal of this field is does
anyone have an example what are we
trying to get at you know typically I
hear from people that the goal for our a
good user experience is for it to be
simple it has to be the simplest thing
across can possibly be and like that's
not a bad way to think about things
generally it's a good good analogy but
the reality is if that's all the user
interfaces were like this would be
everything that we do on the web a nice
big red button to do the thing or even
better there's no button it just does
the thing and I don't have to think
about it I would just essentially mean
we're kind of not needed but the reality
is there's always new problems for us to
solve and interaction design it's I like
to think of it as like designing the
dance between a user and information so
sometimes when you're choreographing
this dance you actually want it to be as
simple as possible making the
communication between a user and
information that's that's pretty well
known like text or images just fluid but
other times you really want this design
this dance to be like deeply rooted in a
lot of complicated movements and like
getting to have the user constantly go
back and forth with the information that
they're looking
so again it's not just about simplicity
like simple is important simple things
should be simple but complex things need
to be possible and they also need to be
visible so how do we design this like
what are some of the things that we need
to know in order to go about this kind
of this task well first let's talk about
like humans but what we're good at what
we have receive the world also like
who's the audience you're trying to
build for and what what the audience is
really like needs from the information
so let's talk about a psychology if
you've ever taken a psych course you
probably know Veppers law let's do a
little experimenting all right tell me
which ones louder no one okay let's try
this again second one all right what
about what about this time okay I
actually screwed that up it's meant to
be the same like the there's roughly
like the first the first one we did
there was really a barely a difference
between the two I'm sure it's look
there's some quantifiable amount but we
just can't easily perceive it Debra's
law formalizes that concept Bevers law
defines what's called the just
noticeable difference for an individual
this applies in all areas of perception
that's we just did sound but also
applies in in visualization typography
uses this a lot whether or not they
formally define it and also it's
important to note this really does vary
from user from person to person like I
might not here as well as other people
or a vice versa that's what k kind of
stands for in this in this formula but
honestly ignore the formula like how do
we apply this to visualization well
designers either even people in
literature define this like root of
visuals our visual medium called visual
channels it seems really obvious when
you see them laid out over here it got
position like where the we're in a piece
of information is the color of the thing
you're working on we also have like
common data types like categorization
Apple versus an orange etc so how how
these visual channels represent
information like can be classified
leveraging Veppers law so when when you
look at like area you find that like
quantitative information works really
well and also just like which ones
larger this is this has been proven
through a lot of research that like
position is one of the best in coatings
for for information and Hugh works
really well with categories but not well
with others so how many have you heard
this before from a date of his
professional I hate pie charts or some
derivative yeah so do you know what this
is where this comes from like take a
look at these three distinct data sets
both with three different types of both
with three different types of or two
different visualizations the pie charts
are pretty similar like yeah I can
notice that one in a is bigger than or
smaller than C but it's it's much less
obvious in the nuanced area so that like
be looks like they're all the same data
points but on a bar chart I
instantaneously see it by the way this
is on the Wikipedia article for pie
charts and I just like thank you for
ever put that up there
so members law like it's used a lot and
like research even recently like layin
Harrison and his team at Tufts tried
doing this to analyze like the
difference between correlation a more
complicated task that you have to do in
visualization deciding whether or not
this is negatively correlated or this is
positively correlated and they took a
bunch of different chart types and
classified the the difference had people
compare it and leverage Bevers law to
validate that like a line if it's if the
data is just like slightly negatively
correlated you can barely tell but if
it's on a scatterplot it's pretty simple
and they ended up creating like a rank
of what visualizations are good for what
I'd recommend reading this paper because
this is this is what human-computer
interaction research is using to
classify and formalize visualization but
what about what about interaction right
like for the web rebuild you eyes
there's this law fitts law it's the kind
of I like to think of it as the kerning
for interaction designers here's the
formula I'll explain it in a minute like
if you're familiar with kerning kerning
is for typography you notice that C and
E this the weird space yeah I'm making
you see bad everywhere not just for type
of not just for visit for typography as
well so Fitz Fitz law is this concept
that like just things are harder to
click when you put them in just weird
places like think about a close button
just randomly smacked onto a page or a
link like this is an actual link and I
can barely hover over it because of
the fact that I have to get within like
a less than 1 pixel width so Fitz law
like it moves us in this direction of
stuff that just makes more sense putting
your clothes button at the top right
corner top left corner because no one's
going to miss it because there's a
bounding box there or just taking like a
link and turning it into a button giving
the user much more area so as I said
that there was that formula so Fitz law
defines the time and error it takes for
a user to go from one point where the
cursor currently is to the desired
location on the page by the size of the
thing that they're trying to interact
with and the distance that they have to
go so how do we apply this to
visualization well we've got like take
this example a bar chart this one's
designed by I forgot their name but like
what is the common in a way of
interacting with a piece of information
in a chart yeah hovering hovering over
just like getting into the actual value
on on the that they're working with a
problem is in visualization the the data
dictates the size of the component so I
have to spend like an extra ton of time
to get the value for compared to 95 so
you're you're naturally making people
only care about the Pareto distribution
or like the top tier values which is not
not always what you want the user to do
but if you if you rethink the way that
you're letting the individual interact
with that piece of information like what
is the goal when you're hovering over a
value value does the wide access really
matter for a bar chart generally no so
if you
just create an invisible rectangle that
is the entire length in the Y dimension
the user can interact with every point
much more easily just to prove that this
works in like in action and people do
implement things this way this there's
this interesting bar chart that again
has hovering based off of the position
of the mouse so a line chart is one of
the most annoying experiences that I see
today like commonly the user has to just
interact with one pixel line to get a
piece of information or maybe the maybe
the person is really nice and they put a
little circle on top so that they can
hover over that first but like following
that same technique with the bar if you
just what is what is a line chart trying
to do it's trying to show the variation
in Y the Y dimension x x and x is
typically time so like getting letting
the user just get the piece of
information at that one moment in time
is much more simple by just removing
that dimension of interactivity so what
about scenarios where it just doesn't
vary by like there's no way to say oh
this this one dimension is the one that
I want to interact with like take the
scatterplot every kid at some point in
their life has made a scatterplot
drawing it out it's pretty common right
yet what can you even CL you can see
these dots on the screen I was a little
worried about that but like I've got a
two pixel three pixel area that I have
to hover over to get some detail like
that that's just a very annoying
experience so how we counteract this
well there's one technique like that you
can use and it's called a voronoi
like really what the goal of letting a
user interact with a piece of
information is there you're trying to
let them approximate there there the
cursors value to appoint the nearest
point on the plane so a voronoi defines
this and it's kind of a weird name and
needs a formal definition so of or
annoyed partitions an area into cells
based off an initial set of points
called seeds and a cell is a collection
of points that are closest to a given
seed so you can think of your seeds as
the points in your scatter plot and this
area right here as being the set of
points that are closest to that little
yellow dot on the plane so take away the
magic and you've got a great way to
interact with the pieces of information
d3 automates this with you with like I
think it's d3 layout voronoi so quick
implementation easy too easy to use but
personally I I kind of feel like this
little odd right like my back of my
mouse is all the way over here and I'm
switching between Kuwait and Equatorial
Guinea by just moving and I have no idea
what's going on thankfully in 2005
somebody felt pretty similarly they
created this thing called a bubble
cursor and a bubble cursor is a way to
replace your your mouse in a given area
on your in your application so what a
bubble cursor is doing is it's showing
you the distance from the nearest point
or like nearest available space a piece
of information you want to interact with
from the cursor effectively its defining
fitts law in real time to the nearest
point on the plane so it makes in it
makes it very intuitive for the user to
just click that said
aesthetics can kind of be applied to
this and can be de-emphasized a little
bit better and can work yeah of course
of course you can't see it on the screen
designed for the medium that you're
going to be presenting on like using the
visualization for is a good note so that
said all of these techniques can be
layered and work out cross every
visualization that that's out there so
Andrew couch created this great example
which took a voronoi as an overlay
across a set of a node link diagram
increase the area of the thing that
they're trying to interact with make it
much much more touch friendly or
something like that and it just it feels
a lot easier to grab these points so I'm
gonna like we only really touched on
like two aspects of human computer
interaction there's really a ton more
out there but honestly like this only
gets you but so far you really really
have to know your audience like know the
context that they're in know what the
what problems they're trying to solve
like all too often ignored like I see
just charts thrown onto a page and it's
like oh I did something really cool with
visualization but all you did was go and
ask people what they wanted and give
them a set of charts that they've
requested so you're just staring it like
they stare at the information they're
like oh cool that's exactly what I
thought I'd see all right I'm done and
again this doesn't have to look ugly to
fall into that same category this
visualization looks very aesthetically
pleasing may even have a good couple
things about the interaction design but
it has no idea about the data that's
underlying so you can talk to your users
directly through user studies get
personas to help your team
ground like get grounded on what they're
building do a/b testing but honestly
like I'm not going to cover this stuff
because conferences and other talks
today are really going to be focused on
this like this is a like most I think
most of us in the room are developers
the reality is like just because you do
development and somebody else is a p.m.
or designer doesn't mean that you're
excluded from knowing this information
you really should care about who your
audiences and who you're building for in
order to create great products so again
who is this for you are never the user
ask your customers questions or if
you're doing data journalism they're
your readers so I mean take this example
the context that the the user is coming
in with it's the two thousand twelve
elections so it's between Romney Obama
yeah there's a ton of other people but
why why do they users need to know that
it's in the US they always know it's the
Republican versus Democrat so cut all
that out and then I like understand what
what kind of information they want to
gain they want to know who's going to
win what's the likelihood that these
people are going to win and just to
prove that some of the interactions
design principles like or human computer
interaction things like fitts law are
really important they made it very easy
to interact with any aspect of this
chart but more importantly they knew
what kind of questions people were going
to have as soon as they saw the
information they knew the first thing is
like well what's going to happen if
Florida wins the Republican vote oh that
changed quite a bit what happens now 00
Obama wins so like this this is a great
example of knowing what the users need
and want from the information behind it
expository visualizations like this
they're really fortunate right I mean
they didn't know what the data set looks
like it's completely static and they're
exploring the data themselves to find
find that aha moment or make them like
understand what's going on so like they
they have a bit of an advantage and like
they can just take the user through this
beautiful story about a like through a
huge data set but at the same time like
visualization is used in a lot of other
places I mean most most people don't
think about Airbnb as having a
visualization in it but look at this
from the lens of a data visualization
individual there's a map a huge map
again visualization you you've got a
distribution of the price ranges you've
got common filters I mean this is this
is kind this is common stuff in data
visualization but it's also pretty
common in products and this is really
really well designed like they knew
exactly the first two questions
everyone's going to ask where the heck
am i sleeping tonight and what what does
the bed look like like and they really
tailor the experience for that
constantly reiterating to the user the
price as they're figuring out that
problem yeah they've got they have these
other more advanced features and they're
really important but but the emphasizing
them is also key so again let's pull
this back and apply it to something that
most people consider this data viz it's
a block from Mike Bostock it has to be
so this is a scatterplot right we look
we looked at a scatterplot talked about
Fitz law talked about interacting with
one
so you're going to put a like maybe 300
500 a thousand points on a plane and the
goal for the user that you're setting
out for them is to interact with every
piece or interact with certain pieces of
it honestly I think you should ask the
question of like how does how does this
two dimensions relate to other these
other two dimensions and by doing that
you end up creating a way of the
emphasis alling fitts law of like asked
answering different questions about this
data set that the user couldn't have
answered if they all they were given was
just a way to interact with one point so
to wrap up we talked about some HDI
principles we said how audiences are
extremely important and knowing the use
cases or what they need from this
information is like first and foremost
but before I go I just want to say like
no one to break the rules just because
one person says pie charts suck doesn't
mean you have to you you know you have
to follow it like I really hope to see a
web where we can just take this chart
from that div we put it in because of
images and explode it and think of the
new ways to interact with information so
thank
questions are you talking about this or
oh yeah they interaction okay well first
i want to mention that like the Voronoi
you can kind of really custom tailor it
if and do some complicated math where
you actually take a set of points and
build the Voronoi based off the set of
seeds that'd be a lot of custom code so
that's possible and that set of points
would be along the line that you were
talking about but that said back to this
visualization interactivity happens
assuming yeah there we go they they take
that chart and then bound it which is a
great way if you know gestalt principles
to like focus the user in only when
necessary only when hovering over the
line that they wanted to interact with
so and it's it's kind of derived
interaction I mean it's a hard problem I
couldn't imagine how they iterated on
this one but oh yeah well that's a
really good question like it's yes the
question was how do you know when you
have just too much information on the
page I kind of I haven't formalized it
but it's falls into that whole like you
know it when you see it a problem I
think this one just toes the line really
well and it like again it takes the user
through a story but then once you get
all the way down gets the user bounds
the user into the boxes again that's a
useful technique it's I'm not
invalidating it just it's it needs to be
like we need to rethink the way that we
like that's that as being the only way
to do data visualization it's a really
fine balance so any other questions okay
okay so I mean that's a little bit outs
I mean that's a really really great
question
I mean if you are familiar with a blog
called flowing data they have a ton of
examples from a bunch of different
visualizations and they sometimes like
this is completely unethical they're
actually commiss representing the
information say just completely changing
the scale for one data point I I don't
typically do that and I would say like
when it comes to the ethics of
visualization representing the data and
in the best form possible is really
important so sure let's see if well
that's just ruin everything so there's a
there's a couple of the principles so
one of them is called change blindness
so as I'm going over here and you seem
like this weird like flash of a new a
new slide you have to do a visual diff
like your brain is actually diffing
between the two images so there's
certain scenarios where you want to do a
nice transition between two points a
opportune two states of your application
it's honestly one of the things that
like when you hear a front-end
developers get really excited about full
page web apps like they're really
talking on like oh great I don't have to
design like the transitions are
inherently a heck of a lot better and
like people the experience is better
whether or not we communicate it that
way that's really what we're giving
users by doing a full page web app then
the gestalt principles so let's see if
the internet works so Elijah Meeks who
gave a a talk on our like a workshop
earlier talks about like this concept of
similarity or like goes over there
consult principles and these are just a
couple of them one is similarity which
is like naturally your brain just
assumes that red the red are matched
together you're seeing it actually three
are like vertical lines not horizontal
lines because of the similarity between
the two points
proximity again like just by separating
them out you naturally say this is one
group this is another and then the
concept of enclosure like putting charts
inside of a div can be important because
you're bounding those two sets of data
so there's there's others as well the
rule of thirds is pretty common in
photography and other aspects you want
to follow what's called the golden ratio
oh yeah there's a ton if you want to ask
more I come talk to me later so thank
you
