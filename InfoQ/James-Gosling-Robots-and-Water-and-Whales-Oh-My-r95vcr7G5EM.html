in my new life and it's actually quite a
kick doing doing stuff where I get to be
a user of Java rather than a producer of
Java and it's it's also weird working in
a company where I'm I'm almost the only
classical software engineer there's a
bunch for like double e's who are doing
things with wires and and incidentally
doing programming and you know most of
the the engineers are like mechanical
engineers materials engineers you know
people who actually know a lot about
different kinds of titanium and
different kinds of stainless steel and
you know how you make an ethernet cable
survived 40 tons of shock so I work for
a company called called liquid robotics
and we make this the funny robot that
that swims around in the ocean and you
know why would you want to do this i
mean the ocean is is a pretty critical
place to us as humans and you know we we
have surprisingly little beta on it you
know the people go out and chips and
they make measurements if you want to
get any distance at all into the ocean
the ship's you have to go rent or buy or
whatever cost you know a hundred
thousand dollars a day to operate you
know things like buoys out in the ocean
they you know a weather buoy costs two
or three million dollars a year at least
and that's almost none of that is the
buoy almost all of it is the ship that
goes out to
pair it when somebody rips the solar
panels off and and and and so the so
there's there's there's all of this
ocean there's we get large amounts of
data from satellites but satellites
don't really tell you very much and and
in particular when there's like a
hurricane that tell you what's going on
on the top of the clouds but not what's
on the bottom of the clouds and and so
what would happen if you could make data
dense and cheap rather than then sparse
and expensive and that's that's kind of
the mission of liquid robotics and when
they got new CEO a guy named Bill vas
who used to work at Sun and then he
invited me over that you know take Lucas
and I want you know this is like more
fun than anything I can imagine do you
need a software guy he said well yeah so
that's what I'm doing and and so being
able to you know contribute to something
like this is is is is pretty damn cool
you know the list of projects we have is
huge so the company has kind of a
strange background it caught started in
in 2005 with Roger hind Derek Hine and
Joe rizzi so Joe rizzi is a venture
capitalist in the valley he was an early
senior employee at Fairchild he has a
his a big house on the on the coast of
Hawaii and the Big Island you know
sitting out in his lawn chair you know
pump back whales leaping you know in
front of him going he's going like well
I like to listen to the whales as well
as watching them so then he started this
you know how do you how do you listen to
the whales you know he didn't want to
just like play a recording of whale song
he wanted to listen to that whale and
you know he did be did the obvious you
know he's like you know the EE did the
obvious thing of you know putting a
microphone in a plastic bag and
connecting it to a piece of wire and
rowing out
a mile or so and dropping into the water
and I didn't work it sort of worked but
it didn't really work but he fussed
around a lot and and then he's friends
with a guy named Derek Derek Hine who's
an aerospace engineer and then his son
Roger Hine who's a robotics guy he used
to design robots for doing IC
fabrication and and so Joe pulled in
Derek and then his son Roger to try to
figure out some way that he could build
essentially you know a radio-controlled
car for the ocean because he wanted to
go and listen to Wales and if you so so
so Joe funds this thing called the
Jupiter Foundation and they and they
study whales and if you go to Jupiter
foundation org during whale season in
hawaii you can get real-time streaming
whale song and most of that comes off of
comes off of wave gliders and so since
you know none of these people were
marine engineers they they came up with
something that no marine engineer would
think was would make any rational sense
you know if you're a marine engineer
you're going to come up with something
that involves a propeller and a motor
and this has neither and it's just it's
just the oddest thing and it's brilliant
so it's not your typical robot it
doesn't have arms it doesn't have legs
it's got two parts it's got a piece of
the top that floats it's almost exactly
the same size as a surfboard kind of
looks like a surfboard it's kind of a
chubby surfboard and then there's this
this cable that goes down it's this
rather exotic umbilical that goes down
to this rack with these wings on the
bottom and the wings pivot so they can
sort of do this and the
this in his photograph this photograph
was taken with a very short umbilical
normally the umbilical is is 7 meters or
21 feet long and the the point is that
the that the float is in the is where
the waves are and the glider part that's
this down below is down where the ocean
is calm and the float goes up and down
and it it pulls the glider up and down
and the float has is where all the the
electronics are and where the the solar
cells and the rest of that are and the
the point of having this the sort of
split vehicle is that it it harvests
thrust from the waves right so you've
got the the glider sitting down down
there underwater and then when it gets
when it rises according to buy a wave
you see the these little wings they kind
of pivot downwards as it's dragged up
and you know if you'd if you take your
hand and you push it through water this
way you'll get thrust in that direction
and then and then it when you go down it
pivots this way and true so it just goes
up and down in the waves and it
generates forward thrust the the rack of
wings on the bottom it's just springs
there's no electronics there's no little
motors there's no nothing it's just the
simplest motor you've ever seen it
doesn't go real fast it goes you know
typically about a knot and a half is a
pretty good range but it never stops and
there's essentially nothing to break you
know the the biggest source of strain is
the umbilical and that's one of the most
exotic parts of the whole design is is
the materials in the umbilical because
it has to handle like you know 40 odd
tons of
of tension when things get getting tense
but the waves just the waves just go up
and down and so this thing generates
thrust continuously it manages you know
hundreds of pounds of thrust and and so
it doesn't go fast but if you hang on to
it when you're swimming it really pulls
you know it's and it's it's sort of
deceiving you know if you try to swim
with one of these things you can swim
with it for a while but you get tired
really fast and it just keeps going and
it keeps going and you know one of the
things about scientific instruments is
that actually going fast is not very
useful for them right you you really you
know if you're if you're going through
the water at you know 50 miles an hour
or 10 miles an hour most most
instruments don't work very well right
and and it turns out that about a 122
knots is just about perfect for every
instrument you can think of so the the
wave glider has a lot of different
places where you can attach to off the
the float on the top it's filled with
batteries and electronics there's
there's there's some masks that stick
out on the top so the this the the in a
bunch of the pictures you see one sort
of tall masts that sticks up that
usually has this like sort of grapefruit
sized white ball and that's actually a
weather station and that's a sort of a
Noah quality weather station not your
you're not not your standard hobbyist
weather station and then you can mount
things like like like cameras and you
know video cameras below there's all
kinds of sensors for things like like
wave motion temperature pressure water
chemistry you can test for salinity
there's there's some weird ones that
will actually do
DNA samples of plankton as you go
through there are ones that can test for
like the amount of algae in the water
the amount of various kinds of
petrochemicals in the water you can test
for radiation levels you can do put
sound tensors or whatever this thing is
basically a platform for sensors any
kind of sensors you can think of you can
bolt onto this thing that don't require
like a whole lot of power you can put on
these things and sometimes what would
people do is they is they have something
called a bill dube do something call the
tow fish which is just you know putting
something in a box and towing it behind
and some things want to be in the water
you know like really calm and so then
you just just sort of tow that behind so
it doesn't get sort of bounced up and
down and and you know the the array of
things is just is just huge so they the
only actuator the only sort of like
robotically controlled thing with a
motor on it is is is the rudder that's
the only that's the only actuated thing
and the actuator for the rudder is
actually pretty cool because it's
actually a magnetic linkage so there's
the there's a worm gear that drives the
motor with a with that drives a magnet
and then the rudder is magnetically
coupled to that so it's it's it's some
it's really if it survives all kinds of
crap I mean the engineering around this
is mostly about how do you survive
really serious conditions and and be
there for a very long time and a lot of
it rests on exotic material so it's it's
it's it's weird being with people who
you know know like like all kinds of
strange ways to make wire and
you know why different kinds of
stainless steel are different there's I
always thought there was a stainless
steel and there's like hundreds of kinds
of stainless steel you know and I sort
of wondered oh why don't you do use like
carbon fiber in this thing it's like
well because carbon fiber is conductive
and you know when you've got a conductor
in salt water and metals you you know
you electrolysis the whole thing away so
can't use carbon fiber and you know
typical fiberglass isn't actually strong
enough so it's like it's kind of weird
it's all weird stuff that I don't really
understand so inside the the parts with
wires there are these dry boxes in the
in the in the in the float the one in
there's one in the middle it's called
the command-and-control dry box the the
current version of it which the current
version runs this strange atmel
something or other processor you know
it's got like 64k Abraham it's it's
really spooky there's a so I'm working
on like neck of a next-generation one
which has like a real processor in it
which it's you know it's an arm nine and
actually can run java SE and get all of
that the the ones that are all the old
ones that are out there right now are
using this really tiny processors and
it's just being a pretty stunning that
they managed to get the current ones to
do what they do but you know when the
when the sales guys talk to customers
the set of things that the customers
want to do and just like crazy and doing
it on a tiny little embedded processor
like that is just just breaking
completely so the company is in the
midst of doing this like complete
rebuild of all the software on the
inside and i'm the big chunk of that so
we do most of our communication using
the Iridium satellite network iridium is
pretty much the only game in town we can
use
gsm if you're close to shore but we're
almost never close to shore you know you
know once you're more than a few miles
offshore you know gsm stops stops
working there's some places in hawaii
where it works to like 10 miles offshore
but otherwise you're you're using
iridium and an iridium has either what's
called rudich switch gives you streaming
serial data or something called sbd
they're short bursts data which is
essentially text messages but the thing
that's this that's the real killer in it
is one dollar a kilobyte and so so
people have been building networking
protocols around you know these you know
multi-gigabit networks and you know
let's use XML because it's so wonderful
and add a dollar a kilobyte the game is
really really different the the protocol
it's that's currently used is literally
you know AC struct and a right and it's
got you know lots of dead fields and
it's good I've got a new one that's
essentially compressed binary Jason and
I actually went through the you know
survey all you know because I sort of
went through
and there's a bunch of interesting
binary Jason packages out there and and
they were like
deltoids kilobytes no I can do better
you don't have to do very much better
for it to pay off at a dollar a kilobyte
so I ended up doing my own compressed
binary Jason and I'm actually pretty
happy with it so we really don't have a
big data problem right you know yeah so
so so so so if you can if you can fill
up one disk drive of a conventional you
know machine it's you know if you know
you can go to frys by a 3 terabyte drive
that will cost you 3 billion dollars to
fill it right so at about the time we
fill our first disk drive we can afford
to launch our own satellite
constellation so it's it's it's
different right and one of the things
that I found interesting in this in this
job is I've you know got all this all
this paths of doing stuff with people
around doing enterprise computing and
web computing and just about everything
in this is just different and the dollar
kilobyte thing it just shows up shows up
everywhere but we do care a whole lot
about timeliness and continuous
operation because these things are being
operated out in the ocean they're in
proximity with other ships you know if a
if a data center goes down then we've
got you know wandering aimless robots
you know killer machines with laser
cannons on them and you know we these
things have you know the motor that
doesn't doesn't stop so we literally
have to be on top of them 24 by 7 you
know we can't take a data center down on
Saturday night to to reboot things like
ever you know currently we have
you know it's it's we're not to where we
need to be so so when you've got this
this sort of free propulsion a really
rugged system all the electrical power
for the the onboard electronics comes
from the solar cells various folks that
the company have spent a lot of time
trying to find ways to harvest
electrical energy from the waves it
turns out to be a really really hard
problem you know partly because you know
the energy that you get out of waves
kind of move slowly you know and most
you know you know if you like moving
coils whatever you know that to get much
efficiency things have to go fast and
then you get to more complex complex
mechanical things and then you get into
survive salt water for a year because we
try to be out there for a year so we
still haven't found anything better than
just using solar cells on the top so
what do you do with these things we have
all kinds of folks so so this is a NOAA
weather buoy my somewhere in the Gulf of
Mexico I think and this is one of our
guys that is the essentially a plug-in
replacement for this guy and one of the
the big differences for our little guy
versus this guy is that our guy installs
itself right with it with a normal buoy
you have to go out with a big ship with
a buoy about a two-ton hunk of concrete
and a couple of miles of cable you know
you drop the buoy into the ocean and
that you know the weight has to go all
the way to the bottom and the cable has
to be you know twice as long as the
depth of the ocean there and it anchors
and you know the buoys get get ripped
off and the ships that take them out
they cost like a hundred thousand
dollars a day and you ended you know a
couple servicing missions a year and the
servicing mission is like a week or two
round-trip it gets real expensive really
fast whereas our guys you literally
throw them off the dock and they then
they drive themselves out to the middle
of the Atlantic and then they sit there
doing donuts and this guy is literally I
mean we if you look at some of our data
you see our guys sort of going in in in
circular patterns and normally that's
doing doughnuts around a buoy to do
calibration and I'll show you some of
that a little later but you know after
they've been on station for like six
months or you know if we start doing
onboard diagnostics but I mean right now
we do onboard diagnostics except that
it's not onboard diagnostics it's it's
it's human beings looking at polemo tree
going that's not right i mean it's it's
really manual involves a lot of paper
and data and it all has to be automated
because we're rapidly entering a time
when we have way too many of these until
they can you know go back and forth
there's a lot of interest in the oil and
gas business for all kinds of all kinds
of reasons everything from you know
doing water chemistry test so like like
the Macondo well you know doing
doughnuts around the Macondo well
sampling the water quality in the Gulf
of Mexico there's all play all sorts of
places where the the oil actually just
seeps up from the ground and and you get
these oil these oil slicks on the
surface and so we can actually go
hunting for them you know people are
starting to do things like marine mammal
monitoring so the that you know if
there's a humpback whale near me
one of these oil rigs they have to shut
down and right now what they do is that
they have like you know guys up on the
mast with binoculars and if they see a
humpback whale they have to shut down
and of course like having guys looking
out there for humpback whales is not
real effective and oddly enough it
doesn't work at night so you know it's
always so so there's a lot of lot of
business there this is this is I don't
know which rig this is that this
photograph was taken several hundred
miles off the coast in the Gulf of
Mexico and that this guy is literally
doing doughnuts around that around that
oil rig there's a bunch of folks
interest in doing marine mammal
mutterings you know some of its for some
of it's for science some of its for
folks like like like the Navy and the
oil companies who have you know strict
regulations about you know what they can
do you know they via the oil companies
they you know when they're doing like
seismic surveys and that kind of stuff
they liked it you let off bombs in the
water and that's not that's not a good
thing when there's things that can be
hurt nearby you can do things like
picket fences around marine sanctuaries
so you know we really just like you know
staying in a row and just just take
photographs of ships that come by we can
do global warming studies there's a
there's a group of them offshore from of
the state of Washington that are doing
these studies to measure sort of carbon
exchange between the air and the water
and looking at like dissolved oxygen in
the water and ends RT owed co2 in the
water last summer we had a we had some
that were up in the Arctic doing a
survey of ocean temperatures that was
larger the largest survey of ocean
temperatures in the Arctic ever
on data was scary yes global warming is
real it's really you know weird to find
places in the Arctic Ocean that you
could actually go swimming it's it's
it's not a happy place there's there's
all kinds of weird sensors you can put
on some of them well we'll sense and
count fish some of them says that so
there there are a lot of instruments
that people put on the on the bottom of
the ocean you know things like like like
like seismometers but you know how do
you get the data out of a seismometer I
mean right now they do one of two things
either they string a really long wire or
they have a ship come out like like once
a month and park overboard over over top
of it and they use an acoustic modem and
the acoustic maybe if for those of you
with gray hair who can remember the the
acoustic modems that you know when you
you know that make the funny whistling
sounds these are pretty much exactly
that and and and so the the thing on the
surface talks to that right now it's
mostly done with ships at a hundred
thousand dollars a day we can do that
for a lot less and then we we sort of
turning to a relay between the the
sensor on the on the seafloor and the
and the satellite and they're all kinds
of sensors their seismic sensors like I
mentioned there are tsunami sensors it
turns out that the way you sense a
tsunami is not by trying to measure the
sea surface height because it's it's
only like an extra meter or two and it's
kind of lost in the noise of the waves
but the way you the way you can you can
sense it is you put a graviton mateur at
the bottom of the ocean and when you get
a a rise in the sea level over a large
area you actually notice a change in the
Earth's gravitational
field and and and so you can sense it
from the bottom of the ocean you can't
sense it from the top and then if you've
got a got a got a tsunami sensor out
there how do you get the data off
because you have to get the data off now
it doesn't make any sense to get it off
like a month later and and so like like
there are places where they put these
things down and they stretch a really
long wire like a 500-mile wire out to
the sensor and the wire costs way more
than than the sensor and it's almost
always broken you know at any one time
like like half of the world's weather
buoys are broken anyway there's there's
just a huge pile of things you can do
with them and a lot of it is because you
know they're mobile and they're really
really tough so they can take you know
giant storms you know if you know when
when you know the Hurricanes come
through the Gulf of Mexico you know all
the ships go into port and our little
guys they just kind of like stay out
there and you know they like waves we've
had we've had robots go through pretty
astonishing pretty astonishing storms
they've they've been through you know
150 mile an hour winds you know the bad
parts of a hurricane you know tropical
monsoons they've been through North Sea
gales it's actually pretty shocking what
they've been through we had a we had
we've only had two shark incidents in
the in the seven years of the car that
the company has been around one of which
was like hard to tell that there was a
shark incident that all there was just
like a scratch on one wing but then just
before Christmas we had we had this one
it's kind of hard to tell how big that
is but this thing got got really badly
savaged by a very very large shark we
actually still don't know what kind of
market was and and it's been so defying
any kind of every biologist we've taken
the shark fragment to it too they've
haven't been able to successfully do
like DNA testing or anything like that
and you can see these these right here
this is all these are all tooth
scratches and so this this guy had it
had these wings in his mouth you know
and these and you know these these wings
are like you know three feet three feet
three four feet long and the you know
when you look at these they really all
he actually did was scratch the paint we
pulled this this is one of the cables we
pulled it out of its its protective
housing and and but right in here that's
the that's the tooth it's like actually
embedded in there and the whole thing
actually was perfectly fine it went
through this like you know this guy was
really chomping on it except there's one
little place where there's one where the
wire as actually goes like around a
spring and it's on the outside and if
you look really closely right there you
can see where a tooth went through and
that's that's the wire that goes right
back in here this is the rudder module
and so we lost contact with the rudder
and so the thing was in perfect health
except we couldn't talk to the rudder so
it it drifted and fortunately had
drifted out towards Maui and we sent a
sent a boat out to pick it up so
actually that boat was a part of this
this this thing we've been doing called
the pack x challenge is kind of a
marketing stunt last November we sent
for wave gliders out across the across
the ocean with this is so we've made the
whole dataset public it turns out to be
odd to make this these these large
datasets public
and I'm you know mr. you know publish
the data all the data publishing stuff
has been stuff that I've written so this
has been like a big big piece of the
pain and agony of my life lately but
this but the data from this has been
showing up in in all kinds of strange
places so we we went from from San
Francisco to Hawaii they did Donuts in
Hawaii and we did some repair and
tune-up and the the guy who cut the
shark mauling had a little extra TLC
that he needed and now they're there
they're on their way after that two of
them are are heading to japan and two of
them are heading to australia and then
the ones that are going to australia
will probably end up circumnavigating
australia then just keep on going so I
thought I'd actually you know so i just
did they did the kind of company
overview what we do I thought I'd sort
of rat hole into one random piece of the
stuff that I'm working on this this is
this is either the most fun and
entertaining thing I've done in the last
several months or the stupidest thing
I've done in the last of Ramon's it
depends on whether it's an even-numbered
day or an odd-numbered day you know when
we get telemetry off of these craft you
know they come in and we have to you
know manage all of that so I built a
system for managing all of that all of
that telemetry and and the system going
to describe it it's it's coefficient of
reality is definitely less than one and
the amount of vapor is definitely
greater than zero but there's more
reality than vapor I mean the last two
things i showed you are all you know
we're all working live off of this
streaming data back end none of it's
rocket science it's you can think of it
as i sort of a lightweight very
specialized thing that's kind of like
like like like JMS you know it's it's
cues of messages that you send it's a
publish and subscribe kind of thing it's
really really simple
I try really you know as a general
policy I try hard to not reinvent things
and but this was really optimized for
small things that flow where it's where
it's a stream where there's there
everything as a timestamp where I really
care about the time and I really care
about reliability I really care about
things you know being able to survive
you know machines crashing data centers
crashing whatever but I also carry care
a lot about authentication that I
because every pack every data sample
from every wave glider can potentially
be differently authenticated and it's
and it's not trying to be like a
general-purpose messaging system you
know like like all of the stuff that you
find in Java EE so it's it's actually a
somewhat track t'kul problem and you
know repeating again it's not a big data
problem right and you know when you're
not trying to solve the you know
gigabits per second sort of a streaming
big data problem things get a little a
little easier so and and you know like i
said before failures leave fleets of
flailing robots which is generally a bad
thing none of them actually contain
laser cannons but it would be fun so our
data model is really simple
fundamentally the data model in this is
just a bag of bytes there have to be
ways to crack open the bag of bytes to
get properties from them like the
identity of the vessel that they came
from the day the identity of the
instrument that they came from but the
identification of the that all that
identification stuff is not attached to
the packet it's extracted from the
packet by something that cracks it and
that happens later and it might happen
again
but hold that for a second so so the
this this this this the system is
straightforward there are nodes in it
the nodes contain data the nodes can
publish data and and other folks can
subscribe to the data and and on the
publish and subscribe sides there's
there's sort of two to two things one is
one is that when you subscribe you
express your interests and that's it's
effectively a boolean expression
describing the set of things you want to
see and authentication you you give it
your login credentials and associated
with all login credentials is a set of
properties they use open am for it for
for everything and it gives you the
ability to associate these are groups or
privileges with with users this is sort
of role based authentication thing but
the the individual data entities can
have associated with them an expression
that says you know this is the set of
authentications that are required in
order to have access to this this piece
of data you know so you can say you know
this you know the data from this with
this this wave glider is accessible to
people who are in the research division
at at british petroleum or you can say
you know the data from the weather
sensor to this can go to noah but none
of the other data from the craft can go
to noah and so it's it's this sort of
fine grain thing because we because we
end up wanting to take the data streams
from these and slice and dice them and
send the data streams to different
people at different times and of course
when you can publish and subscribe you
just publish and subscribe to each other
and the two nodes are chatting and once
you can chat you can
create meshes of things that chat so you
put a piece of data in and it sort of
chats back and forth if you don't watch
out things just sort of echo back and
forth it does a fairly straightforward
way of canceling that out it's you know
the way that people send email about
viral videos you know the interview send
you know here's a great video of a
sneezing of a sneezing Panda and then
you either say oh and usually send the
mail to all your friends or you say
boring seeing that and so these packets
come in from someplace like like iridium
may not be a really might be gsm might
be whatever and they they they hit one
node and or multiple nodes and then that
they just sort of go through and you get
this sort of eventual consistency
network that's that's the that's pretty
that's pretty standard one of the things
that I've was really careful about this
is not using any of the special ap is
that various internet service providers
have because I've had enough experience
with ISPs even like you know the the big
ones light like Amazon of have had a
reasonable number of incidents where you
know they they have like software bugs
that will take out an embarrassingly
large part of their their infrastructure
so I can actually build clusters that
that cross ISPs so so currently i'm
running nodes at three different ISPs
you have a few ago grid I have a few at
one called antic that I like a lot
they're actually one of the few Solaris
ISPs but you know their whole claim to
fame is machines don't go down they
actually use all the weird Solaris
features for being able to migrate
machines so they they can actually you
know repair hardware without with zero
downtime
a little just migrate running virtual
machines from one piece of physical
hardware to another and you know repair
it and whatever so you can go literally
years with no downtime with them and one
of my favorite stunts was they actually
migrated from one whole data center to
another with no detectable downtime for
me then there's another one company
called J elastic they're becoming my i
really love j elastic there a it's
actually a software package that a
number of ISPs are using but it's a it's
a java hosting system and and so you
don't get like a bear linux machine what
you get is a is a as a as a java ee
container and you can drop war files on
it and they've got this really nice nice
control panel where you get get a slider
that says you know how many how many
clones have these things of glassfish do
you want you know checkbox that says you
know you want you know my sequel or
cassandra or Mongo or whatever and you
know there's like nothing you don't have
to go into the Linux oh my god you know
what it takes to install anything and
you know you you know it's like which
version of Linux is compatible with with
which app server at what times it's like
no they they just take care of that and
it works lovely but I actually build
these buildings clusters and have them
span multiple isps and they can span
multiple countries multiple data centers
and that's how I deal with my you know
personal extreme paranoia about the
survivability of these things and so if
you have an app that's talking into the
cluster you can do the the normal thing
of making one connection and then if it
fails then you switch over but for the
truly paranoid you can actually do
multiple subscriptions and one of the
weird things about this is it really
isn't a server it's an API and there's
there's fundamentally two classes one is
the data pool and the other one is an
endpoint and the endpoints
the the communication channel is is one
way everything is always a synchronous
so when you create a socket you get what
you really get is two one-way
connections and you and your streaming
stuff back and forth and it's all using
compressed binary Jason and and and and
and so you can you can have these things
there they're talking to each other they
the apps can can can can tie in and they
and they inside the app they're using
the same API in the same software so if
you run you're essentially running this
instance of the server inside the app
and so all of the duplicate detection
stuff that the server does to suppress
echoes the app the app ends up using so
that when it's got two streams coming
into it what it actually sees is
effectively one stream of all the unique
packets and it and it it works nicely
and works helps with my sense of
paranoia so you can take one of these
these clusters and you can think of it
as a node and then you can create you
know more more of these clusters that
have you know arcs between them using
that the the same publish and subscribe
but when you do that you can you can
have multiple independent clusters that
stream from one to another for a number
of reasons one is you could do sharding
for another you can we have a lot of
customers that want to have their own
private copy of their data so you know
folks like Noah want all the weather
data off the booze and they want it in
their data centers so it just streams
into their data center one of the
weirder and more psycho things that
turns out to be an issue is that when
you're collecting data from all over the
world you have to worry about legal
jurisdictions there are there are some
countries that that where you have to
have a permit to collect data from
within their territorial waters
and you're you're required to like host
the data within their torch territorial
boundaries and then then there's all
kinds of weird tax issues so if you
collect data from you know the middle of
the Atlantic and you sell it to somebody
in Spain if you end up hosting the data
storing the data in the US you end up
paying US taxes so one of the reasons
that we that I that I take every packet
and think about every packet in the
infrastructure is I take the lat long
and it's it's like okay what tax
jurisdiction are you in right you know
tax jurisdiction as a routing parameter
please lord save me but you know it's it
actually matters one of the other funny
things about the way that this is done
and and you know when I made this
comment about the storage model is just
a bag of bytes right I don't burst the
bag of bytes into anything I don't take
the vessel identify or anything out of
that a lot of that is because i don't
know i don't really have a good word for
it i used retroactivity right it's for
those what the moments and
screw-ups always realize after the fact
and when you're dealing with with with
data from real things you you have to
deal with those what the and the
thing about the the binary blobs is it's
it's just like what happens in a bunch
of the photo apps like like like
aperture you know they don't damage the
original data right they they they
always read arrive for words and all
computations are considered a cash and
and I and in my case every computation
is a cash including determining the
identity of the vessel that this packet
came from the reason that that's
important is that for historical reasons
these packets don't actually have a
vessel identifier in them because at a
dollar kilobyte everything that you know
it you know for you know for like n
bytes or a vessel identifier well I have
that when you've got the the folks that
are ridium very nicely put the phone
number that this thing came from because
all the motives look like they're like
they have phone numbers so we use the
the imei number of the Iridium modem to
identify which vessel the packet came
from if the packet came thru through
iridium where the what the moment
comes in all too often in this one is
people will swap iridium modems back and
forth and then they won't tell me for
like a week or two right and so and so
you've got all this data out there and
it's like attached to the wrong craft
and and and and and so everything is a
cash right and there's there there
there's metadata about all the vehicles
and the metadata has things like you
know the imei number of the Iridium
modem on it but the imei number isn't
just a number it's actually a time
sequence it's it's it's a it's a
sequence of imei numbers and dates so
that they because the imei number
changes every time you like swap in a
new one and you can mutate the metadata
so you go back in and you and you change
the the metadata for the for the for the
uridium modem upload that and then
magically all of the data is reek Atta
guys so that then you know it's all
sorted out and it's like oh thank you
lord so you know you know I started out
you know trying to use all the the job
of messaging EE stuff and it kind of
fell apart and I'm on good days I think
it was a good decision on bad days I
think it's a you know it's a stupid
decision but it's certainly we
word and authentication I think I talked
a lot about authentication already I
mostly use use use open am open D s I've
been really a really happy user open am
you know the thing that used to be
called so an identity manager but it's
now a product from there's this company
called Ford rock which is actually a lot
of the folks who used to work for sun
that did sounded identity manager and
the CEO is sons former head SE for
Europe and Ford rock is doing a nice
business they're doing a really good job
if you're a son identity manager
customer it works really really well I
just drops in and and so thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
