are enjoying the conference I know I am
so yeah we're gonna talk about how I
think we can be effective remote
developers so as mentioned I've was one
of the first developers at stitch fix so
I've been there over four years and
during that time worked with a wide
variety of people you know of course
developers right but a lot more than
that right businesspeople people running
stitch fix users people using the
software that we're building vendors all
of that so all remote right day one you
know me and developers number one and
two decided we were gonna make remote
work because I was not going to move to
San Francisco and so we did and now four
years later we've got over 80 maybe
close to 90 developers now and most of
the work is done remotely right so over
half of the development team doesn't
live in the Bay Area where the company
is headquartered those that do live in
the Bay Area yes they come to the office
don't come every single day so a lot of
our engineering work is done remotely
and so hopefully we can take some tips
about that but what do we what do we
mean remotes I was thinking about this
like there's there's actually a lot of
configurations of work that technically
qualify as remote and to which
everything in this talk should apply so
I tried to come up with a pithy
description this is not the greatest
English sentence ever written but I
think it kind of captures it right your
remote if you do not often interact
face-to-face with the people that you
work with right so you go somewhere to
do work maybe that is your office maybe
that is a coffee shop maybe that is some
you know co-working space and you work
with people at your job and those people
are not there most of the time so that
means you're doing remote work so
there's a lot of ways that this sort of
works right there's the lone wolf which
is super hard mode right you're all by
yourself and everyone else you work with
is that some office and you have to deal
with that that's hard easy mode is
everyone is distributed so no one goes
to an office everyone is having the same
kind of experience but multiple offices
is a form of remote work right like if
you get up and have a commute and go to
an office in New York every day but the
people you work with are in some office
in San Francisco well you're a remote
worker because they're not there
so you have the same challenges that are
you know the fully distributed in the
lone wolf half so talk about effective
in the title two what is what does that
mean so obviously you know you need to
produce value right you're hired to do a
thing and you need to get that thing
done but it's me and I guess also you
want to work on a thing that is valuable
right you don't want to just come in and
do like pointless work so you want that
to be happening you also want to have
agency right you don't want your job to
just be closing JIRA tickets all day you
want to have some sort of control over
what you're doing how you're working how
you interact with people are you have
some sort of effect beyond just the JIRA
tickets that you're closing every day
you want to feel included right you want
to feel like you're part of the team all
working collectively to get something
done together
you're not just that dude off in Alabama
who we email stuff to right like you
want to feel like you're part of part of
the team and right you want the
experience to be rewarding I mean at
least as rewarding as having to have a
job can be now I don't want to imply
that you just get these for free by
everyone showing up to an office like of
course not but you get a little bits of
that stuff right think about inclusion
right if you're all sitting in the same
room you're kind of by default included
on the team because you're all there so
when you're remote all of those things
are harder to achieve and you have to be
pretty intentional about how to how to
make that happen and that's what that's
what we'll talk about and you know the
stuff that we'll hear is not right
they're not easy things to do right this
isn't a thing where you just install
slack and everybody's good you have to
constantly up keep your remote
experience and you know not a week goes
by that I don't spend some time thinking
about like what am i doing for my road
experience or the people that I work
with what have I done - like harm or
help that right like it's a constant
thing that you have to do which sounds
like a lot of work but of course it's
worth it those of you who raised your
hand as remote developers certainly know
right you get a freedom and flexibility
that you don't get by having to go to an
office right so like I don't have a
commute that's nice
I can make lunch in my kitchen and in
fact my kitchen is stocked with the
snacks that only I like
I don't have to use a public bathroom my
favorite part though about working route
is I don't have to live in San Francisco
right it's great love not living in San
Francisco but the company gets a benefit
out of it too right so they get access
to a wider pool of talent so if stitch
fix had decided the only way to build
this team is everybody has to come to
some office in San Francisco and that's
just how it is then by definition right
we have access to fewer people when I
was preparing this talk I discovered an
interesting fact that there are lots of
really amazing developers who don't live
in Silicon Valley it's crazy but it's
true and so stitch fix has access to all
of all of them across the country maybe
even the world and so that just makes it
easier for us to build the team that we
want and that could have had a real
impact on the company's success right if
you think about a functioning company
right there's always more work to do
than there are engineers right because
the opposite of that would be weird so
that means that the stuff your company
can produce is kind of limited by the
size and makeup of your engineering team
and so if you're restricting who can be
on that team to just some location then
you're slowing down your ability to
deliver things right and that could have
real consequences so we avoided that by
making remote work but it's not just the
company's responsibility it's our
responsibility to and this is how we do
that right I'm not gonna talk about
chatbots
we're gonna talk about building and
maintaining trust with the people that
you work with like this is the only way
to make it work and you have to be
intentional about it you have to adopt
some mindsets that we'll talk about and
those will drive behaviors that will
build trust with people that you don't
know and maintain trust with people that
you do know and all of that sort of
makes you work better right if you're
trusted and you trust the people that
you work with and you're gonna be
working on important things because you
trust them you will trust that they will
include you you will if you're trusted
then you are allowed to have agency
beyond just those JIRA tickets that
you're closing right and it's much more
rewarding to work somewhere where you
trust and are trusted so that's what
we'll kind of talk about does anyone
heard this phrase the half-life of trust
is six weeks I'd heard it before I
didn't know where it came from and I
found it on this link and I'm sorry it
said well it's not that tiny but you're
never gonna copy that down you can click
on it when you get the slides but it's
an article by Steve McConnell who is a
noted
software books such as code complete and
in the article he's talking about his
frustrations with she could see the tile
offshore development so he's in the
United States his team is in India so
it's like super hard remote because
there's no time overlap other side of
the world and so they're talking about
like trust right that that's that not
only is that a key to making it work and
trusting that team and the team trusting
him but that it has to be replenished
right the half-life is a good way to
think about it right if you like work
with someone you build up a lot of trust
and then like that's it and then you
don't see them for a while you don't
interact with them then that trust is
gonna start to go away not gonna
disappear but it's gonna go away so you
have to actively replenish it seeing
people in person helps replenish it
right but all the time in between seeing
people in person you have to do other
things to kind of keep it up and that's
a wool that's what we'll talk about
so I mentioned these mindsets so there's
I think four mindsets that if you
adopted them they will drive behaviors
that will then help you build and
maintain trust and we'll talk about some
of those behaviors but if you think
about them there's gonna be lots and
lots of things to do so communicate
frequently and clearly be responsive but
set boundaries assume good intentions
and help others help you so we're gonna
talk about these things in the context
of various activities and ways that we
work so we'll talk about it with coding
communication socializing things like
that but we do need to talk about
technology a little bit this is the
least interesting it's the easiest but
it does have to happen you have to have
some way to communicate with people and
that means that you have to have a piece
of technology if you're all in an office
you don't technically need technology
because you can go find the person you
want to talk to and talk to them when
you are not with that person then you
need something right years ago it was a
telephone now we have better tools and
you're going to need them and everyone
has to agree to use them so you'd a chat
system this is easy to use and that
includes people who are not developers
like everyone you work with has to be
willing and able to go into whatever
that chat system is so I'm sorry IRC is
not it regular people cannot use that
but you know slack HipChat whatever they
all work fine and so that's good for
asynchronous communication but you're
going to need to be able to talk to
people kind of real
right so you're gonna need some sort of
video conferencing system that can
support multiple people talking at one
time and that allows you to share your
screen anyone like using WebEx anyone
love WebEx yeah yeah all right nice
I hate WebEx but it meets the standard
right so that means that it's the bar is
low you just need something Google
Hangouts works great we use the thing
called blue jeans they are they all have
an equal level of terribleness but they
all do work and you need this right and
so what's interesting about this and
we'll talk about it more later but this
video conference is the way that most
people will experience you as a person
you know over a screen over the terrible
internet and as we know everything
between you and someone else goes over
the Internet through terrible
infrastructure awful software
none of it like really technically works
and you have no control over that but
you do control what goes into it right
which is your microphone and your laptop
microphone is shitty I'm sorry to tell
you but it's terrible and you don't want
people to experience your voice through
your crappy laptop mic so you need a
better microphone Apple earbuds are
perfectly acceptable right they totally
work fine so again the bar is not high
okay
technology over back to the harder part
which is building and maintaining trust
so I talked about like the activities
that we do as developers so I want to
talk about each of these four things and
then we'll talk about how the mindsets
apply to these four things and drive the
behaviors when you're doing these things
right coding asynchronous communication
like emails or documents synchronous
communication like the aforementioned
video chat and socializing so coding
that's the thing that we do as
developers that's what we're hired to do
hopefully we spend most of our time
doing that and code is our work product
I get is the thing that we are producing
it is the artifact by which most people
will judge us as employees co-workers
whatever you have it because that's what
we're doing all day so how do we
communicate frequently and clearly when
we're coding so you've all been in an
office with programmers before I'm
assuming like what is that what does
that look like okay everyone's typing on
a keyboard and to something like black
rectangle and like they look like
they're programming right I mean maybe
the not but the cow looks like they're
programming I'm type it away so it must
be programming so even as silly as that
sounds that's like something like it
looks like someone's doing something
when you're remote you get
none of that right no one knows that
you're doing anything because you're
just not there they can't observe you
know what's going on with your black
rectangle and your keyboard so you need
to find a way to make big projects into
lots of smaller ones so that you can get
your work in front of people and produce
a kind of cadence of productivity of
shipping things like that this is
surprisingly hard many great developers
do the opposite they take small projects
and make them into big ones so you kind
of fight hard to do it another way
and what this does especially if you're
new on a team is it you know it lets
people like understand what you're
working on and get feedback on smaller
things which are easier to understand it
also demonstrates that you are motivated
by getting a thing done having a result
shipping and people who kind of drive to
a result are trusted more than people
who aimlessly never ship things and on
that note right when you're when you're
making changes like always and
aggressively think about what is the
smallest viable change I can make I mean
you go into some code base to make a
change and there's some terrible class
it needs to be refactored or the white
spaces into your taste or maybe the
tests are written in a wrong way like
don't change any of that don't just you
know fix lots of extra stuff that has
nothing to do with the problem that
you're solving I might say fix it later
but probably you should never fix it
later anyway just like focus on the
problem at hand right and so smallest
viable change and the viable right is
important right you're not just like
don't make a bunch of into the
codebase like it's got to be good and to
the standards that you hold yourself to
and all that but what is the smallest
thing that gets the job done and the
advantage of this is that a small change
is easy to understand and so when you're
writing code presumably there's some
process by which somebody has to say yes
that can go to production whatever that
is that person or people have to
understand what you've done and so by
having the change be small and compact
and easy to understand that's more
likely to happen it also again stresses
that you're driving to results that
you're not getting lost in some like
aimless refactoring that you don't
really need to do right now and that you
want to get things done and it's just
easier to get feedback along those lines
right you're gonna probably write some
sort of text to go along with your
change maybe that's just a commit
message or maybe that's like a pull
request
you're gonna do something to say why am
I writing this code at all and write it
better than maybe you think because this
might be the only thing people know
about to like judge what your changes
they can't go over to your desk and be
like I didn't understand that what's
going on they might not even know that
they don't understand what you're doing
because you haven't set any context so
write a better change request what I try
to do every time is we use github so we
may pull requests and so I will take a
problem hit return I always have what
problem am i trying to solve briefly hit
return type solution hit return outlined
very briefly what my solution is or why
I did it the way I did like you know the
small change small pull requests large
change large pull request write more
tactically learning how to screencast
and diagram and like so much that it's
just as easy to do that as it is to
write is hugely powerful so early at
stitch fix I you know I was building
software for people who work in a
warehouse so like there's no way I'm
gonna like be with them because like a
the warehouse is not in DC where I live
be if I were in San Francisco it's also
not in San Francisco so I had to you
know work with them remotely when I'm
building software for them and I would
write these very long emails that were
like here's how it works and here's a
screenshot
here's arrows and it was just you know a
lot and you know no engagement right I
mean no I hear nothing like that's that
can't have nailed it right there's no
way that I but that was perfect so I
started making screencasts using this
thing called Jing it's free to make a
five minute or less screencast you can
share it privately online and I would
just use the app in my development
environment and talk over and explain
what was going on tons of engagement
right a lot lots of feedback positive
and negative helping me do better at my
job because I could demonstrate what I
was doing without having to sort of
assault somebody with a with a wall of
text and after a while right you get
good at that and then it's just another
tool in your toolbox right it's just as
simple as typing so commit to doing that
diagramming same deal we'll talk about
that a little bit more in a sec okay be
responsive but set boundaries so not
really about coding but the first and
most important boundary are your working
hours especially if you have multiple
time zones right anybody like doing time
zone math right if you work with someone
in Arizona or that weird County in
Indiana like it's really difficult and
regular people aren't gonna do it at all
so just tell them right
I work eastcoast hours or whatever it is
so I put that in my email signature and
then you know people are not gonna
necessarily know and so they might
schedule a meeting with you that's like
8 o'clock you just be cool hey that's a
little after my working hours can we
schedule that later or however it is
people want to know but they don't have
a way to figure it out so just tell them
right setting boundaries now in terms of
being responsive right we talked before
about your writing code making a pull
request you're essentially asking
someone to say yep that looks good
so probably right every pull request you
write it's probably not 100% perfect so
you're gonna have some feedback and you
want that feedback and so when you make
a change that is asking for feedback
your job then becomes to respond to that
feedback right your job is not to go off
and do the next thing it is to like
figure out what you need to do to get
that thing shipped and and engage with
anyone who's responding right so that
there's a couple of things one it lets
people get to know you how you work how
you think you can go back and forth it
demonstrates that you are sort of
driving to to shipping things too it
capitalizes on the context that someone
has built up by looking at your code if
you're quick to respond right they've
they've figured out what you're trying
to do and they've got some feedback and
if you don't respond for like a day then
they've forgotten all that stuff and
then you got to start all over again
so being quick means you can you know
capitalize on that and that right it
doesn't waste their time so that is nice
and people who don't waste others time
are trusted so and so what I've learned
is this is a very long bullet you have
to have you have to develop a workflow
that is not like hours and hours of
disconnected from the world while I'm
coding and I know that sucks to hear and
that is hard to do because we like to
get into our flow but the world is
happening around you and no one can see
you and no one knows what you're doing
while you're in that flow and you could
miss things that are important times for
you to engage on something so the way I
like to think about it and I can tell
you my whole crazy scheme after this if
you want to know but I have in my mind
SLA is for all types of communication
right service level agreements so for
example
someone private messages me and slack I
will read that within five minutes I
won't respond but I will read it or at
least see if I need to read it write
several times an hour I will look at my
inbox I will not read emails but I will
look at the subjects quickly scanning
for anything that's important that is
more important than the code that I'm
writing or whatever I'm happened to be
working on because that exists there are
things like that and so you know you
just kind of get into a habit and then
organize your work in a way that lets
you kind of leave your context and come
back to it at i/o about that later you
have to figure out whatever works for
you right don't be hours and hours
offline because then you will not be
responsible assume good intentions right
anyone enjoy having their code reviewed
or thinking about the first time you had
your code reviewed how pleasant that was
we are not a culture and a profession of
critique at all if any of you have
worked with architects or designers you
know that they very much are and what
that means is that they're good at
critiquing and we are not good at
critiquing and a bad critique is one
that hurts and feels bad and you're like
why are you saying that and this my work
product how can you talk about right
it's very hard and so maybe someday
engineering programming will be good at
critiquing but until then you have to
assume that the person who's telling you
things about your code is just trying to
help even if they're not like doing it
in a nice way
right because they want to make it
better like if they didn't care they
wouldn't bother commenting at all and
it's hard but it's the only way forward
right when you get when there's critique
you have to assume everyone's trying to
help you and that's just the only the
only way to make any sense of it now
leading to the next thing helping others
help you what I've also found is that
people who are terrible at critiquing
your code by typing text are often good
at doing it another way so if you can
figure out what everyone's kind of best
mode of communication is go to them
there right so there's a developer on my
team just doesn't engage on pull
requests or when he does it's like it's
not it's not good but if I talk to him
for five minutes I can save myself hours
of maddening back-and-forth and it's
very pleasant so you know you build up
an index of everyone on your team and
what is their deal and then go to them
and then that makes everything much
smoother
also being specific about what you want
what kind of feedback you want so right
putting up a portal class I feel like
here you go that's not very helpful that
you could be more helpful
so saying like here's what I want to
look at and this does a couple of things
right thing number one that's kind of
obvious is unless we will focus on what
to look at lets them kind of more
quickly get up to speed and engage with
you and and all that stuff but the other
thing too is it's a chance to show some
vulnerability in a very safe way right
hey I wrote this class it's very
complicated I couldn't think of a way to
make it better this is the best I can
come up with anyone have any ideas right
and like it's very easy to say that
because code is is more objective than
other things and then when you show that
kind of self-awareness and vulnerability
people will trust what you say more
because you're able to sort of be
self-aware right and those people are
trusted and that means that people will
come to you for honest feedback about
things and that increases your agency
right good knock-on effects okay
that's coding so coding is a form of
asynchronous communication so this is
talking about all the other forms of
asynchronous communication which is
probably email documents project plans
anything we're like you're working on a
thing that is not code and you're not
sitting in the same room or in a video
chat and what this also means is that
this includes a lot more non-developers
since that always makes things a little
tricky because of everyone's different
different communication styles which
we'll talk about so communicating
frequently and clearly providing more
context so when you're talking to
somebody in real life you can see their
eyes glaze over you can see them to lose
interest they can interrupt you when
you're being confusing and ask question
when you're setting an email or a
document like you get none of that and
you may never know if you were
understood you will never possibly know
that like the thing you're trying to
communicate like landed so you want to
increase the chance that that happens by
providing a little bit more context like
what is the backstory of this email like
what is the problem I'm trying to solve
or something to give someone a little
bit better of a chance of like
understanding it because you're probably
not going to get a lot of back-and-forth
asking like what you mean you will
become a much better writer by being
remote and following these rules and
here is the one bow
point of how to be a better writer so
you're writing something that you want
someone to read all right someone fair
that you read it yourself first and then
revise it right when you read what
you've written you always find a mistake
not spelling that grammar but maybe like
going on too long or using the wrong
word or something like that and so if
you do this one bullet point for
everything that you write you will be
much better and you will also feel more
comfortable writing because you know
that you have this revised step to fix
whatever you've done so like if you read
any book on writing it's like make a
shitty first draft right get it on the
page that's that's just get it out of
your head and then you can then you can
fix it right everything I write I read
and revise a typography is important
when I was younger I use an email client
called mutt it works in the terminal and
my opinions on how email should be
formatted which be text fixed with fonts
if you need any formatting you can just
hit return twice to make a paragraph and
that's all you need right it's because I
want to have everything in there and
that's you know bold means things
underline means things bullet points
convey meaning and typography helps
people understand the written word and
there's not that many things you need to
apply put some bullet points in you know
when you get an email from someone
that's a wall of text with no capital
letters and no paragraphs like you
you're not gonna read that and no one's
gonna read that when you produce that so
you know take a little time to command B
on some things that are important and
again diagramming so when you're
communicating technical things in
particular diagrams are super helpful
diagramming tools are hard to use though
but they're learning so if you have a
Mac OmniGraffle just go buy it and learn
all the keyboard shortcuts and when you
do that you can create a very
nice-looking diagram very quickly if you
know you don't I'm sure there's some
equivalent for Windows and Linux another
thing to learn is graphviz which is a
programming language it produces
pictures it is very cool if you can
learn that again you're reducing the
friction to using this different form of
communication that is much more
effective than thousands of words on the
page
okay be responsive and set boundaries a
lot of this is very similar to the code
that we talked about again engaging and
giving feedback so some forms of
communication like with with code you're
doing a thing and producing it but often
people are gonna ask you or ask a group
for an opinion or needing help or
they're gonna need something from you
and so by engaging and giving them
feedback and doing what's asked right
you are more felt so your presence is
felt you were felt as a included member
of the team and this is the way to have
agency this is the way to cultivate your
own leadership is if you have an opinion
on a thing and you don't share that with
anybody kind of doesn't matter right but
if you share that opinion especially
things that you are know well or have
strong feelings about then you can
affect your team by engaging and being
responsive when things are discussed
right if you check email once a day who
knows what conversation happened during
that day that you could have and maybe
should have contributed to but you
didn't because you weren't engaging
weren't being responsive so this is
hugely helpful for having your presence
felt and being a trusted resource to
help other people
don't forget affirming feedback right
one of the the other things about
learning how to critique is that it's
not all a bunch of complaints about how
terrible the thing is yes you want to
find mistakes you want to find things
that are wrong you want to make it
better but part of that is saying what's
good and it's not just cool or nice or a
good job or yeah you have to like be
specific right so for example hey Chris
the API documentation you wrote for that
new service the parts of the URL they
are they map right to our business
domain object so it makes it super easy
to understand all right that is very
specific feedback that is affirming and
then it's nice to hear right so if I'm a
person who says things that others think
is nice that's good right but that's the
surface level benefit the deeper benefit
is that you are demonstrating that you
understand and demonstrating that that
person has communicated well to you and
you're also kind of confirming a way to
do things right you're saying hey I
agree with you on this thing and that's
a way to have agency right some good
intentions so I mentioned the beginning
of this little section
about non-developers and so I have been
very frustrated in my career by being
sent a PowerPoint presentation that
should be in a document or a spreadsheet
that should be in a document or
interacting with people who use ask as a
noun or solution as a verb and it would
use to drive me insane I'd be like well
they're clearly an idiot because they
don't understand right the English
language or whatever that's obviously
not true everyone has their way of
communicating that they that works best
for them and so the only the only way to
like deal with people who are not
developers even for developers this is
it assume everyone's really good at
their job assume that they're there
they're working with you because they're
good and if you're not seeing that it's
it's it's something about the
communication it's not them right that's
the only way to go forward and then once
you kind of adopt this sort of mindset
then that's a lot easier to work with
with everyone because you're not
frustrated by the friction of different
communication styles you're just like
hey they're awesome and hopefully they
think I'm awesome so we can kind of work
together and figure that out
it leads to leads to better results
helping others help you so we mentioned
this in the code section also being
specific in the feedback that you want
all the reasons stated there but an
additional reason is that it helps set
context when you say what you're trying
to get at or what you actually want
specifically that helps people
understand where am i coming from what
is the problem you're trying to solve
and that can help them understand it and
of course help you this is a hard one
synchronous communication the
aforementioned video chat and you really
can't can't avoid this for lots of
reasons some things are very hard to do
in text as mentioned some people do not
do well in text but they do amazing in a
video chat and you need to kind of go
where they are to be effective and this
is how you experience other people as a
human when you're not physically present
and it's this weird uncanny valley of
talking to a person right because you're
through this screen that is pixelated
over a network that doesn't work and
things drop out and like it is very like
uncomfortable and like I hope that we
have holographic telepresence someday
but until then this is what we got
looking at each other on a screen so
communicating frequently clear clarity
is is
is the important thing here the first
thing is to be prepared right I find
that if I have to talk about a thing and
I'm not prepared I would just ramble on
or say stupid things or you know it's
not good if I'm prepared then when I
open my mouth tends to be better things
come out and so prepared being prepared
as a couple of ways to do that right if
there's things to read before your
meeting like read those things if you
have an opinion on the subject of the
meeting like formulate that opinion in
your mind like specifically don't be
like ah yeah I'm totally down with JSON
like think it through a little bit more
like one level more about why you care
about the subject so that you're kind of
ready to go and engage when you're
talking this is super awkward but you
should use nouns instead of pronouns
like way more than you think right he
she it they that thing those words don't
mean anything the only chance you have
of knowing what it means is that someone
said a noun before and you probably
think that refers to that now right and
now when you think about a video chat
system the words that you say are not
all going to come through like this is a
fact like things are gonna drop out
people aren't gonna hear you a gust of
wind could blow someone's microphone and
it utes everybody else for that second
and like the thing you said isn't gonna
be heard I've been on a video chat where
I was trying desperately with context
clues to figure out what everyone was
talking about and after several minutes
I'm like I'm sorry what are we talking
about because I missed a noun so use
them more it makes it more clear and
makes what is heard and does go over the
wire more more likely to be understood a
better way is to pause more frequently
and ask for feedback right so you're
making a point and you really should
kind of like when you're at the end of a
point make it quickly then say hey does
everybody any questions that makes sense
to everybody before I move on right you
see you say I've got more to say but you
give a pause and everyone has a nice
little safe area that they can ask a
question without having to interrupt you
you can also use this time to call on
particular people so if you know that
someone has an opinion or it's
knowledgeable about a thing hey Pat I
know you know about encoding JSON what
do you think right and that just makes
it a lot easier for everyone to kind of
weigh in in a safe and easy way without
having to interrupt which unfortunately
you will have to do sometimes
so being responsive and setting
boundaries right that leads to this
so first pay attention I mean it sounds
ridiculous but if you go to a meeting
with people and you're like looking at
your phone I guess that's pretty rude so
you wouldn't do that and so you kind of
naturally will pay more attention in a
meeting where you're all kind of
together but when you're on a video chat
you're on your phone or on your computer
and like you can convince yourself that
you can multitask all day long because
emails are popping up slack is telling
you things and like I'm pretty good at
multitasking and so it's this is
terrible for me because I frequently
will try to multitask and that I'm not
paying attention and then either best
case is I just miss some information
worst cases I get called out on it or I
have to ask someone to repeat themselves
because I wasn't paying attention
so yes pay attention don't multitask the
harder thing is if people are not doing
that whole pause and ask for questions
thing that I mentioned then that means
that you may need to just kind of jump
in and interrupt you're gonna have to
sort of be comfortable saying hey we
need to go back a second I got a
question and you know sorry there's a
lag in the technology right like that
that's that's an always always fine but
it is very awkward because interrupting
people feels rude but sometimes you're
gonna have to do it when you do get the
floor that's a chance to sort of set a
better example and do that whole calling
on people think that I talked about like
if you are you know interrupts get your
point have a little back-and-forth then
call on other people that sort of
demonstrates like a better way to kind
of run these things then someone talking
in someone interrupts and because it's
rude you have to be self aware that
you're not doing it too much if you're
interrupting the same person all the
time you might want to talk to them and
say hey technology is terrible I'm
really not trying to interrupt you but
it seems like that so like what are we
gonna do like this is hard it's much
better to have the meetings run better
so just be self aware assuming good
intentions right so people are gonna
interrupt you and you have to assume
that they're doing that for all the
reasons stated that they're not being a
jerk but also think that if you're
chatting with people who are like in an
office so they're sitting around a
conference table and you're a head on a
screen like they're not having a great
time either right it's awkward for them
to
and especially if they are this is their
first experience with remote people it's
gonna be very jarring for them so have
some empathy for you know how things
might be going for them I mean I know
that I used to be the terrible
headquarters person who forgot about the
remote people like so I remember what
that was like and so that that kind of
helps and I mean I've said it a hundred
times the technology that backs this
stuff is terrible it barely works I
can't believe we have it at all and this
is kind of an evergreen topic to bond
with everyone over actually like it's
it's very easy just complain about the
video chat system as a way to bond with
everybody because they're they have the
same terrible experience that you do and
it sort of can take a little little edge
off of everyone if things are kind of
not going well help others help you so
aforementioned AV problems the hardest
thing about them is that you are having
the problem they have the power to fix
it but they don't know what experience
you're having so they don't know what to
do so you got to channel your inner
wedding coordinator and just tell them
what you want them to do and people are
happy to do that right point the camera
at Pat because Pat is speaking no
problem right you don't do be a jerk
about it but just kind of be directive
because they just want to fix it but
they don't know what to do another way
is to have an ally who is on site who
can help with these things or a regular
back-channel so it stitch fix we do
company All Hands meetings they are
remote there's hundreds of people dial
into this thing and the video chat
system that we use has a text chat as
well and so one of the women that works
in the headquarters on our office
management team her job during the All
Hands is to watch that text chat to see
if there's problem start people and you
can say I can't hear this or can you the
camera and she can go figure it out
without interrupting the meeting you can
also ask questions and she will ask
questions for you it's really really
handy early on at stitch fix one of the
developers who was on site was like the
the ambassador for all the remotes and
he decided he was going to make sure
that that the the things he needed to do
were happening and so he would
frequently go in and set up all this AV
stuff in the Mac Mini camera crap that
we had before and like really helped so
that is that is hugely helpful so and
how do you do that build build trust
people that you trust that are on site
they can be your ally
socializing that's kind of a weird one
right so think about like if you go to
an office and you're the quietest person
of all time you're very private you
don't share anything about yourself at
all people still know things about you
right they know what you look like
then how tall you are they know if
you're having a good hair day they don't
close you where they know when you come
to work they know when you go to the
bathroom they know when you eat lunch
then with the sound of your voice and
that right it humanizes you and it and
like it or not it delivers some base
level of trust that oh you're at least
another actual human being that I have
seen in real life like okay we got that
going for us when you're remote you
don't have any of that
you're just a producer of emails
probably right so you have to all of a
sudden we talked about before is great
but you also need to humanize yourself
to everyone I mean they intellectually
know yeah this is a person and not a
Perl script but you need to you know
engage more with that stuff and making
small talk is a way to do that I'm an
introvert I hate small talk for very
actually good reasons but it's the only
way to have real talk is to have small
talk and it does help so one thing that
I find what I'm you know on these video
chats if there's a lot of people and
there's a lot of offices there's there's
always a little bit of time between when
the meeting is supposed to start and
when the meeting actually starts and you
could stare at each other and you could
check email or you could chat about
stupid inane things and get to know the
people that you're on this on this chat
with write an evergreen topic is the
weather it's so banal but like for me
San Francisco right they don't have
weather and I have weather so I can talk
about it and that's interesting
sometimes to people the you know your
your remote you have a background like
what's going on right I sit outside
sometimes and there are cats in my
neighborhood that come and sit with me
and they're in the background so hey
what's that cat doing there right so
it's stupid but it humanizes you and it
kind of gets things you know kind of
started and then scheduling time to
socialize is weird but if you have
one-on-ones with no particular agenda
like it's not a one-on-one with your
boss it's time to just sort of chitchat
it feels really awkward and weird just
schedule time to stand around the water
cooler but it does work and it helps a
lot so being responsive and setting
boundaries to me this is more about like
travelling right because when you're
remote there's usually some expectation
that you will travel at some point to be
with the other remote people be with the
people that you work with like it's it's
fixed we do this every quarter we could
check the entire engineering team
together because that is super
humanizing sit we've plenty she's a lot
of trust really easily but travel is
hard so if you're getting into a remote
situation you need to know like what is
the deal what am I expected to and you
might not be told you might need to ask
and I would also say that you should
push yourself to travel
I mean travel is you know it's
uncomfortable but you should do it
because it does help this guy on my team
scared to death of flying hates being on
planes he's been in the company for like
two years has not gotten better he still
hates it it drives him crazy but he
pushes himself to do it because he knows
that there's a value to meeting
everybody in person every once in a
while assuming good intentions so it's
very easy to be upset when people are
not considered like for example we did
our engineering off-site that I
mentioned and they made nametags for
everybody which is awesome because
they're not so big that I don't know
everybody's name so the people who live
in San Francisco they're named Texas you
know Pat Smith San Francisco California
my nametag says David Copeland remote DC
like I don't live in remote DC I was in
Washington DC but you know what um it's
cool it's fine right like people don't
know what it's like so you kind of have
to not like be upset when they do things
that like seem inconsiderate because
they're really not it's just like they
don't know like they've never worked
remote so they don't know like how
annoying it might be to see that you
live in remote and not your actual city
right it's fine so so so you have to
just sort of like let that stuff go and
try to improve as you can but it really
no one means anything by it
now you're gonna miss happy hours you
just got to be okay with that you know I
like having a beer with my coworkers but
the respect and Trust I have in them is
not because we've shared beers it's
because we've done good work and that's
just how I choose to value my co-workers
fortunately for me stitch fix does not
do business at happy hours I know some
come
they do do business at happy hours and
if your company is one of them and your
remote that that is tricky and you're
gonna have to find some ways to sort of
figure out what business got done and a
personal opinion that it's not healthy
but I know it happens fortunately for us
it does not
and lastly helping others help you so
along the lines of the people in the
headquarters right who aren't remote
they're not gonna know what the
situation is like and they're also not
gonna know like how to improve things so
suggested suggesting ways to socialize
is good you know what would help you so
drive that conversation that's another
way to show agency and leadership and if
you can do it in a way that all your
boss has to do is say yes then cool
bosses are happy to say yes to things if
that's all they have to do that makes it
way easier for them so be creative think
about some ways to do that like we've
got a lot of developers that live in
dallas-fort Worth area they don't work
on the same team but we have a warehouse
in Dallas and the warehouse of course
has offices in it and so those
developers every once in a while they'll
go to the Dallas office and just kind of
be next to each other because it's
pretty easy and pretty pretty low
friction and pretty low cost so yeah
that helps be creative about that stuff
and it's it's good okay now all of that
and much much more will help build trust
it is it is the key like when I think
about every positive interaction I've
had it's because I have trusts with that
person and every painful interaction is
because I have not established that
trust and so you know you have a mental
index of where you are with everybody
and how you need to you know how you
need to act you can get away with
certain things with one person you can't
with another because the trust isn't
isn't equalized and you're not kind of
working on that but I think about this
you know every day so that is more or
less it here's the mindsets again
communicate frequently and clearly be
responsive set boundaries assume good
intentions and help others help you
think about how you can do these things
you'll find a million more things than
what I just went over but they really do
they really do work so if what I
described is a way that you would like
to work I can make that happen come talk
to me we're hiring of course you wanna
hold me there I am on Twitter and all
that I also wrote a book called the
senior software engineer if you're
interested in other things about being a
good developer that are not about code
the book has that stuff in there
and that's it I have no idea if we have
time for questions okay thank you yes
the question is how do you hire remote
so it's we we now are capable of hiring
a person who you've never met in person
but it took a while to get there
so the general hiring process is I think
it's a high level pretty typical of
other companies you do a phone screen we
do like a take home projects and then if
you get through those things then
there's the on-site interview and so
we'll just fly you out to San Francisco
but part of that is having a video chat
with someone who is not in San Francisco
so that gives the the true experience
but recently we've had a few people who
like did like weren't interested in
doing that and we were able to to do
that whole process remote and feel good
about that because there's enough
structure built that we're like okay I
can now trust the process that we can
have a person inserted into it that
we've never met but yeah oh yeah so it's
like a it's like a application and you
add a couple features to it and then you
send it back and we look at it and then
the second step is and you do pair
program with someone remotely usually
and add another feature to it together
so that and it's actually a really good
simulation of how it works right because
you are gonna go off and do a thing
we're not gonna see you doing that thing
and you're gonna produce it back that is
how the work is so it's a pretty good
simulation of like what it's like to to
work with us
right so the question is do we align
teams around time zones and kind of how
do we deal with with that we did it
first so we're sort of organized around
different parts of the business so the
team that does like the front-end
stuff like the website and emails like
they are all code we're all co-located
in San Francisco and then my team at the
time we were doing all this stuff for
the warehouse so we were all happened to
be in East Coast so that helped
but yeah you it's like every time you
hire eventually like it's really hard to
maintain that and so now every time
someone's hired on one of the teams that
has a lot of remotes it's like okay can
we still have our stand up at the same
time because we would have it at like
11:30 a.m. Pacific and then we hire
someone the West Coast we're like you do
not need to get up at 8 a.m. to have a
stand up unless you want to and yeah so
but this is kind of part of part of
dealing with it
yes the question is about the SLA is and
how explicitly that is is set it's not
it's my own personal thing like everyone
kind of does it differently so I guess
the most explicit expectation is that
you should respond to an email like
within a business day so it's kind of
but it's self motivating to be more
responsive than that and so we try to
cultivate that but it's not it's not
super explicit how do I do a distraction
around me I get way less distracted at
home because it's not I have an area at
home that is dead that is set aside for
work and that helps having a clear list
of things to do helps because you know
I'm just like I got to get all this
stuff done no time for TV and all that
stuff I know that not everybody is like
that so you kind of have to find a place
to do that like one of the developers he
goes to a co-working space cuz he's more
productive when he's like amidst people
who are like also doing work I yeah I go
to a noisy coffee shop because it
doesn't bother me and I don't get
distracted but yeah you got to figure
that out
yeah so the question is uh whiteboarding
how do you how do you whiteboard it's a
technique we all use those programmers
in it it is very hard to do remote like
the classic is aimed the laptop at the
whiteboard and hope you can use thick
enough lines it can like make out yeah
that is very hard so we tend to do more
asynchronous like here's a thing I would
have done on a whiteboard but I've made
a document I did do a like a remote
whiteboarding thing I figure what the
tool is called but it's one of those
like sort of group drawing things and so
we all agreed that we would go into that
and whiteboard on that and it's actually
it worked pretty well the the thing we
produce is unreadable and you could
never do anything with it but the act of
watching people draw on it like that was
helpful but yeah you got to get
everybody on it if you're like the one
person trying to look sideways at the
whiteboard like it is really hard so
another thing you can do too is have
some like just ask like okay what did
you just write down the whiteboard like
you know at least passively consume it
but it is yeah it is tricky oh yeah yeah
that's that's right a previous company I
had they would print it could print it
out but yet you can share the whiteboard
remotely yeah yeah that's cool all right
yeah
yeah yeah okay yeah yeah yeah it's a
question but the screencasting and tools
how they how they work so Jing is very
easy it just records you just say okay
go and I starts recording whatever is
happening on your screen so what I would
do is you know meeting up my desktop
maximize and also record your mic so I
would you know talk through what I'm
doing and it takes a little while to get
good at it like if you went to my secret
file in Jing there would be tons of bad
language as I messed it up a lot but you
know you kind of you get you get
practice and you do it yeah I tried
fancier things and they are a lot more
working that like ScreenFlow is a
populum with screen casters and it
requires a lot more commitment to like
to figure out how to do it so I don't
know Jing works pretty well and it's a
good starter I guess
yeah so it's how to deal with the bunch
of people standing around a camera and
half of them are off-screen kind of
problem so one thing that I do because
I'm sort of comfortable like asking is
like hey can you get on the camera while
you're introducing yourself sometime
that that that works effectively more
long-term at my previous job we had a
lot of remotes and what people would do
is even if they were in the office they
just dial in on their laptop at their
desk and so no one is standing around a
conference room thing that that can help
to and a plus it gives everybody the
same experience which is empathetic so
