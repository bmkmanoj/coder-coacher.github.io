can all download Firefox for free even
on Android not on iOS but you can all
email Apple and ask for that CS so we're
here today to talk a little bit about
Mozilla ptg echo project some of the
technologies involved in that and
basically what it means for the web so
my name's Rob box I'm one of the
technical evangelist at Mozilla primary
focus on many on games for them very
much interested in the b2 gecko project
and what's happening with the mobile
space as well I'm Chris Amon principal
evangelist for html5 and open web at
mozilla i'm working with boot to gecko
and with the identity team a lot and i'm
here for google i/o as well to talk
about mobile development there a bit not
as a speaker this time so i can get
presents which is good and yeah we're
gonna we didn't rehearse that talk much
I was actually training people all day
long about public speaking so it's going
to be very relaxed and very ad hoc if
you say so so just quick gauging what
you guys are doing so who he would call
themselves a developer okay designers
project managers own up entrepreneurs
mobile developers it's not like we're
going to change our talk or anything
it's just you need to have some exercise
at the end of the day that makes you
wake up so we thought that's a good idea
but that means we have a mixture of
everybody which is good and so we're
here to talk about bt gecko like I said
so Peter gecko is commonly referred to
as btg and it's a full operating system
and platform for mobile devices
effectively and it consists of two major
components and you'll be the Gecko side
of things and the Gaia side of things
the gecko side of things is the is many
the hardware related stuff and like
JavaScript API is necessary to sort of
get mobile functionality working
and so the gecko side of things is
basically everything that you don't
really see you also have the guy side of
things which is many of the front-end
visual sort of operating system so it's
everything that hooks into those
JavaScript API is that gecko provides
and sagar is effectively everything that
you can see on the device so the
interesting thing about Gaia is that
well first of all gecko is the engine
that that is in Firefox that's the
rendering engine much like much like its
Trident in the audience and Explorer and
these kind of things and the really cool
thing about Gaia is that for the first
time you have a phone system a phone
mobile system that is fully based on
html5 that is not only an html5 layer on
top of Java or on top of C sharp or on
top of cocoa or visual C or whatever you
want to write but it's actually the
whole system itself the operating system
is written in html5 itself and for media
was really cool to finally take the 14
years of web development that I've done
and see them on a phone without having
to go through some conversion process or
going to some other development process
but actually can hack around with some
JavaScript and out of a sudden I've got
an app on my phone and that's an
incredibly powerful thing to do because
html5 when he came out was this big
thing like html5 fictional for is so
dead and XML is dead anyways and flashes
so dead and everything is cool now and
then we got really excited about it and
then all of a sudden a few companies
that set html5 is the best thing ever
realized that they make a lot of money
with native applications and not so much
with applications that run in the
browser and their browsers out of a
sudden blocked us out and we didn't have
the access off to the hardware that we
have on a desktop on a mobile device
which was a bit of a shame because the
how small the stack of html5 is compared
to others allows us to build things
really quickly and really small so why
be touchy why is it important and the
problem is that the right thing is that
html5 and JavaScript are the underlying
technologies of the web like we've come
this far from linked documents in some
Institute in Switzerland and some
University
in America to people that have
day-to-day dealings with the web I
booked my tickets over the web I booked
my hotel rooms over the web I I couldn't
think of it anymore then I mean I
remember like some of you might do as
well when you had to send letters for
things when you had to actually send the
other day I had a server in Germany I
want to shut down how to send them a fax
to shut down my server and I've
fascinated me that nobody has embraced
it that much but the technologies that
we have here actually allow us to build
things quickly and especially getting
people up to speed on development with
the web it's a wonderful thing at
Mozilla we are a non-for-profit
organization to keep the web open that's
quite a mouthful and it's also quite a
job but it's a wonderful job as well we
have this one's a la thimble project
right now where we teach kids how to
build their first HTML pages and people
like journalists how to actually put
html5 video out there with subtitles and
interact with rests up with the rest of
the page I've never seen a media before
it is so easy to get into and that's why
we wanted to keep that media alive also
on mobile platforms so it's created with
open technologies and that's another
thing that a lot of people don't really
get why this is important I mean it's
very simple to say like yeah we're open
huh no that's cool like we're open so
we're not close to an old evil and
that's just not enough but open
technologies means that you are in
public whatever you do is scrutinized by
millions and millions of people out
there and you have the benefit of when
they complain about it to tell them well
help us fix it and not just like oh we
have to fix it two months time don't
worry about it there's a lot of stuff
out there that set is open but it's a
lot of it is like not open source but
today soars as we call it so it gets
released tada and then two weeks later
you can get the source code and start
playing with it but you don't have a
choice in actually building this thing
together with the company that releases
that open source and with both firefox
and we boot to gecko we do it
differently which can be a massive
challenge for us because puta gecko in
the start was eight months ago an empty
repository on github so we said we have
good put your gecko we bring a norm
another mobile OS out
and all we got me being in England and
talking to the press in the morning was
an empty github repository that was the
first time I heard about that thing and
seven months they'd I've got a phone in
my hand running that and I was like wow
and it's a team of like four or five
people back then with lots lots of
people contributing to it and building
on other open source that is already out
there out of a sudden we have a
competitor for the operating systems out
there that is targeted to devices that
couldn't run these new systems I bought
a Nexus S last year the first time I
bought my phone normally I get those
things to test them out and then I send
them back which is pretty good or I go
to Google i/o and but now a year later
ice cream sandwich is too slow on the
Nexus S and I just fascinated me that
this happened so fast nowadays and not
everybody can afford a new a new phone
all the time so we wanted to make a
phone system that makes the web
available to people who have not the
coolest newest technology and as a whole
world out there of those people that
should get the benefits of the web
without having to pay through the nose
for it so why is it free technologies
and a lot of people say that was free it
cannot be good it's like you it can't be
the right thing but it's the same topic
I said before why would I have to pay
for an operating system when a machine
can run the things that I want to do
with something that comes free because
by definition we made it available to
you so part of her to gecko is its and
it's another thing that we're doing and
that's called Kilimanjaro so so yeah the
Kilimanjaro project or the Kilimanjaro
event as we call it is basically a
milestone across several of the Mozilla
products that we've got going on and
it's not like a single release like it
would be like a firefox release or
anything like that it's more of like an
incremental effort to sort of get to a
point in time that we think we should be
getting too so when we reach this
Kilimanjaro event which we hope will be
later this year we're hoping to have
sort of like an elegant and simple
solution for sort of html5 applications
within Firefox so taking into
consideration like what we've got with
me to gecko on the mobile
things are sort of identity and
personalization services with persona
and browser ID then the Firefox desktop
stuff as well and also just tying that
all together with web apps and that kind
of stuff which we'll cover in a little
bit in a moment so yeah the idea is to
sort of reach this by maybe September
this year but like I said it's not just
a product released it's more of a sort
of a consistent push amongst all these
various different teams and products
within Mozilla to sort of read some sort
of consistent and end point so just
before we explain like like the inner
workings of boutique and some of the
technologies and stuff and the best way
to sort of get you sort of to grip to it
I suppose is to show you a demo of it so
I was going to show you a demo on the
computer by matts you're going to show
you a demo of the phone working with us
right now so we've actually got these
devices on us today so if you want to
have a look at these like actually play
on them right now just grab us after the
talk and you can have a play so yeah I'm
just going to quickly run through this
maybe you want to sort of talk while I'm
loading it we're doing the clever thing
would like showing the camera on the
left over turn the laptop around to show
your phone cuz there's just no way to
show phones on a screen simple fashion
so what you see here is the maybe see
here what you see here is a glaring
screen with a finger on it and we also
see these icons and these icons are all
html5 applications and this is for
example WebGL running on that phone with
60 frames per second and we just pulled
a random WebGL demo run and
understanding it ourselves course not
music and all of these things are
basically an index HTML page and the
JavaScript manifest file are Jason
manifest file that tells you what the
phone should do with these applications
and we were at Mobile World Congress the
most biggest mobile conference worldwide
and when we showed that to people they
were like oh is that the windows phone
cuz it wasn't rectangular back then it
was like longer icons and no no actually
that's HTML as Rob just showed this is a
developer demo so this is not for the
end users everywhere in the system you
can just hit department see the source
code off the page
you're currently on there this is the
source code of the operating system
itself the whole interface is written in
HTML Javascript and CSS you don't need
to actually flash a phone to get a
different interface on that it runs
games it runs all the things that you
see on the web my favorite is that we so
this is the dialer here you can actually
call numbers because it's incredibly
useful to have a phone that to call
other people text messaging is probably
a good idea as well so this is all been
supported and what we've done here we
actually opened the stack through
JavaScript API step we all standardized
which we're going to talk through one by
one later on as well really cool is also
that we don't know if the cut the rope
is going to run run here it's really not
as right as every other okay there you
go to cut the rope is a magical html5
demo game out there that is on the web
and it's written by Microsoft for
showing off how cool internet explorer 9
is so we thought we can put this in an
iframe and get rid of that Internet
Explorer 9 logo and actually show how
good were two geckos so this one is
running in WebGL in canvas and has the
same fidelity that cut the rope has on
Android for example on iOS it costs more
money so you probably will not have seen
those levels but it has the hardware
acceleration on everything out there and
there was always the issue with with
JavaScript and canvas that we didn't
have the hardware access that we had in
the past or through other systems or
with operating system browsers that come
out there and I'm looking forward to
google i/o tomorrow to see what's
happening with chrome on Android as well
because for a moment now the Android
browser is actually quite disappointing
what fascinates me here is the
opportunities that we have as all of
that is HTML even the settings menu even
the DDT phone that the volume control is
just the Java Sea is just to see us as
an HTML so you can control that phone in
any which way you want and you can build
your own interfaces so we built that
system we're not going to release the
phone don't ask us for phones because
we're not going don't have any honors
and we're partnering actually with
mobile phone providers or mobile system
providers
to actually bring these phones into the
hands of people because some other calls
some other big company try to bring out
their own phones and do their own
distribution didn't quite work for them
so a non-for-profit organization
shouldn't try to sell phones that's not
a idea of that our idea is to bring the
HTML world to mobile phones without
having to go through an extra build
process and go through extra length here
and you can see the fidelity is quite
good the fatalities we're still tweaking
it the scrolling is fast we have
multitouch support we've got all the
things in that you expect from a phone
and it was great at Mobile World
Congress because every developer we put
it in there started scrolling really
fast it's not quite as smooth as an
iPhone and you like yeah it only is like
600 dollar less and every end user just
looked at it like oh this is cool this
is nice it has games it has buttons you
know like much like people oh this blue
e is the internet right no not anymore
and it runs videos it runs all the
things that you expect from a phone as
well and we found so far when using it
in like day-to-day life that the battery
life is incredibly long because we don't
go through the Java stack we go into a
film go through C sharp it's just a
Linux core with the day hardware drivers
and JavaScript API is on top of that
talking directly to the hardware look at
that it's got a dialer and everything
it's like a real home it is so let's put
2k CO and yeah you can play with those a
bit later if you want
cool yes so that's sort of the best way
to give you an overview of out
explaining it too far so there was a
whole bunch of technology that
Christians sort of touched on and I
suppose you want to sort of go through
those in a little bit more detail the
main thing and Christian cover this
briefly is that the phone is built on
the gecko engine which is what's behind
Firefox now so effectively you could
call this like a firefox phone it's a
little bit more than that but it's it's
running on the same technology in the
back end so the idea is the the features
that we roll into BTW gecko will fall
into firefox as well because it's all
built on the same backend a mozilla
we're working on a lot of things and one
of these is the web api effort and this
is basically our way of sort of working
out what we would need to implement in
javascript to create a working phone
environment and that was the sort of the
basic idea behind boot to gecko and
where this will came from this is known
another sort of camps as like the device
api's working group things like that da
p but it's pretty much the same stuff in
it's all about accessing like hardware
via JavaScript and so yeah this is an
illustration from a website called em
are was it are we mobile yet which is a
kind of cool visualization of all the
parts of a mobile phone that we're
working on and the implement state
implementation status of that so things
of green icons are implemented and
things of red icons are sort of being
worked on a yacht not yet sort of there
so there's a whole bunch of those I'm
not gonna go through absolutely every
single one but I thought we'd cover sort
of a few of the favorites a few of the
bigger ones you can find the rest of the
web api is in more detail and there's a
link in the slides that will put online
afterwards that you can go through so
the first one it's kind of not really a
Web API as such is touch events
JavaScript's you kind of need to have
touch events if you want to have a
mobile phone environment built with
JavaScript there's been support recently
landed in gecko for multiple touch and
that kind of stuff and guest gestures so
it's important to have that
functionality and that's fully supported
now
so you can now have that pinch zoom all
that kind of fancy stuff that you want
to have so if you want addition a pinch
zooming in on the web so you just use
like CSS transitions with the positions
of your pinch previous and afterwards
and they get you got doing a nice smooth
zooming transition and with JavaScript
all the fun thing about touch events as
well that it breaks open the whole new
market to people I mean kids nowadays
they probably all saw the video of that
kid that had a magazine and tried to
zoom into it and scroll it and got
confused poke it rich parents and we
need those kind of things because it's
dee dee dee being on par with native
environments we really have to support
these and diversity original touch
support on the android browser for
example or along the Firefox browser for
Android was just not good enough what
fascinates me is that iOS has 11 touch
points who's got 11 fingers but fair
enough so camera API was something we
needed for years and years and why to
have yeah the question was if we had any
if there are standardized touch events
and they're sanitized gesture events and
the answer is yes as a few companies
working on that we proposed a few of
them but Apple actually had a lot of
standards already supported by other
people as well so we're looking into the
what's been done in native so we don't
have to reinvent that but make these
open web standards as well yeah it well
it does on touch start on touch and and
on drag at the moment the API is a bit
odd in places but you basically have an
array of touch points that you get in
the browser so you know how many fingers
have been there in the past it has
before they keep up with the new
multi-touch it's much much better
Microsoft goes another way with the
pointer events API which is another
interesting one that actually just tells
you something happened and it tells you
what the input was was it a touch was in
the mouse was a day connect or whatever
it was so there's a bit of a race
between those two standards I don't care
I love open web standards so let's see
which one is going to be the best and i
really like connect ideas as well and
facial recognition these kind of things
comes with all the creepy security and
privacy things it's wonderful talking of
which camera API camera API was a big
one
because if you cannot take a picture on
your phone and put that into a web app
then basically we'll never be able to to
get rid of native apps like we use
phones everything we take pictures of
our food and then we upload them
somewhere so people see that we've been
eating it's not for your mom it's
actually showing to your friends I think
my favorite was when Instagram came out
for android and one tweet it said like
oh my god now we have to see what poor
people eat because that was just
wonderful that people are arrogant
enough thinking oh I bought an iPhone
I'm now a member of an upper class sure
let me buy five of you and show you how
much better I am but now we have that we
can basically get camera access from
JavaScript through a secure layer that
tells you like all your camera's being
accessed because a lot of people always
have that issue like oh my god my
computer is going to spy on me and
you're like there's a light next to the
camera that tells you when it does but
that's not on every hardware but on
phones for example it's good to see okay
this side is trying to access the camera
do you want to allow it to much like you
do with your location as well so that
was a big thing so now we can actually
get access to the camera and once we
have access to the camera we have access
to the image data so we can easily
manipulate that image data on a pixel
level with canvas or we can actually
just put it into a gallery or we can put
filters on it and get 1 billion dollars
from some other company buying us but
can I don't think that's going to work
anymore so one of the the more sort of
pain-related api's is the web SMS api
and this is basically not as glamorous
as something like the camera API but it
allows you to send text messages using a
simple JavaScript API so just by
providing a phone number and a text
message you can send a message to that
number it's as simple as that really and
I mean you basically saw a very blurry
view of that SMS app working if you want
to have look at it later you can have a
look on the phone but yeah it's the
whole point of these api's is to be as
simple as possible and this is really
one of the most simple simple ones but
it's one that you inherently need if you
want to have a phone particularly if
you're not using things like I message
and stuff like that which you have on
other platforms
which from it up ties into the other
thing that is this phone that everybody
of you probably has a phone that shaped
like that i can actually my hotel has a
fuse or like what the hell is going on
there but yeah it's the same thing there
with one javascript call i can initiate
a call to a telephone number and that
was completely impossible before boot to
gecko and the web api and i think it's a
very very important step to actually
realize i could for example in Umberto
gecko as is a completely open system I
could recognize when i'm roaming and
instead of just doing the normal
telephone call through the mobile phone
provider and paying roaming access i
could go through something like skype or
i could go through through some other
provider to make sure i don't pay
through the nose while i'm actually just
trying to call somebody and that is
something that is not possible that
easily in other systems you have to do
that by hand but a boot to gecko phone
having access student hardware and
allowing me to initiate calls through a
javascript api could test if i'm not
actually on my normal sim connection and
then go through some other system in a
few lines of JavaScript broaden in
calling it another app and if you ever
tried copying and pasting a telephone
number from the context and android into
skype that is not fun copying and
pasting on the phone generally isn't but
we can do that on a hardware level and
on a on a JavaScript level and it's just
a single call and it's just wonderful to
do these kind of things so one of my
favorite ones is the web vibration API
which was previously known as they were
by bright or API but the name had to be
changed probably for obvious reasons but
yeah I like this API not just because of
the name but also because it's one of
the ones that helps me sort of get a
better idea about how cool these kind of
technologies are in that it's quite a
simple API it just affects the vibration
motor but it's one of the ones that
brings the web into the physical world
and I really like the idea of like being
able to write some JavaScript out a
really simple line of JavaScript and
then it's actually making the device
move across the table which feels weird
but I'm used to like building websites
and stuff and now being able to like
control the hardware on a phone and
actually see it do something it's kind
of cool so I like that API
and definitely like that us actually
working in Android as well firefox on
android so if you want to play with that
and you don't have a access to something
of beauty gecko on it then you can
definitely play with these these api's
and this one in particular today so
definitely give that a go for you really
one where the LFC FBI is really really
cool and quite short at Google i/o we're
going to hear a lot about NFC about
payment systems and these kind of things
I for example have these business cards
right now which is me holding a unicorn
but actually what they also do is like
if I just touch my phone on it I get my
data directly into the phone without you
having to type the number in or anything
like that and this is what NFC is about
new field communication so instead of
having to find my camera and take a
picture of that 2d barcode that extra me
never ever works I just basically touch
one phone to another one or two a system
that has a chip in like these cards have
and I can get that data into the phone
or go to URL or download something and
it's for payment services is absolutely
nuts this is going to be really really
interesting and we will see what's
coming out of that one so NFC API is
supported right now NFC natively
supported right now on android nexus and
nexus s 2 and iPhone 5 is rumored to be
it as well but we asked so we looked at
bugzilla they don't have anything so NFC
is going to be a big one and it's good
that there is an open web api for that
one as well now that button is still red
so there's no support and it right now
in boot to gecko but we've got a room
full of developers here so you can fix
it for us and we're happy and say thank
you if you do it's one of the upper ones
that isn't quite yet supported but is
equally as interesting as web relative
so this is the idea of being able to
through JavaScript connect to bluetooth
devices and communicate sending data
tune from them so I'm really interested
to see what people use once they've been
given a more general API that doesn't
really do one specific thing but it
allows you to sort of unlock the
opportunity to connect to as many
different devices as you want and kind
of interface with them in ways that the
API didn't envisage there's also one
that isn't
quite at the same status as web
bluetooth which is also equally
interesting to keep an eye on which is
web USB which is the ability to use
javascript to communicate with USB
devices so as anyone here heard of
Audrey know which is like DLA hardware
yet it would be kind of interesting to
see if you could communicate with those
devices using javascript using something
like web USB so this is kind of although
these are all related to boot to gecko
in this talk it's interesting to see how
these api's could be used outside of
that and to communicate with devices
like Audrey know to sort of bring micro
sim in the vibration and API to bring
web technologies into the physical world
I think that's really interesting i'd
love to see that sort of happen in a
near future the battery API where that
one came out we were just like okay
that's yeah fair enough it's good to get
exit why would I want to know the
battery status from a website or from an
HTML app but if you think about it
before you start that interface with
lots and lots of great animations and
gradients and really heavy things and
you realize that the poor guy is already
on five percent of the battery you maybe
give them a slighter interface an
interface that is not as hungry you
don't do i as an animation from one
state to another but you just do a plop
animation like we do 48 x bar 6 and
other things that should have died years
ago and so the benefit of that one is
that we finally know how much the
battery is there and actually we can
actually measure before and after we do
something if we drain the battery and do
some testing with that as well so for
performance testing and people get very
excited about painting graphs to each
other and getting getting better at that
this is a great API to play with as well
and just on a side note here the battery
is really really annoying to drain so
make sure that you use the best things
on the new systems that we have which is
don't use said timeout use get animation
frame because then first of all the
animation will be smoother the battery
will not be drained to death when
there's no animation to possible even
and if the tab is not open it will not
do the animation
it's a wonderful thing to do but that's
another talk I guess yeah it's a kind of
stuff at talk about with games but it's
yet it's completely related like
basically using like
requestanimationframe allows you to sort
of put the browser in control of things
like animation and makes it much
smoother and just yeah saves battery
life kind of related in the graphic side
of thing is the fullscreen API so is
anyone using this in JavaScript today
couple people that's cool so it
basically allows you to expand a
specific dominant Dom element to the
full screen on any on devices on the
desktop or whatever so you're probably
seen that already with like going to
actual full screen mode for the whole
browser on the desktop which kind of
breaks the entire experience for every
website that you're on and all the tabs
if you just want to have full screen for
something like a video or canvas element
then you would use the full screen API
to do that and this is important on boot
to gecko mobile devices because if you
want to have like a sort of immersive
app like experience you don't want to
have it sort of sitting in a small sort
of box in the middle of the already
small window and then have like this
menu bar on top which has got like the
time and stuff you might want to
actually open that as a proper full
screen app so that's how you can do that
and that's the technology that we're
using on boot to gecko to open these
applications up because they're just
websites open these applications up as
full screen elements to give them that
immersive experience you normally get on
native platforms a screen orientation
was a big thing as well and that has
been around for quite a while as well I
mean we had the normal orientation api's
which are again event handlers indie
browser and weren't supported on the
android browser but were supported on
firefox for android which you can
download today and for quite some while
so I get the Alpha the beta and the
gamma or whatever those three are to
actually know what the phone is doing at
the moment and four games that's just
incredible and also just as a side note
if you build apps for for mobile devices
take as much as the mobile phone can do
for you and put it in your device like
an orientation is a wonderful thing a
wonderful very physical thing for people
to do like having some buttons that are
small that you have to click
uh not as much fun so with the screen
orientation API we extended this idea of
just getting the orientation of the
phone to also tell us what the that we
can lock the orientation to either
portrait or landscape if your
application only makes sense in one of
them and also detect what the original
the the mint orientation of the device
is like for a phone it will always be
there will always be like portrait but
some for example a tablet is normally
used in landscape so some of these
devices will also tell you what the best
orientation for them is and that's all
part of that screen orientation API so
that has been hammered out a bit more
than the w3c standards were before about
just screen orientation and on some
devices you have to hack with like
resize event of the window and we
shouldn't have to hack these things the
days of internets products are over we
should be allowed to develop nowadays
and not just hack around problems yeah
none firefox mobile we recently landed
screen orientation locking so you can
now actually lock specific Dom elements
to a specific orientation when you're
using the full screen API so it's
particularly important for what we're
doing with web apps in that if you want
to have a game for example open up full
screen and be landscape mode and the
holding in portrait mode you don't it to
be sort of all flipped around and do
some weird stuff when you move it back
around so if you use the full screen API
to sort of open it out and then you use
the script the screen orientation
locking which is just a one line piece
of JavaScript then you can lock the
application so it opens up in the right
orientation in full screen mode which is
incredibly important when you want to
sort of have that unbroken immersive
experience perhaps something else which
isn't again a device API but is also
incredibly interesting and something you
briefly saw in the booty gecko demos
WebGL so the ability to have like
hardware accelerated graphics on a
mobile device is pretty interesting
particularly when it's using javascript
and when the entire phones built using
javascript that's even more interesting
so for example you could have WebGL
hardware accelerated 2d or 3d graphics
in your lock screen or in your home
screen whatever like you can use these
technology
in all aspects of the phone you don't
just have to use these in a specific
application so there's so much more to
these relatively simple technologies
that were used to on the web once you
start unlocking them and actually
building an entire hardware platform
using them so just what it was quite
interesting to sort of talk about that
briefly when it took we yeah the biggest
problem of course is now yeah great you
do all these things in the browser and
you still have to go into the browser of
the phone not input to gecko but for
example on Firefox for Android and the
big thing is apps everybody wants apps
everybody is amazed by apps and all the
apps out there are basically in some
market and not on the web so we needed
to find a way to actually allow you to
have all these wonderful open things and
build real applications on these
technologies as well so instead of
having to write HTML Javascript and CSS
and then use a Cordova or use phonegap
to turn that into an iPhone app and
hopefully get it submitted to restore
put it into the play app and hopefully
for have it found between the 6,000 fart
apps and revert ad clones out there we
had to find a way to allow you to turn a
web interface or a website into a nap
without having to go through these extra
processes because we just want to have
the web on the phone without going
through an install or uninstall process
that is not part of the web interface
that you originally have and that's why
we built a infrastructure of open web
applications around these as well which
of course are mostly targeted at boot to
gecko so you can get your app fix out
there cause end users don't care if this
open technology or not they just want to
have their apps and that's why we had to
build something like that for you as
well hmm and it's important with apps
like particularly built using these web
technologies like and the openness is it
gives you more reach so it allows you to
create these experiences that use a
single code base that run across sort of
multiple devices multiple form factors
desktop mobile tablet and all that kind
of stuff which is really interesting but
also it's it's also interesting because
they're using these open technologies so
let your html5 CSS JavaScript and the
same things that you're currently using
to build websites you don't need to
relearn anything if you're already
building websites using these
technologies you don't actually need to
do anything special to turn a website
into a nap I'll talk about that briefly
in a moment and the other thing is it
gives you freedom of choice so the idea
of these open web apps is not just to
sort of create apps in JavaScript but
sort of the bigger picture of putting
developers and users back in control of
applications so developers can now be in
control of where they distribute their
amps how they distribute their apps how
they charge for that where they charge
for that how they communicate with their
customers and all that kind of stuff so
they can now like distribute their app
on any app store if they really wanted
to or they could sell it for their own
website they're completely in control
because these technologies are fully
open and the API is behind these web
apps are fully open as well so that's
why we have the Mozilla marketplace and
it's right now open for developers so
you can actually start writing html5
apps it's just a manifest file like you
had another in other package formats as
well it's just set that in there in the
manifest file you define what your
application needs that's all the
security settings in there for you
rather than like Oh Andy for anything
could now does set the dial at the
background and send text messages not
possible because you get asked to give
them access to that and you can actually
start a start creating your own
marketplace things in there as well and
actually distribute from your own sites
as well so there's a model much like air
was in the past that you just have a
button to install it from your website
rather than how it going through the
whole market so this is right now in
developer beta so it's it's not for end
users yet but we are seeing these with
lots of partners are ready to build a
few apps in there and the documentation
is out there that you can actually start
writing your apps and I think a lot of
you here will be more interested in
doing that then how hacking a boot to
gecko itself because that's not really
we don't want you to build your own
phones we actually bring these phones to
people and the target market right now
is Brazil where people actually have
millions of phones and they're really
horrible horrible old feature phones
that just basically where you can clap
people to death with
they don't break but they're not fun to
use so we actually partnering with a big
telephone provider there which is
funnily enough called like a telephone
and they are actually bringing out the
device so they are doing the hardware
they're doing a lot of the ending of the
interface together with Gaia and we are
very lucky to have them and it was very
lucky to I was at over the air in London
the other day the biggest mobile event
there and the guy from that company who
gave the talk said like we wanted for
two years to have a web-enabled phone
and then we finally got the budget
internally to start doing it and a day
later Mike a day later Mozilla said that
they're gonna do a web phone and we said
okay there's no way we can compete with
those because who knows the web more
than Mozilla does and we were like hard
gorgeous so here partnering with us on
this so that's what a marketplace is
going to as well so if you don't know
Portuguese yet there's going to be a lot
of Portuguese documentation of our
English documentation being done at the
moment and it's just great to I'm going
to go to Brazil for a few weeks to go at
several conferences and do hack days
there so yeah I put the redhead guy in
the Sun it's a bad idea so yeah I just
want to sort of go for a little bit of
like how to get started with these web
apps because like I said it's pretty
simple like if you know if you already
got website which I imagine most of you
do then you really don't have to do
anything that special it's just a case
of understanding some of the new
features that are being adding into
Firefox yeah basically apps are just a
website so all of those apps you saw on
the bt gecko phone earlier like as
special as they look they are literally
just websites being visualized in a
specific way because of a single JSON
file that's sort of telling the phone or
the browser sort of how to represent it
so yeah if you already know how to make
a website than making a web app is your
complete briefs and it's all because of
that application manifest so all you
need to do to turn any website today
into and into a nap is just include one
JSON file and this JSON file just
describes the application so it's the
the title the description some of the
icons and various sizes where it can be
installed from and that kind of stuff
and then once you have that then the
browser can be told sort of wet
look for that and we'll know how to
install it and what it's called and the
icons and all that kind of stuff and
then it gets displayed in a nice home
screen on a phone on your desktop
browser then it's displayed in however
the the browser decides to display the
apps using that information that it's
got and there's a few requirements when
sort of using these manifest files it's
pretty basic but it's important to know
one of them is that you have to have the
manifest file hosted on the same domain
as the web app which is kind of
straightforward and it's just basically
a security sort of feature that sort of
allows so he stops people from faking
your web apps in sort of making these
manifest files to and still say cut the
rope on a device that wasn't built by
Microsoft or things like that but we've
been adding yeah so we've been using
these sort of things to prevent people
from being able to do that in sort of
the real world which is the best way of
describing it so if you just push
devices as a developer to the phony have
pretty much sort of open access to it
you can do whatever you want like what
we're doing with just the cut the rope
Thurman was just using an iframe in an
app to sort of point to cut the rope and
then display that which was an
interesting demo because it showed us
how little you need to do to some of
these canvas based games to actually
have them working really well on a
javascript-based device that was the
purpose of the cut the rope demo but you
really don't want people doing that if
you've made like a really cool game you
don't want people making money off that
game by selling their own apps sort of
with their own manifest file pointing to
your website so these sort of
requirements are sort of hoping or will
sort of prevent that from happening and
one of the others is a pretty sort of
basic one as well it's just providing
that manifest file with a specific
content type if you know how to set up a
server it's pretty simple to do if you
want to use things like github we've
actually worked with github too if you
host application files and github on get
out pages then it automatically gets
provided by the right content type so
long as you name it as dot web app
the JSON file that is dot web up and
then it will do everything for you I'm
gone now it on github yes yeah yeah so
the github functionality yeah we worked
through them pretty early on and they
did it in like five minutes a really
cool guys so yeah if you just want to
quickly have to give her a nap then use
github pages just to quickly get it
working in and try it out and if you
want to have a look at how your manifest
file actually works and you just want to
make sure it's working there is a
manifest validation tool which is at
manifest org and got all the links for
these everything we've talked about are
in the slides which will put online but
definitely go on there if you just like
have an issue with it and you just want
to make sure it's all sort of formatted
correctly and just to quickly sort of go
through the last bits and web apps one
of the other things is like once you
create this JSON file is how do you
install it and once you've done that the
bits basically up to the browser to sort
of work out how to do that but as a
developer you need to do is one specific
thing and to do that you just need to
basically call this install method on
these this new apps API and what you do
is you just provided the manifest file
that you just created and then if if you
call that from your own website then
you'd be able to install applications
from your own website otherwise you
could that's taking control of by like
the marketplaces like the Mozilla
marketplace will do that for you so you
don't have to worry about that as a
developer you just sort of instead your
application to this marketplace and then
it's all done for you yes the so this
API here yeah this API is in Firefox now
so you can it's actually in Firefox
nightly today yeah so answer your
question good so yeah and what you'd get
in Firefox today is something like that
and that is a basically just a little
door hanger and once you've clicked on
the install sort of provided that
install and cool then it pops up that
door hanger automatically in the browser
the browser now knows what to do with
this application it's just asking for
permission to install that app and then
once you've done that then you basically
get
this native experience that we're
looking at I supposed you wanna talk
briefly about my party yeah I mean it's
the same thing that we that we expected
from air in the past then basically we
have an application that you install on
your desktop or on your mobile phone so
instead of instead of having to have an
index.html they have to double click you
just get the same install process that
if you had downloaded a dmg file on a
mac or an exe on Windows you just it
goes into your Applications folder
there's going to be an icon on your
desktop and you can launch it from the
dock in in OS X for example and there is
no browser UI on the whole thing so you
have a full screen app that looks like
any other but it's just made with HTML
CSS and JavaScript and how cool is that
it's basically like HTA was an Internet
Explorer 4 and 5 with all talk without
all the security holds that we had back
then and yeah you can see that it's an
immersive experience that you don't want
an app to be in the browser with all
your toolbars and all the annoying thing
you want to have a full screen app that
really feels like a full screen app and
also it's just in on the desktop because
end-users again don't know the
difference between them actually the
other day wasn't the apple store here
and I had to hear one of those poor
geniuses explaining to somebody what the
difference between a nap I can and a
photo file is and people just see big
shiny icons and wonder why one thing
does something else and the other one so
we want to make sure once they learn
that we don't have to unlearn something
or learn something new about web apps
because in the end it's apps and sooner
or later everything will be wet believe
me yeah so the question was if if we're
going to have something like extensions
for these native apps that actually
allows you in context to it to extend
the functionality of this app or even
talk to other applications on the same
device much like browsers had extensions
before that made browsers give give
browsers functionality there was no
they're out of the box and I think the
short answer is no and the reason is
because this is web applications that
could talk to each other over the web
and the problem with this kind of
paradigm of making extensions of native
applications is complete the
complexities too high it's the same like
right
werd macros is not for everybody out
there but it's it's interesting for a
few people it's interesting for selling
those inside that so it's up to the web
application developer to build an own
infrastructure in there to allow for
extensions but it's an interesting
concept we could actually tie the
extension libraries that we have for
Firefox into the applications and offer
that as an as an opportunity for HTML
app developers I don't see many people
going for that though because it makes
much more sense to have a server and get
the data from that and that's something
that I'm for example now really don't
like about native experiences but
there's a new level out of Angry Birds I
have to download 15 Meg of data over my
data plan rather than just getting a new
level as a JSON object and with a web
app that would be much much easier to do
with a nice server and you for example
wrote that rockets canvas game then
actually stored DD your your your scores
on a server rather than on the machine
itself so we actually can have a high
score list so instead of extending this
game Extra with an extra level it's a
level of complexity and I don't think
many web apps have done yet but i think
if everything becomes a web app as you
as you alluded to that it's definitely
you've got something interesting i
haven't seen for example chrome do it
yet either with the crumbs with the
chrome apps or the Chromebooks but it's
it's gone it's going to go back to that
I'm culture as well and sort of
something related to that that might be
useful to use if your head of web
intents web intents as we call it web
activities but it's commonly known as
web intents and it's basically a bit the
ability to basically give an application
or a website as sort of a purpose so
like Flickr would be for photo sharing
or YouTube for video showing that kind
of stuff and when another app needs to
upload a video or upload a photo it can
hook into the intent of flickr the
browser already knows that it had that
intent like flickr already told it so
when you go to upload a video or photo
from a different application your
browser knows the kind of services that
you already use based on those intents
and can communicate with them via web
web activities to sort of share that
functionality between the various
applications so it's sort of a it's not
quite exactly what you were saying but
it's yeah that's very important in terms
of security as well the biggest issue
about native applications was through
the sharing of access 11 app being
compromised could then get access to the
old operating system install other
applications and that's why on the web
and with with web technology we make it
make me make sure that they can't talk
to each other without you knowing we
don't want malware on boot to gecko and
on html5 and that's I mean we can say
Lego with with great access comes great
responsibility and these kind of things
but that's exactly what web intents do
the other thing about web intents what
really excites me is that I keep it to
the user to do the things that they want
to do I just want to say star photo I
don't care where they store the photo I
just took a photo with amid canvas and
leave the camera API and the end user
has a flickr account has a instagram
account for now has a facebook account
all these things and i don't want to
know what services this person uses on a
web app in the past like on a web app in
the browser I would have to authenticate
with all of these different services for
on behalf of the user and there was a
lot of like problems coming from that so
with web intents it's basically saying
like I store a photo and I don't care
what you use it's up to you to do that
you can put it up on s3 or on Google
pages if you wanted to it's your choice
and your responsibility to put it where
ever you think is right and the magic
that we had with native apps and we
still have that a lot of resources are
being shared can be rather dangerous and
with a system that is inherently as
distributed as the web it could be a
very very big security hole and the
other thing about web intents what is
really useful about this is like it's
it's a me to an a desktop when I
double-click an HTML file opens in
Firefox for me it might operate an opera
or in Chrome for other people so again
it's up to the user to use the tools
that they want to have to display some
kind of technology or some kind of data
so it's a very very cool way of
distributive disconnecting the intent of
the user
with the system that you don't need
access to and you don't own access to
because once one of those gets
compromised they could talk to the other
one and this way it always goes through
the user to say yes or no and realize
what's going on I see the question was
with technologies like web intents how
does that work with sort of offline
myself I don't actually know how we're
working with offline specifically for
web intents we do have like right so I
mean we do have offline API is like so
you can basically store data or find and
that kind of stuff to sync up afterwards
but specifically for web intents I'm not
too sure what the actual approaches for
the ability to use those offline
specifically because I suppose the idea
is that it's sort of a web application
API to hook into sort of like things
like photo sharing and stuff like that
now I need to look into how that would
work offline spits it specifically if
you've just using offline functionality
and that other web application that
you're hooking into if you still want to
use web intents that would be kind of
useful right yeah so the second part of
that question was like how how could you
use something like web intends to go
from say a photo taking application to a
photo editing application I don't know
the specifics of that process but that's
something we're looking into BTW echo
we're using that to get from for example
the home screen of me to gecko to the
camera application to this little camera
icon at the bottom and if you click that
then it will sort of use web intents to
get into the camera application and
encourage that to open so the specifics
of that I think we're being worked on
there's a lot of stuff that we're
working on specifically before BTW gecko
because we're coming across these
situations like that where it wasn't
necessarily described in the
specification so we're sort of working
as we go but i think we'll sort of get a
consistent approach as bitter gecko sort
of gets nearer yeah there's got to be
quite a few I mean web intents is
actually a lot of pursued by google so i
can ask some really good question of
google i/o do you reel them on stage and
but it's a javascript api so and you
have to
a narrow callback handler as well so if
you were offline and you wanted to share
and it says like oh I can't share your
app could offer shall I stored in local
storage or in an index DB database until
you go online and you have an API to
detect if you're online as well and an
API to detect the speed that you have so
one thing for example it drives me nuts
on Twitter on androids when I take a
picture and then it's gets stuck there
for five minutes not uploading the
picture before Twitter times out and
says like I safety two drafts for you
because I can't use the gallery in
between so a clever way of programming
that would be like okay you're actually
on a really really bad connection as in
everywhere in San Francisco and you try
to upload this right now maybe it's not
a good idea store it locally and then
when you're fast enough I give you an
alert that it's now ready to uploading
so that's up to the app developer again
as well but yeah web intents by
definition are for web interactions so
being online is probably good idea for
web interactions so we just sort of go
through the last sort of pits here so
I'm sort of describe to the technologies
that are involved in bit to get go and
sort of what they mean and that kind of
stuff if you actually want to start
using Bittaker today there's a few
options available to you one of those is
if you know how to use git and you know
where to get firefox nightly which is
pretty simple you can actually just run
Gaia the the front-end operating system
which is probably what most of you are
interested in in Firefox nightly because
it's just websites and web applications
and all those api's are built into
firefox nightly the process that's a
solution is that it's pretty simple to
set up easy to sort of develop with and
you can use the development tools to
some to test your applications and that
kind of stuff the cons is basically that
it's a little bit finicky with like
viewport sizes and stuff so you're not
necessarily going to have you're gonna
have to sort of resize the browser into
the right viewport size and that kind of
stuff we're working on better ways of
doing that right now but this is
probably the easiest way to get started
with bit akiko use the dev tools with
the with the response of you yeah so
something Christian just reminded me of
that we've recently landed in our
developer tools in Firefox is the
ability to have sort of this responsive
mode so you can actually change the
viewport size about resizing the entire
browser and it just changes the
basically the the main view of the
website that you're on and you can
change it to like specific phone
dimensions and that kind of stuff and
we're working on the ability to have
like custom dimensions and stuff like
that which would be kind of cool related
to that there's also something that is
on github which is Gaia dash dev server
which is a little node.js server setup
that just allows it sort of easy as this
process of sort of getting up to speed
with like installing Gaia and testing
web apps and that kind of stuff just in
Firefox nightly quickly so definitely
check that out if you're interested in
doing this it's pretty easy to set up
and it's kind of cool and the final sort
of view that you'll get when you finish
with that is just basically in lightly
browser with guy running fully obviously
not me to get access like the phone
api's and SMS api's and stuff like that
but you get access to the web apps and
that kind of stuff if you're just
building web apps and test it out in the
Guyer environment then you can use
something like this the other one is the
boot to gecko simulator so we're also
calling this bitter gecko on desktop
it's basically just like the nightly
version you just saw but actually sort
of with the consistent viewport size and
all the sort of browser related bits
that you don't need to worry about sort
of stripped out so it's just running
gecko in the background and it's
basically just like web by to just sort
of running in a frame but it has a
little bit more security access and a
few more AP is that you sort of have
access to toes a little bit more of the
boot to gecko experience right now it's
a little bit tricky to install and we're
working on a much easier process to get
that running you basically need to know
how to build Mozilla Central which is
the core sort of code base for Firefox
but if you know how to do that and
you're happy to sort of play around with
that then you can do that today that's
probably the the best sort of midbrain
for getting to grips with beauty
cackling Gaia right now today the last
one is actually putting butta gecko on
your own device so if you're comfortable
with sort of screwing around with your
phone and it's not necessarily a primary
device receptor
flavor in there yeah perhaps what the
devices that we support right now I like
the Nexus and the galaxy s2 if you have
one of those devices just lying around
and you want to try this out today you
can do that the code has been on github
for like that Christian said like over
eight months now and all you need to do
is just follow the mdn documentation and
just follow the build process we've
tried to make this build process as
simple as possible and we've updated it
in the last like few weeks so if you've
tried beauty gecko before and you find
it a little bit tricky and which it was
when it started the build process is
much much simpler now so I definitely
advise it to check it out again we're
also working on thinking about actually
flash devices in the offices of Mozilla
as well so we would have a laptop there
with a button saying like connect phone
put budu gecko on there and then you can
try it out that well so we set this up
in London right now so if you know cheap
flights and you want to go to London
during your Olympics but probably not
going to happen cheap flight but I'm
talking to the team today here as well
because this to me is what really should
be doing it because yeah flashing your
own phone is not fun and it's it's
installing a lot of stuff on you on your
computer as well so we actually want to
make it much easier in Mozilla offices
and also on hack days to actually to
actually flash the phones quickly from a
dedicated laptop which could be a
Chromebook or something like that to
actually make sure that it you can try
it out but let's not forget that like
you can run Gaia in the browser and
nightly so if you just want to build
apps if you just want to play with the
interface itself you don't need to break
one of your phones because we've got
millions of them lying around of course
being like south bay rich people as you
are you don't have to and in the end
this is this is aimed at not replacing
Android and iOS here but it's actually
aimed at devices that are affordable to
people so what we really need to do for
that is apps and we will need for people
to give us feedback on the API so they
become really really interesting for you
to use ghost we're totally happy if
somebody else build something similar
there's a few other process program
programs out there like Tizen for
example which is
open device idea but it's actually
aiming at the high end phones and we're
aiming for the low end phones because
the web is for everybody and you
shouldn't it shouldn't be for some
people that can afford a massively cool
new tablet that displays pictures that
are too big for our 3d PG networks but
so play with it but make sure that this
is for the hardcore geek ones you don't
have to be that hard coking person you
can just use it in your browser as well
and suppose something that I should
probably clarify is if you use Windows
is currently unsupported as a
development environment however nice
office yeah is lovely others there's
nothing to stop you running so basically
you can use this in Linux and Mac right
now but it's nothing to still be running
like a bin to in Windows environment
just to sort of get the build process
running but for example with the the
nightly stuff and yeah with the nightly
stuff you don't need to worry about like
being on Windows and that kind of stuff
that that's fully supported that's
absolutely fine it's just the mozilla
central building that kind of process
that's currently we don't have a Windows
supported environment for that I don't
really know specifically what the status
of that is yet but I'll look into that
but yet just be aware of that that you
basically need to be using Linux or Mac
if you want to actually delve into this
a little bit deeper and start building
and beauty gecko from some the core code
and I think somebody who wants to build
budu gecko from Korres probably a linux
user and very happy to build random
things on it anyways ok so one of the
other things just literally before we
wrap up is if you want to sort of get
involved in bitty gecko then where we
really want you to do that we happily
encourage you to do that there's plenty
of ways to get involved whether that's
just through sort of outreach sort of
talking about it playing around a bit or
actually sort of getting involved in the
code the best way to keep up to speed of
things is to frequent the mailing list
so there's two main main leanest is the
community beauty gecko mailing list
which is more about sort of the non
technical side of things and then
there's the dev boot to gecko
meaningless and again the links in the
slides which is more about the technical
fermentation and some of the
functionality and if you want to get
involved in that then you can do that if
you want to actually help like
submitting code then jump on the github
repository so there's a couple of github
repositories on Mozilla dash beats betta
G and there'll be a boot to gecko
repository in that channel and also a
guy repository and they'll be loads of
issues and stuff if you want to get
involved in start submitting some code
to pull requests get involved and do
that today that'd be really helpful and
the last thing really is to talk to us
like if you want to get in touch with
anyone at Mozilla the best place to look
is on on IRC we pretty much live on
there so I RC Mozilla dog is where you
want to go there's a few channels that
you might be interested in this hash b2g
which is mainly for the the lower level
sort of implementation stuff this hash
guy for the sort of operating system
stuff the graphical side of things then
there's hash open web apps if you want
to talk about the application ap is and
that kind of stuff and also hash web AP
is if you want to specifically talk
about some of the the individual API is
that I was talking about earlier I
suppose we'll sort of end on this like I
think with boots you echo what I'm
seeing at least is that we're on the
threshold of slowing really really
interesting here it's I've not sort of
seen a situation where I've been able to
do so much of JavaScript and do sort of
so many sort of interesting things with
it like moving the vibration motors and
that kind of stuff that kind of is
interesting to me and I definitely
advise it to check out these the booty
gecko projects and play with it in some
sense whether that's playing on the
phones after this talk or actually
giving it a go yourself and I'm really
interested to see where this goes beyond
sort of beauty ghek on mobile phones and
like perhaps this will be something that
we can start using on things like
set-top boxes and TVs and like car
stereos and whatever like the ability to
have a consistent sort of platform
that's using the same technologies on
various different pieces of hardware I
mean maybe we even get those sort of
internet-enabled fridges that everyone
keeps talking about using sort of boot
to gecko in sort of interfacing that
view mobile phone and in some crazy
stuff with web intents I don't know
maybe we will and the
it occurred to me after a while actually
to actually together with some talks my
colleague very much so psycho see here
so he can pester him about this well and
he's like on his playing with iphone
that this is incredible cause for the
first time as a web developer and
somebody who just knows his HTML
Javascript and CSS I can build a phone
interface I can make customized my phone
and not putting like like sticky of
stickers on there and stuff like that
but I can customize the phone itself and
that to me is quite cool and gamey and
everything but say for example you're a
company with 500 people that just want
to have five apps on their and their
logo above it on an iPhone it would be
impossible on Android possibly if you
run your own Android mods and things
like that on this it's writing an HTML
page and flashing it onto the phone and
this is just as you said that's that's
something new and something cool coming
think of a kid's phone with like four
buttons saying like hold school called
mom call taxi call for help Colin hungry
these kind of things on a a STONER phone
like enter pizza order these kind of
things you can do whatever you want with
this interface just thinking about it in
fact we could read out which provider
you have at the moment and give you
different interfaces for the t-mobile
England and t-mobile america card so we
have a complete opportunity to take the
flexibility of the web and what we've
done with the web in the last few years
and put that on the phone and this is
what boot to gecko is about breaking
apart that phone barrier that we didn't
have before and yeah we're almost there
so it's all good okay you expected in a
Microsoft building come on
haha sorry about that I just filmed for
Microsoft I like those guys really but
as I said this is something for you
you're not you're not HTML monkeys
anymore that are really annoyed that
around that corner doesn't show you have
the opportunity to build a phone from
scratch without having to know anything
about Java about any of these things and
if any of you are building apps right
now html5 apps you have a chance to put
them on a device that will be in the
hands of a lots and lots of people in
the future that actually want to be on
the web and can't be right now because
they can't afford those expensive phones
that we have at the moment and with that
I think we just thank you and maybe have
some more questions if the building is
not gonna collapse
