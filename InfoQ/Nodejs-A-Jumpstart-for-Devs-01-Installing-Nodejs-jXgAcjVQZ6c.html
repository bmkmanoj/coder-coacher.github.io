web nerd I teach classes at new circle
if you're like me you use nodejs or
maybe you want to use nodejs
over the last three years I've been
using it a lot and I thought what if I
could put together a video that could
save you some time when you're jumping
into the nodejs world what if I could
save you the mistakes that I had to make
and in about ten minutes introduce you
to the environment of node.js or at
least the important frameworks that you
might want to use within that world so
if you're watching this video I'm
assuming you might not even have no js'
installed let's make that our first
order of business let's open up a web
browser go to node J s dot org I highly
recommend actually using their packaged
installers although there's many ways to
install it I'm gonna do the more
canonical version of their package
installer for Mac click on downloads so
from the node.js downloads page for
consistency I'm actually gonna use a
slightly older version of nodejs and
we'll go to the other releases link I'm
going to grab 10.13 I'm on a Mac it's
got a nice package to download takes
just a bit I'm on a great connection
here that's wonderful node goes in a
place that is easy to access from the
command line as I'm the prompt is
already set up it's going to install for
all users which is really just me that
was the fastest two minutes ever we have
installed nodejs and we can test that
let's go to a command line do a node - -
version and the node package manager
comes along for the ride which we will
definitely need today and we can see
that we have version 1013 installed and
version 1.3 - of the NPM and we're ready
to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
