all here in sunny San Francisco morning
so my name is James Pierce and I'm from
facebook and relishing the opportunity
to tell you a little bit about where we
think html5 is some of the challenges
we've faced and some of the things that
we think both companies like ourselves
but also the community of people like
yourselves can help make html5 the
reality or the you know the
instantiation of the dream that we hope
it all will be so that's me I work at
Facebook i work on developer relations
that said my background and my
speciality is JavaScript and mobile and
so I've kind of been working with some
of this stuff for a little while I've
been on the ups and I've been on the
downs one of the exciting things about
being at Facebook is that I get to see
what it's really like to try and use
this stuff at scale and I can share some
of those inserts with you perhaps so
back in 1997 when i was a wee lad I saw
my first mobile web browser it was a
browser web browser that was running on
an unwired unwired planet platform on
palm 3 device and it was a pretty
miserable experience it was pretty
hockey I mean it wasn't even really the
web so what was this kind of bastardized
version of of the web it used its own
markup language and it even used its own
binary version of HTTP but it was
extremely exciting and you know I was
wide-eyed and everyone was in awe of
what the web was going to become in the
mid-90s anyway but the thought that
there was now a browser running on a
device like this that I could pick up
and put in my pocket and take with me
wherever I went was pretty amazing I
think everybody that kind of got a
glimpse of what the future mobile web
would look like could see that there was
this huge opportunity the web
already was going to escape from the
desktop world and this was only nineteen
ninety-seven and I think we all thought
that there would be this incredible
mobile future and it would happen really
really quickly they would see this kind
of global web that sort of mapped across
the globe that you know went with us
wherever he went it wasn't just on our
desks we could get up and move around
you know that there was going to be a a
global village of billions of people
around the world all connected and all
talking to each other and communicating
via this amazing mobile medium and it
was going to quickly lift us out of this
desktop age that we lived in in 1997 and
create a medium where you know when a
child smiled for the first time you
could take a photo of it and share it
with your friends and you know where you
could check in at a dinner that you were
having in some you know amazing
restaurant or you know where serendipity
could be instantiated by just hanging
out on a street corner and finding out
where your friends were all through the
magic of this mobile device and when we
thought about this future we thought you
know this is going to be incredible this
web is going to be an amazing medium
that'll be innovative it'll be
disruptive it'll be beautiful it'll be
with us everywhere it'll be you know an
intimate part of our lives ah so I
thought this would go and talk about six
months back in 1997 I thought well this
won't take very long i'm sure we can you
know pull this off as the browser we got
people writing content how hard can it
be okay thirteen fourteen fifteen years
later we're finally starting to see this
reality come to life my timing sucks but
it is I think interesting to think about
how we thought this was going to happen
we thought it was going to be the web
that made this happen we thought that
the web was going to me the medium that
would bring this mobile dream to life by
the way this isn't I know this isn't a
mobile conference and this isn't even a
particularly mobile talk but I should
just preface it by saying that i will be
talking exclusively about mobile i will
not be talking about desktops that's
just the world I think we now live in we
have left the desktop age so apologies
that I'm not going to talk about desktop
browsers so this is what I thought we
would get to and we have gotten there
but the point is that it's not the web
that's gotten us there the innovation
the beauty the disruption that's
happening in mobile it's not the web
it's all happening here
all happening on the native platforms
I'm sorry to say that is still the truth
and at Facebook you know we get to work
with native platforms we get to work
with partners and we get to work with
developers who are building iOS apps and
Android apps just as much as they're
building mobile web apps so you know we
can see both sides of the argument and
we know what people are doing but quite
frankly this is where let's be honest
the cool stuff kind of is happening and
in case you think I am just speaking
heresy here just think to yourself look
at your phone how many you know amazing
beautiful innovative disruptive native
apps do you have running on your phone
how many of them can you name you know
you can go on and on and on whether its
path pinterest clear cut the rope you
know Word Lens Spotify bang bang bang
you can just keep naming native apps and
before you even left the first page of
your home screen but if I cross out the
word native and I replace it with web
how many innovative beautiful and
disruptive web apps can you name ah ok
well there's gmail that's pretty cool
there is the Financial Times and Boston
Globe and you know that list gets short
quite quickly and so it's it's just this
place that we are right now that the web
hasn't become the medium for this
innovation in this disruption that is
happening in mobile right now the web is
not where we thought it would be we are
on the back foot we're in catch-up mode
and frankly the stack as a whole is a
little bit out of his depth this is
tough competition and the web needs to
get a bit of its mojo back if you
believe Wired magazine of course the web
is actually totally dead and in fact has
been for several years but what I think
wyd was talking about when they said
that the web was dead and implicitly
html5 was I think inspired by one very
particular moment which was in the
summer of 2007 in the summer of 2007
steve jobs announced the iphone and for
quite a long time the only way you could
build 30 party apps for the iPhone was
in the web browser was using html5
JavaScript CSS 3 and some strange
viewport tags that no one had ever seen
before that was how you created out
as a web community we had that
opportunity Steve gave us a year to
prove that we had what it took to make
the web the first class runtime for this
new mobile age and somehow it did not
happen I don't know whether it was our
fault I don't know whether it was
apple's fault but somehow we had that
window of opportunity and we missed it
we're departing the desktop age we're
joining the mobile age and the web
didn't jump the divide quick enough
somehow and of course the rest is
history so to speak and it's now
although the web is marching forward
slowly on platforms like Apple it's
remarkably difficult to make competitive
apps so why is that well I mean I look
at us a little bit through kind of a
cultural lens and I say well as a
community maybe we just got hung up on
the wrong things you know we got hung up
on pinching and zooming and know what
this we don't need to build special
mobile apps we don't need to build
special stuff we just go to our regular
sites and we pinch and zoom the browser
will take care of it you know we argued
about one web and how you know you
couldn't possibly have a different
experience for different devices that
would be you know Tim berners-lee would
you know would crucify us you know we
worried about thematic consistency
making sure we have the same services
regardless of the type of browser that
we used we worried about alternative
context whether they really exist or not
should we give different things to
people when they're on a train versus
you know their desktop we worried about
fragmentation we worried about server
side adaptation client-side adaptation
proprietary preferences we worried about
you know all of this stuff digital
divides feature detection graceful
degradation progressive enhancement we
are it seems a community of philosophers
because we spend a lot of our time
talking about these high-level abstract
things and we forget to actually write
software and then we come out with
things like this we said don't worry the
web will always win don't worry about
that native stuff it's just a fad the
web will always win how many times have
you heard people say things like this
maybe even I've said something like this
I don't know I'm probably guilty of that
but this is not necessarily a logical
argument this is not necessarily an
axiom we have no empirical evidence to
prove that the web will win in the long
term dewey
of course not so under pinning this is
this kind of conceitedness that we as a
community I'm going to feel bit guilty
saying this arguably we have we think
that the web is going to become
inexorably successful and we just have
to sit back and wait for it to happen so
true believers take the web to be this
sort of inevitable disruptive force and
that these new platforms are merely just
a short-term fad a little bit like the
TV so experienced broadcasting executive
Darryl zanuck in 1946 said television
won't be able to hold on to any market
it captures in the first six months
because people will soon get tired of
staring at a plywood box so what happens
is that generally new technologies
overlay previous ones they don't make
them obsolete you know TV didn't make
the radio obsolete but new technologies
really give up and just disappear and
revert us all back to where we were five
years ago so we can't look at native
platforms and assume that is going to go
away I have no reason to believe that
not've mobile platforms are going
anywhere fast and you know our best use
case or best hope is that we can use
native platforms as an inspiration for
making the web a better place and the
worst case scenario is that we don't and
the web takes an ever more niche role as
being just where you go and look at
read-only documents so whilst we're on
quotes here is another quote from a
relatively well-known web developer when
I'm introspective about the last few
years I think the biggest mistake that
we made as a company was betting too
much on html5 as opposed to native
because it just wasn't there thanks mark
you just ruined my developer relations
year but this is a quote that is born
out of frustration this is our CEO who
has obviously been a relentless backer
of html5 and web technologies as a
platform to help drive you know the
Facebook products onwards and yet he is
prepared to stand up in a very public
environment and say look it just hasn't
worked for us as a company he is
obviously making that Connor that that
quote in a very specific context and
you know that context is the facebook
application itself so we had a as I'm
sure many of you are aware we had on
Facebook native quote native application
until the summer which was version four
not that anyone knew that which was the
personification of the hybrid concept we
had you know a native wrap around the
outside the UI at the top and a few of
the menus were native but more or less
you know eighty or ninety percent of the
screen at any given time was an html5
web view and you were seeing literally
HTML that had been shipped across the
wire and displayed so whether you are
looking at a facebook timeline or a news
feed or you know your settings or group
lists or whatever you were basically
looking at html5 and you know if you
think about where we were as a company
that made a lot of sense when we started
to build out this architecture web
company pure web company you know
Facebook has always been on the web it
is a child of the web era and we had a
pretty awesome collection of very
talented web developers so it was a
natural choice to try to create the
facebook experience using web
technologies it allowed us to launch new
features very quickly without going and
getting apple's permission every time
and it allowed us to reuse a lot of the
mobile web code that we had anyway and
if you ever went to you know
m.facebook.com or you got sent to end up
facebook com inside the frame you got
literally pixel by pixel equivalent
experience and you would think that
actually this would be a classic oh this
would be a wonderful example of a good
app that could be hybridized like this
because you know let's face it it's just
a list of text and a few images and a
few borders right well sadly not it
turns out that the facebook timeline and
the facebook profile newsfeed and so
forth are actually remarkably complex
you know they're extremely image laden
they are infinitely long ultimately so
users expect to scroll and scroll and
scroll and scroll you know every single
story in that news feed has interaction
there are like buttons there are inline
comment buttons and obviously users
expect a certain amount of decoration to
a little bit of gradient a little bit of
shadows and you know they just expect
some texture on there
so even though on paper this is a fairly
straightforward user interface it's
actually remarkably complex it's a
fairly heavy Dom I'm sure we could have
done more to reduce the size of the Dom
but it's it's fairly heavy and frankly
the device even a 4s with you know
fantastic GPU was just struggling to
scroll stuff and use it they just expect
to flick flick flick an infinite list of
their friends status updates and sadly
enough mobile web browsers simply could
not keep up with it so we had to make a
switch and version 5 of the facebook app
although it looks indistinguishable is
now far far more native and in fact one
of our engineers did actually go into
Xcode and do file new project and
started from scratch there are still
some html5 elements inside there but not
the primary views which are now all
rendered natively and you know as
technologists we're interested in why we
did this and how we did this but from a
user's point of view they couldn't care
less they don't know that we built it
one way versus another what they do know
is that it's now twice as fast and what
we know about what they know is that now
they're visiting twice as much content
as they used to do so for us as a
company we've won you know an important
bad layer which is to get our users to
look at our application more and use
content more so was it worth you know
losing half of our content consumption
based on technological dogma well no at
the end of the day facebook is a product
company we need to produce the best and
highest possible quality products as I
think you will do and we made a choice
on this particular product to increase
the amount of native code and give our
users a better experience now that is
not to say that we you know mandate that
everybody else does it we expect every
each and every engineering company
everywhere around the world to be able
to make their own decisions but you know
it's in its the step change that we've
seen as a result has been dramatic I'm
sorry to say and our rating on the App
Store went from one and a half stars 24
in three weeks you know what product
managers does not want to see
the product being more than twice as
well rated within three weeks that's
what we got by switching away from a
hybrid view I'm sorry so you think the
what I'm trying to say is that building
native apps from in a hybrid views like
this is dead but you know of course not
you know our challenges are not the same
as yours but we may be but we can't
guarantee that you've got the same
decision tree to go down as a decision
tree that our product team had to go
down you know we have a very complicated
site we have an awful lot of content we
have quite a lot of users and we need to
quickly and you know a very high quality
meet their expectations we also have a
rather large engineering organization it
was a lot of effort a huge amount of
effort for facebook to retool around iOS
we had to go in higher iOS developers we
had to build a whole new tool chain we
had to create a whole load of new server
api's to deliver content to this
application it was extremely hard it was
extremely painful to do it but you know
from a product point of view the rewards
have been worth it not every company is
able to make those kinds of decisions
but you know we're still not saying that
html5 is dead and in fact if you listen
carefully to what Mark said the rest of
his quote which conveniently didn't get
recorded by much of the tech press was
this it's not that html5 is bad you know
actually in the long term I'm quite
excited about it I'm trying channel
marker one of the things that's
interesting is that we actually have
more people on a daily basis using
facebook on the mobile web than we do on
iOS or Android combined and in fact
that's true these are our iOS and
Android apps in terms of monthly active
users and our mobile web app which is
twice either of them more than both of
them combined so yes we don't put
numbers on the left hand side of this
graph but I can assure you we have 600
million mobile users this is a
statistically significant sample of how
people use our services and really you
know the mobile web html5 remains pretty
much the only way that we can reliably
deliver a rich and compelling experience
to seven thousand different types of
devices a day not all of our users have
an iPhone and not of all of our users
have an Android device we still have to
serve content to many many other types
of device and in fact even iPhone and
Android
users you know continue to use our
mobile web aggressively and as I said
inside the app there are still lots of
html5 views so we have not forsaken it
we've just switched out the bits that
really mattered something else that's
interesting is that in order to do this
in order to increase the native mix on
our device we've had to do a lot more
rendering on the client side so
previously a lot of the views that you
saw in that hybrid app we're actually
being generated as HTML on the on the
server side because they were coming out
of the same code base as WWE facebook
com one of the things that this native
app has done is allow us to think more
about rendering stuff on the client side
we've switched out tags for curly braces
on the wire and we're now sending you
know far more kind of data centric
material over the wire and then getting
the device to actually render a view
from that and it will be interesting to
see whether we can reuse some of that
infrastructure that we've created to go
back and revisit some of the web
approaches that we've used in the past
and start doing more client side
rendering on on web apps too so anyway
all of that's a long way of saying sorry
for the churn sorry that we are
apparently you know throwing all of our
toys out the basket and upsetting the
html5 community but i do believe and i
know i'm not alone that you know every
technology goes through a hype curve of
some sort and html5 is no different we
are on this hype curve where everybody
gets excited about something then you
realize it isn't quite as good as they
thought it was and then it gradually
becomes adopted and there are various
names that I can't remember for each
part of these this this curve but I
don't know where html5 is on that curve
depends how controversial I want to be
it's certainly over the top it's some
way down the other side but you know
what in a way that's a good thing
because it means that people are asking
critical questions about what this new
stack can do it means that people are
critically addressing the challenges
that it needs to overcome in order for
it to become the long-term success we
all want it to be you can have as many
shiny demos as you want to get up the
left-hand side but at the end of the day
that's going to be a successful business
medium we need to understand how to
solve the problems and get through that
trough of despair I think that's what
it's called on to some longer term
success
so I don't see html5 is necessarily this
vanquishing event inevitability but I do
think we need to figure out how to climb
the hill and I think to get there there
are three obvious and big challenges
which we all have to solve collectively
and since as long as I've been working
in the web these have been the same kind
of problems that we've always dealt with
now what are the capabilities of the
runtime that we're hoping to create our
applications on now how are we going to
get it distributed so that people know
where they are and you know can choose
our app over someone else's and how can
we make money out of them and frankly
unless you are building those shiny
little demos you know as a developer
you're thinking about all of these
things before you even open an IDE you
know if you're going to try and build a
business out of your craft you need to
think about these things and have some
ideas about how to solve them so let's
start with the capabilities so you know
this is obviously the cool bit and a lot
of the conference today or yesterday and
today you know is about cool new stuff
you can do new tags new JavaScript API s
and shiny CSS calls and that's all
wonderful look I can blur an image in a
browser but all of this demo were the
html5 goodness does come with a darker
side and in fact there are two dark
sides one is that you know there's a
standard ation standardization process
you want to use this cool stuff in the
real world you need to be able to
understand how to watch as that
technology comes through a
standardization process gaining and
losing preface prefixes as it goes and
secondly you are still entirely at the
whim of what the browser's can do it is
very very hard to polyfill certain
things above and beyond what the browser
ultimately allows you to support so the
tidal pull and push of what web
standards permit you to do and what
browsers permit you to do is what our
little develop a boat to Bob about on
and it's always been like this so you
know regardless of any snapshot in the
web's history if you were to look at the
percentage of support for some given new
set of capabilities you know there is
always going to be some on the
right-hand side some amazing new set of
things you want to use which are not
supported by anything and on the left
hand side there's always some really
base you know commoditized basic
information that is supported by pretty
much everything and as a web developer
you've got to decide where you want to
live your life you know do you want to
do stuff that's supported by everybody
have a nice easy life or do you want to
try and really you know push yourself
off to the right-hand side poly filling
as you go and by the way it's always
been like this it's not a function of
today there's the web has always been
like this since there was more than one
browser and there's this kind of pain
zone in the middle which is where you'd
love to use something and it's more or
less getting standardized it's more or
less something you're going to be able
to use competently but not everything
quite support SATA and in mobile this is
a particularly painful zone simply
because there are so many different
devices there are so many different you
know screen sizes and types of support
and this is the pain zone for developers
I in fact I think we should call it the
rage geyser and this is where developers
have a bad day because something you
were hoping to use isn't working
reliably and consistently so the
question is how can we rein this in how
can we you know get a better
understanding what diversity is how can
we shorten the time it takes for diverse
capabilities to come to a broad market
and how can we make sure the browser
vendors are working on the things that
as developers we really care about so
this is kind of a background story to
why we with a bunch of other companies
got involved with an initiative called
core mob so the w3c as i'm sure you
aware has a standardization process and
also has a community group process where
you know interested parties can get
together and discuss standardization and
try to move agendas forward so we
created the core mobile web platform
group back in May no much march of this
year and this is now the w3c's largest
community group and it is an opportunity
for companies from around the mobile and
web general web space to come together
and think about what really needs to be
addressed what are the priorities for
developers in terms of the capabilities
that are required and it really has an
agenda with three parts to it one is to
agree on the core features that
developers need and can will have to
depend upon in order to be successful in
this new medium secondly to compile you
know test Suites and create test suites
that allow us to see which browsers are
in fact giving us what we need as
developers and thirdly identify you know
a framework by which we can actually
prove that those pro
sations were correct and let me just
took a little bit about how that works
but one of the things that we produced
as part of this initiative was a test
suite called ring mark which we
developed in conjunction with the
community in conjunction with buku
actually and ring mark which you know
runs on our NGO is a little bit like the
old acid tests or SunSpider tests a
chance for you to see how well a browser
ranks against these kind of capabilities
that we expect and what we've done is
chosen specifications and prioritize
these specifications according to what
we think the web needs to compete with
native platforms this is an important
point so ring 0 which is kind of a
snapshot of where we are is you know
okay do you have some baseline stuff
that a runtime ought to be able to
provide you do you have app cache so you
can take this stuff off line do you have
geolocation can you show video can you
store data in reasonable amounts offline
and you know can you use canvas for
improved drawing performance and pretty
much most devices on the market mobile
devices that we all know and love are in
ring 0 that's more of a kind of a
snapshot of a current state than
anything else ring one on the other hand
is what we have judged to be the
features that would be required if you
wanted to rebuild eighty percent of the
world's native apps in web technology
I'm not saying anyone wants to do that
but it is a good way of knowing that
you've got the right capabilities put
into the browser's so you know you want
to compete with native apps you need to
have accelerated canvas you know you
need to have your GPU on your side you
need to have drm to be able to do music
apps you need to have better handling of
fonts and you know being able to track
history and store more data and you know
get better touch event control and so
forth because I tell you what native
developers will have this and they take
you for granted it's like table stakes
so you know these are things that the
web still aspires to have in many cases
or browsers to aspire to provide but
which developers ought to just have to
be able to do their jobs and we actually
painting brother painstakingly went
through a list of the top hundred apps
in both the apple app store and the
android marketplace or Android Play and
we look to each and every app and we
figured out that if we have these extra
capabilities but
some others I haven't listed you would
be able to match eighty percent of those
native apps on the web runtime that
would be an important step forward being
able to get access to the camera
wouldn't that be wonderful and then ring
to which is kind of like an aspiration
for what would happen after that is
where we start to push the boundary a
little bit and say look there are some
pretty amazing specifications coming
down the line whether it's WebGL which
hasn't hit mobile quite so much yet you
know streaming audio api's web sockets
SVG etc you know and and pretty much if
with the suite of API so html5 promises
in the grand scheme of things you have
theoretical parity with pretty much any
native app I think so you know obviously
this is designed to be a catalyst it's
designed I supposed to be a bit of
gamification of the browser space
particularly in mobile and it's about
trying to push their gender on and make
sure developers voices are being heard
and in fact just a couple of weeks ago
we saw the first browser reach ring one
it's not Android it's not Safari it's
not chrome sadly enough although of
course those are all improving but it is
a browser called dolphin and it's a you
know an installable browser for Android
which now passes ring one and actually
does rather well on ring too as well so
you know of course it's easy to optimize
a browser simply to pass tests and you
know the cynic in me might say well
that's exactly what they've done here
but you know what it's it's it's
demonstrating that this stuff can be
done it's not impossible yes some of
these specifications are still a little
bit wobbly but you know it is possible
to build stuff that developers can now
create pretty compelling apps on and of
course we want to make sure the
knowledge about what these different
browsers can and cannot do is getting
back out to developers and there's no
point I was reinventing that wheel so
we've hooked all of the test results
into browser scope I'm sure you you know
you're all familiar with browser scope
and so there's a ring mark section in
here where you can see how different
browsers are doing against the different
rings to give you a sense of which of
those runtimes are going to be ready for
you to build rich client side native ish
style applications because you know what
you know if you're building a camera
application a photo sharing application
you don't have access to the camera you
just
have an application you know if you're
building a music app and you don't have
access to audio api's you don't have an
appt if you're building a game but you
don't have accelerated canvas or WebGL
or even the ability that lock the damn
rotation you don't actually have a game
so we get very excited about things like
graceful degradation and progressive
enhancement and that's all wonderful and
there are unicorns and flowers in the
meadow and everything but actually we do
ourselves a disservice we've got to
stand up and say no you know what we
have to have this capability otherwise
there's nothing progressive or graceful
about going out of business so that's
what that group is all about and the
good news is that 2012 has really seen
stuff moving along a decent pace so I
did some sessions earlier in the year
where I was talking about device api's
is something close to my heart you know
there are so many things that a mobile
device can do that the browser should be
able to give us access to such as the
camera such as the vibrator and the
sensor and the various other
capabilities that are on the OS around
the browser and you know this list was
looking pretty sparse at beginning of
the year in terms of browser support but
it's actually now moving at a reasonable
pace we have got and we actually had at
the end of last year camera support
through the input type equals file
format in Android but that just with iOS
6 has landed on the iphone and ipad 2 so
you can now actually upload a photo from
the camera yay you know this is a big
step forward it might sound like a
trivial little demo but you know what we
put that straight into the facebook app
because we were getting i don't know how
many bug report today from users saying
i can't upload a picture in my facebook
app well of course they were using the
web app which just happens to look
exactly the same except that button had
to go missing because we couldn't wire
it up to the camera or to the gallery so
thankfully we were finally able to put
that back that button back in to the
MDOT facebook version of the app and now
our users are cheerfully uploading
images from their iphone through the
browser so that's been a huge win for us
in particular and of course any of you
that want to build social photo apps of
any sort now have that as an API that
you can use pretty exciting but really I
mean the granddaddy of media API is that
I am most excited about and any of you
that aren't familiar with it you know
keep an eye on this because it's pretty
cool is
user media and get user media is
obviously a ritual way of getting access
to audio or video streams coming in off
the camera or the microphone of a device
the spec is moving around a little bit
but it's kind of getting there and we
now have a fairly straightforward API
fairly easy to use API that gets you
access to the camera and the video it
landed in operating around spring I
think with opera 12 on mobile and it's
now in chrome and firefox nightly since
i think july i'm sorry i don't actually
know about internet explorer but anyway
get using media is is a pretty exciting
thing and of course this now opens up a
whole lot of new web apps that use this
real-time communication so getusermedia
spec as part of web RTC and so i built a
little demo earlier in the year of you
know basically a photo sharing app and
you know it only ran on opera 12 and now
it runs on three different rousers which
is a big step forward for me and for my
demos but something else I wanted to say
about this little app that I built is
sitting on github somewhere it's like 96
lines of code so you know what I talk
about trying to get the mojo back for
the for the web you know there aren't
that many platforms in the world where
you can build a fairly comprehensive
photo app in 96 lines of code but with
all the markup and the CSS and the
javascript required to build a photo app
you know it actually turned out to be
pretty elegant in the end and once we
see that roll up to more browsers
that'll be very exciting so whilst it's
talking about capabilities I should talk
about performance this is kind of like
another one of those elephants in the
room when it comes to web particularly
versus native as I said when we upgraded
our app from web to native we increase
the performance by two times and we
increase content consumption by two
times those two things are entirely
correlated and pixel by pixel users can
barely tell the difference between the
two apps so it was performance that was
the forcing function for that increase
in engagement so I don't think it takes
too much as a thought experiment to
think we'll hang on if the browser had
been twice as performant and if the
scrolling had been twice as fast we
wouldn't have had to have left html5 at
all we would have still have got our
goal which is to have twice
much content consumed we had to go and
rebuild the entire thing from scratch if
the browser got twice and far twice as
fast we would have had the same end
result so it turns out the performance
is really really important we can't keep
burying our heads in the sand and saying
yes okay so I know I know the frame
rates are crappy and I know the
scrolling is really bad but don't worry
you have to worry because it does make a
huge difference users deeply deeply care
about this stuff so when someone says
you know you don't sacrifice X for
performance they're wrong you don't
sacrifice anything for performance so
clearly performance is a major issue
that we need to keep working on and
sadly it's just one of those things you
can't really codify and make empirical
for the purposes of standardization you
know performance is a feature but you
don't ever hear someone say oh it should
scroll like butter in a w3c spec but
that's what users expect and that's what
they're going to use to judge whether
the app you created was good or bad not
whether you use tags or curly bracket so
I'm no Steve Souders but of course you
know we are we we have lots of ways that
we can make web apps run faster and more
smoothly it is pretty hard though I mean
we had to put a lot of developer effort
into making stuff performance and you
know my dirty secret this year is I have
been building some iOS apps I'm very
sorry about that you know I feel guilty
bringing objective c to an extra up
html5 conference but you you can't make
it not fast it just is always going to
scroll like butter it's really hard to
make an iOS app not look beautiful and
not scroll wonderfully but on the web ah
you have to put up so much effort into
it so you know if we're prepared to
continue to take that effort on
ourselves then great but I'd actually
rather see the runtimes their game and
improve the performance there finally I
mean if we want html5 to be thought of
as a fully fledged tech stack that can
stand up against the competition we have
to have documentation that goes with it
and I'm sure you're all aware if I am
sure I'm not the first person to mention
it but there is a now a fantastic site
on the web called web platform dog which
is going to be the canonical whether
it's already really the canonical source
for all of the web stack information and
content that you as developers need
whether it's JavaScript CSS HTML HTTP
and various
kind of metadata standards so we were
actually small and very humble
contributors to the kickoff of web
platform dog last week and I guarantee
that is going to be an essential piece
of kit for us to get our mojo back and
become a community that knows what it is
doing in a canonical way I just wanted
to finish off quickly with a couple of
words about the second to hear I know
this is not really a business conference
we're not here to talk about
monetization and so forth but it is
worth remembering that this is the
reason why a lot of people go down a
native room it's not because they prefer
writing Objective C or Java it's because
they can't see how to make money and get
people to use their apps if they build
them with html5 so unless we're happy
for html5 to be a hobby of shiny little
demos we have to figure out how to get
it to keep the lights on as businesses
so one of my colleagues Simon cross was
at the phonegap day in Amsterdam last
month and I'm sure you're all familiar
with phonegap it's a way of wrapping you
know your web assets into a native
rapper and it provides simple advice
api's and it provides push notification
capabilities and payments and allows you
to publish your app to the app store and
he asked the attendees at that
conference what of those for was the
reason that they chose to put their apps
into phonegap and the answer of course
is d ninety percent of the people use
phonegap do not use device api's do not
use push notifications and do not even
use the payments capabilities are now
available they do it simply to get their
web assets into the App Store so that
should make you you know stroke your
chin and think a little bit wait a
minute you know phonegap was not
designed to be a monetization framework
but actually it's it got a distribution
framework but that's exactly what it is
people don't actually use the device API
is very much they're just told by their
boss to get it into the app store so
they think okay I'll check it in poker
you know why are they choosing phonegap
it's either to get distribution or it's
because your boss said so well I can't
fix be but I can fix a and if we fix a
then B will take care of itself there is
this assumption perhaps amongst non
technologists that just the App Store is
just where everything has to be it's
where the CEO expects to find his
company's app which where the client
expects to find their newest campaign as
technologists that may make us rip our
hair
yeah but anyway you know let's let's do
what they want because they pay the
bills and you know let's get it out
there so phonegap is fantastic i love it
but is that the only way that we can
make ourselves heard is that the only
way we can get our assets out into the
real world I hope not and I know this
presentation isn't necessarily about
Facebook but I ought to mention that we
do have a billion users and we have 600
million of those on mobile active every
month and another number which we don't
publish but it is also extremely high
who only use facebook on mobile that is
the amazing number and that is rising
the fastest of all so we have an
incredible population who are only
looking at their mobile device for their
daily web experience and for their daily
social experiences and that is a huge
opportunity because if they're seeing
stories that are being told by their
friends if they're seeing the apps that
are being used by their friends that is
actually a very powerful way for them to
discover your applications and i think
it's a it's not a replacement but it's
an augmentation of how you can get your
app discovered not just in an app store
but also through seeing people's friends
using and the background to this theory
by the way is not Facebook specific this
is a trend we're seeing generally you
know is the web used to be this
anonymous mesh of documents all linked
together with hyperlinks you know very
very flat and everybody had exactly the
same experience on a day-to-day basis
and you had to go looking for stuff you
had to go and pull content out of this
web it to know what it was you were
looking for first and your life pretty
much began every day with one of these
okay this was how your day started Oh a
box let me think I'm gonna go and look
at the news let me type in news or or
maybe something happened in Iraq i'm
going to type iraq into a search box you
know that's how you navigated the web
but this decade of the web is more about
something that's oriented around you as
a person where you sort of expect to
have content push to you you know you
find it ambient lee on twitter or you
find it in your facebook news for you i
don't know do people still use RSS you
find stuff kind of ambient lee pushed
towards you and it's personal as its
socialized you know the content you see
on the web is going to be different for
you than it is from the guy next to you
so really that gives us an opportunity
to answer people's questions like this
you know what apps to my friends use
not just which apps can I find in that
goddamn App Store categorized in some
bizarre way and so you know without
wanting to bang on the drum too much but
it's kind of what we think Facebook can
do to help developers if they can build
compelling social apps that people like
to use and people like to use to tell
stories to their friends that is another
way for your name and your app to get
out there to the extent that we now of
course have an app center of our own now
where we list out the apps that we know
are running against facebook and which
we know will users are being users are
using and which apps your friends are
using and so forth and the important
thing to note here is that this app
store has native apps in it has android
apps has iOS apps but it also have mo
has mobile web apps they are all on par
users don't know which ones they're
looking at they don't know how they were
built it's just apps as far as users are
concern so if you're an html5 developer
and you want to monetize your app you
now have an opportunity to sell it in an
app store you now have an opportunity to
do in app payments you now have an
opportunity to you know build a business
out of this stack so well we hope we're
helping in some way there so look it may
be possible to argue and I don't know
hopefully I can we can prove history
wrong that the web was really just an
anomaly it might not be this inevitable
thing that lives on forever and ever it
might just be that the web was a thing
that happened at the end of the PC era
and which the mobile web or the mobile
era rather just completely dispensed
with we never needed the web from now on
and you know if the web is just going to
be a dusty bookshelf of anonymous
documents then then it probably will
just die in the same way that libraries
die there there they serve a purpose but
it's not really where people spend most
of their lives anymore so what I hope is
that the web can be lifted out of that
it can be you know it can be more than a
bookshelf and it can become an operating
system you know the web html5 provides
the opportunity to run rich and
compelling applications that stand on
their own two feet and which are not out
of their depth with respect to the
native brethren I think the web has an
exciting new opportunity of course it is
up to us it is up to you to go and prove
that I'm not talking rubbish
and that there is innovation and there
are ideas and there is a desire to push
things forward and I hope that by doing
that by demonstrating what we can do and
by continuing to lobby the runtime
environment to improve we can get there
at every conference like this someone
stands up and says oh well of course you
know the radio was supplanted by the TV
and the TV was supplanted by you know
the internet and you know we spent the
transitions from one area to the next
trying to apply the old cliches to the
new world and certainly I do see a lot
of that I see people taking old web
thinking and just trying to splat it
onto mobile we have to think bigger than
you know we have to think that the that
the web of the next decade is going to
be this amazing rich compelling place
with devices that support all the
capabilities that we need innovative
beautiful disruptive like this dream we
had 15 years ago let's unencumbered our
selves from our desktop dogma and figure
out how to embrace and get excited about
these new opportunities and make html5 a
better and more ambitious place thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
