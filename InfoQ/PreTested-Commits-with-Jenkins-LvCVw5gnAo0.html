junkies I currently work at GLAAD visit
an object and I assume sounds like there
is no need to introduce what changes is
so I guess I'll skip that part so the
you know one of the theme for me in
during jenkins is that we wanted the
shift mode or code from your laptops and
computers to the servers you know that's
I think that's a part of the motivation
for doing this in the first place but
when we do get how successful you are in
doing that it's kind of somewhat
questionable you know it's good thing
that they're doing the continuous
integration ads still more disability
solely but one of the consequences is
that the now that the manager notice is
that a lot of the times feel the broken
people end up making sure that you know
the people end up running extra tests
since I want to make sure that they
deport the depository isn't broken so
that results in having more test time on
local computers meaning more wait time
for people so you know so that's that's
that's kind of a that's kind of a
problem for me that isn't I ended up
creating more work load for clients not
the server so you know so that's why I
guess the notion the retested commit it
that was originally turned by jetbrains
for Team city bus was born the idea was
that well so that let's run the test on
the server before before you commit it
and then so that's why the name is
Godfrey tested commit meaning you tested
stuff before you committed it so i guess
the motivation for this feature should
be pretty obvious that you wanted to
make changes mo safely because you do
make mistakes occasionally because we
are all humans but when that happened we
don't want that the block other people
in the team yeah and so they but we also
wanted to run the test asynchronously
meaning again we don't want to use your
laptops
computer that occupy your attention to
be running heavyweight computing tasks
that that keeps the idol and so I mean
even we think that testing and
development I think there are still it's
not practical to run the entire test
suite on your computer if you can fish
that put it on to some other nodes
that's better but and I guess the
another reason this is useful it's not
just the fact that the people make
mistakes but they tend to compile it
because well if you think about the
simplified notion that as every
developer is making that's a ten percent
mistake so every one in ten committees
bad it is probably sounds like a
reasonable rate and as we add up add
more people to the team let's say if you
have like 10 or 12 20 people in the team
just by the master you get these amazing
result that on average I mean eighty
percent or more time you got some
program going on the deposited a rather
be disastrous I say we have means to
commit in the cop listing specularly
modular lighting these things help
individually testing things at help but
dragon at the same time on a large on
the large a the legacy projects you can
easily do these things you get any help
you can get out of everything and then
that increase the CI server so yes no
one way I guess what way the others if
you look at the other example that cash
if the way they design things is that
they fit be staged in the system so even
ish the whole of the system is
compromising on face they got this
compartment in place that they don't you
know one halogen sink this ship so the
goal the solution for this kind of
program shouldn't be that everyone run
tests as hard as they can and make sure
there is no mistake now you want more
systematic solution that the end doesn't
depend on people working hard right so
that's I think you know that's that's
kind of the motivation for this area I
think that's part of the reason why many
people are interested in this area I'm
so then back to this original idea of
the pretest become its meaning you know
sending running tests on the server
before you commit it turns out that
at least in my opinion this is this is
not exactly a bright idea because you
end up this this the idea of sending
back and forth to death that you change
the change that you're considering to
commit is actually be problematic in
many ways so you know you have to think
about where you keep them both on the
server-side and client-side because once
while you are sending a test to the
fervour you want to work on something
else so because you're does not commit
you haven't committed this change yet
we're all you're going to do is that or
oftentimes you want it to run the
changes by other people so this is
somewhat tied to the notion of code with
you I guess that's inherent in what we
are doing here but again that doesn't
work very well and so or you know while
the server is running a test you put
that test you put this change asides
started working on something else and
then you learn that the test has broken
so you want to do that switchback the
context and it's a shuttling board these
changes arrive and if you start thinking
about other files level operations like
you know creating a new file deleting it
moving them around quickly start to get
pd very painful and in in fact for
longest time you had a better tool to do
with this and then the third name is
called version control system right that
this is exactly a tool that designed for
forearm managing changes and then
keeping track of history so those tools
end up be inventing the world and
control system on its own trying to
create this professor Cohen feature so
you know I think a better approach and
that's becoming more and more if that is
realistic in many environment is
actually you actually create a commit
before you test it's just at the again
at the gate is primal example of this
but it's just a bit you create a commit
in your way that doesn't block colours
so employ distributed version control
system this is pretty obvious right the
act of creating commitment and fishing
those changes del Sur is inherently
decoupled but even with centralized
version control system like that says a
version you can steal things do things
like this by say using branches so you
just create a commit but you do so in
your place that doesn't affect others
until the engines come in later and
verify that your changes are good
so that's why you know I think this time
pre-tested communities bit of a
misdemeanor that it should be difficult
okay what I call as a very dated Mars
but in my mind what Jenkins does is it
takes the commit that he already created
that just it's just that you're not sure
about the quality of it and so it takes
that commit and the more deep is the
current tip of the depository and then
verify that and then push the result so
what what's really going on here is the
fact that year you're validating the
emerging the changes with the validation
that comes from the running of the test
so i think the this practice you firstly
morris indicate because i guess that's
very things like this was most natural
you know people had this the distributed
version control system x is very easy so
the originally I think this practice has
mostly devolved in the garret and
Jenkins and get combination so the
cavities are called reduced to forget do
you does any of you you scared okay so
all right so two of you so yeah so it's
a code review to forgive and then so
someone from sony ericsson sort well and
this was originally called a video so
having other people look at that but
what if we treat jenkins like just
another review are so he doesn't
understand the code in any meaningful
way but he can run the test with a code
and if the test all will be good then
this review our is machined of you'd
give you this plasma design of approval
and then get it comes with all these
work flow control system that i guess
that's a part of the code review so when
enough people sends in their approval it
will merge the changes pushed to the
depository and do all kinds of other
nifty things that makes it workable as a
kind of validated board system so what's
going what happens with this kind of
scheme is now let's say you know d you
got those three committing a divorce fee
that's replicated for in all all places
they got the mastery forestry that
contains so this is where the team with
two changes from and then you get is a
garret that so that you can think of it
as other like a gatekeeper it is the one
that takes all the kind of potentially
broken change
but it's sort of controlling the access
to the real map faster ups 2 ND poultry
and then on the left-hand side you got
your own development computer so in a
you busily hack the college and then you
create a new commit and instead of
pushing that it upstream you push that
into gary and so the garret and jenkins
collaborate behind the scene and see if
this test is actually good or about and
if it's validated to be good this change
then gets pushed into the master so it's
sort of again it's acting as a buffer so
that the changes that started the fair
the validation isn't it the mustard
upholstery so let me show how that works
for you so here I'm running a garret
server own so the garret is a java
application that's double fire Google
guys and then it's used in pretty large
scale in android so this is it you I
right now there is no so these are the
past abuse it's in this case I guess
it's just me pushed anything thing
letting Jenkins tested and this is my
local Jenkins instance that's not what I
should be saying oh sorry
oh yeah and then I got this up another
and then I'm running this Jenkins fees I
get it plug so we should be seeing this
or that looks like i was studying and a
wrong instance of the of Jenkins yeah so
the so this like I said this is
available the flagging that called
garrett III of flagging that you need to
install and then there's a few
configuration you have to do it details
Inc is that Philippa where is ya get it
serviced and so on so so those
configuration is to be done that front a
little bit and then this is also where I
specify the workflow profits in this
case the I'm not actually interested in
doing a code ready for sea but I'm only
interested in validated more features i
give this like i said if the drinking is
successful in building things i give
this to meaning trust to I guess the
plus one minus one comes from this
Apache community where you're voting
things for the past two meaning
overriding okay boat so if assume that
this comes in everyone else's comment
doesn't matter ended it just gets gets
pushed into the the upstream and so here
I have a job so I have a royalty so yeah
have a job configured that does the
action of our relation and the only
trick so discard the eat people three
that's specifying so this theory 8080 is
from from Garrett and then they all i
have to do essentially is there's one of
instruction that specifies a is strategy
meaning like what hype hide i think is
decide what to build so this needs to
get the derrick trigger but that's
basically it and then i can specify
whatever process
geology is for doing the actual build so
in this case I'm not doing anything
interesting about running a shell script
but you could imagine a cleaner running
so build not only just one in a test but
let's say integrator is code quality
metrics so with other plugins you could
for example configure that there be no
new finding bugs errors or like you know
you have to have a coverage that's going
up not going down so you could use those
things of the criteria and it could take
some time to do all these validation and
the people don't really care that much
because as far as people concerned once
they make a change and fish that they
carry that work is over and so even if
the validation process takes one hour as
opposed to say five minutes that's not
much of a program so so that's all I
need to do in terms of the configuration
and so too so till after eight yes it
except it's cut on the left which is a
bit painful they mean yeah so i have to
work spaces here I said to simulate what
like the developer see versus what
another person in the community another
person in the team would see I have this
few workspace and so one is the one in
red this from Alice another hypothetical
co-worker of mine and then on the blue
from time going to be working at coast
gave who's going to make changes right
so what I'm going to do is so I already
have a check that workspace so I'm going
to touch the build script and then hello
from jacks and then make the beautiful
bye-bye exiting non-directive code so
implemented awesome picture and then so
now i'm going to push this to to the
origin so the dirt have this little bit
weird wait what did it be but that
wasn't the crime
yeah a little oh sorry so let me let me
try this again so the Garrett had a
little bit of the magic between rest
rest going so the I big picky on Miss
specifying a branch name yeah so in the
last comment i ended up by passing the
bypassing the code review because i'm
also a demonstrator and so I have this
permission to dessert but here I did
manage to create their views i did a
fish so what I actually have done is the
to push the branch of the master to this
magic ref called mattress to master so
what that does is it indicates to the
garret that I'm doing a review so if I
now go see this guy it should be already
tested so yeah so the rebbe authority
gets created and this has all kind of
details about the changes that I created
because you know it's a code review
system it expects people to actually see
the change like here so these are the
actual discs and then we can see what
those things are bad but more
importantly so the Jenkins notice that
there was up unicode they be created
they give you number 30 so you see that
on the I guess the menu here there is
that review from the authority and I may
I made the changes so that the build
skill to fail so it runs my changes and
then it failed it and so the Jenkins
acting as a review our post a comment on
the ticket I mean do indeed described
here sorry and then affording that it
failed so I not very people get the
feedback about the failed field and then
often in places where people do the
actual real code review by humans they
often before that until of a students
which I mean because you know if the
code is broken there is no much not much
reason is spending a time on looking at
the color right because it's obviously
bad so it's helpful in that way so
I just to complete this work though so
while this potentially broken change was
being worked on if I switch the other
another coworker and then if I pull from
master take it and you see I'm not going
to see a bad change except the one that
i wrongly committed idea and so the
other people in the team is protected
from the failure so now let me come back
to the coast k and i'm going to edit
this cliff again good after 60 other
greek something like that and so
it's not supposed to create any raviga
i am not sure
Oh
there
oh this doesn't look good actually Oh
sir yes sir ok so i guess so the reason
well this is a bit of a mess 30 so what
I was supposed to do was actually not
instead of the adding this dash M it
overrides the messages i needed to keep
it so that's why I guess ended up
creating new reviews but what I actually
wanted to do was the update the original
review and then I've it will so I can
push a new tent near party into this
existing the view and then drinking suit
we validate the change and they need you
accepted but since I kind of messed up
the commands let me just abandon all
these changes and then what I'm going to
do is reset to you or if you master and
then it's gonna fix that
broken be off and so by ignoring all the
other audio guys if I do t 33 and we
should be building that if it hasn't
happened already tonight is ready 33 you
are successful and then so the this
change automatically gets should be
merged except it didn't happen Oh to
your past conflict ok so i guess it's a
warning t we wanna meet you to manually
more stuff
ok and so this time I have to force the
pressure ink anyway so this was a
this I'm not sure all right well so
clearly this is not as what I intended
but yeah so well so just I guess just to
show what was supposed to happen so in
this case he was failed they
automatically fish because I had this
much conflict but if if that wasn't the
case then it will automatically push the
changes and then so that the other
people can access it and so that was the
point supposed to be the point of this
demo and you know the i guess the
highlight that i wanted to point that
was the fact that is the distributed
version control system things like this
is really easy well and then obviously i
think a core debut itself is kind of a
getting attraction so if that's what
you're thinking about doing this is
another great way to combine them all
but the same time i think there's a bit
of a problem in having the server setup
correctly the garrett is not in my mind
it will keep it up and it also wants the
the way we do things at least in code
review i guess the fact that the Garrity
being a cold debut tool makes it sweet
spot bit different from what we expected
in the addy pretest recommit to or
divided it Marge tool so we're am
playing Derek they expect you to have a
so let's say you worked on a branch of
the feature rent that has like three
changes so you made a 111 logical change
that split across three changes but
maybe because one is in the utility code
another is in the client side and the
third one is like a server side and so
if the if a single change consists of
those three commits the dare it wants to
review everything the one of them
separately because if you are doing code
review I guess that's what what makes
sense but when we are doing this for the
bar dated more feature we don't really
care if the tests are broken up with
some all these days I often you for you
to get from one good steak to another
good state you have to go through
something stable state so this isn't
unheard of to have this intermediate
state that doesn't pass the best but
again it wouldn't be happy about that
and so it wants the summer
the money or the override is failure and
the Marceline before all these
successive changes which are ashamed to
be dependent on this guy can go into it
so this notion of one commits and one
can you review it's kind of tricky if
you're especially thinking about things
like feature branch which does contain
almost by definition multiple changes so
that's bit painful at least in my mind
and also i guess my fading the demo
didn't is another a case in point that
when you're kind of working a grateful
system it could get to get into painful
stay so so i thought well you know this
is the it's great that you can do is
scary but i thought we should be able to
do this more easily just for the purpose
of validated much so i mean i created is
another I guess mode of operation where
you can just have been conducting at the
gate not Gary I study what thinking
styles as well in a developer just
change purse changes into this gate
people three and then the Jenkinses
notice the change in there and then pick
up the brand from the upstream do the
March run the test and then if the
result is good the pistol is also the
basically is doing the same water as
Gary class except using Garrett entirely
in Jenkins so for that see so let me
start another server that has a
different set of plugging here and then
let me switch the workspace
so misc so this I don't have any extra
plugins I guess aside from the git
plugin that is it should be very obvious
and but the tricks that I do here it's a
i specify 2043 because I no one is a
giggly posture that contains potentially
broken change the other being a mastery
43 that I guess the Teamcenter or
upholstery right and then I am Telling
Jenkins to do the march down here in the
Advanced Options so I'm telling Jenkins
to the model for the piazza I'm building
this gate master master Brent in the
gate before three more that is the
origin master branch in the origin
depository and then that's why I'm going
to do the build and then here is dr.
build process again this is whatever
thing you want to specify and eventually
I i use the skid publisher which so this
is the one that fishes changes the
upstream so i only want to change push
the changes to the upstream with the
build is successful and then i'm in
changing the result i'm fishing the
result of the March I Dudley that's the
state that it comes in your head and
that's it so i guess and combined with
the post commit and possibly she'd fix
so that i can do the build right as soon
as the new changes gets pushed so so
let's say here let me make some so i saw
the devil 50 from the upstream yes the
origin meaning the team before three and
then i'm going to really take the test
for that let's say make this hug and
then so here i think i think it a little
bit more obvious what i am doing this
that the I'm changing the oaks I guess
they get change pushing the change is
the gate and so this triggers a new job
and so that contains the change that I
just made meaning it's a hanging so
while this is hanging again I can go
back to 3d alice and here i can see that
a change that I made it's not yet be
affected I guess because which is the
point right but we don't want to have
other people see the changes that
haven't been tested yet and the artists
might be making changes as we go
actually this can create a marg conflict
so that's another change from Ali's
changed by always and then so notice
that being obvious isn't using a a very
dated Mars feature so if she is going to
push the change right away to the master
and that's fine right I think the
product yeah I guess I fail to mention
while I was talking about Garrett but
one of the another problem in Garrett is
that it wants the own in this central
repository because it wants to be the
gatekeeper that sees every incoming
commit to it but in most of the places I
think this is master diwali is
controlled idea corporate IP the thumbs
or the github or some places that
outside your control that you can easily
place and the fact that it needs to
replace the centroid upholstery makes it
difficult to install disc install this
family or use this practice on your
personal basis in other words you have
to convince the entire team to switch to
this model before you could gain the
benefit which i think is a bit harder
pipe whereas in this scheme that i'm
showing in currently with scary mr.
Jenkins without carried i can do this by
myself without telling anyone else no
one else needs to change the model they
they don't even need to know that I'm
sort of my changes are coming through
Jenkins so I think that makes it a lot
more easier to start deploying this
process with that fighting internally
between different games so what I wanted
to do is back
the coast k so I made a bad change that
didn't pass the test it Hank the build
and now I could fix that and I'll fix
fixed and notice I'm not amending
commits here so you know I did go
through this one incremented bad state
that didn't pass the test but as long as
I eventually get everything right like
in this case if you'll do another build
and did we already have one yeah okay it
already happened looks like if it was
too fast we show up in the UI and then
it did emerge and and then it crystal is
also if I go back the original master Oh
Oh
ok
yeah sorry so if I look at the entire
committee three i guess like the rate
exactly so I'm artist made that change
so this was the baseline before we
started for them I fought with the demo
and actually me yeah and then this is a
committee that is made while I was
struggling with this change and if this
is my original change I was broken and
then this was my second chance I got
everything right and then this was
demolished by Marvel Jenkins that that
that created the whole result i wish i
could show the show food made the commit
to it yeah this might be easier to see
if you did what yeah so the Jenkins we
did the March and it did so you know so
that you can see who did what in what
order so eventually I guess thinking
stars merge everything into the shape so
that things will back into the same
track but at the same time tourism
temporary variation to how this works so
yeah so again the seddie the reason i
like about this little better than the
garret setup is that you can do a lot
more be 13 you can do a lot more between
the build and fish so you know here i
only used one job but he on buying this
guy with things like beauty from ocean
plug-in you can have a lot of processing
going on between the between the time
the change comes into the point in which
it gets pushed so you can have a build
it can have deployed to somewhere and
then you can run some client-side test
and only after all these three jobs are
completed again habit change pushed back
to this server of example i mean they
have the changes push back to the center
of the Polish trees and then you can do
the exact same thing is the heater
grantees instead of having personal code
and changes testing one by one like that
you wanted to deploy it against the
future rent you just have to come up
with some name information to do it and
then again you can the other thing being
you can do this by yourself without
selling this idea the other people it's
always fine turkey and i think its
nature in jenkins that these things
start in bottom-up fashion right it
works better in that sense but the the
way this is set up today you need to
have one repository for the offer so
that's a guessing get here it's no more
to have lots of lots of lots of little
streets at slightly different but at the
same time if you are thinking about the
flowing is for everyone in your team
this kind of gets somewhat painful and
then likewise and i've used one job for
one level for which again for the same
reasons doesn't scale I mean away this
is a benefit because I was a reason why
I can do it without affecting other
people but if you like this so much that
you want be a team to convert to it it's
start to get a little bit painful so you
know there's a number of variations I
guess it's this is where I'm somewhat in
the nature kid but there's a number of
slightly different ways to achieve very
similar results so one of the flavors of
doing this is like instead of a
different Brantley I'm sorry differently
Paula stories to stage the changes you
can create branches to stage the changes
so
instead of having your changes pushed
escape people you just push the changes
to the masterly 43 accepting some known
brand is that supposed to contain these
half-baked changes so let's say you can
come up with naming conventions like the
personal / Coast game meaning whatever
my local like whatever changes that i am
personally working on or you can say
that feature / eve are indicating this
is a fluval feature and then you can
instruct that we can instruct thinking
that whatever Kenji's that show up in
these branches get automatically built
and tested in this scheme so that's what
i wanted to quickly show to complete
this part of the demo so so here it's
really the same thing but now i only
have one be 43 and then here i have this
brunch specifier this is where you the
magic that I said be anything that much
is this branch study personal / star so
anything personal / Coast case like
Alice and so on they get automatically
deal and again not your whites and then
in the advanced sections you should be
able to see that I'm always morning that
against the a master branch before the
build but we want to test the state
that's being built and then duty testing
is as usual it's just a test script
there and I'm gonna move this guy and in
the end I'm doing the same fish and then
is out I pushed it out tomorrow they'll
need to build a successful so that's
that's that so here let me switch the
so I'm like being the system back to
state is master and then then change is
this code and so well hello Jax and as
I'm making a beaut Vale implementing a
new feature and here I'm going to push
this my personal branch osmo goes gay
yeah so then this so yeah so this is a
bill that devoted from my change and it
failed because yes it contains my change
and it failed but the good thing about
this time is that even though our this
isn't perfected she can still see the
changes so if let's say like I did I
headed back home I'd seen that like I
pushed the changes you know which often
happens in the Friday evening i do you
feel like you're done with the change
safest thing is happening at home and of
course those changes are working but i
guess the worst the worst version of it
is like you know then I i did this
rectified travel to that says right on i
feel for a week university is broken but
now Alice so I did this from the other
sports pace but she can see that my seat
and see my changes it's just that the
United is not in the master I because so
my the ability file if they make
progress isn't isn't hindered but she
can she can feel like anything she can
even push the first additional changes
to fix stuff up into my brand and so
that allows people to collaborate among
failures and I think it's very
convenient for feature branches and say
but at the same time I think the obvious
is in her brand so I'm going to make yet
another progress more likely she has
some other busy things to do so change
by always
I'm going to push alice is going to push
the horizontal branch and then absolute
result seeing another test being run and
stuff successful and then I can come
back to me in the meantime let's say I
get the email from Jenkins telling that
the Butte was broken so i'm going to fix
it up by saying fix the build and then
and then i'm going to i'm going to push
the kaskus candy in it and then the
whole thing gets again tested and Mars
and then that Marge results we got on
all of you and so on so eventually if I
pull the changes all from the upstream
so here's yeah so what happened here he
said id I guess I this is the first
change i implemented and then in the
second i implemented a change another if
you commit as Ali's right and then that
got Morris by Jenkins and I worked on
the second coming back on top of this
fast failure at the fix this problem
which then got Morris into the whole
thing so you can see that it creates
this lattice structure there is a
slightly different but slightly
different people branches that the
people working on but as they think is
more than together you end up and of
consolidating into the single view so by
periodically making sure that your work
is where your work is synchronized with
the master you get the you get this
everyone gets to work on 10 G's and then
you can they can all delegate the test
execution to the server and then the
whole thing you never I mean the master
branch will never break so that's the I
think that's really what we wanted so so
that's that's that yeah so the again so
here we only we got away with just
having one repository so if someone is
interested in doing this setup once you
know everyone else in the team it
benefit without doing any exciting
on their site and also in HD eventually
consistent model that I think is really
useful it doesn't demand that you have
success in every single step as long as
they eventually make it work you're good
and in all three the system would make
sure that the rest of the people will be
productive from your harm and this only
use one one Jenkins show that the
address the downside is that you tend to
have more modest it's a bit more noisy
in that it was creating the people from
subversion background and so on they
don't want to necessarily see this large
number of Morecambe it's so that I
suppose is a potential downside but it's
also yeah I guess I'll leave it at that
but but I think there's a vent in my
mind benefits over weights over
overweight because the way so that was
about give in it in a way it's kind of
easy to do this is distributed version
control system but at the same time I
thinks to the majority of this world
seems divisions of ordinary actually how
many of you do any of you use of order
alright so this sounds like a lot more
advanced audience in which case I might
if the rest of the talk might not make
much sense to you anyway but I'm so yeah
so the subversion in most places I think
in the last survey I've seen it's more
like fifty percent of the devil parsley
using subversion and so endowed version
control system doing this kind of stuff
is a lot harder but so do so but I
eventually managed to write a plugin for
subversion that helps you with this
violated Marge it's called the Espionage
plugin that you can install from the
update Center so you know it's what it
does is it emulates the model that's
similar to this multi-branch model so
you know in this plugin what you're
supposed to do the subversion user is
the you know if you work on your changes
in a branch and then let Jenkins notice
that there is a change in the branch and
then it will automatically merge it with
the master and things like that so i
guess i'm sorry/not mastery for the
subversion we call it struck so in trunk
that the Jenkins
act as the only guy who makes the
commits into the truck and then it only
that's after its para dating the changes
so the only sort of kind of works
because the subversion also has been
improving indecent version so you know I
guess they just beat up so this red
allows that in the middle these are all
the changes the modest and then the
basis that the Jenkinses did this black
line legate commits that individual
Duvall falsely all right yeah it is a
Jenkins plugin called Experian marsh
buggy because the name is Victor because
originally they have there was a
different tool called espionage that
someone wrote in python that the sum of
these advanced the server the morning so
this code was originally written for
that and then in subversion 160 kind the
integrated of feature in the core so the
name remained but but anyway so that
this is the plugin that that's similar
thing Falls approach and with the recent
improvement in subversion like 16 and 17
this is becoming with more realistic and
so the only caveat here is that the
energy when you do the when you do this
Marge that is this Morris being a change
pushing the change-up from the branch
into the master I'm sorry the trunk
subversion also demands that you do the
base at the same time so you can have to
sync up the changes at the same time but
this is the only caveat you need to
gather up and everything else it can
zing kissed and this plug-in texture
it's basically just running Marge
commands in the in the right is the
right parameter it's so what I'm going
to show your ease let me switch to yet
another another instance that I have a
support
more so here I checked out the entire
three not just a track but the entire
truth in round workspace just so that we
can get away with one so here in case of
subversion what I did was I created this
job that looks at the master branch I'm
sorry the trunk I keep confusing a town
of all guys I'm sorry taking out my
Frank doing the bureau would run in a
test and so on and then that's it but
the only trick is that I have this
except integration from subversion feet
or at least check so this is the feature
that comes from this espionage branch so
let's say I wanted to now work on the
feet of randy so i can come in this
feature branch think and then i can
create a new branch so let's say branch
name will be say Jax our Luck's already
exists observe I don't know July and
inside you'll actually will create a
branch in the defaults trees so if I'd
adopts workspace update you see later
than you grunt created and then it also
creates a new job that manages this
workspace and manages this branch so
let's say I'm going to us in going
through this this plant yeah this is all
part of the suspend Mars plugin so i
guess the i find that i find it
conveniently do this kind of operation
on the forever because like I you know
when I was working on a large subversion
project I keep forgetting their like
update the workspace to the latest state
in the right branch to run the command
and then like I end up creating this
messed-up state if you notice that mean
the program in your lucky because
sometimes you they let you get through
it goes through and get away with it and
only much data you discover that you
didn't quite branch off from the right
place and they got this much hill and by
the time it happens today and so so I
think he's having a bottom little server
is makes it rather a foolproof
and so let me just make some line make
some change some edits another change or
something so all these I mean the stove
is already set up to do the right things
as i was making committed we will start
building everything and so that's what i
want it so that's so now you know I have
this my civi do for my personal brand
and change is being tracked and all that
and so now let's say I go to the state
that I'm ready to integrate and then so
what i can do is i can come to this
build that i want to integrate into the
upstream and then click this integrate
to the upstream button and another them
that it do other kind of the more than
commit then stuff and then so it will
get pushed up to this tree and so this
is not only that it provides this audit
trail so you know we drinking is notice
that they commit so this actor Marge
would create a new commitment up prank
right and so that trunk commit gets
picked up by the base job that's
building a trunk so it notice is that
the change that's pushed into the Frank
gets picked up by that build 99 of guy
and or if I go there it knows that this
change that marcellinus commit came from
the the add the my branch dog so it
creates this auditability trail that's
kind of handy and also if I wanted to in
case of heater branch the other or the
possible variety suppose the other
operation that makes sense is you know
all the other people making changes
today to the trunk so when the time
comes I want to be base to change from
the upstream meaning pick up all the
changes that's made in the upstream so I
can do that by coming to this project of
page and then click this VBS button and
here i guess this is another benefit of
using a CI server is that normally if
you're doing this one subversion client
you'll be doing it against you be
merging the tip problem tip of the trunk
but here because we know that which
cubism is actually built and tested so
this was trivial enough demo that like
the current tongue tip is already built
and tested and no interview okay but
sometimes people working on the coeds
you might the people that he force you
might happen to be not tested yet or
might fail the build so you could say
instead of just picking up the latest
version it can pick up the light last
known stable version or something and
then that will we can pick up the
changes from there as opposed to I just
random boredom in the master I'm sorry
in the trunk in this case it actually
noticed that because the last commit
that came in the master is from this
branch so there is nothing to rebase so
it actually didn't create coming but in
general that's what so now so doing
nearly base and integrating manually is
only son is only interesting is hot and
agree because the point of this is to do
that automatically and so here you could
say if it fits that now if this is the
feature run tests oppose this might be
actually what all you want because you
only you want to initiate this
integration process manually right but
if you are working on if you are
thinking about using this as a very
dated mode style what you want to do is
to automatically integrate and
automatically a rebase as necessary so
instead of doing it manually I can click
this integrate apps doing up on
successful yours and then in this way
every committed i create get that get
tested in if they are successful in
automatically triggers it automatically
to your say the more the operation so
let me delete is nearly created file
created file and then if so if i do the
fish i'm sorry if i did a committee go
Martha candies and then the change it
show up in the in the upstream I guess
brother yeah so this is the this is a
bill that tested my commit so in a pig
bastard addition to the file and then I
stand up the changes to the master
changes to the
Frank and so that went into the base
hundred and so on and so forth so if I
updated entire workspace you see that
they have the file the July on file in
the trunk is now removed because I March
that change once again so so I guess
that's the that's how this work for
subversion and mainly affected the fact
that he works for subordinate in my mind
is amazing enough and so I was very
happy with that and the United say it
comes with a number of composable
building blocks you can read this rebase
and integrate and then automation and
manual the execution and mix and match I
think is is really convenient so the
dine on the downside I admission that it
does create a lot more commit so the
March come Derby substantial number of
moles commits depending on how you use
it but I mean that in other words that's
that but only fifth I that's what giving
us the ability to you know to do this
automatic change propagations I suppose
that's just unnecessary price of it so
in kids that's what I mainly wanted to
talk I guess the first point that I
wanted to press wait this isn't free
tested commit meaning you don't want to
do the test before you you commit it
should be other way around that you
should be committing first and then let
that test it and then only after that it
kind of propagate that changeup bubble
bubble it up to the point at the other
team would see so that's how you want to
do it and then I think it's very easy to
do with distributed version control
system there's in fact I can no no less
than three ways that I showed you today
here that have the different
characteristics and so on but it's also
possible to do this in subversion and I
i believe recently someone in the
community came up is doing this for
clear case and the purpose also has a
similar functionality so you should be
able to do things like that so I think
you know I've I think the direction that
we are seeing is that the different
boards and control system needs to
tackle this problem in different way so
the communities working on implementing
those features stuff so these are all
available as open source projects are
going to see in those that you can go to
genki seattle or gander
the gate plug in Derek's trigger
plugging and subversion espionage plug
well thanks very much for showing up and
I did appreciate that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
