Tesla coil electric sight good I thought
maybe you might be here for the free
Wi-Fi so the idea of this this talk is
really to provide kind of a real-world
implementation of kind of an advanced
website and a lot of the the talks that
were attending today talk about very
deep dive technologies and this is
really just to talk about a project a
full life cycle in terms of how we
implemented it all the way from design
all the way through to fixing bugs and
just talk about what we learn through
that process the ultimate goal for us is
we learned a lot of things through this
process that now when we talk two new
clients about building these types of
experiences we actually have a lot more
knowledge to share and things that we
would do in terms of best practices to
when we approach complex builds like
this so hopefully you find that
interesting my partner in crime today is
Matt Bennett he's actually one of the
developers we have two other developers
that worked on the project here as well
we've got Warner wit and we've got Ben
Wigton and they're all the developers
that helped build this particular
experience so what we thought is at the
end of the talk if you've got specific
questions you can just come on up and
ask these guys questions and these are
all the guys that helped build it and
they've got the answers for you as well
so quick quick plug what is what is jebo
cibo is a digital agency here in San
Francisco we have about 40 employees we
do everything from branded experiences
to you at user experience design all the
way through to development we do both
desktop specific builds and as you can
see we've also done a lot of mobile
experiences both web optimized and
native applications for mobile devices
so these are some examples of things
that we've built recently and actually
almost all these guys that helped build
this also helped build these experiences
so very lucky to have this this talented
team here
with a company as a digital agency just
one thing I want to point out is that
we're we're pretty technology agnostic
we're here we're here just like you guys
are to learn about what's new what's
cool what we can use to help build
amazing experiences for for clients
moving forward we're technology agnostic
we've done big java projects we've done
big PHP projects used a bunch of CMS's
and know a lot of the challenges of
implementing these kind of interactive
experiences with with really deep inner
integrated and interactive you I so from
that perspective these guys have a lot
of those experiences as well so let's
talk a little bit about go electric so
the the experience that you're looking
at on the web is really a re-imagination
of an experience that was already built
as part of their studio so if you've
ever been down to palo alto or one of
their Tesla's studios you know they have
an extremely controlled environment
where they they make it immersive in
terms of how you get and understand how
a tesla car works and as part of that
they have this experience that is about
a 60 inch touchscreen that hangs on the
wall kogo electric I don't know if
you've ever checked it out but it's it's
an incredible design highly interactive
and it works extremely well on touch and
we actually we didn't develop that that
was developed by a company here in the
city called Eau de pod so they did the
original design and air application
development for that experience thats
hanging on the wall i don't know if any
of you work at o2 pod but it's an it's
an amazing job and really for us the
opportunity was for for tesla to now
take this kind of to a broader audience
of people so a couple of things if
somebody's standing in front of this
experience at the at the studio where
they sell the cars only one person's at
it nobody else we could participate the
other thing is they know that a lot of
people with ipads are interested in
taking a look at this as part of
just browsing their website so they
wanted to get it on an iPad get it on
the desktop they want to actually be
able to hand out iPads in the store to
augment via the story thats hanging on
the wall and then also have salespeople
walk people through this as well I'm
sure many of you heard about the recent
New York Times article about mileage of
an electric vehicle so there's a lot of
angst from people who are buying
electric vehicles about how far they can
go and there's there's primary five
questions you'll see when we get into
this there's five questions that most
people have about ownership of an
electric vehicle and that's really the
goal of this experiences to address
those and now for us to make it
available across a bunch of browsers and
the iPad having worked in the digital
agency world one of the most critical
things that we do at the beginning of
any project is to understand what the
compatibility is because we know that
any additional compatibility added to
this type of grid can mean significant
amount of work on our party in terms of
either retrofitting or bug fixing so we
actually as a best practice we highly
suggest you establish these kind of
criteria work with your clients to
understand exactly what kind of desktops
in fact one of the things that we do
recommend is either you ask for a report
from their Google Analytics or their
analytics platform or ask for access so
that you can validate what are the top
browsers and platforms so you know
exactly how to build a targeted
environment one interesting thing is we
didn't build this a lot of the the folks
at Tesla especially ones that work in
marketing come from an Apple pedigree so
they really don't care too much about
Android tablets but we did test this
after the fact and found that it did
work on the jellybeans jellybeans Chrome
browser for example on a Google Nexus 7
for example which is a very popular
tablet these days one one thing actually
to point out may not be aware but an
Android tablet is running a different
build of the browser
in a handheld device the handheld
devices are running which is called
android browser and the tablets run the
jelly be Chrome browser which is much
more akin to the desktop Chrome browser
so we were responsible for translating
that very landscape oriented 1080p
experience down to making it work within
a thousand pixels on the desktop and
obviously making it work on the iPad
Mini for example at 1024 x 768 so we had
to work very closely with our designers
to be able to take all those assets to
take some of the layout and to come up
with a way that we can tell this story
about how do you how far can you drive
an electric vehicle initially as part of
this we had come up with a story where
there were actually little leaflets that
were coming out from each of the
dashboards so that you could kind of
navigate in kind of a serpentine fashion
through the experience and this was
critical because we actually did we did
a quick little ping animation example of
it and showed it to a client on an iPad
and they decide it right away that
wasn't going to work for him that they
actually needed a very linear story that
was kind of touch swipeable so that was
really critical the other thing that was
really important was the proof of
concept I was actually really nervous
when we signed up to build this taking
advantage of all this there's a lot
inside each of these dashboards will
show one in a moment there's a lot of
knobs sliders calculations that are
happening we really weren't sure we
could make this into a kind of
responsive desktop application that
would really run pretty well on a
desktop browser so we this was around
the time when adobe edge enemy was
coming out so I decided that was a
really great tool to kind of do a quick
a quick test of using css3 transitions
to see what wheels would spinning along
the car would look like based on
also implementing sliders that the
calculations and showed updates and we
found out that actually performed pretty
well so we were pretty committed to
building out all these dashboards as
part of this single scrolling experience
the great thing for us as well we did
have the air application that was
running in the stores we were able to
get that running on our local
workstation so we set up our QA person
for example with QA so that basically
they could a be the air application
against what we were building now that's
great but actually what that also means
is that the expectation of what we built
it should actually behave a lot like a
native touch application running on a
desktop so we had a pretty high bar in
terms of how this thing should work the
other great thing is the client provided
some inspirational sites I don't know if
you're familiar with slavery footprint
if you're not you should check it out
it's actually a really immersive fun
site that deals with a very complex
topic that it's acting kit was built by
unit 9 here in the city there they did
an amazing job on that definitely check
that out and then there's another site
called smart power generation and the
things that came out of this is they
wanted things that made the that
differentiated the air experience on the
iPad for example they wanted things like
parallax so motion they wanted inter
activities when you interact with
different dials and sliders they wanted
fun things to show up and we'll show
some of those when we walk through the
the experience I'll actually did want to
point out we we did end up see if I get
out
so just to talk about where we ended up
we have obviously this main mast head
this is integrated with Tesla's CMS
platform but where we did end up is
basically where we have this intro slide
which sets up the question we've got an
animation slide so there's some funny
animation and then we have what we are
calling the dashboards so whenever we
refer to a dashboard we're talking about
these interactive these interactive
pages so you'll see that there's some
fun things that happen the biggest one
was when you switch oh here's a little I
don't know if you guys noticed but when
you click on this too you'll see the
windows go up and down so there's a lot
of little fun things that happen it's
part of the experience so now we're
going to go back and just talk a little
bit about how we approach building this
so there's really no pre-built framework
for us to build something like this in
so we needed to basically start from
scratch Matt was actually instrumental
in coming up with some of the framework
that we use we started with an html5
boilerplate and we use aunt for building
the experience as part of that
boilerplate you get moderniser to which
for us we tended to use for feature
detection specific to the touch devices
so for us we knew that we needed to be
able to transition the experience from a
desktop experience that has a lot of
knobs and sliders over to something
that's touch-enabled like an ipad all
the dashboard views are built on
actually the framework in general is all
built on backbone j/s which at the time
I know the 10 recently came out so we
built this last year so this is on 9 as
basically each of the views are built
individually and then they're all pulled
together as a single router
there's custom events and key value
binding that's implemented to pull all
those models together I'll let Matt talk
a little bit about that but one thing we
needed to do because of the timeline for
the project was allow multiple
developers to work on the project at one
time and we knew that basically dealing
with code checking collision was going
to become a problem so each of the
dashboards are separated into a separate
backbone view so that would allow
actually each developer to work and
check in that single standalone view and
have it render and even have it render
as a separate page so even our QA person
could do a pre QA or help them with unit
testing across all the different
different browsers and devices I don't
know if you have anything you want to
add to this sure so with html5
boilerplate and aunt we were primarily
using it to minifying concatenate or
javascript and cascading style sheets
and kind of pulled together the meat of
the page and bundle it into a test
environment that we could deploy on our
test QA site and then also that we could
change a few local properties to build a
fully functional production site like
Doug said using moderniser 24 primarily
touch enabled devices so that we could
you know make differentiations between
the desktop and some of the interactions
you get with mouse versus the iPad and a
lot of the touch swipe touch start touch
end touch move and how they relate to
things like our sliders and our switch
back to the dashboard
sure so using the different rate inputs
like the sliders the radial input here
that allows you to adjust speed some of
the touch enabled this is desktop here
of course on the on the laptop but being
able to use these touch-enabled sort of
like picker views for selecting the
temperature outside as well as what
model of a vehicle your you're
interested in driving and all of these
selections adjust how far you can go
with a certain battery that's installed
in the car well switch back yeah so we
use a lot of backbones built in model
structure for custom events and key
value binding for when selections are
made with the different widgets and like
doug said we were able to split up the
development into separate panels each
panel having its own backbone view for
custom interactions that three of us
could kind of develop in our own silos
checking code and let the automatic task
build the site for us when we were
submitting updates actually another
thing to point out that I just thought
of as well we were very fortunate
working with Tesla Tesla's all about
innovation obviously an innovative
company we were we were allowed to pick
and choose with technology we used when
we built this they wrote in set any
guidelines for us so one very fortunate
thing is we had experience based on
using backbone in previous projects they
didn't force any particular technology
on us we do have other clients that have
very specific based on things that they
have implemented in or CMS so one of the
things to think about when we did
approach this was making sure that we
could reuse technology that we had
already been up to speed on and did have
some investment of some of the framework
stuff that was already done and in some
sense that the back from backbone
framework that we're talking about
that we use for this was actually
implemented for another project in some
sense and tested so we were very
confident that we were able to use that
it wasn't kind of all net new from that
perspective so the dashboards themselves
use a pretty big range of third-party
third-party add-ons for jQuery we use
tween Jas there's jQuery mouse wheel we
also use for all the different sliders
and controls there's third party
controls that we use for that we also
there is a as part of the air
application there was already a
calculation engine that was already
built to do the calculations for I've
made an adjustment on a parameter and
how does that actually show up in terms
of how it affects overall mileage so we
leverage some of the existing code and
just translated that to kind of a web
world one of the interesting things that
we found out was actually all those
values that were used for the
calculations were in CSV format in the
air app and we know that's probably not
optimal for the web so actually then
ended up writing some some code in order
to get it into a JSON format to get it
over into the web app and one of the
most important things is we we were able
to use Typekit web font so having a web
phone available reduce significantly
some of the development time around
having to produce the customer specific
font did we use proxima nova actually in
fact for this experience so that we
didn't have to produce all the
individual image assets and do all the
the animations against all those we
could actually just use the web font and
update web font properties in order for
display I don't know if you want to talk
about about some of the other details
around the dashboards yes so that the
dashboard is themselves are primarily
the meat of the site I mean users are
going to the dashboards to figure out in
this case how far I can go on or I'm
sorry what's my range on a battery
on the highway based on my driving
conditions whether or not I Drive you
know 65 miles an hour in the winter
whether it's it's nighttime out with the
windows down which would be pretty cold
with my 21-inch wheels so that all
affects how the how far the car can go
with the three battery types and like
doug said before all this data and the
air app was stored as a csv file for one
per sort of scenario so this would be
one csv file where would be nighttime
21-inch wheels windows down 50 degree 32
degrees 65 miles an hour on the highway
we had to take all those csv files and
Ben wrote a really nice ant task so that
when the he could run this implant ask
it would take all of the CSV files
compile all the data into a JSON format
that we could load once in the site and
rapidly look up exactly the the ranges
that we need for for these specific
scenarios
so one of the key things as you might
have noticed when I was scrolling in the
the site is there's there's a line that
goes through the experience you'll
notice that the line gets painted red
you'll see that certain things that get
activated based on position on the
screen you'll see a hamburger Getty and
you'll see a bird kick up some comment
so there's a lot of things that that are
interactive in terms of the animations
based on position so we put a lot of
thought into that and we ended up coming
up with basically a customized scroll
tracking system in order to activate all
those things based on position in the
application itself so the this is
actually not done through canvas or
WebGL this is all done through dom and
while that was we'll find out in lessons
learned where that was a good thing for
us in terms of leveraging some of the
skills that we already had just overall
Dom complexity ended up becoming part of
the of an issue so that's how that's all
actually implemented the one thing
you'll notice is the vertical line was
pretty easy in terms of the way the
manipulation is done through the DOM and
showing and hiding basically what's
happening through imagery and placing of
a div but you'll notice that there's on
the horizontal lines they either go left
to right or right to left and there had
to be two separate images and divs that
handled either left to right or right to
left changing of the color so that was
some custom code that had to be written
in order to handle that show high
display specific to the way it was
tracking so that was something that we
actually hadn't planned on there's also
sprite animations that we used I don't
know if you want to talk a little bit
about how those were implemented sure
let's switch back
I lose my resolution no so we have some
sprite animations here that are we used
we implemented with sprightly jas which
is a just a sprite sheet animation
JavaScript library and it allows us to
create the the left-to-right scrolling
background the road lines and the wheels
spinning a lot of these sprite sheets
particularly the wheels were created
with adobe flash cs6 exported from the
library as a sprite sheet a movie clip
exported as a sprite sheet animation
optimized for web and then imported and
controlled with or loaded just as a ping
and then control with the sprightly
library spritely also allowed us to
create this left to right motion with
the different the lines and the
backgrounds as they change when you are
switching say from you turn that off
from highway to city you get a different
city scape that comes up and allowed us
to create that effect so it's pretty
good library for us in this instance
as I mentioned the calculation formulas
were provided to us by the client in air
app there's some very specific business
things that are happening there nothing
that we really added to that just
translating that to something that
integrated with the the type kit web
font that's implemented on the site as
we mentioned we did have structured CSV
then use rhino plus the ant build to
convert those to JSON objects and those
are for the the mpg in total car range
we've used Rhino been specifically has
use Rhino as well for other projects for
kind of these transformations of content
if you want to get a little more detail
on that you can speak to them about it
we also mentioned that we use a lot of
3rd party plugins these make me nervous
when I ever I work on a project and we
use them we know that we've got a little
bit of time but we can't build out all
this stuff from scratch so we pick and
choose what we pull down from the web
and interestingly enough for like tiny
circle slider jquery range slider and
sprightly we did have to dig in and fix
some very specific browser compatibility
issues as needed so if you are building
something like this and you're using
third-party plugins you have to be
willing to dig into some of these these
third-party plugins and also the other
thing to note and we've worked with
other clients they don't really accept
the licensing for some of these so you
also just have to be prepared if you are
using to be understand how these things
are licensed open source or what they
use and that the clients comfortable
with that as well we've mentioned we
relied heavily on using a web font if
you guys have ever used the web font
make sure whatever web font you're using
you test across all the range of
browsers that you have in your
compatibility matrix they will render
different they will render differently
on every different browser because the
rendering engines are different
especially older versions of ie it's
going to look great on the latest
version of Chrome it's not going to look
as good on an old version of IE so
definitely do that test the beginning of
the project
the other thing is we we did as I think
Matt mentioned earlier we did have to
address handling of events differently
for a mouse on a desktop versus touch
interaction so there was a lot of code
that was written using modernizer to
handle those events differently on a
desktop so basically there was two two
sets of code that had to be built one
for desktop and one for touch because
this thing I mean ultimately they said
that the primary experience had to work
on an iPad first than desktop second we
were talking about I'm sure a lot of you
have to deal with Internet Explorer
workarounds you know do we have to say
anymore it's a pain in the butt but it's
just the nature of our business we have
to fix these issues I don't know how you
guys estimate how much time you spend
fixing IE bugs we definitely see across
all of our projects somewhere between 25
to 30 percent of our time it's just
fixing IE bugs and this particular
project it was probably a little bit
higher given the level of interactivity
but we did have to support all the way
back to ie8 and specifically some for
some of those ping animations that you
saw like the burger getting eaten or the
sun and the moon rotating there were
animation transparency issues that
needed to be addressed specifically for
IE classic IE issues our content layout
issues due to CSS differences you have
to be aware and be prepared to to
address those as well and the other
thing we did see is there is a lot of
JavaScript for this obviously with the
backbone framework and we do see if you
do happen to load this on IE it is going
to take a lot longer to load regardless
of your internet speed simply because of
Java Java JavaScript performance so you
have to be prepared for experiences that
use a lot of JavaScript that load on
older browsers there were some talks
earlier from sencha especially those
guys seem to have some some pretty
interesting techniques that you might be
able to use around progressive and
composite loading that if we have more
time we
we could have figured something out but
we ran out of time in terms of our
development effort performance
optimization there really wasn't a lot
for us to do we did try to crush if you
one of the talks earlier today probably
one of the largest things that you have
on your page contributing to page weight
is imagery the tesla wanted very high
quality imagery in their site we spent a
lot of time going back and forth about
what's the what's the maximum amount
that we could compress and remove some
of the artifacts from imagery before we
started seeing some pixelization so we
ended up siding on oversizing images
rather than quality that's obviously
something you need to work through with
your clients we did minify the
javascript is part of the deliverable to
the client but as part of this you're
going to find that we did have to spend
a lot of time working with our client to
set this is a large site a lot of
imagery a lot of JavaScript it's going
to take a take a while to load it's not
going to be sub two second three second
even for a second for the most part so
you have to work with your clients we
did to set expectations the one thing
that would have helped from our case we
did some testing is if we were able to
load a lot of these artifacts imagery
JavaScript up into a CDN the client at
this in this case didn't have a CDN
available but that would have helped so
definitely factor that in when you're
doing these large single page
experiences determine whether you have a
CDN available up front and figure out
how you can get that integrated
potentially with like your aunt build
scripts so you're pushing it out Doug
top talked a lot about the ie8
experience and one of the things we
found that we were able to do you switch
the oops switch this back
just go ya know what that one
pardon me was getting the the animations
to run smoothly on ie8 and there was
some sacrifice there but what we were
able to do with our our animation engine
in some places was use the
requestanimationframe loop to pause the
sum of the animations that like in the
dashboards as you can see when I'm
scrolling here we have a pause state
that allows us to make a little bit
smoother scrolling particularly on older
pcs that are still running windows XP
and an i8 also here with some of these
frame by frame paying sequences when
we're scrolling through the experience
we had to make sure these r optimized
for the IE for the iea platform as well
some of the sliders not not so much of a
big deal updating these these values but
like doug said final performance on some
on some platforms required us to use use
less transparency animations and more
just hide and show kind of a graceful
degradation of the site to make it still
usable on those platforms we talked
about the images and here you know
tesla's really big on these high quality
pings you know in a in a parallax
environment we have separate paying
transparent pings and to get them to
move in at separate speeds while we're
scrolling and we were able to use some
some ping optimization techniques that
come with the html5 boilerplate ant
tasks that helped crush these down get
them as small as they could be so that
when the page loads you're not you're
not waiting around forever again with
some of the pink sequences here as we're
scrolling through the execs the site all
optimized for for ie8 and machines that
run that environment
come on
so let's talk a little bit about some of
the lessons that we learned developing
this one thing that we we did learn was
obviously we were taking a landscape
oriented 1080p experience and trying to
get to work and look like a native
application on an iPad we had to spend a
lot of time with our designers luckily
we had a really great designer on this
project who worked through some of the
the orientation aspects of the design
landscape versus portrait and in this
case we ended up using viewport scaling
to accomplish the goal along with some
some minor some minor adjustments made
in the layout for us we had a well
written reference code base that
streamlined development unfortunately
many times you won't have that available
but if it is available don't shun it
because it's somebody else's code adopt
it take a look at what they do and see
if you can learn something from it with
it really did help us we had you know
fixed budget and a fixed timeline in
order to live to deliver this experience
one of the things that might not have
been mentioned was the scrolling
animations that you see in the
experience are timed baits very
specifically based on position and
height in the experience we didn't
really know going into this that we
would be doing a lot of relay out of
some of the pages based on copy changing
and what that meant was is we had to go
back and very specifically change x and
y coordinates or of animations happening
in the page because they were all
hard-coded based on changes in some of
the different pages that we had or the
modules that we had in the site we might
have done it differently but we didn't
really expect to have such iterative
review of the site and copy up chain
updates and imagery updates so if you do
have something in terms of layouts just
make sure you understand that pretty
much everything is subject to change
especially around the layout clients
expectations with interactions
very high we see how we actually have in
some of the sessions this morning we
have developers who are trying to hit 60
frames per second if you saw the
facebook application that century built
they were hitting 60 frames per second
and some of their scrolling we weren't
able to hit that with ours they spent a
lot of time developing some stuff but
you need to pay attention to that do a
POC / do a proof of concept put
something in front of the client early
we did for every one of these dashboards
while that when they were done and built
we put them in find the client as a
standalone little page that we could get
feedback early and often we had a lot of
issues with ipad on the interactions for
touch that we had to deal with and at
the end of the day all the interactions
that you see on the desktop so the red
mine in a meeting some of the in page
animations for that interactive slide we
ended up having to ditch that and that
was because just the overall dom dom
size was becoming a problem on the ipad
so scrolling was becoming very choppy
because it was under 15 frames per
second we were dropping frames while you
were scrolling on the ipad and the
client just couldn't live with it so we
ended up having to rework and come up
with a workaround in terms of the way we
did the layout on the ipad if we have
more time i think we could have solved
it but we really just didn't have time
on the project to do that in the end
they were happy with the iPad
implementation it's actually simpler and
cleaner anyway so that's when we ended
up developing some additional HTML
specific for the iPad I don't forget
anything you want to sure one of the
main takeaways that at least that I took
away from the project was the proof of
concept was really important to
transition ideas from the design
department and the technology department
in and showing what could be possible on
certain devices desktop and tablet and
also you know our original scroll
animation method using the win when the
scroll event
in the browser was not really usable on
the iPad because mobile safari pretty
much freezes all processes running when
someone uses a finger to touch and slide
up and down and the browser page so any
set interval you might have running or
any set timeout or any loop that's
running Safari will just freeze it until
the page has finished scrolling and
eased in this place so we came up with a
solution to work around that in the end
on some ipads like first-generation ipad
it really wasn't very optimal because of
it just couldn't it can the tablet
itself couldn't support it and like doug
said was kind of choppy so we ended even
though it looked good on ipad 2 and 3
the first generation ipad just didn't
cut it so like he said you know we have
a still have a usable ipad experience
that has all of the sliders range input
radial sliders touch interactive in the
main dashboards that allow you to
calculate how far you can go how many
stops you'll have to make on a road trip
etc
a couple of other quick lessons that we
learned there's a one area in the
experience where we show mapping along
with how those states come up with their
their electricity and we initially
developed it as highcharts I don't know
if you're familiar with highcharts will
show an example we tend that we have
used this for quite a few projects on
this dashboard here so you notice on the
right that animation for the the bar
chart we originally developed this the
pie chart in high charts as well you'll
notice how the lines are articulated off
the pie chart the layout specific to the
the copy in each of these we originally
developed these with a lot of time in
high charts and we could not get it
pixel perfect and the client couldn't
live with it so we lost about three work
three weeks of demo or dev effort but
and we replaced it with all static
images now we were able to get high
chart to work for this bar chart but not
for the pie chart it just we couldn't
accomplish everything that we needed in
terms of that layout highcharts is
actually very effective for a
cross-browser you it even has fallback
technology for older IE browsers and
we've worked with a lot of clients that
it works well but unless you really want
to dig into its innards you don't want
to commit to pixel perfect layout when
it comes to high charts
hmm
hello
the other thing that was really
important for this is all the developers
on this project I was pretty lucky he
actually came originally from a flash
background you might ask why that's
important they actually understand they
all had come from a development
environment where they did timeline
based development it included
interaction animation and this obviously
was a highly interactive experience so
we didn't have to go back and forth
significantly with the designers they
could use the experience that they had
coming from a flash interactive
development environment if you are
working with or scoping out projects
like this factor in the background and
the experience of the developers that
you have building this this was huge for
us and obviously create enough time in
the schedule to deal with iee issues
that was probably our last our last
throes of getting this across the finish
line where are lots of little issues
that we're dealing with for layout with
IE one other important detail about the
flash development was that are our
benchmark was the air application so it
was extremely valuable to have three
developers that had flash background new
actionscript-3 and how an application
was built beginning to end so that we
could look into the source code and
figure out how a range for the 85
kilowatt battery is calculated when
you're driving 45 miles an hour on the
freeway when it's 50 degrees out we were
able to look into all the packages and
classes rather quickly and efficiently
break down what what the original
applicant the original application was
supposed to be doing and then translated
to JavaScript and in the backbone views
all right so the last question is how
long did it take we had three developers
dedicated to this project on and off for
more than actually five months but it
was about a five man month effort in
terms of just your effort not to raishin
it actually took longer in terms of some
of the client reviews that we did so we
started around May and this launched in
around December timeframe
remember it was mid December we would
estimate about twenty percent we were
off in terms of our original estimates
so we were dealing with a fixed price
project and with a pretty accelerated
timeline so we really weren't good at
estimating so we learned a lot from this
in terms of estimating around the
complexity we also spent a lot of time
dealing with layout adjustments due to
the redesign of the user experience
initially so we did some rework at the
beginning we talked about the parallax
issues and some of the scrolling issues
on the iPad we didn't accommodate for
that that contributed to some of the
twenty percent that we were over in
terms of effort we dealt with
integration issues so this is basically
one big page that has plopped into a
very open template on their CMS we dealt
with some integration issues getting
that integrated with their CMS
especially with their standardized
header and footer so if you're
integrating with your clients or
implementing in your own CMS make sure
you accommodate for that we talked about
highcharts we talked about ie bugs how
they're interesting thing is we have the
I get this working on the Tesla in car
17-inch browser and that's a custom
webkit browser and we found out it
doesn't moderniser doesn't detect its
touch events so we had to do some custom
fixes for that and testing testing
testing for something that's this many
browsers this many devices plan for
upwards of twenty thirty percent total
development effort put aside for
basically QA we had a full-time QA on
this for many many weeks and I think we
look through this about 128 or 158 bugs
were open and we estimate like we said
about thirty percent of those were ie
bugs but the rest were all layout issues
so stark you a early do it very often if
you can that's it for us hopefully you
learned something in terms of an
approach that you would use to to build
out a complicated very
interactive experience based on are some
of our pain if you have any questions
these guys are going to be hanging out
after the session come on up and feel
free to ask thanks for coming
