associated myself with type-safe for a
few months ago well when I kind of got
there they I don't think they had a plan
beyond can we get dick to do something
for us so I sort of made it up as I went
along and started looking for stuff to
do and how many people here have
contributed to scarlet in some way don't
be shy ok I see if you have well those
guys was the experience really good put
your hands up with the experience is
really good ok significantly less hands
yeah we're aware of that ok so what's up
pretty much everything in the community
contributions side of things hasn't been
a target for a long time it's the nature
of software development and our people
who are very busy doing self development
the stuff like this tends to fall
through the gaps unless you actually put
somebody in charge of keeping an eye on
it so what I've been doing is figuring
out what needs fixing and the things
that need fixing our documentation
contributions bug fixing the tools which
is something that's actually never been
a focus I don't think there's at and I
present a whole lot of documentation on
how you get involved with contributing
to say SBT are the Eclipse plugins other
tools in the space core libraries really
haven't changed since 2.8 in scala and
then of course the big one the the
compiler features which you know
famously last year actually within about
a month of me joining a type level came
out and said damn it we're tired we're
walking and I've said this to Myles many
times since that day made my job so much
easier you wouldn't believe it suddenly
this thing became like a priority across
the board so anyway this is the rough
ordering of things why did I choose this
order in particularly you'll notice
compiler features is right at the bottom
if this time I'll talk about why that's
at the bottom it's for a good reason
okay so starting with documentation
why did I start with that it's the best
story right now the documentation
documentation is actually pretty
complete most of my job was just gap
closing and you know getting into the
into the situation the other thing was I
needed to update the documents for the
rest of this thing it's all very meta I
think I stepped about three levels back
in documentation terms I kept moving
backwards away from the goal but of yak
shaving but I needed to update the docks
which needed meant I needed to
understand all levels of the
documentation process and this is the
big one within about two weeks of
starting this I thought I'm never going
to finish this job if it's just me I
need to get other people involved so
giving the documentation documentation
sorted out is the first step to asking
and begging everybody here and everybody
in the schuyler community to come and
help me please okay so what's changed
there's been a slight reorg documents
documentation didn't need too much done
to it like I said it was more gap
closing than anything else but there is
still more to do everybody's aware that
the documentation has sort of come about
a coalesced over time there's
duplications there's parts that don't
flow well it's it's a big job to reorg
it so basically what I concentrated I'm
very much my philosophy is fixed squeaky
wheels anything that I could actually
understand whether it was actually
correct or not whether it you know
mostly correct as long as I could get
something done I left it alone for now
what I was looking for was the great big
gaping chasms in things so there's
plenty left to do oh I'm not quite sure
what I did there okay so is it done no
no it's a long way from done this is
more like a first draft but I do
actually have something as of two days
ago the pull requests finally went in
for documentation documentation and
things are starting to really move this
will never be done okay this whole thing
this whole effort as long
scholars a community as long as scholars
going this stuff's going to change we're
going to need people to do this okay so
here's my pledge arrived by the way the
images are sort of it was meant to be a
propaganda kind of thing so there's a
lot of them you'll see previously
there's a lot of propaganda stuff like
this one oh that sort of thing for some
reason when i put pledge drive in a
picture of the first five doctors and k9
came up and i just thought what the hell
i'm going to use that so here's my
npr-style pledge drive okay do you want
to help us okay we can offer bounteous
rewards good there's plenty to do call
us the day and help us meet our target
okay how can you help I hear you cry in
fact some of you I can see I'm vibrating
in your seats from excitement on how you
can help okay there's a lot more
documentation work to do you remember
that list of five things the documents
the bug fixes core libraries tools
compiler the rest of that stuff the
documentation still needs work the rest
of it needs the same process that I've
just done in it and I'm not going to be
able to do this alone other countries so
the other contribution processes that
we're talking about here's another one
and this is going to be an ink this is
for the real heroes and by heroes I mean
people who see a grenade that had the
pin pulled out and throw themselves on
it to save others okay pretty much
everybody agrees that they want to get
out of jareth and enter github pretty
much nobody wants to do that work for
excellent excellent reasons if you are a
masochist then please come and see me
because we have a job for you uh-huh
this is going to be a big one like I say
everybody wants to want to do this
Adrian Mars has actually done a
surprising amount of the kind of
footwork the beginning work but there's
a lot more to do and this is a really
really bad job but does anybody here I
mean as a contributor has anybody been
put off by the fact that stuff
injera right now yeah okay see this is
this is the kind of thing I'm looking
for there's value here there's a lot of
work and there's a lot of thankless work
to be doing but there's value there okay
the logistics there's a lot left to do
it was sort of a rush to make this I
liked I liked having a nice Carla
because it let me impose a deadline on
getting something done the logistics
we've been back and forth on this and
any and all of this information could
change we debated having a separate
google group set up for coordinating
this contribution effort in the end we
decided scholar internals is it scanner
internals has typically been compiler
and language level discussions we're
going to start moving all contribute to
stuff in there until it doesn't work it
will probably work we don't know if it
starts to swamp the other messages will
revisit that decision but for now
Scarlett internals group has is the way
we're going to do it we're going to
start using labels to help us kind of
pick out what's what so we're going to
have just when you create the topics put
square brackets Docs or issue or tools
libs that sort of thing to help us kind
of organize it I'm going to put a sticky
up I meant to do it before I got here
run out of time but by Monday hopefully
there will be a sticky that sort of
explains a bit more about this on
scholar internals another huge one this
is where I turn into a real Butthead
because not only am i begging you guys
but I'm also naming terms beggars can't
be choosers apparently there's going to
be a lot of reading before you can
actually start writing anything okay
depending on the level of involvement
that you want to get in I hope you do
want to get involved there's a lot to
read i discovered this a lot of my time
has actually not been making these
changes but understanding the process
and has a ton to read I've been trying
to organize it so it's a little bit more
streamlined much of this and we'll talk
about what you kind of need to read and
where you can find that stuff in a
second much of this is also still being
sorted out and will continue to be early
you know ur leary contributors will help
define the process as much as anything
else and help us figure out what's
working what isn't it's like it's a very
meta process you try and do it you
figure out what's not working you
discuss what's not working and you try
and figure out a better way to do it
which then gets documented and becomes
part of the process okay so there's a
lot of kind of shake out that needs to
be done okay so here's some of the ways
you can evolve this is the absolute
simplest we are after discussion I went
back and forth because activator is a
type-safe thing and I wasn't sure how
comfortable the Scala team would be
pushing activator but I will tell you
right now it's an excellent little tool
for quick and easy code examples with
some documentation attached and if you
just want to get involved at some level
and you don't want it to be you know too
painful an activator template really is
the best way you can do it you can
pretty much develop it by yourself the
the engagement the the catch-22 whatever
of it is very low because you can write
it you can test it you can stick it out
and github and you can add it to the
list of activator templates if you just
want to demonstrate some concept or
something and get it out that quick this
is a way to go i right quite a few of
these when I just want to demonstrate a
concept so it's the lowest barrier to
entry is perfect for coding examples
another nice advantage of it the code is
runnable so you can actually test that
it's working something that I'd like to
eventually get to in Scala doc it's
making sure the code actually works
that's list all that's shown in Scala
back and there's a link there that you
can follow right another nice little
task if anybody wants to volunteer for
it something been been on my to-do list
forever is activated users a sort of
weird HTML kind of template would be
really nice to get that in markdown not
sure quite what kind of level of job
that would be but it's a great starter
project if somebody wants to get into it
okay Scala dock as another one believe
it or not scale the dock wasn't well
documented in the thing much of my work
has been documenting the process of
contributing to scala dock and there's
new documents that went out yesterday
about that one of the big ones is
helping us to find the missing
documentation
again I'm running out of time I'll get
to the pages in a second spell checking
okay um this is where again I start to
raise the barrier we are going to bat
things out as you start contributing
things like scarlet luck and scholar
lang there will be refusal there will be
cycles of going through and getting
things rejected and needing to patch
them um running a spell checker grammar
checking checking your code is going to
save you a lot of those cycles because
you know basically what we're trying to
do is get this process streamlined get
this stuff in here quickly there's
documentation on it okay next one up is
doc scholar lang dog which is the guides
overviews tutorials that sort of thing
now for this one the barrier does go
quite a bit up we expect some revisions
one of the things is that it has to fit
in oh dear I I stuck my slide layout a
little bit if you don't want to get
involved in probably multiple comments
and revisions cycles on poll requests
you can just opt for the wiki one of the
things I've started doing is reading the
wiki for material and bringing it across
the dock starts galilei the org and one
of the things here you should you know
this all of these links are what you
should read this is particularly
poignant it has to fit into the
repository if you're going to start
contributing to that scholar Lang itself
this is where we're going to document
the process for the rest of the
contributions only those with a very
high pain threshold need apply for this
job okay this is going to be a lot of
work to get this through it's the main
site people land up what can I offer you
zero pay the boss is a jerk you know all
these things are it hit you know
dedicated people basically okay so
what's in it for you well like I said
when I'm going to pay you anything let's
see there's a lot of work you'll
probably get a lot of rejections that
there is some good stuff to it one of
the things I
from doing my master's thesis I had a
real stickler as my professor for that
he actually taught me to use language
correctly it's one of the little
benefits that you get when you do this
sort of thing if you think programming
is hard try interfacing with people
sometimes compilers are simple compared
with people okay so if you really want
to level up this is the way to do it
we're also going to gamify it because
people like that so one of the things
we're bringing back we're going to bring
back the leaderboard we're going to
feature that prominently for
contributors we're also going to have
stickers stickers are awesome they cost
almost nothing and everybody wants them
so we're going to have we were trying to
get the stickers design in time for this
unfortunately we didn't it's still going
through but there is a secure design
coming they'll be at yet to be decided
levels bronze silver and gold I'm
pushing for by the time you get to a
platinum you get some kind of hoodie
with like your github handle on it and
some you know serious bragging rights
and that sort of thing so okay so much
owed by so many so if you are of course
you know these people and many more in
the contributors have already done a ton
of this work my job was would have been
way harder if I'd have had to actually
write everything most of it was really
that streamlining it that sort of thing
your name could be up here okay plus you
can get a sticker and that's pretty much
it so I've got 11 seconds for questions
that's really not going to work is it
but I think it's lunchtime now I'd love
to have a chat with you guys about this
and please if you are interested get on
scholar lang on Monday probably because
I need to get that sticking up and I
need to let the guys know that this is
coming and join us thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
