developers of Django and I'm going to
talk a little bit about the the future
of Django today and where we're headed
so the most recent thing that happened
in the sort of the history of Django is
a 1.3 was released on a march twenty
third and it was a pretty awesome at a
ton of new features so one of the
biggest ones was a class-based used and
class-based generic views which is sort
of a framework but a style for how you
should write views a set of base classes
and just a general cleanup of the sort
of the old generic views which were
difficult to extend not flexible and
didn't really implement a pattern that
was nice for other people to implement
so like if you wanted to distribute your
own reusable application it sucked right
generic views in the old style but now
you've got tons of base classes nixon's
and whatnot it's a really good pattern
i'm going to show off some of the
benefits of it as we go through this so
those are one of the major new features
next one was Django finally got logging
proper way to configure logging work
with the standard lives logging module
logging of a few things within Django
which tangentially gave you better
functionality like you could control
what happened on a 500 page without
overriding the entire view because now
it's just a logging handler and that was
pretty awesome Django contribs static
files was added somebody talked about
this last week and how it makes static
files much more awesome to deal with and
deploy and that was cool and there's an
external app if you're still not running
13 which you totally should because it's
pretty awesome we added a unit test 22
Django so makes testing more awesome and
in addition there are a bunch of cool
test helpers that were added to a Django
like a certain employees and there's
some other stuff too who's pretty
awesome
and uh just tons of other just general
bug fixes minor features new things and
just general awesomeness like tons and
tons of stuff added Django like I
couldn't fit them all in these slides
easily so other question is that's what
we've come from where we headed so the
obvious thing is next we're going to do
14 and I'm going to talk about what uh
what features have already landed in 14
what what's planned for 14 insofar as
anything is planned and then sort of
some pie-in-the-sky stuff for the the
real future of Django I love them beyond
anything we can predict today and please
like kick our asses we have not
announced a release schedule for this
and that sucks it's been like several
months since the last release and so you
guys should be like yelling at us what
is the schedule one of the alphas one of
the betas we had like an internal
schedule we were planning and we've now
like passed both the Alpha and the beta
dates so you guys should kick our asses
because it sucks and so uh when the
major things is we're going to be
dropping Python 24 so you need Python 25
and up and I think it goes like well
like seven from seven years ago finally
like dropped security so now we can
finally drop 24 and Django and means
we're sticking context managers
everywhere because they're pretty much
the most awesome thing and to come out
of a Python 25 so asserts form helpers
just anything you can think of that
could possibly use a context manager
Sprint's going to be there it's gonna be
awesome next thing that's all language
is model objects select for update so
some databases let you when you select a
row market internally within the
database that you're going to be
updating it which puts some sort of a
rock lock on the row within the
transaction and so that's now exposed to
you which is useful if you need it
probably a lot of people don't need it
but when you do you kind of do need it
and suck theft right like raw sequel for
this before so that's there we're now
shipping all the templates that are
shipped with Django or now html5 I'm a
developer I don't know anything about
the front end i'm told HTML hives the
hot so it's supposed to be awesome
I
really have no idea what this means like
that it's like the future though it's
like bigger than four right so it's kind
of awesome to go with that there have
been a bunch of improvements the admin
UI the two biggest star that filtery
thing on the side is that you're right
on your right hand side is now like
customizable used to me you could only
have a field on the model directly now
you can do related fields customize how
stuffs displayed customize what choices
are visible like everything about it's
customizable now and is much more useful
as a result and the other thing this has
been a long requested feature and I
don't know how visible is in the
screenshot but you can now order on
multiple columns which is pretty awesome
it used to be before even if you told
Django multiple columns it would ignore
that and just use the first one so now
it both respect what you tell it in your
admin da pie as well as letting you from
the UI provide multiple fields and do
stuff on it like having them sort in
different directions and all sorts of
craziness another big one is a signed
cookies so now essentially what a sign
cookie is you send some data down to the
client and then when it gets sent back
up to you as part of the cookie it's
verified the you of the right data in
there and along with this is a bunch of
sort of low-level plumbing it's sort of
reusable for how you do cryptographic
signing in a way that's secure so you
don't like giant security bugs in your
app which would suck and to go along
with this there's a new session back end
which stores your data in a cookie and
what this means is you can't store any
data you don't want the user to have but
it means you can use something like put
the users ID in a in a cookie which is
safe you and because it's signed you can
verify that they can't change their ID
but this means if you store say their
name and the cooking you don't review a
database query if the only information
you want to display is a name this is
pretty useful for a sort of
high-performance websites that want to
like really minimize the number of
database queries and stuff like that
it's not possible right now but I think
sort of viña looking to the future
sense it would be very cool
with a you could have multiple session
back in setup so you have some data
that's stored in a cookie and other data
that's actually stored server side
because some data is say you run a
shopping cart you want to store some
like the current state of the cart in
the session and you have data that the
client can't see like you want to store
on our tracking data or something and so
you want to store that on the server but
you still want to get like the left
sequel queries from storing their
username in the in a cookie so I do I
think something like that would be a
cool future direction and another cool
thing is a new form wizard form wizards
this thing's been sitting and contribute
used for him wizard it's like okay three
four people maybe and it wasn't that
good before to be honest but now it's
been totally rewritten using out the new
class-based generic views it has a
pluggable storage before you need to
have any data from a previous stuff in
the form need to be stored in a hidden
field on the page which meant you
couldn't do things like have file fields
on any page besides the last one and now
it's all been fixed they've got like
pluggable storage and a cool API and
they integrate with everything really
well and there are they're pretty
awesome and again there have been tons
of other minor bugs and features and
random stuff that's been fixed so it's
pretty awesome you should should check
out trunk it's pretty stable as Django
trunk generally is tested with your apps
let us know from broken anything yeah so
then at this point we're leaving the
realm of a stuff sort of concrete and
planned and land and coded and entering
the realm of stuff that's sort of guess
work so see this is this something I've
been working on my alotta objects top
bolt create and essentially it's an
optimization so that you do a single
sequel query the insert multiple rows
into your database it's really useful
for example the Django tests are about
twenty percent faster using this because
things like installing the permissions
whenever you have to flush the database
are super expensive and a pair
take a ton of time so right now I've got
this implemented for a sequel light in
Postgres I'm going to add my sequel
support i guess and then land this and
it will be awesome and you're absolutely
it faster as without even asking to use
it because there's all sorts of places
that can use it internally in django so
for example many too many fields add
takes multiple objects if you pass a
multiple objects it'll now do a single
sequel query rather than n of them it
has a few small caveat so it doesn't
send signals it doesn't call the safe
method on the object so if you require
if you need those you can't use this and
it doesn't work with a model inheritance
for very very obscure complex reasons
this is sort of a an open-ended thing
but uh one of the things i think i see
in jan goes future is Django trying to
shed some of the stuff it has and ship
less in the box and to that effect sort
of having more interfaces with Jenga
within Django and maybe shipping loss
actual implementations so an example
this is a django in a 12 added email
back end support the original impetus
for this was a google app engine and
other sort of hosted providers that
don't let you just use smtp but rather
have like their own special api's for
sending email being able to expose us in
generic way but as a result we're now at
a point where we could feasibly remove
the smtp backend from Django and still
have people be able to use email because
they can install their own custom
backends and I know a lot of people do
have their own custom beckons for
example for queuing up the emails and
stuff like that and there's a lot of
examples stuff like this I sort of the
extreme end of this would be if you can
imagine removing the database backends
from Django itself a django install
coming with sort of the ORM but you have
to install django postgres or something
and maybe possibly having you know when
you pip install django or got from it
easy install django if you do that maybe
having it still pull in all these
backends that were formerly shipping as
part of django but
maybe external packages which could be
maintained separately have different
groups of maintainer 'he's it's probably
true that there's a wildly different set
of people interested in maintaining the
database back ends and the email back
ends along with this idea is a google
summer of code from last year by arthur
koziol called the app or factor which
essentially brings the idea of
refactoring how Django loads your
applications in and specifically
allowing you to install applications
multiple times have applications that
have the same sort of app label so right
now there's Django can't rip off you
can't have another app name off anywhere
on your Python path because of
long-standing internal details so as a
result of this refractor you would now
be able to have that you'd be able to
say you at a comments application you'd
be able to install it twice say once for
commenting on users and once for
commenting on sporting events without
needing to have some sort of generic for
and key or other sort of database hack
sort of a really far-fetched thing that
I think would be good is a to breakout
contribute I early the the mantra for
crib for contributor de facto khamenei
implementations of common patterns or
something like that it's common stuff
that we sort of know how to do but the
reality is for a lot of it for a lot of
the stuff that lives in contribute and I
think auth is a really good example this
almost everyone is fought with off at
some point whether it was a few releases
ago it was just downright impossible to
have emails instead of usernames we've
we've evolved off who are that's
possible but now if you want to have
facebook or twitter integration you got
to have sort of a shim between auth and
the rest of your stuff and so sort of in
general I think sort of
thinning out contribute because there
tend to be stuff in there that is not
the de facto pattern we once thought it
was it is good that Django ships sort of
a secure all system that stores
passwords securely and as a password
reset doesn't have security holes and
sort of there are a lot of aspects of
auth that are sort of important that we
ship from a security perspective but as
we as people have different ways they
want to implement user authentication
having more concrete implementations of
stuff often makes it harder for users
rather than easier as we'd like and I
think this is true for a lot of contribs
frankly stuff another probably no one
uses anyone you're a human eyes ok 1 a 2
a few people use human eyes not most
people how about a anymore it's called
called like design tools or something
it's got one template tag that just
spits out a paragraph of lorem ipsum I
don't know anyone who uses this but
Jenga has been shipping it for forever
yeah and so in terms of another thing in
terms of the future of Django is google
summer of code is going on right now and
we have three pretty awesome projects
the first one is template compilation
which is being done by our monroe mature
who is the author of a flask and jinja
too and other stuff he's one of the puku
people so he does like sinks and
pigments and all kinds of other awesome
stuff and essentially what he's looking
to do is a Django has a template
language that is both sort of a
front-end the parses the templates as
well as a bunch of built-in template
tags jinjja chua is the same sort of
front-end same sort of built-in template
eggs essentially what he wants to do is
take the lot of the template compilation
infrastructures built for jinja which is
super fast compared to django and
compared to most template engines and
take this template compilation of
structure and generalize it so both the
Django template engine can use it as
well as sort of any other template
compilation language so we can have this
one shared infrastructure that handles
all the really hard problems like say
compiling your templates efficiently but
still giving you nice trace backs and
still working in environments like
Google App Engine
which you can't do some of the things
that ginger normally likes to do or the
current template compilation of
structure likes to do so sort of taking
all these reusable patterns and sharing
them across multiple template
implementations a part of this is uh
going to be refactoring the template
Agra interface show of hands how many
people here actually like how you write
template tags right now one Navy yeah
okay so in my opinion the template tag
API right now sucks to define new
template tags there are tons of the
helper applications out there Django
classy tags Django t tag Django template
eggs sugar all are trying to provide a
higher level API and that's going to be
required just from a technical
perspective on implementing this so
expect to see something new coming that
way composite fields this is a really
old ticking jangle like 373 or something
really really old and essentially you
cannot have in Django a multiple column
multiple primary key column fields you
can't have more than one field for a
primary key in Django right now because
you can't have any sort of composite
field and this is going to introduce
those and let the the primary key stuff
flow from them so you'll be able to work
with legacy databases to find new
databases that have composite primary
keys all sorts of other awesome stuff
like that it's probably going to feature
or factors various internal Django that
which are going to enable cool new
things like defining new under under
look up some fields right now you have
basically a static list of those and if
you don't like it that's tough this is
going to enable you probably to have
custom lookups which will be awesome and
the last one is done being done by a
Gregor Mueller and he's working on
making templates and forms awesome right
now in Django templates you have not a
lot of if you want to write good forms
for your template or sorry good
templates for your forms it's not real
Pleasant you can either sort of use the
built-in as you well as table as P and
try to style them
pray to God you like the HTML that comes
out you can iterate over the fields
which is nice but doesn't give you real
flexibility you things like lay them out
with two fields on the same row or put
them in form sets or any other cool
things like that and you can't do think
or in the final option is to have as a
sort of lay out every field manually for
every form on your site which sucks and
so this is going to divine a this the
goal this project is to define a set of
template tags built-in templates and
sort of patterns so that you can do
things like lay out your forms and say I
have one have a row here which has these
fields in it another row and organize
these two form sets and have it
automatically use the same set of
templates be able to swap out widgets
for fields within the template and
hopefully eventually be able to do
things like have a set of job to have
your be able to have your designer say
this is where the JavaScript comes from
for this field without needing to go in
and edit the your Python files which
will be a pretty awesome I think and so
that's sort of what we have on the table
right now for Django but the the most
important thing where most of Jango's
direction comes from is it comes from
you guys the users telling us what you
want to see writing patches for the
things you care about and we sort of
defining with chips in the box but the
Django community is shown that what
chips in the box isn't nearly as
important is what the community does
with it in terms of building website
building actual products with Django
writing usable applications for other
people defining what the best practices
are so the future jingoes kind up to you
guys yeah so thank you very much
questions
yes the question was there was a mailing
list post a little while ago by Jamie
Kapp lamaze where he tried to articulate
what he'd heard in terms of feedback for
what Django needed from sort of the
enterprise users he works with and two
of the big ones were marriage of Django
and some surf runnin to land settings to
how you deal with a large number of
settings files and so to the question
was obviously what is the what's
happened on those fronts and so to the
question of the a front-end tool I don't
realistically see Django ever shipping a
JavaScript toolkit or anything like that
saying you should use this in your
applications obviously I think since
then the admin has adopted jquery which
in large part is allowed us to do some
of the nice new admin UI things we're
not there's no plans to extend that
forward and say users should use this
but I see the odd the template and form
stuff as an opportunity there I know
Russell Keith McGee has had an ID
another core developer has that an ID
he's been kicking around for a while of
essentially the Python package index but
for reusable widgets and so I think the
idea of having some sort of JavaScript
framework integration come as a result
of here is a set of template tags and
other stuff that works with it well it
is good because from my perspective I
don't see what Django could ship itself
to make JavaScript matter that you can't
do in an external app and from my
perspective that's better because my
perspective is anytime you add more code
to django it's a little more lock in if
someone doesn't want to do that and it's
a little more stuff for me to maintain
to the setting this thing there has not
been a ton of movement on settings other
than we sort of now have an informal
policy of please God don't add any more
settings to django itself there's too
many like you're not allowed to add a
new one unless you take one out
informally which is to say it's violated
all the time um in prac so I don't know
any there's no official movement on that
I think it would be really good if there
was a
a set of Community Guidelines especially
uh sort of from my perspective there's
now a ton of Jango's Django or Python
specific hosts that are popping up and
they're all going to be they all want to
minimize the friction of setting up a
django app and part of that's going to
be here is here's the convention for
using our service so that if you do this
your settings is automatically set up it
would be really good if they all share
the convention or had some sort of you
know a set of conventions they all
understood whatever the right thing is
so everybody is on the same footing
Django is really good about this in a
lot of other areas everybody puts their
models at thought models and their
models up high their views in their
views up high their URLs in their URLs
da pie it would be good if we had a
similar sort of convention around
settings yes so the question is what is
the right way for reusable apps to
define their own settings and I think
this is right now the answer is you sort
of namespace it within your app by like
prefixing every setting name with
something and praying to God nobody else
has like something similar I think this
is a problem that's really well solved
by the application or factor i alluded
to because essentially it allows you to
define an application class you can
still define apps in the old way but now
you can have a class that represents
your app that can mean stanchion
multiple times and essentially settings
can live on it so the sort of new style
way would be instead of having instead
of having a set of settings in your
settings pie you would have it your
project level somewhere a sub class or
an instantiation of the app that's
provided the settings you want in the
same token this uh this solves the
problem of having all the sort of auto
load auto registration stuff in like
your route URLs that pie like you have
admin dot auto load and you know any
other app that would sort of piggyback
on that same methodology they all now of
a hook on their application class it
allows them to automatically have that
so once this lands if you have admin
installed in your installed apps then
it'll know oh hey I'm installed I can
load up all of your admin app hi files
and this also solves problems around
sort of where do I put my signals where
do I register my signals all this stuff
now serve as a defined place to put
itself an application startup so the
question was about sort of the the
splitting up of Jango and separate
install ability so there's no real
concrete plans around this it's a little
pie in the sky at the moment he has it
relies on sort of having some of the
future installation niceties that come
with distutils to and pip future
versions of PIP and sort of everyone
being on the same page there in terms of
us not breaking everyone who tries to
pip install Django and expect of
everything there's no precise plans to
pull out something like templates which
and the reason is it's is because it
relies on a bunch of stuff in utils
being sort of the dumping ground for
stuff that's may be used in more than
one place in Django and so figuring out
that that dependency chain would be sort
of a first step towards it sort of
splitting out contrib or certain
backends is more possible because they
would obviously you'd still need to have
the rest of django that being installed
whereas if you want if the goal was to
install just templates that objectives
obviously not to have everything else
it's the case today that you can
basically use templates without using
anything else in Django but I don't see
something as sort of the infrastructure
like templates being separately
installable in the immediate future the
question is why is the future of Django
brighter than the future of ruby on
rails at my answers I have no idea i I
don't actively track rails development
so I don't know a lot about what they're
doing it seems to me like from the high
level that we're taking sort of very
similar approaches in terms of
lightening the load it's my impression
that rails three split out a lot of
things like how they integrate with
their ORM and sort of other back ND type
stuff and I think we're definitely
progressing on a similar path that I
still AM verify I think the real answer
is why Django's features bright as
because pythons future is bright they're
like so many like good things happening
in the Python world right
now in terms of other libraries just the
general health of the web framework
ecosystem with us now hang a proper pep
for a whiskey on Python 3k having this
sort of shared template compilation
infrastructure with other with other web
programming or with other template
languages were the sort of discussions
about having maybe some sort of shared
request object so that Django has the
same request object as flats because the
same request object as web sort of sort
of low-level stuff like this that lets
the whole community focus together on
solving one problem once i think is why
the future of django so great because
the future everything around us is
awesome so the question is about django
itself moving on to a distributed
version control system and to quote
russell Keith McGee we already do
support dbcs like every core developer I
think except for Adrian hollow body uses
some form of a DV CS and we take patches
on mercurial on get even I think people
use bizarre and darks even so we can we
take patches there it is unlikely that
Django will move at this point or at
this time I should say because svn is a
decent lowest common denominator you can
write to it from get from mercurial from
bizarre if there was a dvc s that was a
similarly available target for all of us
maybe that would be possible for a lot
of the core developers right now we
don't see the impetus because you know
we're already using it and there's
there's a Brandt this repositories on
github on bitbucket I do see the
perspective from a lot of people feel
like it's easier to contribute something
on github bitbucket and I think if we
could find a way to work with their
workflows so we could accept pull
requests on those sites that would be
good because I mean obviously the end
goal for all VCS is a tool and we wanted
to be as easy as possible to contribute
to django both for other people as well
as ourselves so yeah no concrete plans I
guess
okay well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
