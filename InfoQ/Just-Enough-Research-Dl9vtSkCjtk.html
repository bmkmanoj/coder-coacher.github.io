Francisco I was so excited for the
opportunity to give a talk in a mask
yeah it was this or scary clown because
I've been watching American Horror Story
yeah that's good right that's a good
show and also a studies show that when
you're traumatized while receiving new
information you'll retain it better yeah
I just might rip the bottom half of my
face off that's it for for didactic
purposes but thank you so much for
coming out tonight I hope you got all
liquored up and mentored and all that so
I'm gonna start off I have a question
for you one simple question that
question is do you enjoy being right if
you like having the right answer put
your hand up real proud yeah
yeah I love being right it's the best
feeling in the world I was the kid who
would be first in class to raise my hand
I'm the one who will fact-check your
joke and I always know the dictionary
definition of the word you're not quite
using right and so when I went to
college as Andy said I studied
philosophy and this only served to
weaponize this tendency because you're
graded on how well you make an argument
and the first step in making an argument
is to define your terms and as long as
you define your terms well you've set
the conditions under which your logic is
unimpeachable you're always correct your
arguments valid and so by both setting
the up the questions and providing the
answers I got even better at being right
as awesome and then then I had to
graduate and cut in the real world
and and I found out that uh slowly over
time I realized or was encouraged by
others to realize that racing to
demonstrate my rightness had some
undesirable effects it made me very
annoying it made me a bad listener and
worst of all it actually increased the
chance I was wrong because you know that
person the person who races to answer
your question before you've even
finished asking it that was me and I
came to know the error of my way is
because wanting to get to the right
answer is not a bad thing it's it's a
really good thing but that's different
wanting to find the right answer is much
different from that feeling of wanting
to have the right answer wanting to
already have it and not want to look
outside yourself you know and I learned
that you've got a better chance of
actually being right by figuring out the
right questions are not just you know
coming up with an answer because you
don't want to look dumb or because you
already have a pet solution because you
know being a designer or developer
entrepreneur means exercising control
over a really small set of things you
know you have total control over those
lines of code you're writing or those
pixels you're moving around when you're
at your keyboard but then you send your
creation out into the real world and
you've got no control the real world
doesn't conform to any designers
preferences as much as we wish it did
because you can try to set terms but
none of us are gods and the terms you
try to set are just assumptions we don't
control reality beyond that one small
piece we're designing and instead of
setting terms you're really just making
assumptions and assumptions are risks so
the thing we can do
to try to decrease these risks and get
to the right answer and not be really
annoying people is to look at the world
around us not to the point of being
overwhelmed or paralyzed by data and
options but we can do our best to make
sure that we have enough information to
make the right kind of decisions and
really do what we're capable of and
that's what I'm going to talk to you
about tonight getting enough input to
inform your assumptions and give you
more confidence in your decisions and
that's just enough research which is
delightfully orange orange yeah orange
go Giants Giants that was pure pandering
on my part so time for a story so we
live in the future now it's awesome it's
a 2014 which is sort of a shocking
number but I'm gonna take you back back
to 2001 and 2001 was kind of a rough
year for a bunch of reasons and the the
economy it was really crappy and nobody
had jobs and it was sort of terrible and
and people were looking for something to
get excited about and the rumors started
swirling about this awesome new
invention it was called ginger or
sometimes simply it and it was going to
be the revolutionary future of personal
transportation Jeff Bezos was into it
Bono was into it among other things bono
was a venture capitalist tens of
millions of dollars of venture
investment was poured into it the hype
from investors and Technology pundits
was outstanding very smart people we're
seeing very ridiculous things so what
was it then finally in December of that
year it debuted
it's just sort of a
counter-revolutionary thud and sure we
see segways all the time as a niche
device or a novelty miracles of
engineering conveying gaggles of
tourists through Golden Gate Park while
you biked smugly bye I like hey I like
to make eye contact with them you know
sometimes I'll see the mom and back
she's just embarrassed like doing it my
husband really wanted to do this and
it's as though the finest engineering
minds of the late 20th century
envisioned this brave new world assured
him by amphibious duck tour but the duck
bus can handle segways kryptonite which
is rain not that any of us remember but
this is like that looks kind of I'd say
go in the rain now and you have to ask
the question is this really better than
a car see there's an established set of
modern transportation conventions used
with shockingly little variation by
billions of people around the world and
the Segway didn't fit this established
system at all like what Lana is supposed
to drive it in like not that do not get
in my bike lane with one of those things
where are you supposed to park it it's
slower than a car at least ten times the
price of a commuter bike even those who
could afford it weren't sure what to do
with it once they got over the novelty
and the reason I use this as an example
is I find the segue so murchison because
of the arrogance because it purported to
change the world for such a really tiny
slice of the world because if you look
at who isn't included in the Segway
worldview well it's anyone who has to
transport kids
it's anyone who doesn't have five grand
burning a hole in their pocket and you
know I'll give anybody the early adopter
market you know like what VCRs were
$70,000 when they first came out or
something so sure you know anybody who
has to deal with inclement weather and
you know Portland is extreme weather as
far as the Segway is concerned anybody
who has to carry more than 20 pounds so
that rules out grocery shopping and
anyone who works or shops more than five
miles from home so this is a product
that's gonna change the world for people
who are highly anti-social have five
thousand dollars live in the desert on a
well paved road and find it's superior
to other available modes of
transportation
so who's this thing for that guy
according to a Harvard Business Review
article instead of selling ten thousand
segways a week as the inventor Dean came
and had predicted they sold twenty four
thousand in the first five years yeah
bummer so so Dean came and the inventor
of the Segway is a really smart guy and
he's a really successful guy and it's
got to kind of kill him
that this is this is what everybody
thinks of he's you know he's
successfully tackled a bunch of really
important problems like a water
purification system he's designed a
really amazing wheelchair a diabetes
drug delivery system and I'm sure that
he did a lot of really uniquely
innovative work to develop this thing um
but he and all his investors and
supporters are not gods they did not get
to set the terms under which the Segway
would be successful simply put when
you're developing a new product or
service or stablish or enhancing one
that exists you work from a set of
assumptions about what the real world is
like and inevitably
a gap exists between your assumptions
and the real world and the bigger the
gap the more it gets filled with wishful
thinking or hype and most of all risk
and the only way to reduce this is to
get some new knowledge and new knowledge
well this is exciting Sat cosmos will
decrease the space between your
assumptions and the real world because
when the success of your idea depends
upon significant changes to habits and
infrastructure that's a good time to
check yourself people are lazy and
structural change takes time I mean you
guys most of you from the Bay Area right
if you're if you live around here you
know it took us more than a decade to
build part of a bridge part of a single
bridge and we're spending a gazillion
dollars to figure out whether that we
can support some already popular
existing modes of transportation and and
this is what I think a lot of people
worry about when they hear the word
research they fear that we're just gonna
spend a lot of money to find out
something we already know and can't do
anything about and I'm all for
innovation I want people to design
products and services that vastly
improve the world and it kills me to see
good really really smart people pursue
ideas without taking reality into
account at all and throw millions of
dollars and brains and things against
the wall and just kind of see if
something works because if you want to
improve the world you actually need
first-hand knowledge of what the
existing world is like and and I can't
tell you how often at mule design we
hear something like this from clients
based on the misconception that
creativity and innovation wither in the
face of actual facts we want blue sky
thinking they say
when blue sky thinking meets reality
reality wins but you know this seems so
obvious but if it is this is so obvious
why are so many products released that
are so hard to use or don't meet a real
need or don't serve a business goal
shortcomings that in retrospect seem
really obvious because somewhere someone
along the line decided it wasn't
important to do their due diligence and
you know when I hear up these objections
I think of my little dog when it's
raining cuz it used to rain and he
doesn't want to go for a walk the rain
won't hurt him he really needs to go for
a walk but he puts up this big fight for
no good reason
once he's out there he's totally happy
but the resistance is astonishing and
that's the same sort of resistance here
this we don't have the time to do
research what this really means is I'd
rather spend the time doing something
that feels more productive to me like
coding or to signing and here we don't
have the money we have the money to
gamble on our assumptions but we don't
have the money to spend on research we
don't have the expertise somehow we have
the expertise to make the thing but we
don't have the expertise to figure out
whether we're making the right thing I'd
prefer the illusion of mathematical
certainty building a prototype is
actually a type of research but it's not
a substitute for all types of research
and I'll talk about that in a few
minutes and my favorite billionaire
geniuses who change entire industries
don't do research and as an aspiring
billionaire genius neither do i these
are the same objections I hear over and
over again and these objections the root
of these objections is a special goo
made of laziness and fear
and it's the same thing chicken
McNuggets are made out of oh there's a
nugget apologist out there it's cool
eat your Nuggets I'm not going to take
this isn't like just enough not eating
at McDonald's because people are afraid
of being a follower
even though first mover advantage is
kind of a myth people are afraid of
losing control because paradoxically we
feel more in control with less
information because once you start
admitting one thing you don't know
you've got a cop to everything you don't
know and it can get overwhelming and
having to share credit this is the one
no one wants to admit to but we are in
this culture where we celebrate the
genius the visionary magic loan college
dropout even though we all know that it
takes a team of people and a lot of
information from everywhere to do
something well and good and lasting
people feel that it's a weakness to look
outside themselves for the answers so so
what does the failure of the Segway to
change the world have to teach those of
us designing and building digital
products and services that we're human
choice and behavior are concerned
existing context matters and usefulness
counts for a lot and you know in a world
where you know the the interface design
really can make or break a product all
design decisions are business decisions
and asking the right questions leads to
better answers you know and there there
are plenty of products and services that
have much less grandiose ambitions than
changing all of transportation so here's
another cautionary tale a little closer
to home from a couple years ago so you
might remember an app called color comm
from a couple of years back yeah if you
don't that's even sadder
so it was a photo-sharing I heard that
so according to their press materials
they were advancing the post PC
revolution and stuff and essentially it
was an app that would let you upload
photos and put your photos with
everybody else's photos people were in
the same place and it had an unclear
objective and a really really
complicated user interface and
TechCrunch said that the beauty of
colors stemmed from what they were doing
differently they raised 41 million
dollars Sequoia Capital invested more in
color.com than they did in Google back
in the day so with this much money and a
staff of 27 people color had plenty of
time to you know iterate and pivot and
it could have pirouetted with this much
money yeah they could have just kept it
going but after less than 18 months the
board and major shareholders voted to
wine the company down when it lodged
bill win the founder he said I thought
we were gonna build a better Facebook
but within 30 minutes I realized oh my
god it's broken
holy we totally up this is
an expensive and totally irresponsible
way to learn that your idea has some
room for improvement yeah that's that's
people gave him forty-one million
dollars so the risk of failure is
dramatically lower than it used to be I
read an ink magazine article about how
easy it is for investors to take risks
on unproven ideas and unproven teams
it's it's really cheap one entrepreneur
Alex from Antigua who founded this
dating site said another way to think of
it is that starting companies the
dey's is akin to doing research in the
past why research when you can learn
through failure how did it get to be so
uncool to reduce your risk of failure
but what these guys are talking about
when they're talking about risk is their
personal risk of failure not the
probability of failure and in fact since
the personal risk is lower because you
can go and you can burn through this
money and go get more and people like oh
you failed you're awesome and I think
it's probably driving the failure rate
up and and there's a cost to this the
opportunity cost is all the good
products you're not making an existing
needs that go unmet because they didn't
happen to occur to an entrepreneur
starting a company is not a form of
research starting a company without
doing research is just a form of
gambling and the problem with the
prevalence of this sort of thinking is
it starts infecting establishing
businesses looking for models of
innovation focusing just on what you can
learn through your own failure your own
trial and error rather than looking
outside yourself first
that leaves needs unmet and those unmet
actual real world needs are what you
should be looking at in the first place
they're not like bycatch like tuna that
end up in dolphin nets and then many
established businesses have kind of a
different problem because product
strategy ends up based on politics
instead of real world data and that's
what introduces the risk and and you
know if you're in a big established
company asking what might be very very
good questions can just get you fired
and these politics pull focus from your
goals and from the evidence you need to
make decisions so the bottom line is
don't waste anyone's time or effort on
untested assumptions if you don't have
to I just I just want us to agree that
success is better than failure you know
I we shouldn't be paralyzed by fear of
and a lot of times you know trying and
failing is a great way to learn some
lessons you might not learn otherwise
but you know a lot of organizations
cling to their assumptions and act like
they don't actually want to decrease
their risk of filling my dream my big
dream is that we change the culture of
innovation and entrepreneurship so that
we value solving real problems and I
don't it doesn't have to be ambitious
problems all the time just creating
something of lasting value you know that
people need that people enjoy that
matters to people out in the world that
creates value for them and doesn't just
create value for the investors and to
decrease the risk of failure by giving
products a better shot from the start
and if we can spread the word about how
to gain and use some really basic really
really super simple research skills and
start telling a better story about
connecting context and utility and value
maybe we can change this culture so go
really quickly so what what is research
what do I mean when I say that you know
it's simply any form of systematic
inquiry if you want to know more about a
particular topic you go through a
process you ask some questions you know
the type of process depends on who you
are and what you need to know
fundamentally it's just asking questions
you know and then doing a good job of
interpreting the answers a lot of
personal research these days begins with
a Google query then you end up on a
Wikipedia page and you're like oh that's
how you pronounce his name and the
challenge is just finding a trustworthy
source for the information
assessing credibility is the hard part
and that's where critical thinking comes
in pure research is carried out to
create new human knowledge there's kind
of a high bar whether it uncovers facts
or fundamental principles you know the
researcher investigator wants to advance
a particular field such as neuroscience
by asking a particular question like why
do humans sleep there's experimentation
and observation and the results are
published in peer-reviewed journals this
is science
you know rigorous standards and
methodologies
exist to preserve objectivity and the
credibility of conclusions and but you
know things get squishy when
corporations fund ostensibly pure
research as they do but that's sort of
another issue so Applied Research is the
kind I'm most interested in Applied
Research borrows ideas and techniques
from pure research to serve a specific
real-world goal and that goal could be
creating a super soldier or improving
the quality of health care or marketing
sandwiches in a can
applied research is good for anything
real product applied research doesn't
require the same rigor or need the same
standards it's successful if it helps
you meet your goal and and I really try
to emphasize this because while it's
important to be ethical you know you can
you can change up the questions you're
asking you can work with an imperfect
sample size you know you can you can
make the most of what you have as long
as it helps you meet your actual
business goal it's successful research
then there's design research which is a
form of a Applied Research Jayne full
and Siri the creative Directorate idea
said this long thing key thing that
really boils down to you want to expose
patterns and explore reactions and shed
light on the unknown and that's all
really great but a lot of times design
research is super focused on the end
user and there are all these activities
like participatory processes and velcro
modeling and collage and and all of a
sudden it just becomes this world that's
really focused on these fun activities
and it's you know you can get all caught
up in it but it's not enough it's not
enough to do these activities that feel
creative and help you understand the end
user because even focusing on the habits
and experiences and needs of the people
out there which is often the topic of
design research that's not enough
because you need to look at the whole
thing your organization your users your
world context because no matter how well
you meet the needs of the real people
out there there are plenty of design
solutions that totally failed like
people loved them but the business
couldn't support them you know the real
world context in which you're offering
your product or service includes
everything you don't have control over
which is a lot you know you really have
to think about the context which is
something that all those participatory
design exercises and things you do in a
lab like don't really catch you know if
you're designing a really awesome
web-based service and you know it's
mobile stuff multiple devices stuff and
you're part of a group of super nice
people or maybe maybe you work at home
you know if you don't work for Yahoo and
you'll naturally be limited to the
environment in which your what you and
your team are interacting with what
you're designing but your customers are
real people in the real world and a
system that makes perfect sense to you
and the abstract might not meet those
real world demands okay we all have the
six-plus now it's important you know hey
look at my friends bigger you cannot
understand the context of use in the
context of your own office you've got to
get out into the real world so research
just offers one set of inputs it's
really really important you really need
to do it but it's not a panacea and it
has some boundaries and limitations I
want to point out so there's a big
misconception about research that it's
asking what people like you know like is
not a part of the critical thinkers
vocabulary on some level we all want to
be liked we all want the things we do to
be liked so we treat it as a leading
indicator of success but it's not the
concept of liking is as subjective as it
is empty you know I like horses I'm not
gonna buy any online
so you have to smash all talk of liking
and hating plenty of people do things
they claim to hate you don't make money
from what people think you make money
from what people actually do so mental
states and there's a whole host of
market research that's I think
completely useless and and research
should not be a political tool you know
don't let your methods be guided by a
desire to appear smart or conform to
anyone else's picture of research some
of our clients will argue they'll say
well don't we have to do something in a
lab isn't that important we're like no
nobody nobody operates in a lab you know
it just feels researchy so watch out for
people in power wanting to influence the
results of research because they
conflict with the opinions of people in
power if you're doing research well and
right it is very threatening to the
established order because you're you've
got new information coming in and
research is not science you know in
addition to executives who prefer the
authoritative appearance of
experimentation you might run into
sample size Queens who dispute the
validity of your qualitative research
you know these people are often
pollsters and marketers and they run a
lot of surveys so just avoid arguments
about statistical significance with
these people you will not win keep the
focus on identifying useful patterns
based on accurate descriptions so I want
you to walk out of here and be able to
make more informed decisions based on
real-world evidence today well maybe not
today today is kind of over it so
tomorrow feel free to get started
tonight because the process is really
really simple like there are so many
books and courses and things but it's a
really we all do it all you need to do
to research you need to form some
questions gather some data analyze the
data you know you can do a lot of
different things to gather the data
observations interview
is experiments you can read what other
like reading what other people have done
is a great cheap way to get a lot of
research in there and then the whole
goal of research is to gain useful
insights that you can apply to whatever
you're already doing you know user
centered design developed a bad rep
because it was associated with waterfall
development and oh it takes so long and
everything and a lot of people think
research necessarily requires a whole
lot of documentation but it doesn't the
point of research is not everybody hates
a report nobody wants a report you want
new knowledge and this one simple
process applies to many many situations
you can use research in any process no
matter what you're doing whatever the
best way is that depends on whatever way
is most useful to you you start with
where you are wow that's thank you thank
you and good night Wow yeah that's it I
decided I was done all right there we go
yeah those things so whatever you've got
whatever you need in terms of like your
goal the amount of time the amount of
money the people you have working with
you you can find research methods that
work for you because the most important
aspect of effective research is that you
need to collaborate because it's not
that you're necessarily going to figure
out anything that's so new and so
earth-shaking sometimes the most
important output of research is that
everybody working on your team actually
is working in the same shared reality
and you might assume this could be the
most dangerous assumption that that
everybody has the same idea of what your
goals are who your users are what your
constraints are but once you start
talking to people on your team you might
find that they have very different
visions and so when you go through the
research process together you can
actually end up sharing a reality which
is quite convenient for getting things
done so forming good research questions
is a
seneschal to getting good answers and
I'm not talking about the specific
questions that you asked say in an
interview but the big questions that
you're you're trying to answer through
by going through research at all your
research questions have to be specific
answerable and practical for you to
answer you know it has to be something
that you can actually attain with your
resources so imagine you're designing a
new app aimed at pet owners you might
want to know what do people think about
pets Sherlock is glaring at you because
this is a bad question this is too broad
people think all possible things about
pets but you might rephrase it how to
single urban adults choose an acquirer
pet he is smiling his approval this is a
good question
because because you know any of you in
the audience might already have an idea
how you might find the answer to this
question and maybe you want to know
things about the you know the
organization you're working in you might
think when people do around here all day
you will never have a satisfactory
answer to that question but maybe you
can make a little more specific and say
well how do we coordinate communication
priorities across departments like this
knowing this could be really useful and
its really attainable so so the better
your questions are the better output
you're gonna get from whatever you do to
answer those questions so now we've
covered how to formulate a question you
can see what you can ask a question
about so you can ask questions about the
organization and and this is something
we talk about a lot because it doesn't
come up in design research nearly enough
because this is the hardest kind of
research to do as part of an internal
team you know and often it's the most
essential to the success of a project
because it can be it can be really easy
to design something that the people out
there in the world like and want and
then it can be really really hard to get
the people in your organization to
support what needs to happen to design
the thing that's that the best thing for
the people out there in the world and so
you want to know what's your
organizational cable
love how is it put together how do
people work together what are incentives
for working that way you know quite
often redesigning a website or
interactive product or service requires
redesigning the organization and you
know you want a new shiny thing out
there in the world but you don't want
everybody has their habits inside and
they don't want to change how they work
and that's why you get websites or apps
that look beautiful on launch day and
super shitty forty days later it's not
that it wasn't a good designer design
people didn't want but that just meant
it's like a face transplant
that's microcement this this will stick
with you if you redesign your your
external system and don't hook up the
the workflow behind it it's like you
transplanted a face without hooking up
the veins and nerves and it's just slide
right off yeah yeah workflow you'll
remember that now so if you're in a
small early-stage company this is pretty
straightforward to find out the baggage
is all out there you could just sit in a
room and say okay guys what's up
but you're in a large mature
organization you'll have to do some
digging it can be exciting exploration
because when you do this like you can
clarify requirements deal with politics
understand your workflow your
capabilities and most of all attain some
goodwill which is incredibly necessary
for getting anything decent done you
know an organization on paper is very
different from that same organization
inhabited by actual humans when you
learn how those people really relate to
each other you'll be in a much better
position to design and develop a product
that the organization can support and
get behind you know and it might sound
daunting to do organizational research
but it's really just a series of
conversations very carefully conducted
conversations one-on-one real honest and
it's you know it's necessary also to let
people know you won't rat them out
that's super important so Paul Ford is
an excellent writer and he wrote a
really
excellent essay called the web is a
customer service medium and you need to
all read this and he says that why
wasn't I consulted is the fundamental
question of the web humans have this
need to be consulted and engaged and to
exercise their knowledge and the
participatory nature of the web that
we're all used to they were all immersed
in has created this expectation and so
he was talking about you know end-users
people out there in the world but this
is an excellent principle to keep in
mind when dealing with with other with
your colleagues with people you work
with seeking input at the start of a
project prevents you from having an
enemy bent on your destruction by the
end so users that's I mean that's a hard
part dealing with your colleagues is
really really the hard part users are
relatively easy you know what user
centered designers call user research is
a form of ethnography now it's a sort of
fancy science word it just means what do
people do and why do they do it and it's
similar to market research which which
is like why how do we make people buy
things you know analyzing data to help
you understand different purchase
decisions and things but but a nice
shorthand from Xerox PARC the
organization Steve Jobs stole is early
stuff from yeah
is it true ethnography reveals not just
what people say they do but what they
actually do so if you think you're
getting or people actually do then then
you're you're getting some some real
good stuff there because you know we all
know there's what people say they do
which is on the cocktail party level and
there's what people actually do and so
so I've come up quick four DS of design
ethnography deep dive daily life data
analysis and drama just means that you
want to talk to a few people very very
deeply and really understand them so
don't like some people get really
stressed out like oh my god we're only
talking to 12 people we're only talking
to 15 people like these are the people
who are used to running big surveys but
you can find patterns with a pretty
small number you want to know about
their mess
see messy daily life you either want to
go to where they are or get on the phone
with them with like their kids or
coworkers or freeway noise or
jackhammers in the background cuz
because that's how they live and that's
how they're gonna be interacting with
whatever you're designing or creating
then you've got to really look for those
patterns you know do some good data
analysis or else it really is just like
making new friends and then it doesn't
really help and then the drama is that
you know you're hearing these people's
stories and what you want to do is take
the patterns and things you find and
turn them back in the stories because
that's the way people will use and
remember them because we like to think
that we're creatures of data but we're
really creatures of stories and so if
you turn the information you find out
about the people that you're trying to
reach into you know the personas and
scenarios and all those things they'll
be much much more effective and you'll
run into people who don't trust this
even though it's more effective just
because it's like Oh show me the data
show me the quantitative stuff and
numbers but it's important to keep in
mind every one is a special and unique
snowflake all of you snowflakes
so you can also you know do some
research around the competition
competitive research is it's really
essential and it's also misunderstood
because you need to not it's easy to
know like oh who are competitors who
else is in the same space or doing what
we do but you need to know who your
competition is from the perspective of
your users of your customers because you
need to know who competes for your
attention in their in their minds
because attention is the rarest resource
and the one that you need to survive you
know you need to grab attention turn
that attention to have it and you can
start with some critical thinking and
follow up with user research but you
really need to start your competitive
research with the lived experience of
the people you're trying to reach you
have to know what your customers value
I'll give you a hint they value being on
their sofas you know you need to be able
to answer the question for them so what
you know I'm making a new thing so what
because seriously if all of you just
start asking
the question how do I know that what I'm
working on is not the next Segway we all
win because real people don't care about
the theory of why one product is better
than another they care about the lived
experience you know consider the
alternatives from the point of view of
your audience you know is what you're
doing faster more comfortable to use
does it make people feel sexier is it
cheaper more flexible like you can put
it you can't put a Segway on a bus and
and a really important competitor to
think about is nothing because doing
nothing is easy and it's free you know I
mean for anyone able to walk they're
already getting the benefits of a Segway
plus exercise so maybe you're creating
something so new and so innovative the
world has never seen anything like it
nobody's like oh I can't I can't do
research because it's too crazy it
doesn't exist but you got to ask what
will motivate people to do what you want
them to do instead of nothing and like
what activities are you gonna displace
because the hardest competitor to beat
is whatever your target customers are
doing right now people are lazy
forgetful creatures of habit and plenty
of user research bears this out if you
are seriously committed to the sparkle
motion of innovation you have to commit
this to memory because people hate
change I've worked on enough redesigns
and got enough hate mail people really
hate shade hate it a lot it's terrible
and so whatever you're doing that's new
and shiny and great has to be better
than that
so now few tools you formed your
questions you figure a topic so there
are a lot of ways you can gather useful
data the most important only takes your
brain critical thinking is the
foundation of research it's just a fancy
way of saying making decisions and
evaluating statements based on facts
it's thinking about thinking we don't do
this as much as we should it's it's a
real practice the difference between
critical thinking and regular plain old
thinking is that critical
thinking is disciplined and
self-correcting and clear and logical
you're really like you want to try to
think better about things so an example
of uncritical thinking we've probably
all encountered something like this you
know I hate yellow yellow sucks I'm
gonna make business decisions based on
the fact that I had a bad experience
with yellow as a child but if you can
separate out your preference like we're
all gonna have preferences that's fine
that's great but are we gonna base key
business decisions on our personal
preferences that would be bad
lots of people do this because they just
don't you know think otherwise and
there's a fantastic book many of you've
probably already read it called Thinking
Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman which
is about that dual thought processes
it's so good and he'll you'll read it
and think wow my brain wants to me
over so critical thinking you cannot do
anything with research you cannot
evaluate research you cannot do
evidence-based decision-making unless
you get your brain in order so
observation next most important tool
it's just looking at the world around
you getting good at noticing things and
people watching it's something we
already do you know we're already
observing people regularly if only to
determine how we should interact with
them like you ride the bus and you're
like oh is that guy crazy or just
wearing a headset and we're already
great at reporting what we've observed
back to people you know you go back to
though you should have seen this guy on
the bus he was super crazy we observe
things and we tell stories about them
and to do research to use this as
research all you've gotta do is make a
slight shift in your thinking when
you're observing a person or situation
don't think Oh what does it mean to me
think what does it mean to that person
or what is it what does this situation
just mean in general as a whole and then
do your best to you know just report
that back in a non-judgmental neutral
fashion you know you really have to want
to understand the inner workings of that
guy on the bus love the guy on the bus
so interviews are absolutely the core of
you know organizational and user
research talking to people who represent
your turn
get user customers it's essential and
rewarding and it's it's pretty easy and
and I've heard one dominant rationale
for not talking to representative people
you know we don't want our product to be
limited by what our customers say they
want and this goes back to people
thinking that how you do research is
asking people what do you want what do
you think about that what do you like
but it's not you know and I think some
entrepreneurs and product designers
isolate themselves from their target
customers because they're afraid of
having their hype bubble burst you know
so they say it we don't want facts to
inhibit creativity but you have to get
out and talk to people who are different
from you because there are way more
people not like you than there are
people like you and they're who you need
to design for and you know remote
research is great if you can't get to
where they are phone interviews and
screen sharing or really good I'm a huge
advocate it can be really easy and
really inexpensive napal wrote a
fantastic book on it you know you just
have to talk to these people
and so there's there's an art to being a
good interviewer but you know tried to
distill it really simple you just have
to know what you want to find out you've
got to warm the person up and get them
comfortable and then you need to shut up
and this is the part that can be really
really hard for people you know the the
misconception about interviewing is that
it's talking and thinking of things to
say but once you get the person that
you're talking to going the skill is in
not jumping in to try to insert yourself
and to like let those uncomfortable
silences happen you know some people
start off as better listeners some
people are good at that but it's you
know just get out of the way and and
amazing things amazing things happen
sometimes when you say oh the interviews
over and the person says oh wait I just
thought of this deep personal secret I'm
going to tell you you know it can start
out pretty awkward the important thing
is you know there's a comfort zone and
you're gonna be outside of it like if
you feel comfortable doing your research
if you're finding things out that make
you feel really comfortable you're doing
it wrong you know but your subject you
should make sure the person you're
talking to they
need to be very comfortable so they open
up to you and tell them not about their
jogging but about their sofa time and
and just treat them like everything they
do is right everything you do is
interesting and fascinating because
you're there to learn about them so
practice practice practice so then
you've done all this stuff then analysis
I don't see a gloss right over this so
analysis is distilling the insights
you've gotten from the data and there
there are many ways to analyze collected
data once you have good questions and
good data like you can go back to it
again and again and again so let's give
you a sort of simple basic technique so
you know you get everything although I
hope you've taken notes through this
whole process you get all the the notes
of videos photos whatever you take in
and you get your team because you really
you want people to participate you want
people to collaborate because you know
being the smart person is more fun than
obeying the smart person that's why
there's so many teams where there's a
research group over here and there's
designers and developers over here and
the researchers work really really hard
and make this really awesome report and
they come over and they're like here do
what we say and the designers and
developers are like screw you we're not
reading that we're gonna go do this and
I feel very sad for those people because
they put a lot of work into it and their
findings are probably really great but
you have to have people participate if
you want them to really understand and
really use the research and really have
that shared great reality so you get
everybody together in front of a
whiteboard you write your observations
like things you heard or things you saw
things people said on post-its and you
just arrange them in groups and then you
name the patterns and you rearrange them
and you have the discussion and the
discussion of what you saw and heard is
just as good as anything because you
just want to turn these insights that
you find into actionable inputs to your
design process and an actionable input
is simply something you can do so if you
have an insight like you know you saw a
lot of people collaborate on purchases
you know and you discuss this with your
team you can start generating ideas for
the product and this is where the design
work comes in because when you do
research
you can do all kinds of research Taunton
has research the research won't tell you
what to make it won't tell you what to
design that's where you get to bring you
know your insights and your intellect
and your value-added proposition or
whatever into there to say okay here's
how people are acting here's what we
need to do and this is just a really
simple example so people collaborate on
purchases maybe you need to like oh we
need to save state so people can share
things and so this is a really really
simple example of how you go from oh we
observed this behavior to now we're
gonna have this feature or make this
design change or something like that so
see it's all extremely simple you just
have to do it so just can make a couple
of comment on a couple sort of
controversial topics and research you
hear this all the time
why can't we just skip this and just
make a prototype iterate on the
prototype so prototype is a hypothesis
and putting a prototype out there it's
just it's running an experiment you know
so say you're like oh I want to test
wine openers so I'm gonna iterate on the
wine opener so as Victor Lombardi I
guess fellow wine drinking aficionado
said if we only test bottle openers we
may never realize customers prefer a
screw top bottle at the end of a long
day at the office
dealing with clients I like that just
right off yeah but you'll never know the
larger solution you might be coming to
if you start with the solution you have
in mind you never know what bigger
problem you might be solving so you want
to make sure that you're solving the
problem in the right place not in
something that occurred to you but
really start with what people need out
there in the world so focus groups skip
right this skip right through this part
so a lot of people conflate focus groups
with qualitative research you know the
New York Times says it's all the time
and so the purpose of ethnographic
research is to understand how people
behave and make decisions in the real
world this is not the real world this is
not where I do my online shopping or
watch movies or anything else people
you know this feels official and
researchy this is really research
theater you get a handful of people
together ordinary Joe's with a moderator
and other people are behind the glass
with M&amp;amp;Ms and you know it's this whole
thing and you think oh we're doing
research and somehow that feels like
it's really hot it's really easy here to
get people to sign off on this then oh
we're just going to talk to some people
on the phone even though it's it's way
less effective because unlike interviews
or contextual inquiry and us sitting
down with people in their real-world
environments focus groups do not provide
insight into behavior or habitual
context this is totally artificial and
it just turns into a big performance you
know so focus groups evolved from the
focus group the focused group interview
which was developed by this really
awesome American sociologist Robert K
Merton and he came to deplore how they
were used because even in the best case
scenario focus groups were simply meant
to be a source of ideas that you could
then go out and research and they're
fighting they're fine for that but it's
a huge amount of resources for idea
generation but what happens is people
treat them like research because a lot
of times they're awesome it validating
or reinforcing ideas that you already
have that you want to be true so I think
for the purpose of design research focus
groups are just a giant waste of time
so everything I've talked to up to this
point has been a qualitative method so
qualitative research is descriptive and
quantitative research is measurable so
quantitative methods you know includes
split testing a/b testing multivariate
testing you you put different versions
of your interface or site in front of
people and see which one performs better
it's like going to the optometrist
you know is you know number one better
than number two and you see what
converts but what this will never tell
you is why even if you see something
performing really well on an a/b test
you you're still making a guess so you
know you won't tell you what other needs
you could be meeting optimizing
your current system will only ever get
you to that that local maximum you know
it can't tell you you know you can't a
be test your site to be to solve a
totally different set of problems which
might be the better set of problems to
solve you know there's a great blogger
and entrepreneur Andrew Chen who said
you know it's not telling you doing a/b
testing won't tell you how your system
is creating value so it's really
important like as soon as you have
something to measure by all means
measure it like you should always be
measuring but you also need to be
looking at why you know you need the how
much and the what and why you need both
so who should do research you probably
know the answer to this everyone all of
you because the goal is to develop that
strong shared understanding of reality
you know people who have a hand in
collecting the insights will look for
opportunities to apply them so if you've
seen the Pixar movie ratatouille
you've probably familiar chef gusto the
culinary guide whose book and philosophy
anyone can cook encourages that little
ready protagonist so I my dream is to
unleash a swarm of design research
Remy's designers and developers and
writers and entrepreneurs who are
motivated by a desire to create products
that are great and fantastic and serve
real human needs and can use these
time-tested tools of research to make
better decisions and recommendations and
you know this in no way obviates the
need for trained ethnographers and HCI
professionals but you know if my own
professional observations have taught me
anything it's that the whole field
benefits the more people ask more
questions and really think hard about
the answers and so you know if an
individual designer developer becomes
curious about research and wants to read
up on it they're confronted with you
know 500 page $50 books and so I'm
problem solver
yeah I made the shortest possible book
on research it's small enough
and it's weighted so you just fling it
at people's heads I recommend this you
can leave it out on your desk and people
walk by and say that's orange yeah try
that like oh it's only Joe it looks so
small pick it up because cuz I really
you know this is changing one mind at a
time because like I said research is
really really threatening to people who
you know have Authority just by virtue
of having authority or who want to do
things who don't want to be bothered and
just want to put their solution out
there in the world so to bring it back
to the Segway like like what would have
just enough research bin for them you
know if they'd simply asked what problem
do we want to solve for our target
customers that they could have stopped
there if they just honestly ask that
question but they could have also asked
what are people's current transportation
habits what do they need how far do they
have to go what's important to them how
does the Segway actually offer a better
alternative to what exists you know
maybe it's more fun than walking but you
know but this answer to what is just
enough research for you I mean it's
different for everyone it's different
for every organization it's different
for every project
it's simply doing just enough to
identify real problems to understand
your organizational capacity to
empathize with your users to assess the
competition these are all the things
that design and Technology professionals
can accomplish without a special degree
and chest a little bit of practice like
you already have the skills just ask the
right questions in the right
circumstances because the goal is to try
to be proven wrong the fastest and for
the lowest cost possible if you think
you have the right answer try to be
proven wrong even if you have just
people asking questions of you even if
you talk to users and test your
assumptions you know the best way to be
proven wrong might be to start a company
or to build a prototype but I bet there
are faster and cheaper ways even
you get there so any new product or
service is predicated on a set of
assumptions about how the world works
and how people work within that world so
instead of assumptions why not make
those observations you know the success
criteria of your product or service are
probably lower than people will
rearrange cities to accommodate it um so
I almost done here you can go get
another drink but before that I don't
want you to take my word for it I want
you to listen to this guy
hopefully the volume is up high for
those of you that don't know me my name
is Steve Jobs and this is the first of
one of many chalk talks we're gonna have
this year together the subject of this
one is really important which is who is
our target customer why are they
selecting our products over our
competitions and what distribution
channels are we going to use to reach
these customers a lot of light bulbs
have come on over the last 90 days
I've had the good fortune to be with a
lot of you out in the field meaning
customers getting first-hand information
as to what they're doing with our
products you have fed a lot of
information to the management of this
company and we've done a lot of thinking
and looked at the data and all of a
sudden out of this data some very very
important things have come to light I
want to share them with you today thank
you
question so is your question how to sell
just talking to people out there in the
field that you might find ok let me see
if I can remember what I was talking
about
sure so like um we use research user
research comm a lot and usually like the
feedback is really positive and
obviously that's like a paid research
resource but at the very end they always
we always ask him like so would you use
this product and the answer is no like
you know we always say that for the end
right so you know how can we just like
get away from paid research in industry
I think that's like a big problem you
know even for like medium-sized
companies ok so so the getting away from
paid research so I think there's a
couple things there because um I didn't
talk about it here but I think giving
people inset an incentive to participate
is is really really important for
recruiting like we often give people
like you know 25 or 50 dollars in Amazon
you can get everybody because what that
does is it gives you a pool because we
we do a lot of recruiting online and we
use a screening survey to get people who
really match the people in our target
audience but what the incentive does is
reduce bias in the pool so once you have
those people it is an issue like Oh what
happens if it isn't the person that is
getting money from me going to tell me
nice things like is that your point yeah
and and that that's an issue so the ways
you get away from that so I think it is
really important to provide an incentive
because I think that gets you a better
pool of people but then once you have
those people the way you get better
data back from them is how you frame the
study because it's really yeah we
we used to do research like on-site in
people's labs like yahoo or intuitive
these big research labs and if people
that's the reason why going on site is
bad because if people drive up and
they're like oh Yahoo's giving me a
hundred dollars and I'm going into their
scary research lab yeah like those
people are going to be I think less
likely to be really honest and
forthright and so I think it's less
about the incentive and more about you
know the way you frame the person
leading the study to say because we
often tell you like I'm not the designer
like you might even say like I hate the
designer you know but how are you
Freeman like don't don't try to buy us
than the other way but but it really is
in how you frame and ask the questions
and never ask people like if you ask
people like do you like it or would you
use it
people are gonna lie like people like
constantly so you ask you try to get it
how they actually behave so if your user
if you're testing if you're actually
doing a usability test which is
different from like a market research
survey you know you should be able to
watch them interact with something in a
real way and it's just it really is
being very careful about how you phrase
those questions so you're not asking
them for opinion like anything where it
sounds like oh I'm getting opinion I'm
not getting reported behaviors or I'm
not observing behaviors that's the stuff
you kind of want to toss out because
yeah because you can never somebody will
never accurately report whether they'd
use something I just want your thoughts
on reusing research that's already out
there done by other companies like
larger companies that have a lot of
resources and spend all this time and
send out the years of researchers to do
everything I worked for a small tech
company and I'm one of the only UX
designers I've been tasked with creating
user personas but so we discovered that
one of our competitors or main you know
partners I've already put up all the
personas online and my boss is saying to
just sort of just use them you know to
send agree and I don't know how valid
that is
I don't know how to exactly explain to
her that it's not I don't know it's just
you know she's my boss so I can't just
say that so yeah yeah so I'd say if
there's if there are research studies
that have been published out there cuz
like the Pugh project for the internet
in American life has really good studies
so there is research out there that you
can that you can use that I think is
useful to use and steal but I'd say in
the same way I'd say you can never take
somebody else's design because a lot of
people look Oh Google did this Apple too
this will just copy it
you can't take somebody's research
output and and copy that and take like
take like oh say their personas because
that would be the same thing and so I'm
trying to think of a really a good way
to defeat that argument they show that
you show the seniors raised well I think
I think that's that that's the same
issue with coming at the competitor from
who you think your competitor is like
you don't know that like that's from
your perspective but you'd have to talk
to those people to find out if they see
you in the same light well well if it is
if it is actually that much the same
then I think it might be a good exercise
like what you could do is just take
those personas and not take them
wholesale but really talk through them
and say like how do we know these are
the same how are they different and talk
about maybe maybe to a certain extent
you can use those because yes I'm I'm a
I'm a pragmatist and if that actually
helps get certain conversation started
I'm not gonna say like that's you know
definitely wrong like if they are
similar users then they might be a good
starting place but just use them as a
starting place to start the discussion
everybody give it up for Erica
