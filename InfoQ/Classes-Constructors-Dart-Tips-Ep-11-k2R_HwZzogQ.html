this episode of dart tips today we
talked about constructors fun fact you
can build a constructor in dart that
controls which object instance is
returned there's lots of cool features
with constructors and darts so let's get
started
constructors are responsible for
building and returning an instance of a
class let's start by looking at the
constructors everyone is familiar with
what we call generative constructors
here's an example not a lot of surprises
here the name of the constructor matches
the name of the class but whoa there's a
lot of repetition the word name is
repeated three times in the constructor
alone surely we can do better and indeed
we can check this out if the
Constructors arguments name is the same
as a field you could prepend the
argument with this dot this is just
syntactic sugar for the longer form this
lot name equals name and this not
fluffiness equals fluffiness less typing
is always a good thing use the new
keyword to create a new instance of a
class here's an example of calling
constructor with arguments a new
instance of fluffy bunny is created with
both name and fluffiness set of course
the last parameter is 0.72 isn't exactly
obvious luckily constructors can use
optional parameters just like functions
and methods here's an example now it's a
bit easier to read and understand that
last parameter if your class does not
explicitly define a constructor a
default constructor is provided for you
here's an example of a point class with
two fields and no explicit constructor
the default constructor has zero
arguments and invokes
the no argument constructor of its
superclass I now want to show you one of
my favorite features of dart named
constructors first some background in
traditionally statically typed languages
you can overload methods by the types of
parameters passed to those methods
because dart is optionally typed you
can't overload methods based on type
which isn't a big deal because you can
just create differently named methods
traditionally though you were stuck with
a single name for the constructor the
name of the class often had to match the
name of the constructor and thus you
wouldn't have been able to create
multiple constructors the designers of
the dart language realised this and
introduced named constructors as a way
to allow you to define multiple
different constructors for a class
here's an example of named constructors
at work
notice how the new keyword is still used
I really like named constructors because
they provide
easy-to-read call sight and they clearly
state their intention in this case both
constructors take a string and it's
obvious how the strings will be used one
nice feature of the dart language is
that all final fields are fully
initialized before the this handle is
available in other words final fields
must be set before the constructor body
is rung to calculate and set the value
of final field you can use an
initializer list here's an example the
initializers after the : are the
initializer list the this handle is not
available in the initializer list
because at this point the object is not
yet created here point is immutable
because all fields are final setting X&amp;amp;Y
is straightforward the distance from
origin field must be calculated but it
is final so we can't calculate it and
set it in the constructor body because
this isn't available in the initializer
list you can't call instance methods in
the initializer list however a top-level
functions like square root shown here
and static methods are okay to use
speaking of initializer list we can now
talk about calling superclass
constructors as you can see here you can
place the call to the super classes
constructor in the initializer list it's
important to understand that all field
initializes are run before constructor
bodies are run this means that the
constructor body of the superclass
isn't run until all fields from both the
subclass and the superclass are
initialized we recommend that you place
the call to the super constructor at the
end of the initializer list to make the
order more clear if you don't explicitly
call a super constructor a constructor
will call the default no our constructor
of its superclass in this case when you
create a new fluffy bunny you'll see in
bunny and then in fluffy if the
superclass does not have a default no
our constructor you will need to
explicitly call a constructor from the
superclass we've so far seen many
examples what we call generative
constructors these traditional
constructors create a new instance of
the surrounding class and return it
while familiar generative constructors
are a bit limiting modular composable
software applications require more
flexible ways to build and return
objects and entire Suites of design
patterns have popped up to compensate
for traditional constructor shortcomings
one popular pattern is the factory
pattern with examples in many frameworks
or toolkits
however without native language support
for the factory pattern most
implementations have to implement it
with combinations of static methods
and/or utility classes while this works
it exposes the
pattern to the consumers of the code
luckily the designers of Dart added the
factory pattern right into the language
with darts factory constructors you can
natively use the factory pattern and
make it appear like a regular
constructor one great use case for
factory constructors is to return
objects from a cache here's the code
notice that the constructor is declared
as a factory constructor inside the
constructor body the cache is checked
and if the symbol exists it is returned
else a new symbol is created added to
the cache and then returned using this
class is easy because there's no special
syntax to use a factory constructor get
a new instance with new both X and also
X point to the same object so they are
identical because the user of the class
doesn't know the constructor is really a
factory the original author of the code
is free to refactor regular constructors
into factory constructors without
forcing clients to change their code in
other words start with the generative
constructor and if you later change to a
factory constructor no one needs to know
here's another cool fact about factory
constructors they can even return
instances that are subclasses of the
surrounding class what other
constructors can control what type of
object is returned I think that is very
cool so remember kids while dart might
look like your friendly neighborhood
structured language it has productive
features like terse field initialization
