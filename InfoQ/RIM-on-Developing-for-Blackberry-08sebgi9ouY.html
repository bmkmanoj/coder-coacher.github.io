blackberry app world and intelligence
systems I'll tell you what that means
and so as Carl said how many people have
used a blackberry before right nearly
everybody well we're coming back and I'm
going to talk about how we're coming
back and we've got our presentation on
our tablet here controlled by my
blackberry's one aspect of how we
integrate our different devices I'm
going to talk about the transition to
bb10 which is our new platform for the
blackberry service I'll also talk about
know where BlackBerry's at you know what
are the monetization opportunities what
why you should even care and and the
exciting things that are coming later on
in the year we will talk about
specifically html5 we're making heavy
investments in html5 and then also if
you've got html5 apps how you actually
get them onto the storefront and
actually generating dollars so the main
thing is we are in a transition period
in transitioning to the bb10 platform
that's going to be announced in a number
of different ways next week in Orlando
where we have our blackberry world
conference and that conference for the
first time we'll be providing actual
alpha developer hardware to developers
to actually develop their apps on and
practice running their apps on these
won't be the production devices but
either the devices that we use
internally to test our own applications
to give developers a head start on
actually getting their applications on
the new platform so that's that next
week and their prizes and things there's
still time to register
and that's in Orlando so we're a week
early there's still a lot of things I
can tell you about the platform and but
the major announcements coming next week
so we've been working on blackberry 10
for about a year and a half now and
we've been finding the building blocks
to make a superlative operating system
and platform the first building block is
Q in X which is a real-time multitasking
operating system it's used in many many
different applications from space
vehicles nuclear power stations and it
gives us a highly scalable environment
for running applications in the multi
tasking format we may be able to show
some demos later on the next one is t
ATS call the astonishing tribe this in
that position in Sweden that allows us
to give really rich fluid user interface
frameworks for for our developers that
gives us a much more sparkling interface
and the final one which is relevant to
this session here is torch Mobile which
is a browser company which has really
upgraded our browser experience if you
look at even that's shipping in the
current BlackBerry's which has pinch and
zoom and we talked about full html5
compatibility and there's a number of
very large number of other applet
acquisitions we've made distant Unger in
the pim space schoolloop is in the
virtual currency game space JK is in the
video editing space database visas in
the word document reading space I myself
came through an acquisition cell mania
which bill app store infrastructure was
about a year ago or so and the current
apps app application delivery
infrastructure on the current
BlackBerry's is powered by cell mania
and we'll be delivering new and new set
of infrastructure for the new blackberry
10 environment later on you beat X is
also for multi-platform mobile device
management so that works not just with
blackberry devices but also Android
devices iphone devices as well so let's
get to basics first why blackberry in
the first place and we see a lot of
articles in the press not being overly
positive on why you should get to use
blackberry or developer blackberry but
actually we have no debt we still make
hundreds of millions of dollars of
profit every quarter we have 77 million
smartphone subscribers out there we've
connected to 650 carriers the market
smartphone market overall is expanding
its such a wide rate despite the fact
that we've lost some market share in the
u.s. we're still in the top 14 100
growing companies another aspects unique
about blackberry is the BBM service
blackberry messenger for those of you
who haven't used blackberry messenger
service an IM service and it's got a
couple of unique things one is you can
send a message but unlike normal i am
message you know when the the PERT the
message has actually been delivered and
you know whether the other person has
read it so that usually results in a
quicker response time because they know
that you know that they've read it and
so that results in a quicker response
time we're still growing developers on a
rapid base there are 75 thousand apps in
our storefront we've had two billion
downloads plus two and a half billion
dollars the latest number 180 million
downloads a month so in pure install
base we we hold our own the other aspect
where we we have an advantage over the
competition is
a billing carry buildings very important
for two things one is the carry
alignment story are you in support of
the carriers or you trying to go over
the top of them second in a lot of
markets people don't have credit cards
and or even in marks where you do have
credit cards it's very difficult to
actually enter the credit card
information into it into a device so
essentially a large portion the market
is prepaid and so we've made a major
investment on carrier billing we'll talk
about that a bit more so just in the
last quarter we're still growing very
very rapidly the increase in number ups
increases by twenty percent
quarter-over-quarter the playbook which
is the precursor to blackberry 10 which
is our tablet device which I'm running
this presentation from is generating a
big increase in applications the
application qualities increasing much
more vendors registering to be
developers on the blackberry platform
that's worldwide and again big advantage
is connecting to the BBM service which
increases virality and distribution of
your applications so some sort of myths
that people talk about and I think apple
just announced 600,000 apps so we're
only at 75,000 apps one of the things
that leads to though is discoverability
issues and so we actually find that
developers know in surveys that have
been done actually can make more money
and get more downloads on a blackberry
platform then can they can get on the on
the other platform purely because the
discovery flow is is easier on the
blackberry platform and the other thing
is that we also generate more money than
the more money as well as more downloads
versus Android and iOS applications
so the other thing is like these
pictures not showing up but the thing
about the numbers 500,000 apps you hear
from Android platform 600,000 apps on
the on the iOS platform when we've done
surveys and people have done surveys or
what are those apps actually mean on
iphone that 900 solitaire apps is 1200
solitaire apps on Android when you
actually count numbers remove the
duplicates no we're really looking at 30
to 50,000 apps and we have duplicates
too definitely we have duplicates as
well but the actual count that you need
we believe once you get past the top 100
apps the top 10 apps so pretty much the
same across all the platforms that we
have Angry Birds they have Angry Birds
we have angry birds space though vendre
birds bait with a vm we have pandora we
have facebook we have four square now
once you get past those apps the nut
actual quantity of apps is the order of
50 thousands of people actually need and
look at now having said that we need
apps we need more apps and html5 is one
of the ways to get to it so here's where
our strategy on platforms are coming is
coming across we have taken an approach
to say to developers whatever tool
you're comfortable with you can work on
our platform we have the wider set of
platform tool sets that you can use than
any other platform so we can run flash
we can run air we have an Android
runtime so you can put kaput most of
your Android apps running on our
platform but where we're making our
investments in is in html5 and native
html5 we think gives us the quickest
fastest way to develop applications the
lowest cost the tool sets are readily
available
costs are a low or free that you can use
and you can also so we're putting a
heavy investment on innovating on the
html5 framework that's not to say we're
not enabling other frameworks so the
number of frameworks like unity
marmalade which we're enabling on our
platform that allows us to get
applications quickly on our on our new
platform so this is not your father's
blackberry a new black people at forum
it's going been a deliberate investment
to reduce the cost of getting apps onto
onto the system and one thing just to
come this sort of dotted line the html5
we have a legacy installed base of
devices that run Java but they also run
html5 and blackberry we brand our html5
framework as web works html5 web works
and so by doing html5 one has access to
the existing install base of devices
from blackberry OS 5.0 and above but
also to the new platform as well so
that's a big advantage on the 18 45
framework our native Android flash
typically what flash will work on on the
BB OS devices but typically the they
will not work on the legacy they will
work on future platform so no depending
who you are what kind of application
you're making you're going to choose the
appropriate tool set and the a lot of
developers who've got android apps we've
structured it so if you have an Android
app then that is compatible with our
Android runtime then it's a simple
Packaging people definitely taking no
less than an hour they can upload their
application and start selling on our
platform that's the low-cost way of
getting bored flash there's no we have a
license to adobe's flash that enables
flash applications and a similar way
applications are wrapped in to create
bar files that are uploaded into the
store phone that can be sold native is
typically for intensive gaming purposes
we've targeted a number of high
computationally intensive applications
that are typically around the gaming
area for bb10 and html5 again as I said
the main thing is compatible with the
existing store base and the new platform
as well so let's talk about html5 web
works so that's up as I said our brand
name for our variant of our framework
for html5 and again I think you've had
other presentations today talks about
this debate between native and web
experiences we believe that users really
don't care whether it's web or an
applique they're expecting an icon and
they're expecting to be able to install
the application so from the user point
of view it's transparent weather its
nature more 5 application or whether
it's a native application or an Android
application and so there are other
advantages of that is packaged as an
application it can take advantage of the
billing systems that we already have in
the store fronts and I was working on
storefronts 10 years ago looking at the
history of mobile when we started off
with websites and went over java sites
and mobile websites certainly one of the
issues of mobile web and where was it
was sometimes somewhat difficult to do
the billing and in the rim framework
essentially you're creating application
then you use the normal billing systems
that we have in our storefront so what
are we when I wear how is our html5
framework driven and we using the WebKit
engine so it was highly compatible with
a number of existing applications we are
typically in the top one or two or three
positions in compatibility you can go to
html5 test com I was just doing that
just before I came here and we were we
were number two sometimes with number
one it goes up and down but we there's a
curve that shows the rate of
compatibility improvement and our out
we're at the highest rate of improvement
and so we are making a fairly heavy
investment to ensure that we have all
the elements latest elements of html5 in
a framework we also have enabled a
number of the other frameworks as well
phonegap now in boa called / etc and
provides support on for the for those
frameworks as well so a number of other
things that we've done that a new about
different about our with html5
implementation certainly know we have
sort of we have location sockets we have
a fairly deep implementation of
WebSockets what means you can have a
persistent connection useful fact
multiplayer gaming you can also do
remote control kind of applications we
were playing around with one of the
developers outside on that graphics we
have a canvas objects web workers we can
have multiple multiprocessing different
threads on different experiences so you
can sample you could have a thread
working on the you
interface and another thread on the
calculations that one might need to do
for a particular application we have one
of the you know Larry's over here I
think but correct me if I'm wrong with
the most advanced WebGL implementation
on mobile out there which very very rich
allow you to do very very rich graphics
way ahead of our competitors in that
area yeah so tunnel till we might have a
demonstration later on on that so if we
go so show some application go use the
WebGL as they will use enable all the
other frameworks touching every
frameworks that you can use over using
those frameworks already you can create
applications for our platform a number
of applications are already on the
platform some of the applications if you
already have a web content different
people have implemented different ways
but typically it's easier to render to
different screen sizes using html5 some
of the applications try and keep it
similar to their other HTML properties
others try and change it to use some of
the advantages of the actual device
itself so let's talk about how do you
actually talk about getting those
advantages so you start off with york
the toolset you prefer right so either
it's a framework HTML html5 JavaScript
and what we have is a platform which we
call web work so you might hear this
phrase called web works it's basically
html5 and it's a set of tools that are
powered by the native capabilities where
we have any developer we've developed
some extensions that wrap capabilities
of our
handset so there's an example the camera
where you can access the camera drop it
in one line and you can start using the
camera in your applications now we've
done a fairly large number of those but
a large number of developers have done
those as well created their own
extensions either for themselves or for
putting them in a repository on github
so we have a repo on github where people
have created extensions for the
blackberry framework one of the
acquisitions we made not too long ago
maybe nine months ago was company called
tiny hippos and they have an application
called a ripple and what ripple is is an
emulator for actually testing out the
result in html5 applications on a on an
emulation you can test these things on
there on the web of course but you won't
get the emulations of the actual device
specific extensions and that's what
ripple is for and the whole idea is to
try and basically get to a position
where you can actually develop on ripple
develop on your desktop and reduce the
time that you need to reduce the time
that you need to actually go on the
device that's what takes development
time from putting the code between your
desktop and your device and back and
forth again and spend more of your time
actually in the in the emulation mode we
also have web inspector what can work on
it so this is like sometimes new to web
developers but pretty important to
optimize the applications for optimum
battery life memory etc etc so how do
you get started and how do we make money
all of these tools available on the
blackberry website and most of the you
can actually just start using no
registration required and just start
developing immediately the tools you
need to get on this site and the point
you need to register is when you need to
actually get the application on the
device so that might be for debug modes
where you need to get your application
signed again you can get a signing token
and the second part is when you actually
want to deliver the application for sale
on the store from where you have to
click through a vendor agreement in all
cases it's free no costs to get the
signing tokens no cost to sell your
application the current revenue share
for applications on the blackberry
platform is seventy percent and we have
a number of monetization vehicles to go
through so and we make money essentially
it's a exercise and optimization right
across the supply chain and unlike
perhaps some of our competitors we
actually have people we have teams of
people will actually interact with
developers and work with you to actually
optimize your chances of your
application getting featured it's in our
interest to help you that when
developers make money we make money we
help we strengthen our platform and just
as a reminder the install base is
sufficient to make it profitable the
main monetization methods are either
billing or advertising for advertising
we have our own advertising SDK
components that you can use but you can
use other people's we don't prevent
prevent that and for billing we have
numerous billing methods credit card
paypal and carrier billing carrier
billing we're in 40 carriers we were
integrated with and the final part is as
I said before is utilizing the share
framework and running your extensions
for the share framework to use the BBM
viral distribution system so if you are
going to do an appt know what do should
you what sort of talk about the install
base and the new platform that's coming
out know how should you get your
application optimized for the various
devices now the interesting thing with
html5 you can address nearly all of the
blackberry install base and the future
base in one shot so if you look at these
charts here most of the both for free
and download is through three free and
pay is through blackberry 5 and above
and the PlayBook so if you look at the
playbook for paid apps it's already like
you know even though it's a relatively
small part of our install base it's
nearly a quarter of our sales and that's
an indication of what's coming down the
pike is you know the blackberry platform
will be a true smartphone platform and
when it's viewed as that it will get
smartphone level downloads and sales and
we're seeing that the first indicator is
the playbook which uses the QNX platform
as an indicator to the device strength
that's coming out this year so that is
the way to think about the installed
base the advantage to html5 you can
actually get it on a on a legacy and
future platforms we talked about
different billing a carrier billing is
very important you don't have to do
anything for carrier billing that's all
done by the storefront and it typically
can increase you know two three or four
X improvement I've seen as high as 10 X
but no a corporate messaging says
between 100 and three hundred percent
but the main reason is people if you put
credit card or PayPal you then have to
go through a set of flows to put your
credentials in your credit
numbers and your IDs and all cetera et
cetera if you just do bill three
carriers just click right that's if
you're in a developed country if you're
in a undeveloped country if in an
emerging market you may not even have
these options a lot of the users won't
physically won't have the credit cards
you also get the benefits of the other
billing systems we have subscription
billing in-app billing in that payments
that are available for the for the store
from we've talked about BBM connected
which is basically again putting
features in the application that
leverage the BBM virality at the
simplest level is just tell a friend
more interesting levels are basically
being able to show no change the avatar
or the icon for your BBM kind of like
the Foursquare thing you know where you
are checking to show that other people
what you're doing well you're doing
other things is like integrating with
other we have very strong pim capability
contacts calendar messaging AP is where
you can have extremely deep integration
for those kinds of things so for example
you can actually put things in the inbox
without actually doing that at the
server level the application can put
things in your inbox and to the user it
looks like it's button emails being said
but actually it's just gone through gone
through an application ingestion system
so the final thing is you know how you
get featured and we all know that we
have you know the main way to get
downloads is to get get featured on the
carousel because there's only so much
real estate on the screen and we will
know up we have teams of people who will
talk to developers to figure out you
know how to change your application how
to get the right images how
to actually monetize the replication
almost business consulting type activity
to get your application monetized and no
storefronts available in 140 odd
countries and so there's ample room to
get promoted in one of those countries
or many of those countries we have
different store fronts for different
countries different carriers different
handsets so we have many many
promotional slots so you might think
well there's only so many slots out
there there are only but we have a
deliberate policy to give developers a
chance to to get get get an application
promoted there's a nomination process
you can nominate yourself and one else
can nominate you sending an email or and
as once you're in the developer zone
system there's interaction with our
personnel so now we're getting to the
end here we are involved on the in the
html5 side we're involved in the
community if you get as a github
repository with lots of sample code ap
is that we can we can provide we're also
looking we also open source web works so
one can actually make use of it on a
wider basis and we look at this as I
ecosystem effort the more extensions
that are done the more people can
develop on our platform and actually
monetize on our platform and again we
have an objective to increase ecosystem
revenue as opposed to blackberry revenue
from the the app ecosystem we know that
if we we know that we need to have
applications to make a strong ecosystem
so there's some resources I think both
these are on our on our website no costs
no sign ups to get started as only when
you want to put it on a handset that you
need to register and finally just as a
reminder
we have our conference next week and
you'll see a lot more even if you can't
get to the conference you should be able
to see a lot of news in the press about
our new devices and new plans around a
black v 10 platform so watch out for
that bit for that next week
