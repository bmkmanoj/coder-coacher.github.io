this episode of dart tips today we
continue our tour the fundamentals of
functions by looking at functions as
objects nested functions functions as
arguments and lexical closures get ready
for more functional tips about functions
in Dart right now let's get started
dart is a true object-oriented language
so even functions are objects
this means functions can be assigned to
variables passed as arguments to other
functions and more to start check this
out
function is defined in the core library
as an abstract class this means there is
a function type and a function value is
a subtype of the function class just
like you can assign objects of variables
here's an example of assigning a
function object to a variable notice how
you can call the Lao defi variable just
like a normal function you can also
assign an anonymous function directly to
a variable like this you might use this
technique if you want to retain a handle
on the function so that for example you
can add or remove it from some
collection now that you know you can
treat functions as objects you can start
to do some even more fun things here's
an example of filtering a list of
numbers down to only even numbers and
then printing them all out this works
because for each wants to be passed the
single function that takes a single
argument print just so happens to be a
function that takes a single argument
tada
building on this example let's say you
need to filter on a complicated
condition you could write the code this
way but yuck that's a big complicated
chunk of code in the middle of an
otherwise pretty line
surely we can do better thanks to dart
support for nested function yes we can
here's an example
much better notice how we can create a
new named function inside of main which
itself is a function the complicated
check function is a nested function the
where for each chain is now much easier
to read you can define your own
functions that take functions as
parameters here's an example notice how
the second parameter is annotated as the
type function this code works but it
doesn't tell you much about what the
filter function should expect in terms
of arguments or what it should return
all we know is that it's a function we
generally recommend that you use type
annotations for the functions you expect
as arguments here's an example notice
how in this example it's clear that
filter should return
and should take a single parameter
ideally of type int now with this extra
type information tools like dart editor
can give better warnings if you try to
pass in a filter that doesn't match the
description before we tackle our last
topic let's review darts scoping rules
dart is a lexically scoped language
which means that's a scope of variables
that's determined statically simply by
the layout of the code I like to think
of lexical scope as follow the curly
braces outwards here's an example of
nested functions with variables at each
scope level notice how nested function
can access variables at every level all
the way up to the top level darts
scoping rules are very easy to reason
about it's very much what you see is
what you get darts lexical scope even
works with this but we'll cover that in
an episode about classes now that we've
looked at lexical scope let's take a
look at functions as closures a closure
is a function object that is access to
variables in its lexical scope even when
the function is use outside of its
original scope closures are popular in
other scripting languages like
JavaScript and dart is no stranger to
lexical closures here's an example of a
function that closes around its variable
notice how make adder has a nested
function named adder that adds two
numbers make adders parameter advi-- is
lexically visible to adder then make
adder returns the function object adder
which at that moment creates a closure
so far so good let's ease make adder to
create a new adder in this case the
function add to calling add to function
with 1 returns you guessed it 3 this is
a lexical closures in action because add
two closes around add by whose value was
originally passed to make adder to
really drill this point home notice how
you can create more adders with make
adder each one not affected by the other
here's an example of making an adder
that adds 100 notice how add 100 is
independent of add to dart support for
lexical scope and lexical closures
really helps you compose your functions
and apps the better the composure
encapsulation and reusability the better
the code thanks for watching this
