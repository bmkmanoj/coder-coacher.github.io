or security the designated security
person in your organization okay and how
many of you are cryptographers
cryptographic engineers can spell aes
okay so what we're going to talk about
today is a little bit esoteric it's not
specifically related to Android it's
something I worked on for six years and
it's kind of an interesting side Avenue
into security basically what happens is
we'll talk about kind of what the
background is some very basic things
about cryptography how to encrypt data
in a way that's secure I won't be able
to do the demonstration tonight and then
I have some additional information about
how to misuse cryptography in a way that
looks perfectly reasonable so this is
probably very familiar to you the
concept is you have that's useless
you have something you want to protect
inside the red box is your protected
area you have some important information
that you're going to convert into a
ciphertext so that you can export it to
the rest of the world without worrying
about whether or not the channel you're
sending it over is protected so when you
send your credit card information ssl
I'm sure you're all very familiar with
this and there's this side channel that
can happen so because cryptography has
to run on hardware eventually and
because hardware uses electricity and
because transistors use different
amounts of power depending upon the data
that they're operating on you will have
leakages the question is how do we
control those leakages in a way that
doesn't give the adversary enough
information to extract the secret key or
the secret information we're trying to
protect
so when you have a side channel attack
and you've got a strong cryptographic
algorithm like AES or RSA or similar
algorithm and you've done your
implementation correctly you haven't
made any mistakes in the way that you
use the crypto you can still have
leakages so this was discovered early
and often in the smart card industry
where you've got a small embedded
microprocessor in the early days these
things were literally 8-bit
microprocessors like a pic microchip and
you could literally defeat the security
on these things and turn them into money
how many people have ever looked at the
internals of AES okay so before I
started looking at this years ago I
thought wow these crypto circuits these
scripter algorithms are really complex
it turns out that the math is pretty
complex but they can be broken down and
implemented in a way that's very
straightforward AES was designed so that
it could be implemented on an 8-bit
microprocessor and still have reasonable
throughput now no you're not going to
encrypt the library of congress on a-z
80 and get any kind of a reasonable
response but you can encrypt a few
packets at a time and you can do some
very reasonable things with a very
lightweight microprocessor
at the same time with a with an x86
processor you can get tens of megabytes
of data per second without really
putting that heavy the load on the CPU
so the way that the implementation works
is you've got an overall black box the
black box is made up of steps called
rounds each round has steps inside of it
each one of those individual steps is
very simple very straightforward and if
you're given the input and the output
you can easily figure out what goes on
in between but when you put all of the
steps together and all the rounds
together you have a secure function so
what a side channel lets you do is to
break apart the security of the whole
and look at individual sub steps within
individual rounds and if you can do that
then the security of the system is
basically broken so to give you some
background on eight yes it's a symmetric
cipher what that means is if I want to
exchange a key with you that has to be
done over secure channel so i have to
hand you a piece of paper or i have to
have someone deliver it to you or over
some kind of trust connection this isn't
going to work real well for e-commerce
but it works pretty well when you want
to encrypt something store it away like
on a hard drive and then recover it
later on and it also works well in a
situation where you want to encrypt a
large set of data and give it to someone
that is only going to be able to decrypt
it when you provide them with the key
later on
it has some options about the size and
the number of rounds and there's some
things you need to know about eight yes
if you use the raw AES mode as it is you
can get yourself in a lot of trouble
very quickly the key to it is not to
just take the building block and plug it
onto your system but to combine it with
other steps in the right way so that
when you're done the system from end to
end is secure and protected and there's
a lot of information here there's a lot
to understand the Wikipedia page is
actually almost completely accurate and
gives a very nice explanation of how it
works just to give you some ideas about
what we're looking out this sub bytes
step so these are the steps within a
round so you're going to go around the
circle ten times this is an 8-bit look
up so there's basically a 256 byte array
and you just do a one character at a
time look up byte for byte
this one stores 16 bytes of the state
and then you just shift Rose a certain
number of characters so it's essentially
a memory move or in Hardware it's just
changing wires oh I'm sorry I put that
one in twice this one is this one is a
little bit more interesting mathematical
function it mixes up the data and
provides a nonlinear characteristic and
then this one is just an XOR function
it's a byte by byte XOR function so I
mean anyone in the room not know how to
implement an XOR right so the point is
when you break it down into the
individual steps each individual step is
very easy to implement and by the way
how many people think that using an XOR
with the secret key makes a good secret
cipher right so in and of itself it's
pretty bad but when you combine it with
the other steps in the right way you get
yourself a very strong solution RSA
diffie-hellman a lot of other solutions
use a public key private key to get over
the problem we talked about later which
is the issue that if I want to exchange
something with you I don't necessarily
want to have to exchange the keys in the
secret environment I don't want to have
to drive to your house and give you the
key before we can communicate safely by
the way depending upon how you paranoid
you are you shouldn't give somebody a
secret key over the phone
so you can actually put your secret key
on a key server and I'm sure everybody's
done this at some point other people can
download it and then they can decrypt it
securely so as long as you know that
that key goes with that person then you
can download their public key decrypt
the data and you've safely communicated
information now one thing to be careful
about is you have to be sure that their
public key belongs to the person you
think it does there's a thing called an
SSL man-in-the-middle attack that
basically substitutes an independent
public key for the one that you think
you're getting decrypts your data and
then re encrypts it with the with the
other ends key so you have to watch out
for things like that so this is a slide
that shows what happens when you do a
cryptographic operation on an 8-bit
microprocessor on a smart card and you
say well why do I care about this I'm
using Android it's a 32-bit
microprocessor well this shows it a
little bit more clearly but as i'm going
to show you later on even on an android
phone or an iOS phone you're still going
to get a certain amount of leakage so
there's some interesting things here
you can see that the power consumption
is at a low level here during the input
phase something happens in the middle
there's an output bump here that takes
place some more input and then the
cryptographic operation ends here but
wait there's more you also get the
eeprom so the eeprom right takes a
considerable amount of information and
by looking at this you know whether or
not you're writing zeros or ones so if
the security of your system depends upon
not being able not being able to detect
what's being written in the eeprom in
this case you've already got a leak okay
so the question is yeah there's a
difference here yeah there's a
difference between a zero and one and
how do I know if it's a zero or how do I
know if it's a one so a standard process
is to get an example of the device and
then do some tests on it and watch it
and then you sort of learn how it
operates and it tells you what the
signature is and gives you some feeling
about how the thing operates so you may
know from I'll get right to you you may
know from having bought a pic let's say
that you know that the smart card is
implemented using a pic microchip or
maybe you can even get access to the
card by the way sim cards have the same
vulnerabilities they're basically the
same technology so you get ahold of them
as a developer get some samples run your
own code on it and then watch it operate
the other thing is if this is a secret
and it goes like this when it's a one
and that one it's a zero or if it's just
the opposite how many times do you have
to try
right if you know for sure that every
one of these bits is either a one or a
zero and you only have to try twice
that's not very secure okay so there's
two questions the first question is
sounds like I have to have physical
proximity like I have to physically have
the device in my hands you have to be at
least in the same room as the device and
I'll explain more about that later the
second question is what about these e
problems that are advertised as secure a
lot of it depends upon what you mean by
secure a lot of times when they say
secure what they mean is
cryptographically secure unless they say
explicitly power analysis or DPA or SB a
secure than they're probably not they're
probably not experience indicates that
most cryptographic devices unless they
are specifically designed to prevent
this kind of an attack are vulnerable to
it
so the question is could the battery
management system so the onboard power
measurement system be used in order to
exploit this kind of an attack maybe but
probably not and the reason why I say
that is because the clock speed is
typically too slow usually the clock
speed on those things is measured in
kilohertz and to do this kind of an
attack you you typically want to have a
sampling rate about ten times the speed
of the CPU clock cycle although that's
not always the case either turns out
sometimes one system I worked on we
actually were had to filter out
everything that was greater than ten
percent of the CPUs clock speed so it
was a cpu running at I think 10
megahertz and we got our best signal
when we filtered everything above 100
kilohertz okay so the question is how
what's the scale of this graph so this
device is a this particular device is an
8-bit microprocessor it's running just
over three megahertz and the sample rate
I think the sample rate is something
like 100 megahertz but you could
probably get away with about a flirty
megahertz sampling like a USB sampling
scope
I'll get to that one that's a good
question the question is can this be
done is this being done wirelessly this
one is a wired attack so what's
happening here is there's a maybe I
should just go on to the next slide
there's a cryptographic device smart
card if we put it in a fixture and we
put a resistor in line with the power
supply like a 10 ohm resistor and then
we put an oscilloscope across the
resistor so what we're measuring here is
the instantaneous power consumption
through the power supply wire in theory
you could do the same thing by
intercepting the battery in your Android
phone but there's actually a much more
interesting attack which I'll show in a
little bit
so this is an example of a wired attack
again also on a microprocessor edge and
you can see that there's some
information here there's some peaks here
some smaller Peaks here some valleys and
here's the implementation so the way
that this RSA decode works is it goes
through every bit in the key and for
every bit it does a square and this is a
in this case it's a 1024 bit square and
then if the current bit is a 1 it also
does and multiply so it turns out that
squares and multiplies take different
amounts of power on this on this system
and in a lot of implementations they do
it turns out that in the Android
implementation that's also the case they
basically used an implementation very
similar to this so that's kind of an
epic fail for the standard library so
what happens is you walk through this
and you look for what sorry you look for
an operation that takes a different
amount of power whether it's a one or
zero and so you see that if there's a
square followed by a multiply that's a
one bit and if it's a square followed by
a square that's a zero bit so you just
read out the bits and this takes one
operation so essentially in the time it
takes to do one RSA decrypt you have the
entire 1024-bit secret key
this is something else that's a little
bit interesting too you've got squares
and multiplies so you have a platform
that's done the operation it's a little
bit harder to tell based on the height
difference whether you're looking at a
square or multiply but it turns out in
this loop this if statement doesn't take
zero time also this loop return
statement doesn't take zero time right
so there's some there's some time
difference whether or not this then part
gets executed or not even if the squares
and the multiplies take identical
amounts of time there's going to be a
different gap I'll be right with you so
if you look at the difference of this
gap square multiplied square square
there's the difference that's enough to
tell you turns out you can write a
Python script and extract the secret key
automatically yes ma'am
so the question is your given this set
of data and you're just looking at it
and it's just kind of a jumble of
information you don't really know how to
extract the key so it turns out there
spend quite a bit of information
published on this and part of what
happens is you train yourself you look
at devices and you you start to develop
a set of patterns you say well if I see
this kind of thing where I've got for
example in aes if you're looking at a
power trace and you see some random
stuff and then you see an operation that
has ten peaks in it and then you see a
bunch of random stuff or maybe you see
some low level 10 high peaks and then
some low-level power consumption and you
happen to know that the things using
aes-128 which is 128-bit key which has
10 rounds that's a pretty good clue that
you're looking at the AES operation so
let's take a quick look at that one and
see what's happening and that also tells
you where the beginning in the end darn
the other thing you can do is get
examples of the device and there's an
actually a type of side channel analysis
called correlation power analysis where
what people will do is get a device
that's as close to identical is the one
that they're attacking but they'll
modify it or somehow tweak it so that
they can insert their own key and then
what they do is they just take the power
trace of the device under attack and
they take the power trace of the one
that they're using to compare it and
they'll just keep tweaking the key bit
by bit until they get an exact match and
when you've got a match and you've got
one hundred percent correlation then
you've got the key so that's another
trick in the back but a lot of it is
sort of experimenting seeing devices
that are similar training the operator
and there's been some very interesting
research done lately about how to
automatically
based just on the data and the type of
cipher you're looking at without any
human intervention just go through and
figure out what's the right way to
attack the device
so in the previous slide what we saw was
you've got a device it's got a fairly
gross power leakage that basically means
that the designer act either wasn't
thinking about side-channel attacks or
just made a terrible goof it's possible
if you take a statistical samples that
when you're looking for the value of a
specific bid or a specific byte at a
certain place that it's going to be
impossible to just eyeball it and say
well that's a one and that's a zero like
if you look at these power traces and
you're trying to figure out which one
it's not going to be very easy to just
figure out by eyeballing it but if you
put together a statistical method where
you take the sum of the where you
partition the data
take the set of measurements record the
data itself and then record it along
with the cipher text or the plaintext so
the way this works is you have like an
encryption engine you put in some some
text to be encrypted or decrypt it and
you store that off in your server and
then you measure the power that was used
along with that encrypted data use you
read that from your data collection
device which could be a digitizing
oscilloscope or something similar and
store that on the server and correlate
the two then after the fact you figure
out some way to partition the data sets
so you figure out you're basically
looking for an Oracle I want to say well
if I could ask this question is this bit
in this part of the crypto 1 or 0 at
this moment in time it's pretty simple
question if you can ask that question
and get a yes/no answer that's your
partition
so a for example is in certain
implementations of AES it's done eight
bits at a time if I can ask well is this
bit is is this bite this value or not
and I get some blip in the in the
waveform when it is and I get nothing
when it isn't well then I've got myself
a very effective attack so let's i think
i'm going to skip that example because
i'm losing you so here's an example of
one that was done in hardware we took an
FPGA there was some bookkeeping and
overhead that i'll let us put in
transactions we were able to put in
twenty thousand transactions in a short
period of time there's 128-bit aes
implementation in this FPGA so we were
able to generate some random data load
the data ask for the device to decrypt
the data store off the power consumption
basically the oscilloscope traces
partition the data into yes no sets and
extract the secret key in about a minute
and 50 seconds so we're able to extract
a 22 128-bit key basically 128-bit key
which should take 2 2 128 brute force
operations and we're able to get the
answer within two minutes
um
small value 1 ohm resistor is used in
line and then you have caps here
you can see even in a hardware
implementation details about the
implementation so this is a tes 128 10
rounds and you can see that there's some
decoupling capacitors on the board so
this is what it looks like this is
basically an uncorrelated guess and we
said in this case
is the value of a particular bite at
this location one the answer is no in
this case the answer is yes it took
about 32,000 encryptions to get enough
data to get that clear of an answer so
again what does this have to do with
android one of the things that we did
was we took an iphone pointed in antenna
at it oh sorry here's the oscilloscope
we took an iPhone we pointed an antenna
at it a simple ham radio antenna
handheld ran it through an icon radio we
got on ebay for somewhere between one
and two thousand dollars it's a kind of
like a shortwave radio ran it through a
good new radio which was about a
thousand dollars and then fed the output
of that into a scope so the one we used
was pretty deluxe but you can get USB
ones pretty cheap and were able to
extract the key from an RSA decryption
15 or 20 feet away depending upon the
room and that was without tuning the
antenna that was without spending too
much time product izing the attack so
it's entirely plausible that a
determined attacker would be able to
take a nice parabolic antenna may be
buried in the wall and if they got lucky
extract that RSA secret key that you're
using to do your banking or whatever
you're working on now granted there are
a few there are a few things the phone
had to be oriented a certain way in our
demo but the point is you think you're
safe because somebody doesn't have your
phone in their hands I wouldn't bet on
it yes sir
in the case when you're remotely doing
this demo the iphone is the iphone
running a specific piece of software do
you guys wrote or that
this is being recorded okay I have to be
the question is was the iphone running a
specific piece of software so the place
I was working for considered themselves
white hat hackers and one of the rules
they had was that they would never
demonstrate publicly an attack upon a
system that was out in the field so what
we had to do was build a contrived
example and run that on the phone and
presented it at the trade shows saying
you know this is probably not the same
way that the native library is
implemented but and then one of our guys
did an experiment and came back
red-faced that we had gotten closer than
we should have and that's about all I
can say and by the way we ran the same
test on the android phone and so part of
it depends upon how the phone leaks you
can get quite a bit of information by
just putting a magnetic loop next to the
phone and there's a lot of probing
around which frequency do you want to
tune in on but the point is that an
adversary who knows what they're looking
for and has had time to set up the
attack has a pretty good chance of
getting what they're looking for the
question is how does this vulnerability
going to cost me money well first of all
I misspoke earlier it wasn't an iphone
it was an iPod so there's no dude the
Wi-Fi was turned off there was no there
was no 3g connection so the gsm data
format has been broken it can be brute
forced in the reasonable amount of time
so if you've got data if you're relying
on the carrier to encrypt your data
don't if you've got a encrypted say
network traffic going across that
connection
you should basically assume that
someone's got a network sniffer on it
you know so if you're doing a banking
app on your phone and you're using a GSM
connection and I imagine that LTE or
whatever it probably has similar
vulnerabilities or will be found soon
that's just my speculation I don't know
for a fact but how long were people
saying that GSM was absolutely secure
before someone came out and said it's
broken buddy I mean it's really up to
you it if they happen to know that
you're using a certain app or if they
can trick you into doing it this comes
up in places like when you're doing the
well here's a for example how many
people have a clipper card you know that
electronic tag in card for the for the
boss where you just wave it wirelessly
so it turns out that that uses an
insecure implementation you can extract
the entire secret key by watching the
transaction about a dozen times and it's
probably worse than that but my
understanding is that by watching that
transaction a very small number of times
you can extract enough of the secret key
one of our one of my colleagues was able
to hack the clipper card and put on
arbitrary amounts of money on it so now
that's a wireless transaction you can
watch the wireless transaction go by so
use your imagination San Francisco
parking cards by the way are completely
broken too but for a different reason
that's just broken crypto they didn't
implement the crypto properly
does that answer your question okay I'm
not much of a villain I just I just
spend time thinking about how things
break and I don't know what to do with
it once they're broken so the question
is how much noisier was the Android
device versus the iPhone device we were
able to buy it was actually a phone
identical to this one the HTC evo we
were able to put a loop right underneath
it and I'm sure it wasn't optimized and
just by putting it under the phone in
the correct place we were able to get a
very clean signal clean enough that you
could have used a Python script to just
analyze the waveforms and extract the
key so one thing about the ipod was that
it radiated pretty strongly out through
the front glass so to be completely
candid if you had a phone that had very
good shielding which is probably
unlikely because shielding is expensive
and it weighs and it costs money then
you might significantly reduce the range
does that answer your question sorry
well the thing about the power analysis
about the statistical methodology is
that uncorrelated noise so if you've got
four processors and one of them is doing
crypto and the other three are doing
something that's uncorrelated if you
take enough operations the uncorrelated
operations just go away so what it means
is that you've got a little bit more
signal to noise ratio maybe you take
twice as many samples does that address
what you were trying to ask so there was
a question earlier about what do i do so
in a hardware implementation you can
generate some noise you can turn on and
off devices you can insert jitter in
your system you can insert random
operations that's one possibility you
can do things like balance your logic so
one way to do it would be if you're
writing to if you're writing a one in
one place you can also write a zero in
another place if you're doing an XOR
operation you could do the complement of
that X or in another place if you're
doing remember the RSA one where it says
well if it's a one bit then also do the
multiply what you can do is you can
always do the multiply and then just X
or it in and XOR the complement of it in
and that will generate some additional
noise
what these things do is they don't
actually fix the problem they make it a
little bit harder to discover the issues
another thing you can do is if you can
get the noise reduction down to a small
enough level then you can limit the
number of transactions and you can
combine these techniques in order to get
a reasonably secure solution so the goal
of this part is not for you to go away
and now become DPA experts but to let
you know that which crypto library you
use matters how you use the crypto
library matters how many times you let
the user or the the adversary do an
operation matters so this is why for
example on a lot of on a lot of
implementations they only let you enter
your password a certain number of times
not just to avoid a brute force hacker
but also to avoid detecting things like
minor variations and timing
so I also promised some crypto usage
gotchas and I think these will apply
more in a pure software domain one thing
you want to avoid doing is you want to
avoid always having the same secret key
in every device in every place so you
don't want to have every implementation
have the same key it's pretty clear what
this means when you have a physical
token you know if I've got a smart card
I don't want to have the same secret key
in every smart card in your application
you'll have to figure out how to use a
secret based on the device and a secret
that comes from another place and
combine them so that you have a unique
secret in the software for each instance
of the application on each device this
will help people to this will help
protect against the kind of an attack
that uses basically a dictionary lookup
if you have to you have to but generally
you don't want to do that if the initial
attacks on a lot of the blu-ray players
and a lot of the aes players and other
devices happen because people were able
to just sift through the RAM and find
the password this has also been the way
that a lot of video game players have
been broken where they just sorted
through the RAM found the place in the
rim where the password lived and then
just pulled it out
so
just a simple example you've got a EES
you've got something that you want to
encrypt you've got a key that goes in
it's the same key every time and you run
it through the black box and you get
some cipher text output right so if I've
got say a picture and I want to encrypt
a JPEG file and I want to encrypt the
JPEG file so that nobody knows what's in
the JPEG file how many people think this
would be a secure method AES is
bulletproof I'll tell you that the best
attacks to date have only been able to
peel off a few bits of security so the
problem is not here
well if you start with an image like
this and you use the method I just
showed you that's what you get because
when you take a block of say you've got
a string of zeros and you take that
string of zeros and you encrypt it with
the same key over and over again it's
going to look the same right because
this transformation is very repeatable
same key same plain text you will get
the same ciphertext so that allows you
to look at patterns but if you use a
mode that looks more like this where you
put in a randomization value
sorry the lines did not come out on this
one what you're supposed to see is a
line that comes and feed speeds back the
crypto text up here so this
initialization value changes every time
and you get a different input to the
block cipher each time and that value is
unpredictable oh there are lots of modes
you should be very careful using ECB
yeah the correct the kick biggie pardon
me rented lips the comment was you
should not use ECB as a finished cipher
for encrypting secure data and I would
say yes the answer is that ECB the basic
Aes block is more of a component that
you should put together with other
things so I'm going to go ahead and skip
the last example but basically the
method the the message I was trying to
convey is that if you really want your
system to be secure you have to think
about it as you're building it you can't
just build the whole thing and then bolt
on some security afterwards and this is
even more challenging in a pure software
environment because you don't have a
secure core that you can go back to in
an embedded system where you are like a
smart card you can buy a crypto core if
you incorporate that and use that
properly then you've got something
that's that's pretty good in a software
environment where the adversary may have
access to your full memory space it gets
quite a bit more challenging
okay there were some attacks used
remotely on smartphones you may see more
of this there's also been some
speculation that the radio used for
traffic in other words they're the when
you're talking on the phone the radio
that gives you the voice connection has
power modulation based on the strength
of the battery and because of the way
batteries work the greater the load on
the battery the less voltage it provides
there's been some speculation that that
signal could also be used to do this
kind of an attack
and the message that we heard earlier
was don't try to do crypto yourself you
will almost certainly fail unless you're
already an expert there are too many
implementations that have been done well
so I strongly recommend that you copy an
implementation that's been done
sufficiently as opposed to trying to
invent one yourself and even very small
even very small mistakes can be Mott can
be exploited to provide a backdoor that
completely defeats your security so I
hope you found that interesting Sartre
was a little bit more esoteric than you
probably bargained for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
