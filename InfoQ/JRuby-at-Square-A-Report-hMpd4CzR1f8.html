square Steve carnival was supposed to be
here presenting with me but he is quite
ill so he had to bow out it's okay I've
included some Steve quotes in the
presentation it'll be like he's just
here so this presentation I guess it's
not it's more of just it's an experience
report we've used Jerry be at square
we've been using it for quite a number
of months now and this is sort of things
that we've found things that have helped
us and hopefully things that will help
you how many people here are running
Jerry in production a couple of people
okay so it'll be interesting to see
maybe after to compare I mean things
that you've seen that the same things
you've seen that are different you know
there's been ups and downs and whatever
so to start with some context this is
this used to be a fairly accurate
architecture diagram of square which was
great when we first started it allows
you to move very quickly it has a lot of
benefits but it also has a lot of
downsides so we started to move towards
more of this architecture with lots of
different services and now this also has
downsides but it has the upsides that we
want so you know we can split out osla
as we can split code bases between
developers just worked a lot better for
us of course we then have to figure out
how do you do this because you have to
be able to deploy more than one thing
you have different servers it all gets
very complicated especially when we have
you know rails apps we've got some Java
Web Services some Sinatra stuff some
Ruby stuff which isn't even a web like
it's just running background processes
so we needed to figure out how to do
this easily because we near the cost of
starting one of these up to trend
towards zero right when you only have
one app it doesn't really matter what
the startup cost is as far as deploying
it because you've done it once and you
don't have to worry about it but when
you have all of these services with new
ones springing up all the time
you need to really think about how
you're going to deploy these and what's
your infrastructure get a look like and
so we decided for our Ruby stuff to go
towards jerry and i'll be talking a bit
more about that decision and how we came
to it later on I've got four main things
that I want to talk about the first is
Java integration which is something that
you get on JRuby which you don't get on
any other interpreter I don't have a lot
to say about that but so that's why I
put it first to get out of the way I
want to talk about employment that's a
big one I wanted to talk about some real
specific stuff and we found running
rails on JRuby and then I wanted to talk
about development and as far as
developer environments and rather than
deployment so to start with Java
integration this seemed like a really
cool wind with JRuby there's a lot of
stuff in the Java world and we be able
to use it if we're on JRuby and we've
got Java teams at square as well so you
know presumably we could share stuff
with them and things would be great was
it really as immediately useful as we
thought it would be this wasn't because
we tried stuff and it didn't work it
just didn't come up and we didn't really
end up doing it much we still do have
some grand plans for code reuse across
our Java teams and our Ruby teams but so
far we haven't had anything worth
reusing across those teams so it hasn't
come up one thing we did do was we
integrated with neo4j which is a graph
database written in Java and it has a
there's actually a gem called neo4j the
gym or Ruby neo4j which wraps all of the
Java classes in Nice Ruby isms and
everything to let you you know call the
near for J API and so we did use this we
used it to bulk load the graph database
we actually ended up not using the near
future gem but rather just using the
Java classes directly because it worked
out easier for what we wanted to do with
some indexing stuff and I thought this
was really really cool this was actually
this was the promise of hey we
can use Java in Ruby code and it was
really really easy like you don't even
have to think twice about you just do it
before you know know it you've already
done it and it's working you're like
well that was really unexpected in the
end we're not we're not using this like
we use this to sort of bootstrap our
stuff our stuff to get started but we're
not using it in production now because
with neo4j we were running the embedded
server to get it up just started but now
we're running the rest server and we
just have a rest client the talks to it
so there's no need for direct bindings
but it was cool that we we're able to do
that but it's what I'd throw that out
there there's another thing that's been
really handy we've got some really like
old-school Java guys at square who have
some really strong opinions about the
JVM and know how to tune it know how
Java works and know how the garbage
collector works and know which options
you need to pass into your interpreter
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
that's been really really useful except
means we've been able to apply the same
sets of things to our to our deployments
that you know as opposed to having to
have a separate set of Ruby and Java
chops for deployment so that's also been
a really big thing for us might not be a
big thing for most shops because a lot
of companies don't have that mix of Java
and Ruby developers but in our case this
was sort of an extra an extra thing that
sweeten the deal for JRuby for us so
they said that was a bit of a short
section I just want to throw it out
there so deployment this is kind of the
big thing for us we how we tend to
approach things at square is we'll be
going along we're doing things and then
we'll sort of notice hey this team over
there is deploying a new service and
this team over here is deploying new
service they used a rubix I want to use
Java and now we've got four different
deployment environments let's figure out
how we can not do that and see what wins
we can get from integrating across the
organization and this is a quote from
Matthew O'Connor our director of
engineering he we sort of do a big big
meeting get everybody in and sort of
everybody discusses what they want and
then we sort of nominate a panel of
three people and then Matthew said and
Steve and I were two of those three and
Matthew said to us this is you
guiding question go figure it out and
don't bother me again so this is kind of
this was guiding our decision to go to
the JVM we deploy a java stuff on jetty
if we could also deploy our Ruby stuff
on jetty as well that makes things a lot
easier for us when we have lots of these
services this question was asked I can't
remember exactly how many months ago or
maybe three months ago and already it's
starting to pay dividends being on that
same platform but so the question is how
do you actually deploy a web application
a ruby web application on JRuby and
there's actually a number of options
here at one end of the spectrum there's
you can package up everything you have
as a war file and ship it off to a java
application server and this can work but
for us it was we didn't have a java
application server to ship this thing
too so it was an extra thing that we
would have to do and manage in order to
get started so we sort of shied away
from this approach the other thing is
because your packaging every thought
everything up inside a while file it's
not very Ruby ish in that Ruby tends to
expect files on the file system there
are kind of ways around that but in
general that was kind of a little bit
difficult so there's some other options
is Trinidad which as far as I know
Engine Yard uses yep and so clearly
that's got something going for it it
does use Tomcat though and we were
already using jetty for our Java
projects we have a lot of jetty fans
especially from Java side of the office
so we were kind of hoping to be able to
stick with jetty and to have that
integrated server across all of our apps
so we passed on Trinidad Kirk is from
the strobe guys I don't know is anybody
from strobe here no this is the one we
initially used to to deploy our very
first JRuby app we deployed with Kirk um
these are all quotes from the read Mees
of the projects by the way
um also a quote from their Remi and we
found that that wasn't quite right we
had all sorts of problems with it this
may have changed although I don't think
there's been any commit since we use it
so it probably hasn't um but fun it's
completely abandoned yeah it yeah there
were just things once it looks great on
your development environment then when
you try to deploy it and get your logs
going to the right place and get your
pit files monitored by monett and all
these things that you have to do when
you're in production it just didn't work
for us mizuna was in sort of a simpler
version which was also there which
looked promising but did tend to have
the same sort of issues that we'd seen
with Kirk none of these options really
fit very well for us um so after after
sort of playing around with this and we
had some sort of batch scripts to kind
of get jetty working with Ruby just
playing around we thought actually hey
this is pretty cool we can use jetty as
jetty and so not trying to embed it and
Ruby not try any of that stuff just have
a jetty server and then we can have Ruby
code there's a free package it can be
out on the file system so we can let
Ruby Ruby we can let jetty be jetty and
we can just marry the two together and
that's the approach we took for jet pack
which is a tool that we wrote now it's
it's kind of similar to the alternatives
in that most of these things are based
on JRuby rack and sort of has the same
idea of let's take this java application
server or web server and put it with our
Ruby code I was talking to Steve about
this earlier today and this was his
commentary on that this was really the
only one that we got to work for us and
as of today as of right now we've just
open sourced asst if you're interested
so what we found really good about this
is it's essentially a glorified batch
script that packages everything up ships
that have it up into a tarball ships of
every server and unpacked on your server
you don't need a ruby runtime on your
server you just need a Java Java install
you don't need a java application server
just eat Java
and from that you can just run
everything this also provides rapper
scripts to be able to run break and IRB
and all that sort of thing so that's a
um it's a fairly simple project but it
works for us really really well so maybe
it will work for you I can't believe the
name jetpack was available we initially
called a pre-flight but then that was
taken I'm going to deploy it and three
scramble today to come up with a new
name and jetty packaging jetpack yeah we
were stoked anyway so with this what we
tend to do is so we'll deploy to a
server and we'll probably deploy to two
servers or three servers depending on
what the SLA of the of the app is and
and then we can just do a rolling deploy
to those servers with H a proxy we we
just use a thin set of scripts on top of
Capistrano to do this they're really not
very interesting they just do it as I
said do the do the tarball up single
similarly concurrent hit heo prophecy to
say hey take this person out of the out
of the rotation that works really well
we so yeah we're not even going to
bother open source app because it's it's
literally just basic Capistrano um but
that's sort of how we how we ship our
code at 12 servers having just one doing
this having just one process with real
threads is much much nicer than having
10 processes running on a machine which
just found it much easier to manage as
part of this so actually sorry I forgot
a bit so with jet pack this also gives
you a script which you can it's an init
init d script to start and stop your
service which is what our Java guys were
doing so it actually fits with a Java
guys so our apps are really easily
monitored by monitor because you're in
it d script you wanted on it and it's I
mean you kind of can do that with having
multiple processes but it's it's far
easier if you have one process one
paired it's either alive or it's dead
that's been really useful for to
simplifying a lot of things
so as far as Raines ghost and so
following on from the threads thing this
also means that we can have background
processes really really simply and we've
been using Girl Friday and it's it's
been great it's a library by Mike poem
Terim um and it's it means that we don't
have to have a separate set of workers
running our background jobs we can just
have this one process with one pair that
can also do background processing as
well as servicing web requests it just
drastically lowers the barrier to entry
to doing a service properly and so we've
found that that's been a really useful
library and that model of not having
separate background workers has worked
really well for us um biggest problem
with rails we've found is that thread
safe mode isn't really very widely used
which means it's not really widely
tested so we've stumbled across a couple
of bugs with this hopefully you'll
stumble across fewer because we found
them first this hasn't so for instance
we found a bug with ARL where we were
querying one record and we were getting
another user's details back which was
very very weird but we were able to
patch this and we got accepted into
rails very quickly and so the rails guys
to their credit have been very very
helpful and supportive of us with thread
safe issues and helping trying to debug
them and and that sort of thing and
accepting patches and that kind of stuff
um there's still a few autoloading
issues around this is still an open
issue which I've spent far too long
trying to figure out but we haven't
really been bitten by well this is it
because it was always because it's
related autoloading you might get an
exception when the app starts up and
then never again so it's not really that
big a deal especially and you can I mean
for this this was an internal app but if
that was a really big problem as you
start your app hop you can just spray it
with requests but yeah so there's an all
other issue but in general those
heart from that it hasn't been that big
a deal and it hasn't made this
experience particularly painful I mean
it it sucked a little bit it's pretty
obvious when you get a concurrency bug
like if you get something like this
happening when your app starts up in the
require code require in Ruby is known to
be not thread-safe in like it's kind of
obvious that it's like oh that's
threading bug so yeah so that hasn't
really been a huge deal for us being a
little bit painful but it is much better
now and so those are just a couple of
rail specific things that we've seen so
development so this is all great we're
deploying we've got apps we're running
we've got one process we love it this is
a really big deal jruby takes freaking
ages to start up it really sucks and
part of that is part of that is
unavoidable I mean the JVM takes a while
to start up there are things you can do
like nail gun where you sort of have a
process running and it effectively Forks
off processes to try and work around
this problem we didn't find anything
that was really really solid in doing
that and we really like our startup
times quick if you want to get a really
good TDD cycle going 1.5 seconds just
for jruby is too long um so we decided
to run both so we actually develop on
193 and we deploy on JRuby now the most
important thing about this is that you
run your CI using both Ruby's so
apologies for putting a block of code on
a slide you can look at this afterwards
but the general idea is this just a bash
script that we have on projects which
knows how to use our VM to install the
rubies that it needs to switch them
around and to run the test using the
different rubies if you've got this you
can't go too far wrong we haven't been
bitten by any errors in production by
developing 193 because our CI is able to
catch any problems so this is kind of
the foundation if you're going to do
this you need this practically what does
this mean well
pretty much every app you're going to
have to use different database drivers
if you're using active record a sequel
of data mapper or something that will
abstract this the majority of this
problem away from you the only time
you'll then have to do more than this is
well obviously your configuration you'll
have to have if JRuby load this driver
otherwise like this driver or if you're
accessing the drivers directly like if
you're executing ross equal or something
for instance these two gems this is some
code we have result is the raw raw
result back from the database driver
they're slightly different in each case
as I said the ORM deal with this for you
but if you're hitting them yourself then
you can have to do it yourself and then
we also found process management to be
slightly different between the two there
is a gem that does this for you called
peer up and for which one of our apps is
using it and the app that I'm writing we
just use that because it was simpler
than pulling in another gem and it
wasn't that hard so that's that's it
like the cost of writing cross Ruby
compatibility of writing cross Ruby code
is really really low I I grabbed all of
our code bases for like an if ruby
platform equals Java and those three
examples of the only things I could find
so it's really not that hard and I think
is really worthwhile the benefit of this
also is um you kind of hedge your bets a
little bit the way we see all these
things like deciding to run Jerry
reproduction it's it's a bit it's an
architectural bit we're saying we think
that doing this will pay off in the
future and as with most bets if you can
hedge them that's a good win so we
looked at both thing so if we go down
the jruby path and in two years it sucks
or in X amount of time it sucks what's
the cost going to be to switch back to
MRI versus if we're on MRI and we go
down for a few years and it sucks what's
the cost of switching to JRuby it's kind
of a finger in the air type guess but it
seemed since most people are using MRI
switching back to MRI would be fairly
easy especially since we're running it
in development going from fMRI turned
out to be a really bad move
architectural switching from that to
JRuby seemed like would be a much bigger
deal because of you know these driver
options but also having to get the
infrastructure in place to be able to
run jruby code so that's this kind of
being able to hedge our bet on that is
especially since we can't get it for
free is really nice so we're developing
on 19 we do have apps in both one lake
in JRuby running both 18 mode and 19
mode when we first when we put out our
first JRuby app 19 mode in JRuby wasn't
quite there yet nowadays it really is
it's pretty solid and the Jerry you guys
would come out and said that the only i
spoke to charles like a month or two
back and I think his exact words were
it's all fine except for the encoding
stuff pretty much so yeah we've been
running both of these in production and
yeah they work great so I mean I'd go
with 19 because i like the hash in tax
and the stabby syntax but what if you
like so those are the four things i've
covered java deployment rails
development as i said we're not doing
anything sort of revolutionary or
bleeding edge with this stuff but we're
doing it and so my hope with this was
sort of just to get that data point out
there here's an experience of a company
that's using jruby it's being like
hasn't been totally knock it out of the
park hasn't been terrible it's been
better than its been better than average
though so hopefully that's helpful to
some people this is a when we had to
recommend when we were trying to figure
out how to recommend this to other
people this was how Steve phrased it and
he as well as hedging bets likes to head
your sentences but so far we have an
adequate reason not to so it's been
great for us there's me on twitter if
you want to ask me questions afterwards
or maybe you want to ask me
questions now up the back there this
since we're dealing with payments and
that's really important not quite people
dying but still important are we what
are we running our back on them are we
running are back in the JRuby let me
think our most of our payments code is
actually Java there's some stuff in our
main rails app which is actually so one
thing I should have said we do have like
that big rails app that I showed you at
the start is now much much smaller than
it used to be but it's still running on
REE we didn't we haven't migrated that
across so we're just starting up as we
start up new services and take things
out of it by starting them up in JRuby
I'm not sure if we have any JRuby
directly in the payment flow yet but we
would I think well I think we're yeah
we're comfortable enough that no
actually sorry I like we do have some
Jerry be in the sort of critical path
and yeah it's been serving us really
well so yeah we're comfortable enough
with it that we would so are we
transferring the API endpoints from MRI
to JRuby most of them are moving to Java
actually as you accept our main payment
API endpoints our there we got a Java
route for those JRuby are so we use it
for a lot of different things I so
actually yeah I should give some
specific examples of what we're doing
we've got we've got an app that does
kind of Google Analytics type stuff like
it's an analytics sort of things so it
collects a lot of data from a public
website we've got an internal app that
we that the risk team uses to do
transaction view and to find fraud and
that sort of thing we've got some
settlement and like reconciliation
related stuff running on JRuby we've got
the some other ETL processes to do with
our graph database and we've got I
actually got two etl things yeah i'm not
sure if i've i've missed any
and I think there's a few more coming
along so cool so there were two
questions there the first one was we
have a load Java developers in house if
we didn't would be still recommend jruby
so it's nice and then it can save us a
bit of time but really we would have
done it anyway I think it's yeah it's
nice to have guys who just know Java
backwards but we haven't really had to
rely on them too much it's it's a good
safety net but we haven't had to fall on
it the second question was happy noticed
any performance anomalies the startup
time is really the only one it's it's
really quite killer and and even even in
production like starting up a new
production instance like takes good 10
seconds plus as far as other we haven't
noticed any other significant
performance and amelie's either way any
other questions cool well I'll be
hanging around if you do is come up and
chat but otherwise thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
