you have a lot of slides to go through
someone's gonna and jump in I anticipate
a lot of people walk still walking in
but I apologize if you miss anything
good so I'm gonna start with the brief
story just to get going for full-stack
Engineers walk into a small cage and are
told to write a new app high up on top
of the cage well beyond the reach is a
brand new technology called bananas
underneath these bananas is a
well-documented ladder
the engineers immediately spot these
bananas and one begins to climb the
ladder as I do an instigator sprays him
with a stream of cold water and
questions him about why these bananas
would never work the instigator
instigator proceeds to spray each and
every one of the other engineers the
engineer on the ladder scrambles off and
all four sit at a time on the floor wet
cold and bill will be altered soon
though the temptation of the bananas is
too great and another engineer begins to
climb the ladder again the instigator
sprays the ambitious engineer with cold
water and all the other engineers as
well when a third engineer tries to
climb the ladder the other engineers
wanting to avoid the cold spray pull him
off the ladder and beat him frustrated
with the limitation of the cold water
one engineer leaves to work for a new
startup and a new engineer is introduced
to the cage I distinct that with a blue
moustache that's a new engineering
spotting the bananas the naive engineer
begins to climb the ladder and the other
engineers pull them off and beat them
here's what gets interesting the
incident gets another one of the
engineers to leave and replaces him with
the new engineer again the new engineer
begins to climb the ladder and again the
other engineer has pulled them off and
beat them including the new engineer who
has never been sprayed by then the
experiment none of the engineers who
were left who were there at the
beginning were left and despite none of
them experienced the cold wet and spur
spray they learned never to try to go
for the bandhas again the metaphor
didn't the lessons that apply here here
clear
despite the original limitations in the
cage being solved there fix cold water
is poured on the people and their ideas
whenever they tried to do something new
so I'm actually going to talk about
react native I'm just trying to little
icebreaker react native is something
I did that little intro because react
may actually react in general I always
pooh-poohed about I started as a rails
developer I got into ember and I thought
I had a head at all but then react
native changed that for me and that's
what this talk is gonna be all about so
if you don't mind bear with me I'm gonna
make another metaphor to react react
native rather react native is kind of
like Kanye he's dropping new beats new
hits all the time at and at first you
don't like him but eventually you start
to like him and I guess to give didn't
really matter but who'da thought Kanye
would have spoke so much truth about
what I'm about to talk about so this is
my opening slide it's gonna be about
react native and it's gonna be should I
even bother to learn Swift that's a
question I had when I first got in the
react native and I answered it so I'm an
answer for you guys today but before I
do that we're gonna go to back to the
future or back to the past versa
actually back to 2009 where the
introduced introduction of node during
this time Lady Gaga is actually pulling
out hits faster than JavaScript
frameworks could be built which was true
because we didn't have that many
JavaScript frameworks then so note was
interesting was introduced node at that
time there were engineers that did the
front-end in that new JavaScript at that
time if he did JavaScript people feel
bad for you there was a lot of
limitations of JavaScript and node kind
of opened up the front end to the back
end so you could do node server server
code and you can also do front-end
JavaScript code so you could say that
the lines between front end and back in
JavaScript that blurred so let's travel
back in time but not actually forward in
time a little not too far 2014 the
introduction of swift swift is announced
then not a lot of people in the iOS
community knew forth was coming it was
basically swift is what's good about
Objective C which is nothing and what's
good and and what's great about all the
dynamic and scripting languages so Swift
kind of fell in the laps of iOS
developers you could say it came in like
a wrecking ball
that's the cleanest Miley Cyrus picture
I could get on the internet so there you
go so the line between iOS was blurred
now but not really from an outsider
looking in Swift is a very nice it's a
very yeah it's a very nice syntax it's
very approachable but unfortunately with
iOS you still have to learn all these
other things I won't go to the list but
I mean this it's a lot of legacy things
you've got to implement into your swift
code plus the fact that objective-c is
still is still reign supreme at the
moment so I came to this conclusion that
iOS is still hard I actually attempted
Swift about over a year ago and pretty
much bailed on it walked away from that
and didn't do any mobile development
development after that until very
recently but I just want to talk about
react native again so react native came
out in 2015 which is March of 2015 which
is less than a year ago so react native
is still very new there's a lot of
things that I knew about it and exciting
about it but I'll get into that later
so back to my Kanye example at one point
Swift seemed like the way to do
everything but then Kanye came along and
told Swift there was something better
out there so let's get up let's move
away from that slide so everything
basically if you want to understand
react react is everything's in a
component that's the gist of it some of
the problems that get with like blog
posts from react and even a react native
in general is that they try to get too
much into the weeds about how react
works when in reality react is actually
pretty simple so I'm not gonna begin the
weeds today but I'm going to talk about
components today this is oh but it's a
forwarding everything that I'm gonna
talking about is gonna be in es6 or es
2016 well es6 now because 2016 is not
going to include some of this stuff but
which I found out in the first talk on
the panel but anyway so this is a
JavaScript class is it es6 yeah C X's
class I'm using react component I'm not
gonna go but why byline yet but just
know that this is a component in an es6
class for the the sake of this talk so
basically what I'm going to break it
down line by line now
you have here's props so props are like
things that you can pass in the
components and that's the super simple
way to do that right there and then we
just reset that too and then also know
that there's a nested component inside
of this component so that's also
possible so again you could have
components on top and components and all
the code lives separately inside of each
component so I'm not going to go too
much it more in detail for that but just
know that that's how it works and also
note that there's a navigator prop in
this notes prop are just notes component
that's also happening so I'll get more
in detail on that later and this reset
again and also something else to keep
another point of contention for react in
a react native is GSX
j sx is inline CSS and HTML this was a
part this is a big reason why didn't
like react when I first saw it I had a
lot of scar tissue from CoffeeScript so
I wanted to keep all the logic of
JavaScript separate and make a
JavaScript but once I got in the JSX it
made sense I had very little by this
point time I had very little Objective C
and Swift experience and and actually
before I get into that let me just show
you JSX it's this inline style so that's
a variable that I'm explaining my
finding my Styles another thing you want
to note note is Flex boxes it's like
first-class citizen and your CSS or you
JSX so they use that all throughout it
helps a lot too it's like next-level CSS
if you're not familiar with it and then
again this is my view component and you
can see I have a style prop have you and
uh it's got my Styles injected in line
so it's like 1999 all over again and
then I kind of separated that to let you
know so that's JSX
now this is Swift Swift is all its again
I don't know all the best practices for
Swift and Objective C but when I did
Swift and eject to see all my styles are
inline as well so that's why I said JSX
kind of makes sense I'm not going to
break this line by line but you could
see like the RGB and I'm like defining a
color at line 121 it might be small for
int to actually look at the lines but
just note that Swift is pretty much
similar as far as in
Styles again at Miska sorry didn't
preference I'm just gonna start
explaining some other things about react
so sorry react native sorry if I say
react this know that that's not
synonymous with react native I'm not
going to specifically talk about react
today so yeah react native you have
views and not divs that's one thing I
had to figure out I didn't understand
why I could've put a div inside of my
class but this understand that the logic
is all built to use views views are very
similar to table views and iOS so a lot
of that knowledge transfers over but
it's more of a watered down table view
table views and iOS have a lot of like
extra API calls and stuff like that so
which I'll get it to later of how I how
to work around for that so I'm just
reset again so that's basically my main
component this is my node app which I
will explain if he didn't it will in the
giveaway by the notes component this is
the app that I built using react native
it's just very generic notes I'm using
firebase to save the data using no flux
I'm not gonna get in the flux is a
little out of scope for the talk today
but uh yeah that's just me writing a
note about Elmo all right so what about
Swift
well before I get up Swift I'm actually
gonna talk about something I really like
talking about a lot and that's me so my
name is Brian Douglas I go by be dougie
on github all the code that I showed is
gonna be on github so if you fear if you
feel like you want to like dig deep if I
miss something feel free to go there and
yes there is popular song named after me
if you're at the after party I might
give you a free lesson
who knows depends on how many drinks I
got so uh oh and this is what I look
like on the Internet that's my Twitter
handle and just moving right along I
work for a company called block block is
an online mentorship program it's a it's
a boot camp for say but rather than the
classroom study it so you get a mentor
match to you one-on-one and you go to a
curriculum I mentioned this because not
only a current employee I'm gonna lump a
block and I'm also a current student a
block block gives us the opportunity to
pick a course of our choice and go
through it with a mentor and the course
I chose obviously was iOS support of the
past 30
six weeks I started learning iOS I
started the block curriculum has a
curriculum that you start off with you
get a Objective C foundation so in that
foundation I learned how to build a
calculator
I went how to build a web browser and
then I also built a Instagram clone
which I Nate which is named blocks the
gram for obvious reasons during the
second half of the course you get out of
the curriculum and you get a list of
features it's called a project phase so
rather than using a curriculum to
actually learn you're just getting a
list of features and you just use Google
or iOS documentation actually a build a
project so the project I made as my
first project I used Swift for the main
reason I was more interested in Swift
and objective-c at that time I tried it
before and it gave it up and also my
mentor that was paired with this guy in
New York he had been using Swiss since
it's his its inception so he had a lot
of knowledge from like zero dot whatever
to current Swift so I was able to
leverage dad that's one thing that I
like about block is uh I can leverage my
mentor for knowledge outside of a
curriculum which most of our curriculum
is objective-c at this point so I'm at a
messenger app for Kanye it's a it's an
app it's super buggy is not live you
can't ever see it but you can look at
the source code
it's a Swift app and it does basically
the sends messages quotes from the
internet that Kanye said like really
stupid stuff and I built it all in Swift
and I was able to learn a lot of Swift
at the time and I got pretty competence
with so at that time my mentor at the
time I knew web because I didn't mention
I'm actually a full stack web developer
so I did JavaScript angular rails what
have you a little bit of react now and
so I knew web and a new iOS so at that
point the lines between iOS and web
became blurred so my mentor approached
me approached me in one of our meetings
he said well you know JavaScript right
why don't you try to react native for
your next project
so I said why not so I did it just a
little side I just wanted to put
JavaScript and Swift next to each other
I know it's cut off a little bit at the
bottom but I just wanted to look at the
if you could just like the squint test
Swift and JavaScript and this is again
it's es6 looks very similar if you if
you know JavaScript you could pretty
much do Swift outside of some iOS
library stuff you might have to look
into but just know that Swift is not
that hard to grasp so I just want to let
you guys know that so now I'm going to
talk about react native and I'm take a
sip real quick so react native is
something that came out last March it's
it's a it enables JavaScript developers
to write iOS code native code around in
iOS 7 or Mavericks is like the
comparable of what came out that year an
Xcode JavaScript this thing called
JavaScript core came out where enables
you to write actual JavaScript and Xcode
so it's a it's a wrapper over Java sorry
over web kit so you can have interaction
with like things like web views and
stuff like that you can do with
JavaScript core I won't get too much in
the weeds about that but just note that
this is react native it's all compiles
to Objective C and JavaScript core so
getting started getting started is
actually super easy with just doing
those two lines that I have in the blue
box that's just taken right off the
Facebook box you can get started for
react native it might take a while so
you might have to let it ride for a
little bit but just note that you're in
a node 4.04 yeah anything for or later
for this actually work I had to figure
out the hard way took me 30 minutes to
figure it out because I'm at one that
actually read the documentation I was
kind of just jump in and do it so I had
to go back to the documentation figure
that out and yeah so that one's for free
for you guys you guys it's taken out of
that so that's this is the app you're
actually gonna get it's a generic like
welcome to react it's very similar to
frameworks they give you some static
hello world this is nice because to get
up and running I have a little gift so
as soon as I install that I've got react
native there's something that's really
cool is you got a hot loader so as soon
as I once I enable it
I can change text and it will
I refreshed I didn't I messed up yeah so
once I hit save
boom alright so you get a hot look
reloaded his anybody I didn't ask is
anybody used react native in the room
cool not a lot but some does anybody use
yeah let's ask that so react it's pretty
awesome oh sorry I was gonna ask anybody
do ILS here ever deny OS so what do you
update I'll when you update code in iOS
you got to restart the cement simulator
and that's pretty painful especially if
you have a large app if you've got a lot
a lot of stuff going or if you're just
trying to iterate fast it takes so much
time to like continue to hit restart on
the simulator sometimes it could be slow
sometimes be fast but most the time it's
slow that it's huge for me so do simple
things like copy changes and color
changes and stuff like that
that's really nice also not pictured is
you can debug in the chrome console
which if I wasn't familiar with Xcode
and debugging I hate it like I hate it a
lot it's really hard if you're not
familiar with it it's painful but I knew
JavaScript that I knew Chrome so that
made it a lot easier so just note that
that happens even though it's not a
picture so now I'm gonna get into my
actual project I did show some of the
code previously it was it was the same
code but this is now I'm gonna get in
like the more of the weeds of the
project but I just want to preface that
this project if it's a one project it's
called block notes it's a simple node
app what's nice about using the project
as my basis of react native is I had a
clearer list of features to obtain so I
think so I could prototype this and
figure out is react native even worth to
using if I came up with any like
roadblocks which I didn't come up with
too many of them then I could just you
know figure out if we reactivate it was
pretty viable so basic things is
creating notes setting a title these are
all like checkpoints within the the
project our features that you had to do
sharing notes searching notes and
detectable links which is something I'm
not going to go to but that's like when
you send a text message and you can
click the link or it opens like the
phone or Safari and stuff like that so I
had to do that
so this is my notes component if you're
not familiar with like react actually
who knows react in here okay a lot of
you cool so I don't explain this I'm
just pulling out different using these
structuring I'm pulling out different
modules out of the react native API and
I'm just gonna go but I'm not gonna go
through every single one of them but I'm
just gonna show how it kind of works
with react sort of flying by line so I'm
gonna talk about view first so this is
my wallet exit code which oh cool most
of its there and so this is my view I
within the render function within the
class there's a return function that
returns a specific view that's a common
practice with react and react native
that's my view again it's like table
views I have my Styles on there not
really much to talk about now list views
is pretty cool it's just like very
similar to at this one plank on what
it's called in iOS but just know that if
there's a comparable thing in iOS that's
similar the ListView and yeah so I'm
just pulling that out ListView is
basically each note that I have there
it's gonna list view is gonna render a
separate item so it's almost like using
map actually it's just like using map
and that's what that is so I'm gonna
break that down now with ListView
there's going to be in the API there's
going to be two different props one's
gonna be the data source and the other
one's gonna be the render row and that's
what's doing that that's similar there
the map thing I'm gonna talk about data
source first data source is literally
what it is it's the data that you're
gonna pass into your ListView so it's
built like an array and you're able to
iterate over that and present that in
each of using render row one thing to
note that there's a state this D s that
I'm passing in all my list data so I
believe it's just straight from the API
documentation you could change that to
dis dot stuff and it will still work but
I'm just note that that's why I called
it des anyway so there's my data source
being set so I have a fetch method I
delete a lot of code just a lot more
code in there but I just put this fetch
mess with this to know that you're
inside the class at that point I have a
fetch
that's calling to firebase and with my
API module and right there I'm setting
the state which is data source at the
moment and that's how that happens no
real question to that and then I also
wanted to note that clone liffe Rose is
also happening there so that's what's
actually taking each object in that
array and setting it to the Westview so
now I have these rows all set up for me
so now I'm going to talk about render
row which is pretty self-explanatory
again this is if you're familiar if we
react native or react this is going to
sound like oh why are you talking about
this prop most likely because there's a
lot of people haven't seen this but it's
gonna it's it's pretty straightforward I
mean there's no like magic to it and
then I'm rendering my Rose sorry I think
I have this slide twice alright so I
just wanted to know - also I'm gonna
talk about touchable highlight touchable
highlight is a wrapper outside of your
whatever you're rendering so again going
back to the the notes every time you
want to touch a note and do something
use that on press prop and you could
pass in a function my function is called
view note so I can view a note and this
is that happening so now I'm like going
in and out of notes touching home view
notes getting called and we're good to
go
hopefully that makes sense nice so at
this point once I figured this out this
was like one weekend of work to get my
notes rendered and working I don't know
if that's out of the norm or whatever
but I pretty much knew I didn't know
what I was doing but I figured out
rather quickly I think that we could I
probably put maybe close to eight hours
on this on a project because I only
worked on my projects on the weekends so
yeah I felt pretty good about this some
things I'm not gonna talk about is
testing and swiping detectable links I
have a blog that goes in more detail
about that but I felt for the sake of
time not to go in there so just make a
note that's my name that me and a blog
in front of it I'll stop for pictures
but I could I could literally go on like
slide by slide about things I figured
out and react native but I won't do that
because you guys have stuff to do today
so back to this question remember this
question should I use Swift you could do
stuff in a react native should I use
Swift well I'm gonna answer that now so
there's a thing that I had to do what's
called note sharing so I can you see it
okay so there's like that that little
share icon which I have here I knew I
was gonna get cut off so I put it up
there I could I cut it out and put it
there
I had to
you can't see but I hit the button and
now I'm gonna add my black notes
extension so I can share this website to
my notes and I believe I'll save it and
once I figure out how to click home
there's my share now right there cool so
this is something that I had to do
outside of react native there's a react
native doesn't really cover this in the
API documentation will react native that
team that core team they're not gonna
they already they basically said they're
not going to cover every single iOS
feature and react native they might get
there if it's around long enough but
this thing's like sharing to your app I
had to do and Swift I created this thing
called a node extension well it's called
an extension in iOS I think I called it
a node extension as my file
no I didn't anyway so I had to create a
share view controller which does all the
swift code to be able to share to
firebase so I kind of circumvented my
react native app in order to get this
accomplished because I felt like why
would you do all that work and then go
shove it back to react native and then
save it to my firebase which is
completely separate anyway so for this
that's what I did here again I'm not
gonna go line by line in this Swift side
but just know that this works and so the
reverse of that so when I'm in my app
and I want to share to something else
that I was able to do in react native so
I basically an oldish Boop
show this working I will show button up
here which then pulls up the sharing
functions i only enable copying which is
for the sake of my app just to get it to
work I guess I could have did more but
and now in the memory I'm able to once I
figure out a paste paste and there you
go I've copied stuff so that was a
proof-of-concept to show that it works
it works I had to go into iOS again to
get this started so when I'm starting in
oh actually I'm starting in my app but
anyway I created a share manager react
native has this thing called react
native modules native modules where you
could actually write code and Objective
C or vice versa and talk back and forth
the documentation is pretty extensive
and that's like one of the few port
places that actually have clear
documentation not I'm not going to react
native but there's just a lot of
limitations is in documentation oh yeah
so I'm creating this in this is actually
an objective-c by the way I'm creating
this export I'm saving stuff I'm sending
it back and I'm actually passing it to
my share module again Iowa stuff I'm not
gonna go line my line I just assumed
maybe people weren't for as familiar if
Objective C a swift I actually chose
Objective C for the reason that of the
limitation of Swift at the moment Swift
you can't export stuff out of Swift and
anywhere else but you can only do an
objective-c which would then it's gonna
get in the weeds a little bit then would
require me to write in Swift export it
in a kind of like sorry I'll have this
in my notes but I'd have export it into
an objective-c helper class I dot H file
and then send it back to this file and
then export it to react native so I was
like why I'm gonna did I already know
how to doing this so for the sake of
this talk yes I did do Objective C and I
had to know a little bit of Jackson C
not really a blog post told me exactly
what to write so I just copied and
pasted and put in my variables so going
back to react native I have a I'm
actually including the react native
native modules and share manager I'm
including share manager is what I named
it and I'm able to have a share function
and I'm able to share
stuff so I can put it into my
objective-c class and then do whatever I
need to do with it so if I wanted to
share it to let's say mail or Safari or
whatever I could do that I didn't want
to write that much objective-c so that's
the gist of my app so there's like a lot
of things that I haven't touched a lot
of things I haven't figured out and a
react native there's a there's actually
full there's actually five issues that I
had on this list originally now only
have one because react native actually
closed them all they figured them out
and they're basically good to go the
team moves pretty fast on things that
are problems but they're also not that
big of a team too so some things take
real short amount of time some things
are quick but I just wanted to note
there's still some problems with react
native and mainly you could sum up this
slide with how young react native is
again we're less than a year out so
there's going to be something some edge
cases that you can't accomplish so back
to my original slide react native versus
Swift what do I do well I think if
you're gonna ask that question you're
asking the wrong question because the
answer is react native and Swift
what's nice about react native is you're
gonna learn Swift if you want to learn
so if you don't have to learn Swift
you're gonna learn objective-c and
you're gonna learn to solve problems
reactivated it was actually really good
at getting out of the way for you so
when you hit a limitation they react
native you could easily make a native
module and start writing a little bit of
Swift code to make that work that's
really nice about react native and
that's again the shop the JavaScript
core engine helps you do that because
you can this pass code back and forth
also react native helps you do that with
that that sheriff's native module stuff
so what's so great about react native if
you didn't get it already
react native it's great with fast
prototyping you can write in JavaScript
which is nice so coming from the web and
not knowing objective-c or Swift it's
really nice to get like one weekend out
of the way and just learn a little bit
of react native and you're good to go
you could also use a lot of different
tools in JavaScript ooh I didn't go
through all those but just know you can
do that as I close I wanted to mention
that discover VR as an app it's built
all and react native anybody familiar of
discovery BR never used it well if you
haven't used it they were the hosts at
the Puppy Bowl 2016 this was created by
a consultancy in Nashville it's called
chocolate chisel and they had they were
mainly an iOS shop that for the most
part they were native iOS and one of
their engineers Mark shilling actually
wrote a really good blog post I highly
recommend this googling that or looking
on medium either mark shilling choc and
chisel or that title you'll figure it
out and he wrote a really good
perspective based on working with
discovery VR coming as an iOS developer
and coming some of the limitations but
he came away thinking that react native
isn't a side step outside of iOS but
it's a really good way that to think so
they came up with the conclusion at the
very end he has his quote step outside
of your comfort zone and you may find
something even better than before so he
was able to I don't think they're gonna
write every single iOS app at that shop
using react native but I think they're
gonna make a really good case either why
or why not for react native and it makes
sense he actually I think one of the
Engineers actually actually his boss did
a talk in November and what more detail
about this but I think he was actually
one of the only iOS engineers at the
company so there's a big limitation but
to get things done because they had the
wait on him so now they have a react
native app derived arrests of developers
I work on the API and some of the jQuery
and stuff like that for the website to
be able to get knee-deep in a rack code
and just kind of get stuff done
they're probably fumble at first but I
think they'll figure it out something
else that I didn't bring up was Android
Android at the time I was learning react
native Android became like legit and
react native so I didn't have time for
the sake of this conference and would
sake of my iOS course to do Android but
just note that this this project react
native a MBA app is side by side I think
on the left is iOS and the Wrights
Android these guys accomplish what
everybody has questions about can I
write code and react native and you know
be good to go
react names ma-mutt let's have that
slide twice anyway so react NATO's motto
is to learn once right everywhere so
there's some things are you gonna write
an iOS that you can't write and Android
but just keep that in mind
I think chocolate chisel they mentioned
that when they ported discover VR over
they were able to port 80 percent of
their code over the Android and then
it's had to rewrite 20 percent of it
AGGA hit io Tyler McGinnis actually was
one in one of the panels he actually
here today and his react native intro is
probably hands down the best intro I did
that prior to that weekend that I did
this node app I went through that
actually went to like five tutorials
before doing this but I don't think you
really need to do five I think you just
need to do his so just check out egghead
die oh cool
well that's my twitter handle and I have
a few minutes to answer questions if you
guys have it I went faster a lot of
things so I'm sure there's some things I
didn't cover anyway how many questions
in the back did you speak loud
I have not
I know TV OS it's I don't think it's
very at for react native there's this TV
OS it's built
I've been tried anything in TV OS but
when it came out I read the
documentation and it's different then
even watch i watch so i don't think
you're gonna get a lot of a lot of stuff
done if you use react native at this
point today yeah yeah it's very what
with using es6 and classes and
components like I said chalk and chisel
80% of app is agnostic between framework
my API to talk to firebase is pretty
agnostic so I'm able to put that in a
Lib folder and this you know include it
and port it or if you want to use common
Jas you can use require so yeah so and
so with react native I think I should've
went to this but it's a good question
you gonna have it indexed iOS J's file
you're gonna have an android iOS that
J's file and those live all the way in
the sorry the top level of your file
structure so then you could have your
app folder and you could include stuff
from that so it it does live separate
you have two indexes one talks to
objective-c and one talks to whatever
Android uses at this point yeah so
that's a good question I didn't cover in
the scope of this talk but I'm an answer
it real quick but chalk and chiseled
again there node comp November talk goes
right into how you put send apps to
production but just to note for react
native you can actually export it all to
Objective C that's what actually what
happening so when you actually compile
down and get ready for the App Store
Apple is not seeing JavaScript I'm they
might see a little bit of JavaScript
talking to the web if that's what you
did but all of its gonna compile in
Objective C so when they get their app
to review in like 2 to 6 months or
whatever how long it takes him to review
an app they're just going to see
Objective C code and their QA
departments actually mainly not looking
at your code it's looking at how how
buggy it is so we got like glaring holes
in your code
you'll probably get kicked back on that
but for the most part they're not look
they don't know if you're doing react
native unless they know some of that I'm
not gonna show it but and I projected
our yeah and I an Xcode rather all the
react files are preference with RN so
I'm sure some people might look at your
code like oh this guy didn't react
native but if it works no prove it it's
the same thing of Cordova and the same
thing for all those other you know
hybrid things a question it back yeah
yeah yeah as long as your if your app
works you're good yeah and going back to
my blog I talked about how to get your
app ready for production how to compile
it down how to test it on your phone
yeah I go into a blog post about that
it's pretty simple we just kind of
changed a couple of lines in the code
and you're good to go
probably simple oversimplify that but
there's no it works in the back on the
right yeah yes yep when it compiles down
yeah you can edit it I haven't myself
because I I don't know I just never felt
like I needed to but yeah just know you
can dig deep if you really want to in
the middle I keep missing you yeah
actually yes it's huge in iOS it's way
different so I didn't mention him at
core data it's completely different to
orm on top of sequel and like I haven't
really dug deep in core data but yeah
it's completely different to like let's
say flux or rather redux
I think Redux is kind of like the way
everybody's going Redux works well with
react native but yeah coming from like
web and JavaScript it's different than
Swift there's different best practices
you can kind of force your or your swift
code into like more like a JavaScript
way of thinking that's totally possible
but it goes against like the the best
practices of some of the things that I
OS do
but yeah there are differences but yeah
you could if you really wanted to like I
want to write my code one way the same
way every time then yeah you could
totally do that one of the the biggest
pitfalls I think for newer iOS
developers which I fell into is shoving
tons of stuff in your controller I think
that's pretty common for a lot of
languages and frameworks I did that and
was a big problem and I was able to
refract her out stuff so I can have like
this stuff that talks to data stuff like
different modules there's also a big
learning curve because it's like I think
iOS it's not MVC it's like MV VC and
it's like like different like view
models and stuff like that that like
talk to the view and the controller and
yeah that's in the weeds but this note
that it's it's it's slightly different
as far as best practices one more
question and the last first one yeah
it's it's totally possible the react
native podcasts are rekt native radio
whatever they had a good episode like
maybe a couple months ago about that
doing hybrid applications and everything
iOS first but yeah it's totally possible
I think it might be difficult because
with the react native CLI the two
commands I showed you and getting
started it sets you up to start your
react app first so you're gonna have to
figure out how to get all that react
native code into your establish iOS app
but if you wanted to start off with
react native off the bat and then
override all that with Swift I mean it's
all Xcode at this point but you're gonna
have to know objective-c at that point
to get around stuff one more question
just for the fun of it performance
concerns no but again chocolate is like
keep going back to them I literally just
watch this talk like Monday and I was
like wow this guy they said so many good
things they had an issue going back to
we react native stops and then you can
take Xcode iOS to do the rest they had
an issue where there are renderings so
what discoverer VR it's you could pick
like what videos you want to watch and
it's like supposed to be virtual reality
and you have like the Google cardboard
and you walk around with it the actual
viewing of the actual VR is done in
Swift and that's because they had
performance
imitations trying to send it from
JavaScript to iOS so it made no sense at
that point so that is over at that and
did all objective-c actually is what
they wrote the wrapping yeah hey that's
my Twitter handle I'll be walking around
if you guys have any more questions or I
just want to be friends come find me
thank you
