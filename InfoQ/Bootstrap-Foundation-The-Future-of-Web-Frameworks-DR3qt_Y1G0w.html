are do we do have a lot of front-end
developers here how many of you guys
know what a framework is I'm guessing
that's why your how many of you don't
know what a framework is we're in
trouble
so just real quickly Jonathan please let
us know what is what exactly is a
framework if you had to describe it okay
what is a framework a framework is you
have to help me a framework is a system
or not a framework is patterns and best
practices and shortcuts to help you get
started on things and do things that are
awesome more quickly that was a really
in eloquent answer it's it's tricky
because the what is a framework changes
pretty frequently and there's a lot of
different kinds of frameworks yeah our
frameworks are our frameworks are like
the patters of the templates they're the
the constraints the things we we try to
do all the grunt work so that you guys
can do better awesome more than
what we do right all the stuff that you
don't want to keep doing every single
time that's it that's a framework it's
all the stuff that you don't want to
keep doing over and over again yeah
and the Paul blog wrote an article about
the purpose of a framework or for
pattern libraries to create visual
design consistency can you guys tell us
of some other frameworks that exists
besides bootstrap and foundation no
kidding
my top of my head there's a topcoat
which X is one of the guys who works
actually the guy that worked on it's
right over there reason and reason that
got ready to top
not good two weeks ago I feel like a
jerk now first off easily JIT he's
awesome there's there's pure that one's
firmer from John Doe
there's Inuit there's any wait yeah
there's an you it there's Burberry
there's bourbon neat if you if you're
feeling semantics II there's one called
tuk tuk tuk tuk it's all one word they
claim to be not dude strap that's in the
slogan what's cool well they're correct
I was also Gumby okay so we're all
curious how was and ratchet sorry
there's another Club ratchet Jacob Jacob
and Connor Connor Connor raise your hand
- Connor works with Houston we're
blessed serve as well he works at get up
with me and you made something called
ratchet with Jacob's release the second
version of integration okay um so just
curious how did you guys start I'm gonna
start with mark how did you come up with
the idea of bootstrap so it wasn't clear
from the slides I worked at ZURB for two
knife years on my first job in
California and I work with this guy for
about a year and a half I think how much
and so when we were working with
basically do is a design agency so we
did a lot of work for different clients
of all different sizes and a lot of that
then entailed doing stuff on the web and
the best way that we found to deliver
that kind of stuff wasn't in Photoshop
and any kind of sense there we would
still deliver that stuff but we actually
want to give them the tools to make all
that stuff come to life in the browser
so we made style guys and they'll start
it in Photoshop and then also we did the
same thing in HTML CSS so well we would
deliver is all the standard graphics and
then HTML CSS like a couple of template
pages and the key pages we designed
likely put the home page and like a sub
page and then we'd have all of our
components that and that was basically
the inspiration for at the time called
the deserve style guide which John and I
worked on a lot when I was there when we
were there together and that was for
reserved calm and all the applications
that we were making there and it was the
same kind of thing so we had a lot of
inspiration for style guides I've been
making style guides basic for the last
six years and so when I got to Twitter I
just wanted to
same thing so essentially a framework is
a style guide more or less yeah okay
Jonathan how was is it would you give
the same answer if you're a so many were
to ask you how did you come up with or
who came up with the idea of foundation
foundation came about it was the same
sort of thing I mean I worked yeah I
worked with worked at served with mark I
still work conserved obviously and we
did style guides for all the clients and
every time we did every time we did a
new project the the style guide that we
had the initial style guide that we had
was pretty bare-bones like it was like a
16 column fixed with grid and it was
buttons and like a couple of other
things and we still found ourselves just
doing the same things over and over and
over again like every client needed this
and every client needed this and every
coin needed this so after a while doing
all these style guides which we still do
for clients heads are actually and this
is totally aside but one of the great
advantages of getting style guides to to
clients is that actually empowers them
to build stuff themselves which as a
consultant is really awesome it means
they don't to come back to you all the
time to help them do things they can
actually do stuff themselves that's nice
but after doing this over and over and
over again we we got the idea to take
the style guide that we had and abstract
that because it had some sort of like
Serb specific stuff in it we used it for
all of our internal things so we decided
to abstract it pull out anything that
was opinionated about design or visuals
or whatever and build it out to include
any components that we thought we were
going to use more than like once and
that was the beginning of foundation
foundation one actually no one ever saw
unless you work at serve because
foundation one was all internal that
foundation two was the one that we
released and now we're at foundation
five or 5.2 today I have point to give
it up for reserve for launching 5.2
today found these and we're at bootstrap
3 points I highly suggest if anybody
wants to like get in a better mood to go
visit the bootstrap blog because there's
90 there's a 90s dance party with every
release that they that they announced
which is really fun music video the top
of our blog post
you haven't seen him in a the lesson was
rhythm as a dancer no I think it was
that there was one before that actually
there was one after that we've done a
lot of them it's half my day is spent on
YouTube favorite videos that I think
would work well super good
that's true he doesn't work very much
okay so if somebody if say that I wanted
to design my own framework
how would that how would I be able to do
that well can I can I answer in kind of
how do you not answer an assister okay
fair enough I think it's I think it's a
cool I think it's a cool coding exercise
to make your own framework I think it's
I think it's a cool like empowering kind
of thing to do it is a lot of work
there's there's a lot of stuff to build
for a framework this there's a lot of
moving pieces and the frameworks that
exist now I mean ours notwithstanding
but also other people's are pretty
sophisticated not to toot our own horn
so I guess so there's there's a lot of
stuff to do to build your own framework
if you want to be I mean if you want to
just if you really want to build your
own framework that I mean build your own
framework and figure out the what are
the pieces that you need repeatedly what
are the things that you are always going
to be using over and over again and then
figure out the absolute best possible
way you can think of to build them
that's I think that's one of the biggest
challenges of working on a framework or
building a framework is that especially
if you're talking about like foundation
or bootstrap or anything like that that
people use reasonably frequently is that
anytime you design something like that
anytime you build something you're you
have to be pretty opinionated about it
and lots of people are going to either
really be excited about your opinions or
they're gonna you up about it so
you kind of have to can I do that
shout out to the haters yeah
so yeah exactly so you have to you have
to be pretty on point I guess you should
be pretty ballsy to do some of this
stuff so we're gonna build your own
framework it helps to just go out and
look and see like what's the absolute
best possible way I could do this thing
and that'll change in two months you're
not creating a framework for a huge
audience you're just creating it for a
specific product like they're not
necessarily like bootstrap or foundation
you're just creating more of a style
guide and a list of patterns and you
know how everything is gonna wear the
other way there's a couple ways you can
go about it one you can use someone
else's thing and you can pull whatever
you want from that both bootstrap and
foundation have a web-based customizer
so you can check oh I only need these
five components download that and use
that it's base if you wanted to right
I've given a talk in a couple places
called the future of frameworks
basically one of the things I have tried
to reiterate is it's real easy to make
what I'm calling compilation frameworks
and that's basically what a lot of our
current frameworks are you just mash
against you just mash together a bunch
of different things whether you made
them individually or if you made them
all just for the thing and it becomes a
framework like in both boots Jeff can
foundation we have normalized and we
have like a preprocessor we've got a
couple other things there's a lot of
other ones I'm good you take any grid
system you take some basic that POG rafi
scales which there's tons of both of
those you just Google grid system and
you're just gonna get pages and pages of
it same width type scale and you can
make some buttons make some forms in
table Styles and boom you've got the
basics of a framework and it's really
easy to put that stuff together
the put it together and making it work
on every device and testing all those
things sometimes you don't need to do
that you can go on your way to do that
if you want to make another one you can
fork bootstrap or foundation like
they're all they're both open source
that both MIT so you can do basically
whatever you want to them same with a
lot of the other frameworks and there
are a lot of frameworks out there that
you can began as Forks of bootstrap or
foundation there's actually some they're
fairly large now there's also a lot of
good examples out there if you if you
want to make like a style guide like for
your company or for yourself or
something like that there's a lot of
good examples now companies are getting
much more open about their style guides
so if you actually go out and look and
it there's a bunch of companies now that
actually publicly released their style
guides and they're coded style guides so
you can see what they're you know how
they put their components together and
what their pieces are there's a really
cool examples of that milk soup is a
really good campaign
it's a map box the first one I ever saw
it was actually for who did who did
Chris Epstein work for before he went to
go to LinkedIn no I do like caring I
think was caring calm Christine okay so
he Chris Epstein is one of the creators
of SAS and he was he's always been
really huge on on style guides so he
released one like quite a while ago and
released that one publicly so he's a
speaking of which um I'm sure what what
happened with less is less so part of
the chopper what is it what is it the
future so this guy named Alexi his user
names cloud head Jacob and I know him we
met him a couple of times he made less
as a preprocessor JavaScript JavaScript
based preprocessor I shouldn't set it
out at the Ruby but he turned into
JavaScript and when I was at Twitter
working on the earliest version of
bootstrap which was then a time he/she
called Twitter blueprint because was all
internal I use less because I wanted all
the power of pre-processors by the time
I didn't know what the hell a gem was
and that was required for sass and I was
like I don't know what's happening here
so I'm just gonna use JavaScript because
that makes sense and so less at the time
it's toxic and file you included it
compile your CSS and everything's
hunky-dory and so less has been a part
of bootstrap since the very beginning
and we've stuck with it because they've
done a lot of iterations over it feature
wise they're basically on par sass
versus less and things like that I said
more or less more or less the syntax is
widely different there's couple other
features we have an official sass port
for bootstrap since 3.1 and that's just
a conversion script that they run so I
converted from West assess like he's
writing script and you can do that so
it's kind of pretty crazy but some less
has historically run really fast for us
it runs in the browser powers our
customizer we know we knew the guys so
when we submitted pull requests be like
yeah just merge please merge like when
we wanted to change things unless which
actually did one of our releases we're
like yeah we need this for tomorrow just
ship it yeah
so which one do you this this is not to
put your on the spot or anything mark
but which one do you prefer to work in
it God goes backdoor for me
plastic so I working to get up we
everything is SAS for get up calm and
then I spend the other half the day and
last for bootstrap so literally out
really I'm either or at this point Alex
s we've always used we we built
foundation we rebuilt foundation in SAS
for foundation three because one of our
designers his name was Chris was really
hot to trot on SAS and he was like yeah
we're gonna SAS and I was like kind of a
curmudgeon about CSS I was like pre
processors are done but he got me on
board with SAS he got actually the whole
team on board with SAS and Serbs always
been a rails shop anyways so gems were
not really a problem yeah no problem
okay sorry hang on I should say gems are
not a problem for deserve they're still
sort of a problem for me because I
that's not really my scene but we have
our talented engineers who do that
so I've shout out to those guys who are
hey one of them's here one of them's
here but it's like this like stand the
tallest one anyways so yeah we've we've
always used SAS and I think I don't know
I think to be totally honest I've never
used less all that much I know a bit
about the differences between and the
syntactical differences between it but
not a whole lot I haven't really dealt
with it I've just always been in SAS
what do you guys think is gonna happen
in the future with less and sass and
other food processors do you see any
other ones coming I'm gonna merge become
laughs
as a stupid answer
I don't think they're both both have
their different opinions on how they do
things like the syntax you talk about
that and amatuer sets and everything
like that if you look at how to like
generate a list of classes just
programmatically from lessor success
it's gonna look wildly different and I
believe I think that the goal should be
that like basically make it so that
lesser sass don't exist like a lot of
this should just go back into CSS which
a lot of it already is they've got all
kinds of proposals for ways to put
variables and mix-ins or whatever the
less equivalent they're exactly into CSS
itself which would be definitely
preferable because having to run a
preprocessor just to get the browser to
recognize your stuff is not ideal it
would be nice if the browser could just
parse the stuff so that'll happen at
some point look I probably say minimum
of another five years we we just need
one of you all to create it that's all
so you're getting ideas tonight for
something to innovate them let's just
pretend that the CSS working groups can
get stuff done in less than like half a
decade so see what happens I'm gonna
pretend like I don't know them anyway um
so what are the pros and cons of using a
framework such as bootstrap or
foundation well sure I'll start hi okay
thanks appreciate pros and cons using
framework uh what is a lot pros of using
framework is there's a whole bunch of
stuff that you don't have to do other
people have already done a lot of heavy
lifting for you so you don't have to
worry about I mean there's there are a
lot of frameworks and there are a lot of
different ways of doing it so odds are
if you have a very particular opinion
about the kind of stuff that you want
you can find a framework that more or
less subscribes to that but there's
it'll take care of the grid for you
we'll take out a layout for you it'll
take care of in almost any case it'll
take care of responsive things for you
it'll take care of a lot of JavaScript
stuff for you one of the beautiful
things about frameworks foundation or
bootstrap or any of them really is that
if you don't know a lot of JavaScript
like a lot of designers myself included
uh you don't need to know a lot of
JavaScript to do really cool stuff with
these frameworks because someone has
already put in all the legwork to make
that work for you so there's a ton of
stuff that you just don't have to do
if you use a framework which is really
nice you also don't have to QA nearly as
much which is great in most cases if you
take a look at what browsers and devices
and such these frameworks support you
can rely with pretty good certainty on
the fact that unless you break it stuff
is going to work as you would expect in
pretty much any of these browsers and
devices I know I know it serve like that
was actually one of the biggest reasons
we made foundation at all and one of the
reasons we used it internally even
before we released it is just that we
would spend on any given client project
we would spend hours and hours and hours
doing QA well maybe you would I wouldn't
I said this works I walked I walked
right into that one
yeah you know other people would spend
hours and hours and hours on QA while I
laughed at them but we wanted it we
wanted to cut that time down so it was
like if we build a framework and we just
test the crap out of the framework then
we only have to test the stuff we build
on top of that which is much much
simpler and this was ok amelia's was
back when we still supported as long as
five years ago this was like ie6 and 7
and stuff this was like a world of pain
yeah who would develop an ie6 and you
know what's up anyone without your hand
up hate you so much
Thanks
some of the other pros like
documentation that is built for a lot of
these frameworks both for ours cuz we
put so much time into it but all the
other ones come really well documented
not only what you can do but also what
you can't do and we need both us given
the number of people that use these
things which is just outrageous I think
there was an article that I saw last
week I'd be here this week that said 5
million sites are using bootstrap and I
was just like I don't first of all I
don't know how you got that information
second of all it's really cool why isn't
it sighs third of all wasn't no but yeah
the documentation is just out of hand
out of control with how good it is for a
lot of these frameworks all these
frameworks basically some of the cons
it's easy to get stuck in what other
people are doing and sometimes you can
get down the pattern of hey let's just
do the same thing over and over again I
mean that's a lot of the point of this
like we don't want to do the same
over and over again but at some point
you have to say to yourself I need to do
something else on
top of this and it's easy to not get to
that point some of the other cons what
you might want in the framework might
not be what either of us want to do in
the framework we think we're both very
small teams that maintain the things
actively so when somebody says hey it
would be great if it did these 14 other
things I'll be like no we'll do this one
thing and that'll work for almost
everybody as much as we can so there's a
lot of back-and-forth and sometimes you
have to give it takes so and I mean any
any framework is at the end of the day
is a compromise to some extent because
you get a lot of stuff for free but you
get what the framework gives you and
that's that's all you're gonna get out
of us whatever the framework gives you
so it's so from the community aspect
there as well like the number of plugins
written for serving fund for Foundation
and bootstrap is just out of control as
well and you can find all those on
github for the most part as well right
there's a whole market and and um like
WordPress yes an entire business is on
top of these things which just blows my
mind every time I meet something talks
about that well for like tools that like
hisses I can make a foundation in
bootstrap website using like a WYSIWYG
editor or something like that yeah
there's a ton of those things
yeah it's outrageous them they're making
a lot of money creating an empire so so
this is one of one of the questions but
I am wondering is is there a particular
is there a way to develop these
frameworks so that way when you guys
come out with a new version it's easy to
a major version is it easy to upgrade we
want to be able to upgrade easily to the
next version and not have it break our
entire template I'm sure all of you guys
would who use the products would agree
with that it kind of depends on a
changes from version to version honestly
I mean right it really does lots of
things change from version to version we
I'm pretty sure you guys do the same
thing we try to follow roughly something
like semantic versioning which is
basically if it's if it's a major point
release if it's 3 to 4 4 to 5 5 to 6 you
can assume that we broke some things so
you're going to have to fix some things
if you want to upgrade that's sort of
unavoidable there's
I mean we make decisions for these
frameworks that are supposed to last for
a while but we have to change them at
some point there's gonna be a better way
of doing something or we're gonna look
back on something and go that was stupid
we did that maiya culpa we did that with
foundation for we in foundation for we
removed tabs in favor of this component
called sections which were this super
cool idea realistic job which was the
super cool idea which was most people
want tabs on larger screens but on
smaller screens they usually want those
tabs to turn into like an accordion
element so we thought man it'd be really
cool if we could just write one
component that just did that
automatically all the same markup it
would just transform into this other
thing really neat and and technically
fun to put together and an absolute
bloody nightmare to restyle or do
anything with and it was just not the
best so in foundation 5 we completely
removed that and we reinstituted tabs
and accordions as separate components
and came up with better ways of
switching between the two of them but it
meant that if you were upgrading from
foundation for to foundation 5 and you
had a lot of sections we broke all of
your so that's just I don't know
it's kind of kind of the way versioning
is hard
basically especially when you're doing
something that people build on late in
the rely on quite heavily for production
like bootstrap gets you've done a lot of
prototyping environments also this is
used on a lot of production sites and
when people depend on that to serve
their things entire businesses depend on
this kind of stuff like you got a
support as best you can so like John was
mentioned with assembler semantic
versioning if it's a like a 3.0 point
one release then presumably just bug
fixes these documentation changes if
it's a three point one release and
that's gonna be a new feature it's not
gonna be removing a feature butts gonna
be new stuff added if it's a major
change chances are we're probably gonna
break something and the reason before
that is the web kind of moves pretty
fast like really it moves pretty slow
because I still do the same crap we've
been doing the last five years but we're
getting better at it I was just talking
with some folks actually earlier about
this but um we have to break some things
we have to make your lives a little bit
harder so that we can help push
everybody forward obviously we're not
all working for i working on ie6 anymore
so like that's a good thing right so we
can't always keep supporting that old
stuff and a lot of sites no longer are
even are a lot of things actually guys
didn't even support ie8 anymore do you
really out of the box so yeah we still
do with the notion three
Brasserie sorry yeah bootstrap 3 hi bad
a lot of words okay
um and we'll drop that for a comfy for
cuz I yeah it's just keep going down
right so actually I what do you guys
think of the idea of having it update
automatically I know it's a bad idea but
some people take forever to update
there's this new thing I have to do it
I'm on the board 2x I get less time to
give a talk I update it to Mavericks the
night before everything went fine but it
was I was actually kind on edge the
entire day they turned night it was this
all the time we get all kinds of
requests that's like we just built our
website on foundation for and you just
released foundation 5 how do we upgrade
it's like you just built your website
gets it's fine you just built it but
it's not like they're not stopped
working right there were still good code
like it's still it's fine just don't
worry about it like when you're gonna
build the next thing build the next
thing in foundation fiber bootstrap for
a foundation 6 or whatever exists at
that time use that because there will be
some cool new things but you don't need
the cool new things every single time
especially this is like a this is a
coder nerd vs. business goals kind of
weird conversation to have where it's
like you can do the big new cool thing
and in all likelihood screw yourself and
your company so just it's not nearly as
urgent to upgrade as everybody thinks it
it's like the new versions are cool it's
still you're still okay everything minor
in patch of the shirt go for it but and
and I mean I think both bootstrap and
foundation have like pretty simple ways
when it's like small point releases to
do very easy upgrades especially use
like CDN there's a there's a bootstrap
CDN that's built by these MIT DNA guys
they just do it for free they'll host
right host at the hell foundation I
think to do that get it I think they
might want the version of it that was
bunch about the frame that'd be cool
they host found font awesome so if you
want icon fonts like you can just get it
super quick super easy so
and I know with icon fonts too if you
use the if use the SAS version of
foundation if you do like the command
line install it's all done through grunt
and Bower and you can just say update
and it'll just update things for you
it's pretty straightforward that doesn't
work from like five to six six doesn't
exist yet but it won't work for five
days so short answer yeah you can
upgrade when it's minor patch
but the big jumps we're gonna break
things so that we can stay sane there's
been one legacy code and just tried with
reform we usually have migration guys
anyway really all that people care about
is that it works and it looks good and
you know multiple works on multiple
browsers and devices so yeah that's it's
cool to worry about like the next big
cool thing like that's why we do
frameworks and generals to worry about
the next big cool thing but if you're
building like your company's website it
doesn't have to be the coolest latest
thing every single second of the day
like let it hang em in it and there are
we have things it's herbs still on
foundation 0.8 so there's we don't
update everything so so I wanted to go
ahead and open this up to the audience
for questions and we have somebody in
the back there but okay so she was
asking if we do anything for like the
the next big version of any of our
frameworks did we do anything to
validate whether we're really doing the
next the next right thing or the next
cool thing do we do like user testing do
we do any kind of any kind of like
discovery or validation around what it
is we're doing next I don't know you
wanna go first
absolutely Jonathan thank you very much
the problem so we do a couple we don't
do usability studies directly on
bootstrap I don't know if you guys do in
foundation we know but we listen to it
we get a lot of people who like give us
feedback both on Twitter or on Hacker
News or witch doctor news II can take or
leave but people also open a lot of a
cheese bootstrap to date so we we've
been out for over two and a half years
now and we're about to pass thirteen
thousand issues on github closed issues
and so we've gotten a lot of feedback a
lot of those are duplicates like hey you
spelled this word wrong but a lot of
more also really good feedback like hey
be awesome if we do this and the way I'm
handling that now for bootstrap 3 going
from 3 to 4 is we have a private repo
it's called a team repo on github and
there's an issue in there and whenever I
see something that we can't do for v3
because the breaking change or it's too
big or we're just not gonna be able to
get to it just because of our own
constraints do we all have like jobs to
be honest stuff I add a link to that
issue in this private issue but no one
else can say so my
self and my team are able to see this
and know hey this is stuff we need to
address in the next version so we're
always keeping track of this stuff as
much as we can do we give feedback to
people when we take those ideas do we
trust the people that are giving us
feedback sometimes if it's if they know
what they're doing I mean I know about
Jonathan I know everything okay okay
well I'll speak slightly on behalf of
you Oh everybody who works primarily
works primarily or in any kind of core
capacity and on anything on any of these
frameworks probably any framework at all
is how do I put this nicely an
egomaniacal control freak or a masochist
masochist bastard now we're just were
just very very opinionated yeah no
problem I assumed I could say that on
your behalf we're very very opinionated
and to some extent I mean there's
there's a lot of people who contribute
because we have the same sort of thing
with with foundation this scale of the
issues is slightly smaller but we get a
lot of good feedback through the issues
and you can typically tell from from you
know what someone is asking for what
someone's suggesting there's people who
put more time into their suggestions and
put more thought into what it is they're
looking for what they want than others I
mean there's plenty of people who are
just man it would be super cool if I
could have a button where when I click
on it the page spins around in a circle
and does this thing and it's like that's
cool that would be neat for you I guess
but there's no way we're gonna do that
and then there's people who have like
really good solid reasoning for what
they're looking for and those people you
there's no there's not a rule for it
there's not like a science really to it
it's just you look and you and you see
there are a couple signs like if you see
the same thing reported a couple of
times then you know hey I should look up
this in the future at the very least we
need to make a change shoot
documentation for why is this question
coming up over and over and over again
right and if there's a lot of people
saying hey man you really the bed
on this thing you should fix that then
it's like we should probably fix that so
you got like the group the crowd
mentality for that kind of stuff right
and that's the beautiful part of open
source and the hard part about open
source is letting all these people know
exactly what we're thinking without
over-promising or saying something we
don't mean or come
like an asshole because it's really easy
to do when you're just writing words you
don't pick up on all the context of the
tones it's really easy for mark it's
really easy for me to be a jerk I'm
sorry guys I just want to apologize in
advance to everybody on the internet so
we try to be nice and inclusive as
possible and a lot of times into you
just gotta call it like that sounds like
a great idea not something that we're
gonna work on and sometimes that's hey I
don't want to work on that and I don't
want have to maintain that and sometimes
just pure logistics that you can't make
it happen but some most frameworks also
have sort of work no one's gonna get to
ask any other questions we're just going
to talk most frameworks are have at
least some sort of like I don't know
guiding philosophy I guess to some
extent and some of that just comes from
where they originated yeah but I know
there's like there's frameworks where I
mean there's any number of things I'm
sure you could suggest to like bourbon
neat that they're not going to add
because they're incredibly opinionated
about what they include and it's like
basically nothing and I mean foundation
we have particular goals for Foundation
and what we want to do with Foundation
and I knew with bootstrap has the same
so there's times when yeah someone is
like a great idea and it's like what
that would be a really super cool thing
to have in you know pure and not in
foundation I'm not knocking pure Chum go
do that over there yeah we'll stop we'll
stop going on and on about next question
next along next hi
so to take up you know talk about
feeling guilty about these huge you know
super popular open-source project that
you create as creators of some of the
most popular frameworks on the internet
how do you feel about you know being you
know taking ownership and continue to
take ownership of these projects that
you create and do you ever get to that
point where you just think you know it's
time to move on you feel you feel guilty
really you feel guilty alright so Jacob
gave us what
me about foundation well so so what I
was gonna say about that it you got it
you got to see Jacobson tired talk about
this it's actually it's a really good
talk honestly it is and it's he talks
about what is open-source and why do I
feel so guilty it's really easy to burn
yourself out on anything as what we do
like it's easy to just be staring at the
screen doing the same old kind of stuff
for hours and hours and hours and we've
put thousands of hours into these things
my school's myself Jacob in and down in
here and sometimes yeah you can get
burnt out but the fact I'm still going
I'm still doing strong I think like I'm
think I'm alright a bit with it I could
go a little bit longer I'm slipping like
week I get like 60 notifications a day
just from bootstrap alone I get up so
like it sometimes it's hard to keep that
up and we've built up a team around it
so there's like four or three or four
other guys that helped me like triage
issues and like keep me fresh will come
to me with ideas they'll fix things for
me and just like nah man I got that but
so I final take care of that but it it
is tough to feel responsible for
everyone that's using your thing so like
those five million sites are using it's
like yo if I stop doing this or like I
just delete the repo I'm probably gonna
be crapping out a lot of people's hearts
hear about this stuff right and I'm like
I don't want to do that so it's not not
only is it the gift thing but it's also
like you feel like you really need to
you're definitely responsible for it
obviously you are the maintainer but
you're responsible for so many other
people and everything else like that and
that's why we version that's why we have
the issues and everything else like that
so oh no I think it's a it's a privilege
in large part I mean no definitely you
could have asked I'm gonna go and you
could have asked either of us five or
six or seven years ago hey are you going
to make a thing that hundreds of
thousands or millions or whatever people
are going to use and you're gonna be
responsible for that would be like you I
didn't see that happening new new new
new so it's it's quite a privilege and I
mean yeah it's a it's a occasionally
it's a heavy thing to think about but at
the end of the day I mean we're doing
our best there's lots of people who are
doing similar things if we screw
something up someone else is probably
gonna get it right and we all learn from
each other I mean I we learn from you
that's a really good point actually if
you feel like we screwed up you gotta
call us out on that what if I screwed up
tell me like if I misread your issue and
I just closed it and was a pretty
terrorist but he briefed about it you
talk to me like tell me about it like we
want to hear usually people come back on
that one yeah exactly not like you
closing there is
I believe I actually did watch Jacob I
watched your talk and I think that the
idea is that we all want to create and
we want to keep creating and keep making
like the next best thing but if you're
stuck updating and updating and working
on the same project then maybe you get
bored you don't feel like you're doing
enough like whatever you're doing
however much of it is it's never enough
like I can't spend one hour on
everybody's issue debugging it and
making like chest pains an example and
everything else like that and testing
every single device no no individual can
do that maybe larger teams can but that
I think is the guilty part is like
whatever we do no matter how much it is
there's always gonna be more that you
can do and deal you want that sometimes
when you stop think about it's like
I'm like letting these people down I'll
go through that every now and then but
how many people work on bootstrap and
foundation separately you can answer
that the core team for bootstrap is
myself Jacob a guy in Greece again a guy
in Germany and a guy so five people in a
guy and down in LA so it's five people
working with the core team foundation is
worked on by in some capacity other by
most of the design team most the
engineering team at ZURB so it's there's
probably seven or eight designers and
three or four engineers the touch
foundation on a fairly frequent basis
they do a lot of work for it a lot of
the time we also have two guys two or
three guys who do support and stuff for
foundation Marc do you work Marc
currently he moved to github at in 2012
correct do you work on on boot shop at
work or is it a separate project
sometimes yeah actually the the month
and a half before bootstrap 3 launched
that's all I worked on you know
everyone's familiar with github or
someone familiar get up there on the
profile page yes they know it's not just
knocking down there's this thing called
a contribution graph and represents
every day of the last year and you get a
green square if you like me to commit or
a comment mine are mostly only light
green and then there's the right in the
middle there's that month of like August
right before the release and it's just
the darkest green imaginable and it's
all from bootstrap just going to town on
it and sometimes you need to do that
it's great get up gives me the freedom
to do that as long as this isn't like
interfere with what I'm doing on daily
basis as long as I'm delivering and do
what I'm supposed to do that's great
and Keita actually has the kind of
environment we can work wherever and
whenever like most of our companies
remote so if you're more productive at
night doing get up things and work at
night on get up things like so by the
way your site your how like coding style
guy code guide if anybody if you guys
have not seen that you should look on
give us the URL but I guys crappy URL
just go to my github profile get about
console SMD o+ it's terribly got it all
wrong I'm just kidding alright so many
more questions whatever here sir we
could just we just merge like Voltron
into found Stratford food station
I like big station that you are is
there's like UI standard guidelines of
naming conventions what is the
difference in the naming conventions of
it was my preference documented and like
they try to be really like public and
like deliberate about like this BM block
on the modifier I don't like that so my
me holy nitpick with that is I don't
like these double dashes or double
underscores my own is like hey there's a
base class or a prefix and then you add
something to the end of it so like alert
is your base class and you have alert
danger alert success like and those the
base class has all the common stuff and
then you extend it or add stuff to it or
on the hopefully in the rare occasion
override stuff like that those I think
we actually use the same class names
yeah and you're like one third of the
water alerts your I think you're good to
go
I think I can do it with alerts I mean
with foundation one of the one of the
big things we wanted the foundation was
when we brought on new people observe we
wanted them to be able to get up to
speed very quickly so it was very
important us for it to have very very
very easily human readable syntax so
that's why if you go back a little ways
before we added in like a lot of
different good sizes and stuff
foundation was like eight columns
literally spelled out which was just
pretty straightforward as I gave a row
and eight columns we didn't prefix stuff
because we were building the sites
ourselves we didn't it wasn't even
prefix anything we can prefix things now
and we mention those sites next we
provide
like interfaces for building like you
take up a shop or a foundation
components or build a foundation or
pajetta site if you want to do that if
you want to go that route man bold move
definitely do it like that'll take a
good amount of time and effort I feel
but there are examples of other people
doing that in some capacity like hey I'm
gonna go the beach I brought our manila
foundation right foundation route and
hey we've got both options readily
available for you and fully support it
so we do have a lot of very similar and
to be totally honest we have a lot of
very similar components between
bootstrap and foundation in fact most
frameworks because there's only so many
things that most people need is building
blocks then we augment that and we do
new things but as far as like having
sufficiently compatible identical syntax
I mean just built a maybe in bootstrap
ten in the foundation 23 there you go
we're their great-great-great
grandchildren will be working on it
right hahaha all right we have another
question right here yes well mine's
better
I'm just kidding see I'm they get to do
a review at the time jerk response to he
asked what are some things to consider
when choosing between bootstrap and
foundation and I'll tell you what I'll
throw in and any other framework they
are both our frameworks and most
frameworks are reasonably opinionated
you probably have some sort of opinion
of your own I would look for something
that reasonably Maps to the way you want
to work and the way you want to write
things and the direction that you want
it to head historically all that marks
become you have bootstrap historically
one of the I mean guiding mantras for
foundation because of the way we built
it in the way we use it is we always
wanted foundation to be as easy to
modify and muck with and build your own
thing on top of it as possible to the
point that for a long time foundation
frankly was kind of ugly out of the box
it looks nicer now but we really didn't
want to have any kind of opinion on
anything we didn't want it to look like
anything so we we stay as true to that
as we possibly can so that's one thing
to at least consider I mean there's and
then there's other SAS versus less
there's all kinds of things I think the
biggest one used to be SAS horses last
assess being for foundation let's being
producer I used to believe that's now
not the case anymore because bootstrap
3.1 introduces the official SAS port
that's two other
two of the guys that makes it the main
team for that and they just run a script
like I said earlier and import
everything that we do and they're up to
date whenever we now when we release a
new version of bootstrap and less sass
part comes out the same day to Indian
wanked versions and released all at once
some of the other things some of the
components like if you go down to that
level like that use case as well Ivan
look too closely at the compiled code
for bootstrap or for a foundation for
bootstrap now I'm skinny but in
bootstrap
Jacob actually wrote this thing with a
couple of looks at Twitter but we've
called recess and that's what started
like our own less compiler and we did a
whole bunch of CSS linting basically for
powerful code is formatted like the
default less compilers just spit
everything out
wasn't that readable and we want to be
as available but we want this to be of
it is available to anybody of any skill
level any experience to help them make
something awesome with what we've done
so we make sure that our codes as
legible as possible at every single
level so not going to town on like
Nestene and less or sass like you can
get in rod trouble with that kind of
stuff not going over the board with
mix-ins and variables or though honestly
we kind of have and it's a people really
want those things a lot and then I
figure out the other one was but
something other that's cool yeah yes
it's one more question why because we
don't wanna you know unless you guys
want to keep it going keep asking more
questions up to you but I think it's
she's really excited okay also we're
gonna be here afterwards like doesn't
hang out so come ask us things hi weirdo
so I'm wondering if you could speak a
little bit to how an organization that
isn't really formally using these
frameworks can get started using these
frameworks who and then how who should
be involved in that is design
engineering how should those different
people or groups be involved in terms of
adapting the processes and making
decisions on some level all those people
need to be involved at least a little
bit because you need buy-in from a lot
of people to make something like this
work as far as getting started I think
both of us have pretty good getting
started documentation I know with
bootstrap we have hey what is bootstrap
what's the story
what's all included and then how to use
it we have like some quick starts - for
downloading downloading compiled stuff
using a CDN and then going a little bit
more about how to extend it and stuff
like that so as far as finding out what
it can do for you and how to get started
with it both are we pretty well
documented for that that process as far
as involved that all depends on your
organization and your team so you need
to talk to those people at the very
least I would include design and
engineering yeah a lot of companies
lookie here like oh like no designers
are off doing their own damn thing and
they're like now the engineers don't
listen to us just stop that just talk to
people like we're all smart intelligent
good-looking people trying to do awesome
 on the Internet
let's just keep doing that with each
other and like good things will happen
so it's I mean you it's important to get
buy-in on big decisions like this and
you know what's part of your stack is
kind of a kind of a big deal because
your if you if you build on top of
bootstrap or foundation then you don't
want to do that for a month and then rip
it out and switch it to something else
you're just you're just burning yourself
so you have to kind of commit to it I
would say for both both our frameworks
and for a number of others it's it's
good to investigate like what are the
you know what are the community
resources what are the other resources
that are gonna be available what kind of
power if something doesn't work what are
you gonna do I'll throw in the plug for
ZURB here just because a foundation is
really core to our business foundation
is is one of the four major things that
we do which means that we do things like
paid support and we do things like
consulting implementation that kind of
stuff bootstrap has an enormous
community of people to ask questions to
and figure things out with any of these
frameworks I mean the people behind them
are pretty approachable too so I mean
you can always ask questions of things I
know mark will answer questions about
thing the whole answer questions about
things various people from ZURB which
there's a whole little cadre of them
over there there's a little crew will
answer questions about things we all try
to be pretty approachable like Mark said
definitely design and engineering if
this is assuming that your design team
does anything with code or cares there's
they should and they absolutely should
designers should code at least front end
stuff they don't need to go way into the
weeds but they need to know how things
work anybody who's gonna have to touch
this code should be involved in some
level the decision-making
it's I would I would say fairly
confidently that using a framework is
almost all the time a good business
decision because you're gonna take
advantage of a lot of somebody else's
work and save yourself a lot of time and
a lot of pain so that's the pitch that I
usually make to businesses that want to
get on board with a framework did that
answer your question are we just
rambling okay cool okay so I'm just
we're gonna give you you guys need to
get a closing statement Oh
starting with mark thank you all for
coming out I have lots of stuff to give
you I brought plenty of stickers from
github good ones too not just the
original ones and I have shirts and I
only brought them a couple limited
shirts so if I have your size and you
come up and you're nice enough then you
can assure it or a sticker or a moleskin
thank you for coming again thank you
with all your swag this guy I
don't have a shirt done though that's
how he got a hundred thousand plus
followers he sent them actually wait do
I go yeah I thought you liked Marcel
thank you very much for coming we really
appreciate it
I'll speak slightly on behalf of Mark
and I wishes that like I said neither of
us would have dreamed quite some time
ago that we would have done any of this
kind of stuff or worked on this kind of
stuff so it's really flattering and and
I'm not gonna say humbling because we
both have enormous egos but it's very
flattering to see all these thank you
very much for coming I also have things
to give you if you want like cool
foundation stickers there you know it's
it's not an octa cat it's a Yeti but I
think I got hella octa cats though I
think we can go toe to toe I mean it's a
Yeti it's it's big it's it's got claws
and whatnot so there's some things come
come talk to us about anything we moat
that a lot of the fun of how many of
these things is hearing from interesting
people so come talk to us
but thank you very much thank you John
and Mark thank you thank you Andy
they do Eventbrite thank you to Denis
Denis Sardinas and to evan over at new
circle we'll have the video online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
