present a few data points on app gaming
I actually used to write a lot about
mobile as well 3g 4g wimax if anyone
still remembers what that is but over
the last three years have been focusing
primarily on video games and we do a lot
of research and consulting for the big
publishers as well as the small startups
including a lot of social and mobile
gaming companies as well so you've heard
the other the other analysts mission
gaming being one of the top categories
today in-app space so I'm just going to
drill down a little bit deeper on some
of the trends in smartphone gaming as
well as tablet gaming so as you can see
from this slide about eighty-one percent
of all the iphone owners actually
downloaded one plus apps in the last
month compared to about seventy four
percent of the android users and out of
the top apps this was fairly consistent
to what yannis and david presented
earlier social networking weather and
games are the top three categories
across both platforms so clearly a
gaming is what a lot of the people are
doing when they are spending time on
their smartphones and about forty one
percent of all the smartphone owners
actually have played games or use the
game app on their smartphone over the
last month and all the data points come
from one of our syndicated offerings
called new media measure on a quarterly
basis we actually a survey 9000
consumers in the US and we've been doing
that for the last 20 quarters so a lot
of these data points came from that data
set and I couldn't believe my number
matches exactly with your number yannis
fifty-three percent of the female fifty
fifty three percent
the smartphone gamers are actually
female I think that's exactly your
number as well and there are on average
32 years old and if you look at the
split Android and iOS platforms about
forty three percent of the smartphone
gamers came from the Android platform
about thirty percent came from the
iPhone platform although gaming is
actually more active and more popular on
the iPhone but as you saw from the
earlier presentations the penetration of
Android has really caught up and that
kind of contributed to a bigger share
for Android here and if you look at the
slide the chart below you can see as I
mentioned the iphone gamers or iOS
gamers they are a little bit more active
playing games than the Android
counterparts about forty two percent of
them have played games over the last
month and versus thirty-seven percent
for the Android users some more
comparison between the two platforms the
percentage of those people who have
downloaded one plus apps in the past
month among the iphone gamers the
percentage of people who have downloaded
a free app is about eighty eight percent
very similar to the android platform but
what you notice here is among people who
actually downloaded apps a much much
larger percentage have downloaded a paid
app on iphone vs android actually the
percentage doubles forty-four percent
versus 22% so as yannis mentioned
earlier iphone still monetizes a lot
better for various reasons and android
is a very fragmented market right now
and the monetization mechanism is not as
good as on iphone yet and also if you
look at this from another angle if you
look at the total numbers of apps
downloaded by iphone gamers versus
Android gamers it's 7.5 over the last
past month for iphone gamers versus 6.9
for android gamers over
last month and also among the seven
point five games the iphone gamers
downloaded they actually purchased about
twenty percent of those verses among
android gamers only ten percent were
actually purchased or paid for and all
the others are free apps the other thing
you want to pay attention to is the ipad
i mean this device is definitely
revolutionising the gaming space just
like the iphones and the ipod touch did
on the mobile platform and gamestop is
coming out with their own tablet later
this year or early next year so clearly
they view this as an important platform
for the gaming industry and just over
less than two years now you have eight
million gamers playing on ipad in the US
alone and a year ago that number was
only 3.5 million and what's more
important is the diversification of
people who actually play on ipad you're
looking at a much larger percentage of
females now it's forty-eight percent
versus forty percent from q3 of last
year and also a slightly older
demographics as well 35 plus it's about
forty percent compared to thirty percent
a year ago it is fascinating because my
wife never picked up a controller in her
whole life and then she's been playing
plants vs zombies and now she's like
level eight and clearly killing zombies
was a good way to relieve stress before
she goes to bed and my my two daughters
I've got a seven year old and the three
year old they've been actually competing
against my wife on the iPad my
three-year-old we used to only have one
and my three-year-old every time I go on
a business trip and took my iPad she's
asking her mom she's like mommy mommy
where's my ipad so translates her ipad
and my seven-year-old place lego harry
potter on the ipad as well so it's
definitely introducing a whole new
demographics onto the gaming platform
and eventually I had to convince my
company to get me a work iPad so I can
play games as well now if you look at
their behavior on other platforms very
consistent to the demographics trends
about forty percent of the people who
are currently playing I've had games
they've never played on console like
what had mentioned about my wife
compared to only thirty percent a year
ago so and what was the interesting was
these new people who are introduced to
the platform they do spend money
although they don't spend as much as the
people who also play console games but
the bottom table shows even among people
who don't play console games and only
play ipad games about fifty two percent
of them have downloaded paid apps over
the last month and on average they've
downloaded almost two paid games over
the last month so definitely it's
introducing a whole new demographics to
the market and also new monetization
opportunities and new types of gameplay
experience for the market and there is a
reason Nintendo just came out today and
said they will be expecting a recurring
loss for a pretty significant number for
the for the next few quarters and I
think it's a hundred billion yen or
something and you you just wonder how
iOS and other smartphone tablet devices
actually played into that so that's my
presentation and we have about five
minutes for the audience to ask some
questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
