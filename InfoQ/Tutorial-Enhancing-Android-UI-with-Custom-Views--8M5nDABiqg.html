with double
core and an Android instructor here at
new circle today I'm going to walk you
through the process of building custom
views and view groups on Android as
developers building custom view
components is a necessary part of
embracing creative UI design we
shouldn't be afraid to implement a
designer's unique vision just because
the framework or the community doesn't
provide a component that will do the job
for us out of the box getting our hands
dirty in this area is a great way to
build great apps there are many great
advantages to building your own UI
components such as the ability to have
full control of how your content is
displayed but one of the best reasons to
become an expert at custom view creation
is the ability to flatten your view
hierarchy one custom view can be
designed to do the job of several nested
framework widgets and the fewer views
you have in your hierarchy the better
your application will perform our first
example will be a simple widget that
displays a pair of overlapping image
logos with a text element on the right
and vertically centered you might use a
widget like this to represent the score
of a sports matchup for example when we
build custom views there are two primary
functions that we must take into
consideration measurement and drawing
let's have a look at measurement first
before a view hierarchy can be drawn the
first task of the android framework is a
measurement pass in this step all the
views in the hierarchy will be measured
top down meaning measure starts at the
root view and trickles through each
child view each view receives a call to
on measure when its parent requests that
it update its measured size it is the
responsibility of each view to set its
own size based on the constraints given
by the parent and store those
measurements by calling set measured
dimension forgetting to do this will
result in an exception each view is
given to packed in in on measure these
are called measure specs and there's
something that the view should inspect
to determine how to set its
is a measure speck is simply a size
value with a mode flag encoded into its
high order bits there are three possible
values for a specs mode unspecified at
most and exactly unspecified tells the
view to set its dimensions to any
desired size at most tells the view to
set its dimensions to any size less than
or equal to the given spec exactly tells
the view to set its dimensions only to
the size given this is a helper utility
here that I often use to quickly size
most custom views as it provides general
behavior needed in most situations it
may also be important to provide
measurements of what your desired size
is for situations where wrap content
will be used to layout the view here is
the method we use to compute the desired
width for our custom view example we
obtained with values for the three major
elements in this view and return the
space that will be required to draw the
overlapping logos and text
similarly here is the method our example
uses to compute the desired height value
this is governed completely by the image
content so we don't need to pay
attention to the text element when
measuring in this direction here's a tip
to help keep you on the right track
don't spend time testing and overriding
States you don't need unlike the
framework widgets your custom view only
needs to suit your applications use case
over optimizing the code to handle
measurement states that will never occur
in your application is a waste of time
and effort place your custom view inside
its final layout inspect the values the
framework gives you for measure specs
and then build the measuring code to
handle those specific cases a custom
views other primary job is to draw its
content for this you are given a blank
canvas via the ondraw method this canvas
is sized and positioned according to
your measured view so the origin matches
up with the
up left of the view bounds canvas
supports calls to draw shapes colors
text bitmaps and more many framework
components such as drawable images and
text layouts even provide their own draw
methods to render their contents onto
the canvas directly which is what we
have taken advantage of in this example
you may find yourself wanting to provide
attributes to your custom view from
within the layout XML we can accomplish
this by declaring a styler bilac in the
project resources this block must
contain all the attributes we would like
to read from the layout XML when
possible it is most efficient to reuse
attributes already defined by the
framework as we have done here we are
utilizing existing text and drawable
attributes to feed in the content
sources and text styling information the
view should apply during view creation
we use obtain styled attributes to
extract the values of the attributes
named in our style able block this
method returns a typed array instance
which allows us to retrieve each
attribute as the appropriate type
whether it be a drawable dimension or
color
don't forget typed arrays are
heavyweight objects and they should be
recycled immediately after all the
attributes you need have been extracted
now that we've seen how easy it is to
build our own custom content into a view
what about building a custom layout
manager widgets like linear layout and
relative layout have a lot of code in
them to manage child views so this must
be really hard right well hopefully this
next example will convince you that this
is not the case here we are going to
build a view group that lays out all its
child views with equal spacing in a
three by three grid this same effect
could be accomplished by nesting linear
layouts inside of linear layouts inside
of linear layouts creating a hierarchy
many many levels deep
however with just a little bit of effort
we can drastically flatten that
hierarchy into
something much more performant just as
with views view groups are responsible
for measuring themselves for this
example we are computing the size of the
view group using the frameworks get
default size method which essentially
returns the size provided by the measure
speck in all cases except when an exact
size requirement is imposed by the
parent view group has one more job doing
measurement though it must also tell all
its child views to measure themselves we
want to have each view take up exactly
one third of both the containers height
and width this is done by constructing a
new measure spec with the computed
fraction of the view size and the mode
flag set to exactly this will notify
each child view that they must be
measured to exactly the size we are
giving them one method of dispatching
these commands is to call measure on
every child view but there are also
helper methods inside a view group to
simplify this process in our example
here we are calling measure children
which applies the same spec to every
child view of course we are still
required to mark our own dimensions as
well via set measure dimension before
returning from this method after
measurement view groups are also
responsible for setting the bounds of
their child views through the on layout
callback with our fixed size grid this
is pretty straightforward we first
determined based on index which row and
column the view is in we can then call
layout on the child and we can set its
left right top and bottom position
values notice that inside layout we can
use the get measured width and get
measured height methods on the view as
well these will always be valid at this
stage since the measurement pass comes
before layout and this is a handy way to
set the bounding box of each child view
here's another tip measurement and
layout can be as simple or complex as
you make it it is easy to get lost at 10
getting to handle every possible
configuration change that may affect how
you layout child views stick to writing
code for the cases your application will
actually encounter while view groups
don't generally draw any content of
their own there are many situations
where this could be useful there are two
helpful instances where we can ask view
group to do some drawing the first is
inside of dispatch draw after super has
been called at this stage child views
have already been drawn and we have an
opportunity to do additional drawing on
top in our example we are leveraging
this to draw gridlines over our box
views the second is using the same on
draw callback as we saw before with view
anything we draw here will be drawn
before the child views and thus will
show up underneath them this can be
helpful for drawing any type of dynamic
backgrounds or selector states if you
wish to put code into the on draw the
view group you must also remember to
enable drawing callbacks with set will
not draw false otherwise your ondraw
method will never be triggered this is
because view groups by default have self
drawing disabled so back to attributes
for a minute what if the attributes we
want to feed into the view don't already
exist in the platform and it would be
awkward to try and reuse one for a
different purpose well in that case we
can define custom attributes inside of
our style block the only difference here
is that we must also define the type of
data that attribute represents something
we did not need to do for the framework
since it already has them predefined
here we are defining a dimension and a
color attribute to provide the styling
for the boxes gridlines
via XML now we can apply these
attributes externally in our layouts
notice that attributes defined in our
own application package require a
separate namespace that points to our
internal apk resources notice also that
our custom layout behaves no differently
then the other layout widgets in the
framework we can simply add child views
to it directly through the XML layout
file just for fun we will even include
the layout inside itself to create the
full nine by nine effect that you saw in
the earlier screenshot we have also
defined a slightly thicker grid
separator to distinguish the major
blocks from the minor blocks I hope that
now you can see how simple it is to get
started building custom views and
layouts reduce dependence on the
framework Ridgid s-- leads to better
user interfaces and less clutter in your
view hierarchy your users and your
devices will thank you for it be sure to
visit the github link to find full
examples shown here as well as others to
help you get comfortable building custom
views thanks for your time today
and I hope you learn something new
