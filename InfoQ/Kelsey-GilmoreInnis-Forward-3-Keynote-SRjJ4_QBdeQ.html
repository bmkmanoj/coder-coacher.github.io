coffee or y'all good I know it's like
the middle of the night by programmers
standards so thank you for coming out so
early um my name is Kelsey go Martinus I
am a lady programmer and I grew up in
San Francisco which means that I get to
repeat the answer to the first two
questions anyone asked me like yes
really yeah I know I don't look like one
yeah I know you don't know anyone else
um yeah that was a treat that I mean
you're half-hearted chuckles are like
IRL faves um y'all on Twitter or
Facebook like some kind of online
platform to get into arguments with
strangers anybody yeah yeah some of you
right like fighting about like bin
versus Emacs or like whatever the
JavaScript version of that is vampire
weekend versus MGMT or whatever um
that's a 2009 zinger you can follow me
for the up-to-date ones so this is um
the kind of thing I get into a fight
with like fights about a lot on the
internet um this is a tweet it's like a
quote from a 1933 text book about San
Francisco and it's talking about the
gold rush and how the people who were
already there were super mad that the
people came in and spent all this money
and like huh and they didn't they say
that we're ruining San Francisco's
heritage and like what like come on like
this is I on makes me so mad like really
like the gold rush like the gold rush
was like large-scale massacres of
natives there was pogroms against
Latinos there was legal massacres of
Chinese people and like we're still
dealing with the environmental
devastation that that wrought in the
northern part of California and you want
to align our industry with that like
okay like blue jeans blue jeans were
pretty great like I'm not I can't deny
that from the gold rush but everything
else like that's such garbage it makes
me so mad um and like I it makes me so
mad and I i checked i literally gotten
three separate fights about this tweet
when it first was going around like with
strangers I didn't know any of the
people involved um the internet it's
awesome and so when Brian really
generously invited me to come speak and
asked if I went to keynote and you know
that was super generous thank you and he
really trusting Lee said I should just
talk about something I'm passionate
about which was really
trusting and I'm sorry um I thought you
know I'm going to talk about this and
I'm gonna like maybe um live up to a
promise I made on Twitter a while back
which is to sort of address what bothers
me about this and what bothers me about
it is that it aligns the industry i work
with with it's like gross and
destructive force but it's also like
super ignorant like do you people really
think that like the gold rush happened
49ers and then we like SAT around on our
hands for like 150 years took a break to
jam with Jerry Garcia and then like
thank God Silicon Valley came and Steve
Jobs invented computers and we were safe
like that's so inaccurate it's such a
weird casting of San Francisco history
you're like SF as such a boom-and-bust
town well you've named two if you count
this one with the last one which you
probably should um that's it though
right you've got this huge gap and all
those people in the gold rush got got
here and the gold and the products that
they bought with the gold got out some
kinda way right as our cultural
developed in California ninety percent
of products that left the state left
through the port of San Francisco
shipping is a huge part of san francisco
history um oakland became the area's
main port in 1964 reasons i'm going to
go to into like shortly but the bay is
still one of the three principal
gateways on the west coast for goods to
come in and out of the country and
there's so much to learn as an industry
that's based here and has deep roots
here from that industry and from all
those years and so i want to take this
probably undeserved opportunity to talk
to you guys a little bit about that so
this is a celebrated figure from that
industry and era and i want to talk
about his work and some of the lessons
we can take from that as tech workers
and in the tech industry this is Harry
bridges he is a beloved figure in the
Bay Area commemorated in song from pete
seeger to rancid that's all of the types
of songs there are um the ferry plaza
actually is named after him that's the
Harry bridges plaza in front of a ferry
building you've probably been there and
that was named 100th anniversary is
death and speeches given by Nancy Pelosi
Barbara Boxer big political figures
celebrating him yesterday was actually a
port holiday for his 114 birthday so I
want to tell you a little bit Harry
bridges and his work and what we could
draw on
on his legacy to inform our work here in
the tech industry so Harry bridges was
an Australian immigrant he went to us to
get age 16 in Australia he came to SF in
1922 and he would live here the rest of
his life he left the c-4 longshoremen
work what longshoremen do is they pack
boats and they unload them at dogs they
work exclusively on land but they're a
critical part of the shipping industry
he was a rank-and-file member of the
longshoreman's Union he rose to
prominence due to his role in the 1934
strikes which were a really big deal up
and down the west coast he led the
membership quite literally he's the
second one from the left there in a
coast wide strike shutting down the
docks shutting down all shipping
industry all up and down the west coast
of the United States and Canada to
support workers rights that called that
1934 strike culminated in bloody
Thursday which was Thursday July fifth
nineteen thirty-four the Industrial
Association of the docks asked the
police to use force to reopen the port
they threw tear gas they charged the
crowd Mounted Police and they ended up
firing on the crowd with a shotgun and
all the crowd and on Locker onlookers
they were shot and two were killed there
was a huge amount of outrage this
picture is of the two men's funeral
walking down coming down Market Street
you can see the sort of scale and what
happened is the outrage was so high in
1934 that there actually it actually
prompted a general strike so Harry
bridges who is the leader of the
longshoremen went to other unions and
said we cannot stand for this kind of
violence against workers who are
exercising their rights to ask for for
good conditions and the other the other
unions were like yeah that's not cool
we're going to strike with you is shut
down the city shut down up and down the
coast and ended up getting the
concessions they asked for this is a big
part of history um I wanted to address
what its what actually was for so we if
you've even learned about labor history
which may depend on the curriculum of
the state that you grew up in um you
probably heard it you know in this sort
of stroke struck for better working
conditions and that's true but I wanted
to get specifically into what those
working conditions were in this 1934
strike because I think it's pretty
instructive for some of the things
changes and reforms we're trying to do
in the tech industry so they weren't
just work striking for better working
conditions they were specifically
writing for changes around higher and
the hiring process for longshoremen in
1934 around the world was called the
shape up it was a basically you would
show up at the at the docks or at the
plaza in front of the dogs which is why
the Ferry Building clauses named after
Harry bridges and you would you would
show up very early potentially even days
before a ship came into port and you
would hope to get chosen Biden's foreman
it was a ritual of humiliation it was
marked by nepotism and bribery if the
foreman would often were very corrupt
would often make people go through
extraordinary trials to get these jobs
would require them to take out loans
that they would then ask for huge
interest rates back on it was it was a
bad system and the strike in 1934 was to
establish hiring halls and what a hiring
hall is is it's worker control over job
distribution the way that it worked was
to get assigned to a boat instead of
going through these Foreman in this
corrupt system you would go to the
hiring hall and the Union dispatchers
who were democratically elected at least
on the west coast long story menion
unions would distribute the jobs
equitably made rotate through the
members who had worked the least the
idea being should try to distribute the
wages across the set of union members
that everyone got a living wage they
also again on the west coast and hiring
halls use the hiring halls to uh to
punish or to have some sort of control
over folks who had broken various rules
some of those work related if you worked
more than 120 hours a month you were
taken off the assignment because the
assumption was you were going to drive
working conditions to wood to a standard
that was unbeatable also if you did
things like like make racist comments
you can be kicked out of the hiring hall
hiring hall rotation apprenticeships and
working new members into the industry
and into the work also captain through
hiring halls and in many industries
nowadays there you unionize the training
systems and the ways of getting new
people into the fields are controlled by
the workers and this is really
astonishing to me as someone who has
followed as a programmer right where we
have these sort of like paroxysms of
like oh like whiteboard interviews right
like the I think a lot of people would
say that our hiring processes are on
I think it's it's patently evident but
the result of our hiring processes are
totally an equitable and totally don't
reflect the general population or even
the population of applicants but we seem
to be leaning on the goodwill of our
employers to fix it and what was really
interesting about this is they did try
that but this strike came after a
combination of these long sermon and
other union members realizing we cannot
count on employers to do the right thing
they will literally never do the right
thing by us they have no there is no
such thing as moral suasion when you're
dealing with that corporation that's
really interesting it really opens my
eyes to what we could ask for or how we
could conceive a fair process in tech
hiring and in tech the tech pipeline the
hiring hall it again it transferred
hiring control all the way over to the
union it was the cornerstone of the
longshoremen unions power continues to
be and that union is a union that Harry
bridges would continue to leave to over
40 years so establishing this hiring
hall was really how he got his power get
a couple things out of the way about
this Harry bridges was a communist
there's arguably whether he was
card-carrying he was certainly Marxist
definitely no no doubt of that the
government repeatedly tried to deport
him for that that doesn't disqualify you
from being a local here in San Francisco
um also yes longshoreman's unions do
famously have ties to organized crime a
little spoiler alert for the wire it's
actually fictional I didn't know if you
know that but not only is it fictional
it's the key point here is it set in
Baltimore East Coast longshoreman
belonged to the international
longshoremen's association Harry bridges
union is the International longshore and
warehouse Union they actually seceded
from the east coast union shortly after
the strike because Harry bridges Union
and the West Coast unions felt that the
East Coast Union social conservatism was
not okay their policies about race and
about immigration and just generally
about social conditions were not
acceptable they actually stood alone
they were affiliated with no national
union leadership in the 1950s because of
that communist thing as a result there's
isn't much organized crime involvement
in the West Coast longshoreman's Union I
know in 2013 they actually once again
left national union leadership because
of the of the national support or
punitive immigration laws and lack of
support for for universal health and
that's it's important because
fundamentally the ILWU and Harry bridges
local 10 which was his home local of
that Union it's fundamentally a union
that takes a stand and took a stand on
social issues it was actually fully
integrated from the beginning its
majority black it's always had black
leadership the local ten was and that's
partially strategic one thing Harry
bridges realized really early on is that
lily-white unions mean a steady source
of potential strike breakers but it was
he he acted on that desire he went out
and did outreach to Black Dog workers at
a concerted effort to recruit African
Americans into the local ten and as a
result they stood much stronger for it
they also spoke out strongly against
Japanese internment one of the only
organizations in the country or people
in the whole country to speak out
against Japanese internment in Congress
and then asked as the war ended they
worked to get japanese-americans back in
jobs at the docks again acting on that
conviction um the Chester Chavez is
delano grape boycott in the 60s was a
farm workers union strike but the farm
owners hired scabs to come in and pick
the grapes when the grapes got to the
docks on the west coast the a
longshoreman refused to load the scab
grapes in support of the farm workers
who are working to better their
conditions they also led anti-apartheid
protest why I was late but my cab driver
on the way over was like oh the
longshoreman I went and blocked the
boats with them in the 80s which was
super exciting to me um they actually
blocked ships South African ships from
loading or unloading on West Coast dogs
and what I point out about all of these
these are not statements being made
they're not vocal statements of support
or written statements of support they're
very much economic actions which i think
is really critical right these are all
actions that take a specific approach to
an issue and say we're going to we see
ourselves as dock workers as part of
this broader economy and when there are
injustice is happening that are
perpetrated by that economy we have a
duty and a right
to act on them why do I think that's
important well this is where i plug my
 and hopefully get this Macy Gray
song stuck in your head um come to my
talk my talk this afternoon is all about
the tech economy and what kind of
political change that's funding in ways
that we are directly and indirectly
funding police militarization and school
privatization and you know you walked by
today a protest right and I've heard
some of you last night say I don't get
it Apple's not a presenter here why are
they even picketing right I'm presenting
on an apple laptop I know some of you
write software for Apple machines this
is it's really ostrich heady to pretend
like we don't participate in an economy
that uplifts apple and if they're doing
things to their workers that are unfair
I don't know it's up it's your
conscience right but I see a strong
argument from a moral compass that
stands against that and asked to act
with that so if I don't think I want to
talk to you about about Harry bridges
and the ILWU as regard to tech is
containerization I have in my notes
docker joke here um so so actually like
real I'm talking about real physical
containerization which was the move from
from shipping individual goods in
various shapes on a boat to putting
everything in containers and shipping
them in containers which were
transferred directly to rail or truck
shipping and doing the warehouse
processing elsewhere not on the dots
this was a huge revolution in the world
economy and in fact is probably uh
behind a good amount of the
globalization that's happened in the
last 40 or 50 years oh I started reading
about this it is fascinating i give a
whole talk about it like dr cohn call me
like i want to talk to you guys about it
but I'm gonna wrap it up many many
people were caught off guard by this so
this is a big it's basically a form of
automation right because a lot of the
work in packing and unpacking those
boats no longer exists when you're
shipping in containers or it exists in a
different place it ended up causing a
ninety percent reduction in the number
of workers needs on the docks which is a
huge deal when you think about all the
different people that those jobs used to
support
um Harry bridges and the ILWU signed
what is to this day still very
controversial agreement in 1960 called
the mechanization and modernization act
it actually guaranteed wages for dock
workers the agreement basically was an
instrument to pass on some of those
savings caused by automation
industrialization to the workers who had
provided for that economic growth of the
dock in the first place um one detail I
find pretty interesting about this is
that management pushed very hard for
these concessions from the Union to
allow this kind of stuff and then once
it was signed they proceeded to squeeze
every inch out of labor they increased
the loads too dangerous amount they
refused to upgrade cranes that were
dangerous and they actually had like a
switching of sides where the Union went
back and forced them to make the capital
investment that would make this a
workable system that wouldn't main
workers and wouldn't wouldn't force
workers to loads that would cripple them
this is a mixed bag it's still
controversial there were fewer jobs it
definitely happened it came in the
context in the 60s which I didn't know
as much about till I started reading
about containerization of automation
being a huge deal to factory workers in
general and actually JFK said in 1962 I
regard it as the major domestic
challenge of the 60s to maintain full
employment at a time when automation is
replacing men and what this agreement
did the Harry bridges and the ILWU
agreement did it insisted that workers
deserve to be treated humanely as their
jobs were eliminated and that's a
physician that very very few other
places in American culture took and that
to this day we don't really honor we see
this happening now I'm sure a lot of you
are dry I hope that a lot of you are
drawing conclusions in your own mind to
how this is happening with the service
industry with a lot of the tech that we
built I think it's worth thinking about
what is our what are humane obligations
when we're building this tech that's
putting be a lot of work I also think
that um it's worth thinking about how
this might affect our own jobs I made it
offer joke but how many of you guys
build services that are sold to other
deaths anybody that's a big thing right
or services that are intended to
increase productivity increasing
productivity is not necessarily a net
good when you're talking about people's
jobs and livelihoods
so are we like longshoremen um I think
there's an obvious difference right
which is that dock work is physically
arduous and dangerous I mean you know we
probably need to stretch more we've got
some carpal tunnel issues but like
obviously we're not we're not at that
level right but I also think that a lot
of the impulse to say that we're
different we are not working class we
don't do working class labor it's
probably based somewhat imbalance or min
work requires training it's experience
judgment and work ethic like many of the
things we do I think we sometimes
overstate the amount of creativity not
to mention many creative fields are
involved collective bargaining or
labouring labor agreements it's not
necessarily in either or like our jobs
longshoremen jobs are paid well they're
paid well by dint of a strong union
protecting them in many years of bitter
fights were paid well by dint of a
temporary labor shortage that's maybe
like buttressed by our shitty an
unwelcoming culture like I I mean
honestly it's worth sitting down and
thinking about why you're paid so much
and whether you will be in the future um
and you know it's kind of scary we are
privileged and I don't want to minimize
that right like I think you you don't
want to stop you don't want solidarity
to erase differences and privilege and
we're especially privileged because that
pipeline into programming depends on so
much privilege already that said we are
paid well but we're taking on a tiny
fraction of the enormous amount of
capital we're generating and you look at
the throughput of money that's going on
in the tech industry and it starts to
make these six figure salaries which you
know as I said are not really guaranteed
by anything and many people see them
disappear as simply as they age or
procreate seem like a smaller and
smaller fraction and I think one of the
main differences right is the narrative
of success and it bothers me if one of
the advertisements for this conference
build those of us speaking as JavaScript
thought leaders um if there's a thought
I'm gonna leader this is it get ready um
I think that our narratives of success
are both they manage to be both
unrealistic and far too small I don't
want to dream about being the next Steve
Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg that's an absurd
third goal to sell one because that's
never going to happen I don't have the
resources access or network to get there
it's a fairy tale right it's a crumb
throne to keep us complacent and frankly
to keep us implicitly threatened and we
have real reason to criticize leadership
or to criticize labor conditions more
than that though like fucus sheryl
sandberg if people who work for her
can't feed their families like what the
hell kind of dream is that really to be
that elite that's leading companies and
industries that do so poorly by such a
majority of people I believe we can
dream bigger than just why you know
widening the potential demographic
profile from which a really tiny elite
class is drawn I really I believe in us
um am I here to organize you well I
don't talk to me up there ah i don't i
don't know that i am i will say this
what I'm here to do is I want us to
recognize our labor for what it is our
labor is input to a system that's
extracting an enormous amount of capital
that goes to a very few people and that
system is wreaking havoc in many ways I
don't necessarily think that unions are
the be-all and end-all of class struggle
and empowerment a lot of what I just
described the gains that were made yes
they came out of solidarity worker
action they also came out of an economic
and political climate there's work to be
done in boardrooms and courthouses as
well there's a lot of reasons why
unionization might not work local 10
really is like the best case union
there's a reason why people love Harry
bridges because he really represented
and he built the promise of unions that
have often failed and that have often
turned into vehicles for organized crime
or corruption or racism or anti like
xenophobic sentiment um that said it was
real it is real local 10 exists it has
done an extraordinary things in its
existence the local ten of the
international longshoremen's workers the
unwary us union was and is an
extraordinary union but SS in the Bay
Area is an extraordinary place and that
to sum it up is what upsets me so much
about that tweet I presented at the
beginning right I will continue to push
back on this because that narrative of
gold rushers gonna gold rush is just
like the saddest most complicit
shittiest possible reading you could
take a
area history so gold rushers are
going to gold rush what I would like to
say instead is workers joining in
solidarity to lift each other up are
going to join in solitaire H lift each
other up finally if I could ask you to
do one thing today it would be to go to
Silicon Valley rising org to learn about
the movement to value all of our workers
and communities in the Bay Area in the
tech industry and thank you for having</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
