this episode of dart tips this is part 1
in a series about functions the stalwart
and trusty building blocks of any app
dart supports top-level functions
optional parameters nested functions
passing functions as arguments to other
functions and more it's not uncommon to
build an entire app using only functions
if you think dart is only classes and
libraries you're in for a treat this
episode will focus on defining and
calling functions let's get started
functions are reusable bundles of logic
they can take zero or more arguments
perform some work and optionally return
a value here's a very simple function
named meaning of life the empty
parentheses means this function does not
take any parameters use the return
statement to return a value in this case
42 if no return statement is specified
the function returns null here's how you
call this function so far so good but
dart likes to be a terse language so we
can simplify the definition of this
function into a single line this fat
arrow syntax is syntactic sugar for a
more terse way to return the resulting
value on the expression on the right
hand side of the fat arrow functions can
of course accept parameters here's an
example this code works just fine but
this is Dart we have optional type
annotations so we can annotate this
methods parameters and return type we
strongly recommend using type
annotations on the surface area of your
code any code that another user will
interact with functions being a perfect
example should annotate what types it
expects and what type it returns your
fellow developers will thank you and
your tools will give you even better
feedback functions can take multiple
parameters here's an example this
function has two required parameters a
string for the message and an integer
for the number of exclamation points to
add at the end exclamation points are
loud no doubt about it but sometimes you
may not want to shout so loud of course
one option is to pass zero at the end as
the second parameter like this code
shows however it is hard to read this
line of code a casual observer may not
know what this magic 0 is also wouldn't
be better to simply leave off the second
parameter if you don't want to use it
luckily dart has a way to make this
better wrap one or more parameters with
square brackets to make them
optional here's an example notice how
the function now checks if exclamations
is null which is the value of the
parameter if it was not provided by the
caller now that the second parameter is
optional you can optionally omit it when
you call the function here's an example
we made this function more flexible and
easier to use however there is still
another problem here
the second parameter if it is provided
still looks a bit like a magic number
that is the casual observer would not
know what this magic number 5 means
luckily dart has a solution for this -
you can make methods even easier to read
by using optional named parameters
here's an example I think adding a
simple name to the parameter makes it
obvious what is going on to define
optional named parameters wrap the
parameters in curly braces to briefly
recap there are two ways to define
optional parameters square brackets for
optional positional parameters and curly
braces for optional name parameters
there's yet another benefit from the use
of optional parameters but first the
setup sometimes there's an obvious or
default answer for a parameter only on
occasion does it make sense to pass in
something more unique for example here's
a function that opens an HTTP connection
the first parameter IP address could be
anything so it's required however almost
all HTTP connections use port 80s so the
second parameter can be optional the
function is easier to use now because
the user doesn't have to specify the
obvious however the code inside the
function is a bit verbose plus there's
no way to express to the user what the
ports value is if it is not provided
luckily dart lets us specify a default
value for a parameter if that parameter
is optional here's an example this code
is simpler the semantics are more clear
and it is self documenting you can use
any compiled time constants such as
integer literals as shown here for
default values here are some examples of
using this function however here's an
example that might not be totally clear
notice how I am passing null as the
second parameter null is a perfectly
valid value so in this case port will be
set to null even though it has a default
value the lesson here is that default
values are only applied
the caller does not supply any value for
the parameter this means to really cover
your bases you should check for know
even when you use default values this
brings up a good question in the case of
an optional parameter without a default
value can you tell the difference
between a user passing in null and not
passing in anything at all the parameter
will be null either way it turns out
that dart does indeed have a way to ask
if an optional parameter was provided
when the method was called just use the
question mark parameter syntax here's an
example like the optional name
parameters you can use default values
with optional positional parameters
there is a syntax difference though you
must use equals with the positional
parameter Phi nning an optional
positional parameter with a default
value moving on you can define functions
simply at the top level of your code
here's an example I love this because it
means I don't need a wrap function
inside of classes writing a simple
script with dart is easy because of
top-level functions now you know the
functions can capitalize on type
annotations have both optional
positional and optional name parameters
have default values for their optional
parameters and more there's a lot more
to functions in dart and we'll cover
nested functions functions as objects
