today we're breaking open dart with set
lat with the developer advocate on the
dark project thanks for having me what's
that that was a little bit about
yourself what brought you to the project
what makes you be the developer advocate
we're done oh good good question so I
got my start programming many years ago
with C and kind of jumped in the deep
end there and so when I heard about Java
is an easier way to I think approach
software development I was all over it
but also because it worked really well
in a web browser at least at that time
also Java had first class support for
things like network access and web
access and loading by code over and URL
I mean this is really really cool ideas
at the time so if I could take kind of
my experience with structured web
program or structured programming and
apply it to the web I was all over and
so I did a lot of java programming moved
on to Ruby again still working with
classes and objects that was lucky
enough to get this job at chrome which
is really great except there wasn't
experienced JavaScript ninja if you will
mm-hmm so is a little concern but i did
get up to speed really quickly on html5
and javascript and learn about how
totally awesome the modern web platform
is but all this time i was still missing
just a little bit kind of my structured
programming experience and expectations
so when I heard about the start project
I was all over because I could combine
my structured experience and
expectations with deploying modern apps
on on the modern web and it's unperfect
cool how long ago was this let's see I
join a little over a year ago we had our
public launch about a year ago okay so
right at the beginning pretty much a
little bit yeah okay cool so um you know
you brought up this this theorem
structured and that seems to be the way
you guys ascribed art so what it just
tell us a little bit about both art and
why this structured nature of dark is so
important sure so it's important to
remember that as you scale up in the
complexity and number of team members
that are working on some of these
projects you need to have certain well I
believe you need to have certain things
baked into the language to help you
scale up from 10 lines of code to 100
lines of code to a thousand then when
you start to go into 10100
which really isn't that unusual when you
think of their really large apps like
Gmail xand Facebook's and Twitter's and
Google+ we're talking very large teams
lots and lots of code when you reach
that kind of scale you need certain
things like classes or libraries or
modules things that help you kind of
partition structure that code so you can
go bigger and bigger I think you cross
this point where it's too much to keep
in your head and you need tools that
help you navigate that code and refactor
that code just evolved to the very large
and so we're building dart to help
developers start small like everywhere
web developer does open up a file add
some functions but then grow over time
to classes and then libraries and then
10 developers and a hundred developers
and so we think that structure to help
you scale is very important right so I'm
kind of hearing scale asse structures is
a way of bringing about scale right and
so does that kind of imply that it's
mostly geared towards very large
enterprise projects or do people that
are building smaller sites also benefit
from the essentially the structure I
think both I think especially way we
envision web developers growing over
time that is their apps you always start
with a small idea a lot of startups you
know start with that see the Minimum
Viable Product just enough to get you
going but then you listen to the
feedback of your community and you
refactor the code as you grow and you
can grow up to the very large and it's
not just really about lines of code or
number of people on the team it's also
about how do you take advantage of the
wide array of modern html5 features like
WebGL and canvas and WebRTC in web audio
and file system its list goes on and on
the more complexity you add into the app
even if it's not just pure lines of code
but just the more features you need to
add the more I believe that you need
more structure so you can employ
encapsulation and give your tools that
kind of knowledge and insight in your
programs so that you don't get
overwhelmed by that complexity and and
make no mistake I mean we need to add
this kind of complexity we need to move
beyond just dynamic websites if you will
when new platforms launch ever the first
thing every user says is
where are the apps i want these apps be
beautiful and functional and silky
smooth and takes advantage of all the
hardware that's the thing i think that
really motivates us and how can we help
more developers do that with the web
platform that's what keeps us going
every day can you tell us a little bit
about javascript I mean obviously this
is the you know the big question that
everyone's talking about is you know is
dart out there to replace javascript is
it a compliment javascript is our dart
gear towards larger more scalable or or
even essentially projects that require
more scale is essentially are they going
to coexist what's the relationship with
you sure they're definitely in a coexist
we see JavaScript becoming almost the
assembly language of the web I mean it's
probably the most popular language of
the tremendous amount of installs across
all these devices and so it's going to
be around right but we've seen that it's
helpful to introduce other ways to write
apps for web that compile to JavaScript
we see I'm script in as a way to get
like C and C++ into javascript
CoffeeScript is another syntax we see
typescript as a way to compile in
JavaScript we see dart as a way to
compile into JavaScript and so GWT grid
compiling in JavaScript and all these
things just what they do is they bring
more developers to the web and that's a
good thing I mean if in the end of the
day all we've done is help more
developers build more complex awesome
apps for the web that's a great thing
and so this is a very much in and world
it's not an or world at all there's a
lot of fantastic developers with
JavaScript there's a lot of fantastic
developers of Java and C sharp and
ActionScript etc as well everyone should
be building for the web and so we found
that dart has been really appealing to
some of those other developers mm-hmm
but tell us a little bit about the
performance aspect of it specifically
one of the ways they kind of see dart
and JavaScript differing is the fact
that you know based on on how the dark
didn't put together class-based you know
put that infernal static typing and
whatnot that can lead to much better
performance out of the VM and so doesn't
mean the down the road you'll want to
you know essentially take advantage or
leverage these features and improve the
performance by having essentially a
native nearly provided vm how does that
factor into the equation like do you
still you see compiling to JavaScript or
is the ultimate goal running an eight
the ultimate goal is to enable better
apps for the modern web and so compiling
to JavaScript is a first-class concern
in fact I think there's two core tenants
to design the dart language one it has
to be like saying it's like very quickly
familiar and recognizable it's just not
a chance or we didn't use this chance to
introduce an esoteric syntax or anything
like this thing you have to look at and
say I get what you're doing and we've
seen this with hackathons people get up
and running in just a couple hours but
the other major core tenant of the
language design is that it has to
compile at the same logical JavaScript
because that is our number one
deployment platform for the foreseeable
future certainly we have a dart virtual
machine as well I do want to say like
some of the like the optional static
types and the classes some of those
things don't necessarily in flow into
just performance features necessarily
but by starting with a fresh kind of
clean slate and by limiting some of the
Supreme dynamis ism that's available in
other languages like JavaScript in Ruby
and so pulling back a little bit on that
I think is one of the things that's
really helping us get extreme
performance as well but really an end of
the day dart has sink a pile it's a
logical java script that runs as close
to the the JavaScript engine on the
different browsers will allow it to run
okay and what about I mean do you have
any sort of performance numbers you can
share with us in terms of say you know I
don't know what sort of algorithm or
sort of benchmarks you guys have what is
the performance the most optimal code
natively implemented a JavaScript versus
one implement that in Dart the
compositor JavaScript versus one that
potentially would work directly on your
vm yeah so as you might know the
cofounders of the dart project also were
the cofounders of chromes fast
JavaScript engine v8 and they also have
a long lineage of pedigree of building
virtual machines for other platforms and
so if these guys do anything it's about
performance and speed we don't have any
public numbers just quite yet because if
we're still really early one thing I can
say is that the dart VM is beating v8 on
a couple benchmarks now and we expect to
be able to do quite well in
in this area in fact there's a
benchmarking dart article on our on our
website if you're interested in that and
we have more work to do and virtual
machine more work to do on dart2js which
other compiler to javascript but i mean
these guys are all about speed and so
I'm very I'm feeling very good about
what we're going to be able to do for
the one point A to point o etc releases
of dark and so that brings me to another
next question where you see kind of the
industry you know with respect to
support native support for dart VM
specifically browser vendors yeah I know
there were some concerns expressed by
say folks from Mozilla on on support for
dart and saying that hey the only date
way dark is viable is there is a native
vm yeah so are we definitely we have
differing views about that and what's
really fantastic about the web platform
is it's that full name open web platform
and that I interpret that open as people
can introduce ideas to the web test out
their viability and see if they really
help drive the web forward and we've
seen other people unilaterally launch
features for the modern web before
things like canvas at the time only
Safari hadn't no other browser had it
and there's a lot of kind of skepticism
around this feature it flash forward to
today and you can't imagine the modern
html5 world without canvas I mean so
it's so fantastic but somebody had to
just step up and say we think that the
web needs say a drawing surface let's
see what that means we think that more
developers should be able to come to the
web by building when a language and with
tools that are just much more familiar
and meet and exceed their particular
expectations so the nice thing is dart
success isn't predicated on the vm
actually getting into all these
different browsers again it goes back to
our compiling to JavaScript right as
long as we do a good job compiling to
JavaScript we're a good job is defined
as we can get that code small and fast
then we think it doesn't it doesn't
really matter as long as those other
browsers continue to increase the speed
of their JavaScript VMs and which
obviously they're doing great thanks all
the great competition and friendly
friendly benchmarks out there that
helped start that just helps the web ok
so you think this whole argument around
you know for example the presence of
dart VM fragmenting essentially the web
by having some browser supported some
browsers don't support you know not
offering suboptimal user experience is
basically the somme not sure with
suboptimal user experiences because it's
also being slower well again it's only
as fast as the JavaScript engine allows
it to be all right and again because
there are tremendous amount of
JavaScript engines out there we compiled
dart to JavaScript and make that small
and fast then we've done a good job and
developers will use it now let's come
back to this you mentioned open and
actually that seems to be another thing
that comes up you know in the developer
community saying that for example like
Android you know being open source it's
all great but it's being developed
essentially behind closed doors so a lot
of the design design decisions
requirements you know are not
necessarily visible until after the fact
and others don't really have ways of
contributing our offering contributions
to the project until you guys have
already kind of put it in stone so can
you address that can you tell us a
little bit about of your development
process how do you go about essentially
yeah you know listening not just to your
own core developer community at Google
but kind of reaching out to others and
incorporating the app you back into the
future order sure sure this is an area
that I feel very passionate about
especially as a developer advocate my
job release to be that liaison between
the community and the engineering team
and engineering team back to the
community and so yeah I'm right in the
middle of it and I'm very happy with how
the dart project has evolved it is
totally open source it's a bsd very
permissive license we're open in spirit
and in name and in day-to-day operations
so you can track the issue tracker you
can follow along in the mailing list in
fact i just posted our buildbot so you
can see every commit and how it trickles
through the waterfall of builds you can
see when someone has an error in their
commit and exactly what what unit test
failed i mean we're that open and the
other nice thing is we you have external
committers which is really great so
these are people that have contributed
to the dart project in some some fashion
and we've Shepherd their patches through
and said okay you've clearly shown that
you're really passionate about this and
do a really good job I'm going to flip
that commit bit for you we've taken
numerous just patches from the community
mm-hm in fact you can go to our authors
file and we call out every contributor
which is really nice we also have the
kind of dance later satellite
jaques on github and so you can fork it
and send pull requests which we've done
for everything from see pub or package
manager to the website itself to our
articles to our dart JavaScript Interop
to our web components work and so it's
really cool to see the community not
just get interested and excited and used
art but actually contribute back to dart
and the more we can help Shepherd their
patches in the more I think we really
live and breed that open source nature I
mean you have to look at dark comes out
of the chrome project a chrome project
is a kind of reflection of the open web
this is just how it's done in the web
world so we're very comfortable and
happy to do couple of questions one is
you obviously you know are open opening
the project to committers but not
necessarily the design process right so
is there Sara Lee so yeah okay tell us a
little bit more about that yeah on the
mailing list you can see lots of great
discussions around language features
language syntax library designs those
will often evolved into feature requests
and bugs on the issue tracker and then
we milestone them so obviously languages
design by committee probably aren't
always the best thing but we have
definitely rolled things back we've
added things we've clarified things in
the spec and so it's it's because we
have that active community participation
have we been able to move i think as
fast as we can because we get that that
feedback almost instantaneously i mean
we have weekly releases so people are
like here's the bugs here's why I think
it could change I'd like the editor to
do X for us great file a bug over on it
and so yeah I do i do see collaboration
there and it's not just a community on
the mailing list to be clear I mean we
have the engineers and the language
designers they're also participating on
the list as well can you tell us a bit
more about kind of maybe share some
numbers or at least percentages like so
how quickly is this community growing
what percentage of developers roughly
our external versus internal and and
kind of high this I know there's some of
these numbers you may not be able to
well it's just a really hard i'm not
sure how to measure that stuff and we
can look at things like followers and a
number of bugs but i think what's really
key I think the metric that I'm most
interested in how many packages are
being published into our package manager
so dart is much more than a language we
have all of these projects as well to
give you a complete picture of
developing we have the editor we have
the libraries we
pilot JavaScript a virtual machine we
also have a package management system
like Ruby as gems &amp;amp; javas maven dart has
pub because you play darts at a pub
right and so not only is it just a
series of scripts that help you discover
and install and manage third party
dependencies but it's also a website
where you can upload your own packages
for other people to use and to me that's
that's I think the real bellwether of
dart adoption I don't have actual
numbers with me but anyone can go on go
to pub dartlang.org and click through
and you'll see packages for st. mongo DB
which they're you know obviously a
database and you'll see templating
languages and you'll see the dart
JavaScript Interop we even put our own
packages up there treat them just just
equal like anyone else that that's
really where I'm really excited for the
community to participate and upload and
share their work vector math stuff box2d
you know the list the list goes on and
on and you're seeing a growing number of
packages yes in fact we we're scrambling
to allow developers to publish their own
packages that's in our next milestone so
we're doing the upload for them right
now and I can tell you nothing motivates
us more than seeing the tremendous
amount of bugs like please upload my
package please album a package like okay
we'll get the stuff published done
really quickly so tell us what other
metrics you guys use like how do you
know you're on the right track like what
other things are you looking at or why
are you talking to in order to
essentially know you're doing is is
making sense yeah sure well adoption in
terms of our people launching more
packages with dart is really great to
see our people providing feedback we
have an editor with a big Sun feedback
button so we love to see that those that
is if people use the editor they send
the feedback we love to see justjust
participation on say our Google+ feed
that's really really nice we look at
that and say our people joining in on
the conversation are people sharing what
they are doing with dart with say pound
dart lang on google+ and twitter so just
keeping a finger on the pulse of the
community and seeing what they produce
in terms of packages and apps github is
another good way and this is pretty
common with most open source projects
just monitoring where we are with a
number of open source github projects
that you start it's just a really cool
way to see what people are doing cool
and so speaking speaking of open source
obvious
the open source communities is usually
quick to adopt these sorts of things
just because it's its nature who we are
but what about commercial vendors like
do you see actually I keep you know
professional IT teams and say fortune
you know five thousands trying playing
with dart potentially when using it in
some we've definitely seen people trying
and playing with it we see a lot of
interest from the grid community looking
for say a next-generation way to build
scalable web apps so that's really
interesting it's probably fair to say
we're in very early stages with dart and
so we don't have all these kind of
pieces that these guys need but it's
really encouraging to see them come to
the meetups come to the presentations
and tell us the s this is something
we're interested in we also been talking
to other vendors that help flush out
just the ecosystem in general so we've
talked to drone I oh they have a CI
continuous integration server then we'll
test your dart code which is really
fantastic that's great we've talked to
library authors and vendors creating
Rikuo is one that has it's all built in
dart and they target mobile and desktop
modern web apps it's a professional tool
kit so that's really encouraging and
some others I can't talk about right now
but yeah we're starting to see people
flush out the ecosystem people try it
out and send that feedback so it's
really great so speaking of trying it
out how far you guys from dogfooding
essentially dart at Google so quickly on
we have internal team yeah we have
internal teams using dart right now
nobody i can say publicly which is great
and again just really validates our
ideas that this is a good way to build
these larger scalable apps and google
does nothing if they don't do really
large web apps and so to see internal
teams check it out and work with us is
is really really nice you also mentioned
width or pwt i no understand that that's
basically in your platform of choice for
things like Gmail and the like so I'm
not I'm not sure how or if these in
Gmail or not but it is true that there
are a lot of googles apps and sites out
there are built with quit basically then
the question is how you see wit for
existing with dart oh absolutely coexist
is is the right word here so grid is
transitioning to a consortium led by a
lot of the key stakeholders and wit
which is
great again just more open now more
community involvement and grid is a very
mature platform and does a lot of things
really really well and so if you have a
existing investment into it that's
fantastic if you're looking at the next
next thing you might be interested in
dart as a way to evolve maybe move
quicker but it's very much a coexisting
and we love that this there's options
out there and that's a good thing so if
you're not happy with great you might
try dark not happy with our you may try
quit as long as you are developing
awesome apps for the modern web that's a
win for everybody and but in terms of
like just within Google do you foresee
kind of time where you know the existing
width based installations are going to
be migrating to dart or new projects are
going to be recommended to go to Darth I
mean so obviously like Google is an
interesting place right it's very bottom
up and so we would love to see that as
the dart team or more teams check out
dart of course but it's up to them and
get excited and all I know is that we're
talking to a bunch of teams are really
interested and I know of early adopters
inside Google and so that's a good sign
to basically have to sell dark not only
outside of Google but within it yes goo
Goo's again very grassroots organization
we have to sell them as well yes one
thing about dark you mentioned you know
the ecosystem which is which is actually
quite impressive especially around the
ids and whatnot you guys have really put
a lot of effort into that yes but that
was a little bit more about the specific
features of the language that you are
most proud of and how they essentially
address the shortcomings of or I should
but it's not use these shortcomings well
let's say the rough around the range of
edges parts of JavaScript I like to
think of what are the features of the
language that are really interesting
help developers be more productive ever
I think every language most languages
have their place and I really believe in
this polyglot world out there and so
what makes start more unique and
interesting to me a couple features like
optional static types this really plays
into the scalability story let's put it
this way so again if you're just
starting a web app you just have a
couple functions well at this point in
time you're just playing around you're
not worrying about type hierarchies
you're not worried about is this an
abstract factory class factory or
whatever you just want to get the thing
running and so you don't have to worry
about appeasing some ceremonial type
checker
but at certain point as you add more
features you move into classes and you
pull in more developers and you get more
comfortable with the structure of the
program then you can start adding these
optional static type annotations
throughout your code which give it's
more like inline documentation it gives
feedback to the tools so the tool can do
things like refactor for you or give you
more warnings before you actually run
the program and hit the problem but it
also gives you can call site
documentation for other developers which
is important as you scale up to say 50
developers or hundred developers like
you can't convey the information fast
enough or concisely enough unless it's
kind of right there in the code now of
course you can be like well hopefully
the developer put it in comments but
then you know the comments can be really
long and then the tools aren't reading
the comments and anyway so we believe
that you add these type annotations
right there in the code and to give that
kind of feedback and flexibility so I
really love that feature I'm really
liking our way the way we handle
concurrency which is through an isolate
model and so we've taken lessons learned
from other platforms that you can do
shared memory threads but they lead to
dead locks and a really hard to debug
and that they require them things like
locks and mutexes and just way more
complexity so we took a cue from Air
Lang and probably others and said well
what if we actually shared no state
between these separate little running
bits of code and instead just pass
messages and if you're not sharing state
then you can't have two threads kind of
clobber each other and get in a deadlock
okay we like this model especially
because JavaScript itself is a single
threaded execution model so again going
back to the we can't design anything
into the language that can't compile the
same JavaScript dart has to kind of play
in that world and so we took these kind
of cues and build a system we call
isolates an isolate is an isolated
memory keep or a logical logically
isolated memory heap that can run in a
separate thread or separate process kind
of depends on the implementation and you
pass messages back and forth between
these different isolates much like air
laying and its actors much like web
workers and JavaScript you might fire
off a web work and pass messages back
and forth so I really love this
concurrency modeling this whole posting
messages back and forth and maybe moving
a nice limbu tween different virtual
machines or using the isolate
abstraction between the web browser and
the server or two isolates in the same
vm i mean the abstraction seems to scale
to all these different approaches which
is really cool to me so there's other
esoteric features but those are the two
the two big ones are of course the
object-oriented being kind of being
properly done being class based as it
was probably not it is a class-based
object-oriented system which is very
familiar to developers so it's it's less
sexy but it's the thing that I think
everyone was like oh okay I totally got
this you look at javascript libraries a
lot of them implement these class
systems and that's because a lot of
developers want them but it's hard to
then or interoperate between these
different JavaScript libraries because a
the class is more like a convention
right whereas dart bakes it into the
language now of course you can have
frameworks built the top of frameworks
much more easily and your tools can tell
if you're trampling on each other so
certainly the class based on library
based approach to structure is another
good one but probably another really
good one roof around the subject is
lexical scoping which is fantastic so
that the visibility or the access of the
variable is you can determine simply by
just looking at the code right
statically analyzing it or just using
your eyes so it's different than
function scope or or dynamically scoping
the coping the variables and that's not
one of those things a little tricky as
people move to traditional web
programming but it's very logical and
straightforward in gardens and the fact
that we have lexically scoped closures
makes it even easier and cooler and so
things just just kind of work like this
is lexically scoped which is a very
logical approach to it so that brings me
to the next question would you find dart
is specifically well-suited to like so
who you know who are the developers
they're most open to this I'm assuming
folks that come from structure languages
yeah well so we've done some surveys for
some of the meetups and conferences
we've done and it's kind of all over the
map we see some spikes with people who
would say they're proficient in Java
JavaScript C sharp and ActionScript are
the seemingly big kind of pools of
developers that are attracted at least
in a kind of curious manner to to what
what dart is doing and so that's
good we wanted to be very familiar and
approachable and to see multiple spikes
I think in the survey answers says we're
on the right track there do you ever get
into a situation where essentially you
know people say the JavaScript ish is
good enough you know you say it's the
assembly language of the web and you
know there's a lot of people that seem
pretty pretty well you know versed in
JavaScript especially when you're taken
to account like modern frameworks like
jQuery and whatnot sure so so how do you
convince them to at least you know
considered art if not even you know
start using it yeah to be honest I'm not
sure we need to get you know success of
dart isn't every developer is now using
dart and so I'm more interested in
tacking the higher level problem of how
do we get more developers building more
interesting apps for the modern web and
so if you have the developers with 15
years of hardcore web development
experience and know all the subtle ins
and outs and are doing it in other words
doing a great job already that's
fantastic and especially we've seen them
accelerate their velocity even faster
thanks to frameworks like you know
backbone and number and angular adding
structure to their programming again
which is always really important or
tools like closure which allows you to
annotate via comments but annotate your
code so that you can have things like
linters and static analyzers help you
can bust through that that ceiling of
what you could fit in your head and what
your tools can think about for you and
that's great like we we want them to
continue doing a good job so what I
think we can continue to demonstrate
just in general for all developers is
our increased performance increased
productivity certainly just with the
languages I'm in terms of the tools like
just being able to refactor just being
able to right click on a method and say
show me everywhere where this is used
these are things that I'm used to in my
past life so yeah sure or intelligent
whatever but when you bust it again that
kind of artificial barrier you need the
tools be like where where was this call
then and who else is calling this can i
delete this can i rename it can i move
it so really enhanced productivity is
something i think that will will turn
people on to dart as well what about you
know speaking of productivity what about
you know the
the Harmony Project basically the next
version of JavaScript you know with
classes being kind of first-class
citizens oh love again way I think we're
doing a syntactic point right it's still
a prototype will inheritance but I think
they're adding in syntax or syntactic
sugar to to build a class to feel that
kind of javascript is fundamentally and
again I'm going to use the word flawed
although some people are going to that
yeah a lot in a sense that you know
being able to scale the way modern
structure languages can you know any
treaty essentially scaled you know to
offer larger team's ability to
productively work on larger you know
deployments I can just tell you what
I've seen at Google and that we built
tools like closure and quit to help us
scale out to larger teams and larger
code bases and so it's really nice to
see the JavaScript community look at
things like structured frameworks look
at things like new sink texts for
JavaScript to help them do even more for
the web I think what's really cool
though is by taking a fresher approach
with dart and saying okay if we can do
this kind of from scratch taking cues
from other platforms and languages what
else can we do how fast can we move can
we meet and exceed more user
expectations with not just syntax and
scalability but just like pure language
semantics and productivity as well
mm-hmm okay got it well we're
approaching the end of the of this
episode but I wanted to ask you kind of
where is dark today in terms of
completeness and where do you see it
going in the next you know short and
obviously a long term yes just as an
essentially how do you convince
developers that dark is a viable
platform that Google is invested in it
that it's not gonna you know go wave on
it yeah and that you know in three four
five years it's going to be here to stay
sure well I can say that it's a serious
investment in terms of in Google in
terms of headcount and locations and I'm
a project we have offices around the
world working on this from all different
aspects language libraries compiler and
JavaScript package manager editor the
website docs the list goes on so this is
not just about hey what would happen if
we looked at another language it's hey
let's make a serious investment into
making a more
div and performant platform for modern
web developers and that means pulling in
all these other aspects into the
platform so I think that's really
fantastic sign the fact the sign that
internal teams are using dart today is a
really good sign the fact that we see
our community growing in terms of
releasing packages and can participating
the manliest an issue tracker is really
fantastic sign so we should say that
recently we had an m1 release which is
our first release as we moved out of
technology preview so we launched a year
ago where we had things basically
compiling and working but we're it was
really release to say what's your
feedback community we had really awesome
feedback and then we put out the m1
which said ok we added in the extra
pieces of the platform that you need
like the package manager and more robust
editor and we took a look at the
language we said ok we think the
language is baked enough that we're not
going to break backwards compatibility
unless of course there's something
massive bug or something but so it's a
more it's a safety net now for developer
even more developers to come on and try
out dart will have other milestones as
we approach a 1 point 0 but right now is
a really good time because we have a
much more robust and stable at language
platform for developers to try mm-hmm
and and let's say in a year or two two
weeks can you expect see you know one
point 0 release with some you know some
major timelines are really really hard
to predict unfortunately but I can say
that we're moving really fast and I feel
like this team is very aggressive so I
don't I don't feel like this is
something that's going to stretch on for
very long so I think that if you've got
feedbag you want stuff ask us now cuz
this train is moving really fast right
and you're just too just to also clarify
this you guys are focused mostly on the
client side mostly on the you know dart
to JavaScript server side is an option
but it's certainly yeah that's a good
clarification right so because we have a
standalone dart virtual machine we can
of course embed that into browsers like
we have done today with dartium which is
a build of chromium that has a dart VM
built in and that facilitates really
fantastic edit reload cycles something
that's hard to achieve I think in other
platforms that you can go in the editor
write some code just hit reload and
you're real without recompiling anything
just relaunches into dartium you can
then set breakpoints in the editor and
it will stop the running program in
dartium which is really Fanta so just to
have that kind of vm level debug
integration
in your tools in an editor that a lot of
people are familiar with I think will
help a lot of Ella pers get excited
we're speaking the editor we also are
friends with IntelliJ and they have dart
editor I'd plugin for IntelliJ in
webstorm as well we're awesome but going
back to the virtual machine it does run
stand alone on the command line you can
access files and directories web servers
web sockets you can even deploy a
server-side dart app to Heroku which is
really cool so we do envision this
end-to-end world which obviously all
great things turn on we've seen from the
JavaScript meaning when you have no Jess
on the server and obviously JavaScript
of the client we've seen quit when you
have javascript java on the backend and
java compiled JavaScript we see the same
thing for Dart so we are focused on the
client but the server piece is coming
along nicely yeah awesome before I let
you go one last question what else are
you passionate about when you're not out
there selling guards what makes you
think what makes me think well I love
playing games board games that is in
card games so I've been playing like
Dominion and settlers catan so I'm
really into that stuff and photography
so just taking pictures and pretending
I'm a professional photographer cool o
course not but awesome well thanks a lot
i appreciate it this was a really really
inspirational i'm definitely excited
person about dart I know there's a lot x
still a lot of kind of kind of many
controversy around some of the things
that happen over the years but it
definitely seen it happens it this is
the life cycle of adoption of reverie
you know this is not unique to dar you
know introduce something new to the two
communities they have to kind of
rationalize and contextualize and of
course new things scare people and then
we just keep listening to the feedback
keep improving the platform and then you
get to that tipping point and so you
know things over a great things start to
happen so so we're optimistic and
excited thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
