impacts calm I'm basically an Android
developer and I'm going to talk today
about android market search so some
things in general about the android
market but focusing more specifically on
android on the search capability within
the android market so let's see so so
the analysis that we did is based on a
lot of data that we collected from the
android market itself from looking at
literally thousands of posts on forum
that android developers participated in
the the google forum itself and in some
outside forums collected all the data
all the data we could did an analysis
and came to some conclusions that you'll
that you'll see tonight so why did we
why did we do this well here's what
happened in mid-2011 we were deploying a
suite of apps for our company that our
ad-supported the quick click series of
apps which is basically a front-end for
google maps and there they're focused on
a number of niche markets so there's a
lot you'll see a lot of over there on
the right hand side golf restaurants
parking and so forth so we were
interested in looking at what happens in
the end the android market in a lot of
little slices at the same time that was
going on lucky us google transformed the
android market with a with a new user
interface
ace and changes to their search
algorithm and changes to a lot of things
going on behind the behind the scenes so
we started scouring the internet the
google site anywhere we could to see
well you know what's going on here why
are our apps ending up where they are on
search results and so forth so if I
could I'd like to do a little survey
here to see where where you what kind of
experiences you've had with the Android
with the android market and so you might
be on you know you might be on both
sides of this equation so who can who
can emphasize with mr. happy over here
on on the left there many people that
are happy with the new with the new
android market so there's a few hands
going up you know dozen or so hands and
we frankly we're one of those we liked
most of what we saw with with the new
market so what about the the hair puller
here we have some hair pullers with the
with the android market so there's
there's a few a few hands now there's a
lot of hands that didn't go up is that
because you're just don't care one way
or the other or you haven't paid much
attention to the android market or you
don't have apps on the android market
any for somebody who didn't raise their
hand i'm curious what can you don't have
it don't okay if you don't have an app I
can see why you wouldn't care
okay all right so so fair enough what
you'll see as I go forward here is that
there were all kinds of reactions to to
to them to the android market because
people like more maybe to complain when
they go on forums and post post
responses on forums maybe maybe that's
one reason why you would tend to see
more of the hair puller then then then
then the happy face but it ran the gamut
so on the positive side what were some
of the observed benefits of the new new
market well there seems to be less of an
impact from keyword spamming what a lot
of developers were doing understandably
was cramming as many keywords as they
could into the descriptions for the
description section for their apps but
what that did is it caused a lot of
results to be returned that had really
nothing to do with the the query that
you did I remember doing one doing a
query if one of our apps as fast food
did that and there's a I think it was
some kind of a calendar a pretty girl
calendar app and there was Angelina
Jolie she popped up I said would so so i
looked at the description and she I
think she had appeared in the movie Fast
Food Nation so that's why she came up on
a search for fast food so it was the the
keyword spamming thing was getting out
of hand and the new market seems to deal
with that much better so there were more
generally I would say more meaningful
search results and people like the new
all of the new lists that Google has now
the top lists of the top-grossing and
top free and top this and top that
now on the other side of the equation so
here were some of the negatives that
that came up people could no longer find
an app with the app name so previously
you if you'd keyed in a search first and
you used the the exact app name that app
would would tend to come up at the top
of the list makes sense right well
they've changed and for reasons I'll get
into a lot of detail about it but
basically they're parsing app names
pulling them apart and unless you put it
unless you put an app name in quotes in
a search it won't necessarily come up
near near the top so as you can imagine
a lot of developers had apps that we're
doing quite well with with a given a
given name and all of a sudden you know
their users couldn't find it there was
some complaints about inconsistent and
unfair search results rankings apps
we're moving around so apps that had
previously been ranked pretty high were
no longer very high other apps had moved
up and so understandably the apps that
had bootman had moved down of the the
developers were we're not happy about
that and in some cases that really
negatively affected their their their
earnings there are a lot of developers
out there who are trying to make a
living doing app development there were
complaints about app market bugs it
turned out that a lot of the bugs that
people were complaining about weren't
really bugs they were changes to the
search or algorithm where they were
changed to this so they were changes to
that but Google wasn't really
participating on the forum so we were
left to guess well what's what's a bug
and a lot of developers were screaming
bloody murder you fix this bug fix this
bug and a lot of them turned out to not
be bugs inconsistent install numbers the
the the reported install
cells started moving around I know I
know google has made some changes
recently to stabilize that the order of
comments used to be that user comments
were displayed in chronological order
and now they're coming up in GaN chronic
chronological order I think Google is
trying to do something with let's call
it comment spamming so they've got some
algorithm for figuring out which
comments are going to show up toward the
top of the comment list rapid income
develop elven o request for more
communication so so on the help forum on
on the Android site developers were
screaming please google you know what's
going on talk to us talk to us they were
very sparse with their comments
eventually they did make some comments
that I'll work that that that that I'll
report on yeah and well here they are so
after a couple of months so so that the
the heavy changes started I think I like
July first and there there were a few
threads on the help forum one one big
one that got up to over over 1,200 posts
on this particular thread so after a
couple of months google finally made
made some comments and although they
were sparse comments they were they were
they were very revealing so one they
said that yes there they're enhancing
the market search algorithm they're
making changes and so developers when
you see things moving around that's
in some part because of the changes
where we're making and they did say that
their data suggests that it's it's it's
working well and that users are able to
find their apps quicker and easier and
of course google has access to that
plethora of data that we can't see and
so we'll have to take their word for it
and I believe that's true that on the
whole it is working it is working better
and then they said well some some
developers have noticed that their apps
have moved up or down in the search
rankings after these changes well so
yeah it's a competitive landscape and
there's only so much top real estate in
search results and if somebody's moving
up and you know somebody's somebody's
moving somebody bill somebody is moving
down and because they're making changes
to the search algorithm those kinds of
changes are taking place then they said
that the help forum should be focused on
user issues and they closed any issues
related to developers so what they were
saying I get it it's understandable that
they don't want developers complaining
on a forum that's really there to help
end users so it's like you know guys
don't air your dirty laundry in front of
the very customers that we're all trying
to to attract and then and then they
said well if you if you have a specific
issue with a nap send that to us and
we'll communicate with you one on one on
one so by the way that all these view
graphs are up on if you go to the market
impacts dot-com website to the blog
you'll see a blog the firt put up a blog
entry today and you can download the
view graphs if you want to if you want
to see them now I have noticed that that
Google is trying to up their
communication level with developers
there now including these messages in
the Android
market about some aspects of market
change it would it would be nice if
maybe there were more of those but it's
a it's it's a start and also Eric chu
from the Android developer ecosystem he
did a good presentation at Google i/o
this year that I I recommend you look at
if you're interested in the in the in
the market and in that presentation he
focused a lot on what you see on the
left hand side here so Google now has a
lot of lists that show you the top apps
in a lot of different categories so if
you're one of the my estimate ten
thousand or so apps that make it on to
one of those lists then the lists
obviously benefit you it's a good thing
however that the 250,000 apps that don't
make it onto a top list are left being
found by by search and so the search
capability is really important to the
majority of Android developers and this
I'm sure you've all heard of the the
longtail concept it's really popular now
that that amazon.com has talked a lot
about where and they talked about it in
terms of book authors which I've just in
the last few days been reading a number
of articles about how self-publishing is
taking taking off where someone can
write a book or in our case develop a
develop an app that may be out on this
out on this long tail somewhere you know
we're not what you were not one of the
top apps but we've got a devoted set of
users that are interested in a
particular in a particular niche and if
they can find us if they can find the
darn thing we can do you know we can do
pretty we can do pretty well
now they also google also made changes
to their search filtering and on the
website they have these selectors that
allow some filtering of the of the
search results on the mobile version
they really don't have those you can
essentially they have the first the
first one here type because you can go
into the app section and if you do a
search in the app section you're only
going to get you're only going to get
apps but for example there's no way to
sort by relevance versus popularity they
also introduced this concept of sticky
of stickiness so they're not revealing
the exact formula they use for
stickiness but they do have now this
this little chart of how many of
downloads you've had with your app in
the last in the last 30 days and it's
it's on it's it only appears on the
website version and it's a relative
chart so so the left-hand the y-axis the
left-hand scale there is is relative so
that one of these charts for an app that
has millions of downloads might look the
same as as an app that has only hundreds
of of downloads and what they're what
they're trying to measure it with this
is how are you trending are how popular
are you recently are the number of
downloads you're getting you know on the
upswing or or on the downswing so the
stickiness concept is well you know
people people download you but then what
are they continuing to use you or are
they uninstalling you and this chart is
a way to try to measure that now
uninstalls are now accounted for more
accurately so so apparently in the past
it was more like downloads were just
building up so you had developers that
would have app
that would that would get this constant
progression of reported installs but
they weren't accurately accounting for
uninstalls so this summer they they made
this kind of almost overnight adjustment
to account for uninstalls and so that
you know that negatively impacted some
developers who overnight saw their
install numbers shift shift downward
there's there are also changes in how
keywords are handled so in look on the
lower right here you see previously
there was more emphasis on keywords in
the description and it caused this
keyword spamming problem where the
description can be quite long so there's
plenty of room to shove you know every
keyword you can think of in there so it
looks like what they did is they said ah
well we've got the app name and we've
got the first sentence or two of the app
and that's a limited space so developers
are really going to have to declare what
they're all about in that limited space
and they're not going to be able to do
keyword spamming there so we're going to
we're going to start emphasizing the
name and the first sentence or two in
the in the description and at the same
time they started to pull apart the
search terms are the name of the app
parse it and try to make meaningful
words out of the app name so if you have
if you have an app name that really
doesn't mean anything in real English
but you're it's it's a composite of a
couple of words they'll pull that apart
and try to make sense out of that and
you might your app might not show up
anywhere
so if you want to find an app as I said
before with a specific name you have to
put it in quotes and then to counter
this parsing and and the way they're
handling the app name today if you have
if you have a name that doesn't really
mean anything that it's a fanciful name
like doll like like dolphin dolphin
means something but without calling a
dolphin browser so so a lot of a lot of
developers were using only their
fanciful name like maybe dolphin would
use only dolphin yes uh he the question
what was would food fast give the same
search results as fast food and I don't
I I don't know but i don't think so i
think that they're they're trying to get
very sophisticated in you know I think
there's using some of the same
techniques that they use in web search
now in app search so so to deal with
this issue of fanciful names if you just
add meaningful names after your fanciful
name in your app to make that for
example stitcher stitcher as a is a
radio app and they used to be called
just stitcher so they've now added
stitcher news and talk radio so the
search algorithm now sees oh there there
a radio station and and they've moved
back up in there in the rankings so
let's see I think I already talked about
these these are the issue so how do you
the app name issues and strategies for
include including app names and quotes
if you want to find a specific name
adding plain keywords to deal with to
deal with abstract names
so a little bit of an overview then of
the changes that affect the search
ranking is they added the they added the
sticky factor in there they're waiting
keywords in the app name now there's
less emphasis on keywords in the in the
main description oh and on the on the
phone version or the mobile version
they're strategically placing paid apps
and there's unless you put the word free
in your search like radio stations free
your they're going to place paid apps
strategically on the list I guess maybe
it's because they're trying to you know
motivate people to buy to buy more apps
so to try and put all this together I
did a I did a little example and
although this is just one example I
tried to do one that in my opinion is
indicative of how its operating in in
how its operating in general now since
their search algorithm is proprietary
this is my guess at what some of the top
criteria are for the way their ranking
search results the the recency of
download activity the total downloads
the rating the name and and whether it's
paid or not so if you look at the the
area in red here and you let your I just
fall across that data see if you can see
if you can find any correlation with any
individual factor with the with the
search results I can't if it looked it
it looks sort of random you know the the
million the million download app is only
number three so how they're doing this
sorting of the apt results is obviously
based on some sophisticated algorithm
and if we look at the who the who the
winner is here if I had if I had
scrambled these results and said pick
out the winner probably nobody would
have picked that app that that is at the
top so so why is so why is that app up
at the top not with my little green
check marks over on the right hand side
I did a very gross indication of for
what criteria a given app seems to you
know seems to be doing well with so for
the one that came up on top he's
only has 10,000 plus downloads so it's
not anywhere near the top of the list of
downloads the rating is a 3.7 it's out
of that group it's the it's the worst
rating it's not a paid app so what what
does this app have well the app has
recency so if you look at the the recent
30 days squiggly 30-day chart he's you
know he's on the upswing recently but
he's got the word coffee in his app and
it's he and I'm not and I'm now noticing
now its its its first in in the name
whether that means anything to their
algorithm I don't know but that that
recency and that app name caused that
the app coffee guide to to move up to
the top now in looking at a lot a lot a
lot of search results I did notice that
if you have if an app has 250 thousand
or more downloads that does seem to have
a pretty pretty pretty big impact on now
that may not move you up to the top but
that'll tend to get you up you know move
you up in the result so this so this
this million-plus download app one of
the reasons they didn't end up at the
top is because they don't have the word
coffee in their name now they've got
cafe which is which is close but no snow
no no cigar and it looks like google
makes an attempt to to find words that
are similar and so they seem to
understand that cafe and coffee are
related so i also took a quick look at
app search on other app markets this is
a an iphone search for for for coffee
and and you'll see that the coffee
appears a lot in the names but not
not everywhere I did look it I did take
a look at these individual apps and the
word coffee appears somewhere in there
in the description or in some cases in
the in the developer name I also looked
at the amazon app search and Amazon does
their app search in a way the same as
you know we're all familiar with the way
they do book book search and search for
all the other products that they handle
and the Windows Phone app search you can
see here that it's a little hard to spot
correlations I mean the number one app
is called lunchbox not called coffee it
has a low rating so it so in general
here's the observation i made about the
other about the other app markets is
that it's it's not obvious with any of
the app markets exactly how the rankings
for search are being done and it does
appear that keywords are being given
some significant weight in the in the
names and that all the app markets are
dealing with the same the same
challenges of trying to create you know
relevant and useful results search
results so putting it all together I
came up with a couple of suggestions for
Google maybe maybe we can come up with a
few with a few more here one is to make
the search filtering especially on the
phone more robust so put some search
filtering criteria in there maybe there
could be a switch that hey i'm going to
i want to look for an app name that's
exactly like what i am typing in so you
put on you know you put that switch you
put that switch on so they have more of
that going in on going on on the on the
website version and very little going on
on the mobile on the mobile version yeah
my second suggestion is
that Google create some kind of
password-protected forum that developers
can participate in and do some
communication possibly with Google would
be easier every every developer has a
has a password for their account and
other groups yeah so you say on the
android developer google group that that
kind of things going on so that's all I
that's all I have any more questions or
comments okay so he's saying that he was
just at a google group meeting with good
in pair in Paris with in Paris and there
was a representative from the market and
that they're aware of a lot of these
issues and trying to make the market
better trying to trying to improve it
which is you know which is which is good
to know you know what I found in these
in the forum when that when a lot of
these issues were being brought up this
last summer is that that a lot of the
developers were so angry that they they
were having a hard time participating in
a rational discussion of what's going on
and how can we adapt to it and figure
out how to figure out how to how did you
know how to deal with it what would be
helpful from from Google's when they
feel like they can disclose certain
aspects is to say well this is you know
this is the way it this is the way it is
we're now parsing words in that in the
app app name or whatever whatever it is
that they're doing if the developers
know that okay well that's being done to
know then they'll you know try to adjust
and
and and deal with it but if if they if
the developers think it's a bug that
then they just keep pounding on the
table fixed the bug fixed the bargain
and that you know that doesn't help
doesn't help anyone so the question was
does it look like Google is is or what
is Google doing to take action with apps
that drain the battery a lot or crash a
lot or you know where they have problems
and as we all know the on the the iphone
market they curate that market and
they're they're much more draconian
about what they'll what Apple is more
draconian but what they allow to happen
on their market then Google which leaves
it as an open market it looks to me like
they're pretty much leaving it up to the
market to deal with those things so and
so that misbehaving apps will be
uninstalled and shunned and not do well
okay so so the statement was that in the
case of malicious apps that are sending
out too many messages or or taking some
you know obviously doing some obviously
nasty things they'll they'll take those
down but for the most part they're
leaving it up to the to the market to
disorder it out right so that so the
question was to what extent might
inbound links let's say somebody reviews
a nap and they put a link and the link
would be to the market
specifically in the market so like I my
Claudia girl into your app right we just
say market gone ? whatever actual
faculty right so so there can be inbound
links linking into your app in the app
in so you're you're you're you're the
URL for your app in the app market right
like that right and is that helping with
search results and a placement in search
results I don't think so we've we did a
series of press releases for our quick
lick apps and and they're being picked
up by lots of other app markets and so
there's a lot of linking going on I
haven't noticed the core correlation I
haven't I haven't read about that
happening I haven't noticed it myself
could they I well they can figure out
anything they want to figure out so so
they could do it but I I haven't I
haven't understood</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
