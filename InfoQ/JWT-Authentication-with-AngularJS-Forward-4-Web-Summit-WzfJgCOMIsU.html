with angularjs but really this is gonna
be applicable to pretty much any
front-end framework that you're working
with what we're really gonna be talking
about in this talk is like what why JWT
like how does it fit into the whole like
browser scheme so a little bit about me
I've been doing full stack development
for about 10 years I didn't know it was
called that once upon a time I just
thought it meant like I'll do everything
and not say no but apparently that has a
title been using JavaScript on the whole
stack since 2011 my life started up we
decided to use node and angular because
we thought it would help us move quickly
prototype fast which was true
it was the language learning company and
basically our whole product was a
browser application so this combination
helped us move fast and that's how I've
come to be where I am now and I'm
leading the JavaScript team at storm
path you saw a Randal give a little
three-minute talk early on or basically
a user I did on the application for our
developers it's a REST API so think of
us not only as a cloud datastore for
user data but also an authentication
service so that's really great because
you basically don't have to worry about
storing user passwords securely
integrating with all those crazy things
like LDAP Active Directory to Google or
Facebook ad yada yada we like we
basically encapsulate all that for you
in a service and it's free to get
started if you got to like a little side
project or something you're working on
it takes like five minutes they get
started with it so check it out quick
housekeeping if you guys want to grab a
picture of this this is actually been
working pretty well for sharing the link
so I'll give you guys a second to grab
this QR code okay
so we're gonna cover a lot of ground in
here just kind of want to give you an
overview I think we've got 40 minutes
actually I need to get a timer going
okay so we're gonna recap the scheme
that we're all used to which is like
sister and identifier store doing cookie
we're gonna just briefly you know
revisit the thing that we're all used to
and then kind of talk about why gwt's
are happening we're gonna introduce them
and then also talk about access tokens
and refresh tokens it's um this is there
is some overlap between GWT and OAuth so
we're going to talk a bit about that and
the thing that I'm sure you're all the
most interested in is like how do I
store these things in the browser we're
gonna talk about some of the security
trade-offs that you need to think about
we'll get into some angular specifics
and then if there's time I have some
really deep dive stuff on the right way
to do a cookie is the point the point of
that part of the talk is to like freak
everybody out and like make you run back
to your office and like check your
application that part this is like a
version 4 of this talk I've moved it to
the end and this time to make more room
for other stuff okay session identifiers
this is the scheme that you know we're
all used to user submits a login form we
verify their credentials create a
session store that ID and a cookie and
in an old-school looking fashion here's
what that looks like you know login form
verify the stuff send back a cookie
great all feature browser requests are
authenticated with this I deem well you
know that seems to be going out of fat
especially when you look at all the hype
around GWT so like why is that well
aside from it being the cool new thing
there are some legitimate problems with
session IDs and the first one that most
people run into is that they're not
really like a web to scale so to speak
right like now you've got to maintain
this pointer between a session ID and
the rest of the user data so now you're
incurring like database load for every
request that gets kind of annoying
it's pretty easy to solve that problem
you know you just basically put that
lookup table in an in-memory cache or
something that's super fast you can work
around it but you know it's a problem to
be dealt with
so people have always kind of been
looking for something different and
there's a perception that cookies are
inherently insecure which there's truth
to that like if you do cookies wrong
it's a disaster but there's ways to do
it right so I'm gonna work on that
perception a little bit so I want to
introduce gwt's pretty early on here
basically it stands for JSON web token
because JSON is the format of the token
but before moving on I just want to
cover some words so authentication is
the part where you're proving who you
are it's that step of asserting like
okay some credentials are coming in and
I'm asserting that therefore the person
who they punish you to write most common
form are used to do is just using it and
password you authenticate yourself with
those things but now in likely API
driven world and machine to machine
communication we're seeing API Keys
being used a lot so that's the
authentication part it's like
credentials
give me back something that I can use I
don't have to present those credentials
every time that's what the token is for
so way to persist that authorization I'm
sorry that authentication the
authorization part is what happens after
you've authenticated authorization is a
way of saying okay given that you've
authenticated as so and so like what do
you have access to you know so it's like
who are you what do you have access to
jelly booties are simply just a token
format so if we're gonna take this idea
of exchanging credentials for a token we
have to make some decisions about what
that token should look like and JWT is
winning and as a format because it's a
JSON and you know everybody loves JSON
now for good reasons
and the overlap with oauth2 and GWT is
that auth to actually calls itself an
authorization framework and they
describe you know the process of
exchanging credentials for tokens they
don't explicitly say with a token for
that should be but that's where GLBT
fills the hole is like okay you need a
token here's a convenient format for
that token okay so I mean like a long
story short JW tees are fun so let's uh
let's dig in and see what they actually
are before we talk about some of the
other concerns around them
if you encounter them in the wild they
look just like another ugly string you
know like at first glance it might be
like houses different from a session
identifier it just looks like some
random crap in a cookie but it is
actually structured so if you separate
it out by period it's basically three
base 64 URL encoded strings the URL
encoding is important if you're if
you're like a rack and your brand trying
to figure out why you can't decode
something make sure it's 64 URL encoded
so each of these seconds have a name
we got a header colloquially the body
really is called the claims body and
then a cryptographic signature so if you
decode the basic C for encoding then you
get down to your JSON so you know as a
token that's a certain you know
authentication it's got to have some
information to describe what has gone on
so the body is where the meat of that is
we're going to talk about that the next
slide but the header is sort of like
this envelope kind of like information
thing that describes the whole token so
part of that one of the features we're
going to talk about about gwt's is you
cryptographically signed them and the
header is telling the system that's
going to verify them what the algorithm
was that was used to to do the signing
so that you know and then if you've
encrypted it which is an option for gbts
it tells you information about how to
decrypt the body like what algorithms
need to be used so header is just sort
of like that FYI
about how to parse this token but the
body is actually the part that has the
really juicy stuff in it so this is
where I'm gonna spend a decent amount of
time so they call these claims because
they're basically making a claim
about the person or the system even that
authenticated and as as with all RFC's
these these common fields are
recommended but not required in practice
you're gonna see these fields the most
so I'm gonna cover them you have the
issuer field which is describing who
issued this token so you know we're in
this world now where a lot of the things
we make are like micro services or our
product is actually like a multi-tenant
application where multiple customers are
like hosting their applications on our
platform so the issue field is a way of
like letting the people who are gonna
look at this token know like you know
which application essentially has issued
this token and then you also can see
when it expires token expiration is a
complex thing that we're going to talk
more about but just know that you're
supposed to put the expiration time in
the token because it helps other people
know like should I even consider this
thing about it anymore and the subject
is kind of like numero uno it's telling
you who this token represents like who
authenticated so this can be a pointer
to your database system some user ID
something like that
and again we're now seeing another
overlap here with scope so in Roth tool
and it being an authorization framework
they describe a whole lot of ceremony
around the idea of scope which is
basically just like saying like you know
this person has authenticated it and has
access to these things and scope can
differ depending on the authentication
attempt if you've ever integrated with
like Google login our Facebook log and
you've seen this part of off before
where you ask for specific scopes like I
want the users email address or I want
like everything which is always fun when
you're presented with that option when
you're Facebook logging into something
but this is their this is where the
overlap is but again it's not prescribed
by OAuth gwt's are just like hey we got
this token format we need to person need
some way to persist information
about that scope that was requested so
don't end up putting it in the in the
token so how did we create these things
and how do we verify them you know if
we're gonna use these things essentially
for authentication like how do we do
that
well as we've discussed to get the token
you have to present some credentials
traditionally that's not username and a
password more often these days we're
also seeing API keys being used for like
developer services and they're gonna be
issued by your server your
authentication service or whatever
however ever you architect your system
like you are the one who's issuing these
your application is granting these token
that's giving them out and as we saw
with those signatures before you're
gonna sign it with a key like a strong
key that's private to your server so the
only person who can verify that these
tokens are sent out by the server if
somebody has access to that same key
these tokens are given to the client
that's all we got to talk about browser
security and the clients gonna hold onto
them and then for subsequent requests
until the tokens expire they can use
them to authenticate and be authorized
to resources and all those claims in the
body or what are what helps the
verifying service know what the user can
do so on the verification side this is
where it gets super fun and exciting and
feels very new because it's just a
signature validation and an expiration
time check you've now got this stateless
authentication mechanism so as long as
your server
wherever in your stack you're verifying
authentication tokens as long as that
component has access to that private key
now it can just verify signatures and
look at expiration times and be like
yeah you know I trust this user I
created this token and oh yeah by the
way I put the scope in this token so I
trust this whole thing so you don't have
to go running around to like three
different layers of databases to figure
out like who the user isn't what they
can do it's all encoded in this like
cryptographically signed token so this
is
so backing up to here oh I'm sorry yeah
the question was what is the signature
so when the tokens are created there's a
hash essentially created of this
signature so with the key you can you
know verify the hash was created by that
same input just kind of like your Strief
just straightforward crypto hashing kind
of stuff just there's tons of libraries
out there for these kinds of things so
this is like I say and this is this is
where it feels new and exciting like oh
my god see this off I don't need a
database right like it feels super
exciting because I can like you know
make decisions locally about who the
user is what they can do yeah the other
and that feels super great but
immediately the question that comes up
is like well how do i revoke this right
like if it's really stateless then this
token is basically valid for as long as
it exists like that's kind of scary
right so the OAuth specification
described this idea of access and
refresh token and it's actually super
useful the entire wealth to spec is
pretty large and covers a lot of
concerns and it's a good read if you
want to go to sleep after the lunch
it'll take you like a week they get
through it that way like one section per
day but it is actually I recommend
reading that just because it kind of
gives you like a high-level overview of
things that of problems people are
trying to solve and you can kind of pick
and choose some abstractions that work
and I'm actually a really big fan of the
access token and a refresh token scheme
so I want to talk about that one in
detail basically the way this works is
you're going to create two tokens to JWT
s when the user logs in and you're gonna
give the clamp both of them and the idea
here is that your access token is going
to have a short expiration time and the
Refresh token is going to exist for much
longer
once the access token expires the client
then presents the Refresh token to get
another access token now the pole the
whole point of the scheme is to kind of
like give you a little bit of control
/ how often you do a stateless check and
just implicitly trust versus making some
longer round-trip to assert that this
authentication is still true so you know
in some the paradigm is designed to give
you control over the implicit trust
trade-off with stateless tokens so you
get you get to control for how long
you'll do implicit trust versus go round
trip to a database because the idea with
refresh token replication is that's the
thing you're gonna revoke if you need to
just if you need to kill this user
session if you need to like basically
revoke access you're gonna maintain a
refresh tokens and a database and remove
those when you want to remove access so
in this paradigm the Refresh token
basically sets the maximum lifetime of
the authenticated context you can you
can sort of think of the refresh token
as like the maximum amount of time that
this like you know authenticated session
can exist whereas the authentication
token sets you know that that the little
bit little bit of wiggle room where if
you need to revoke the refresh token how
long can this compromise token be used
for him to put this an example I find it
much easier to talk about this whole
thing through example you know if you're
building some like super secure banking
application where often there's a
requirement that the user gets like
actually forced out after some period of
time you would set your refresh token to
that that force logout time so if the
user is only allowed to have a session
for 30 minutes
you would set their refresh token to 30
minutes and then set your access token
to something small like five minutes so
basically like as the users use an
application every five minutes you're
gonna check like as this as a refresh
token been revoked if so it's like game
over we're done so you know that's the
super secure side but then the flip of
that is like some mobile social app
where once the user logs in they should
be logged in forever and security and
it's probably like less of a concern in
this case just you're gonna set their
refresh token to something in San lien
large like four years
lifetime of the phone how likely are you
to uninstall Chrome that kind of a thing
and then you know how you want to set
the access token again a varies
case-by-case but you can do something
pretty long in there as well but you
know this all feels nice and exciting to
have this stateless check but what if I
want the user to be logged out
immediately when I revoke that refresh
token this is like something that we're
pretty used to being able to do with
traditional applications I use a session
identifier and the answer to this one is
you gotta maintain a blacklist this
feels like introducing the database
again to the authentication layer and
there's truth to that but it's it's sort
of a different process because rather
than maintaining every single session
and having to look it up and every
request instead you can just do a really
quick check like has something been
revoked so if you do need the user to be
forced logged out in this scheme you're
gonna have to maintain a blacklist of
access tokens so when you're issuing
actus and refresh tokens you need to
create a pointer between the tomb and
there is actually a feel for that called
the GTI field you just basically put a
random ID in the tokens and then they
basically reference each other so you'll
need to maintain those pointers in your
database question when ax is still gonna
I it's a good question when an access
token expires your authentication
service should reject it just be like
nope not valid anymore
the refresh token implies that you still
have access to get more access tokens
does that help answer the question okay
how do I describe this and it's was
there another question when the refresh
token expires then you basically have to
login again so it's the whole point of
this access and refresh token thing is
from the clients perspective it's gonna
keep reopen its authentication using the
Refresh token until that Refresh token
is over then it has to present the user
with the OP
they have to login again basically but
the the needle you're controlling
between the lifetime of the - that's an
optimization for your security concerns
and your back-end performance how often
you want a new database checks how often
the client basically asked to
authenticate with you yeah so the
question is like should the user be
notified of this no this should be
totally transparent to the user which is
where cookies are actually gonna be
pretty useful when we get to that part
of the conversation oh the owner them in
a client yes
yeah that's we're going to talk about
yeah okay so back this all blacklisting
so yeah if you need the user to be like
force logged out at that point that
you're doing that when you're revoking a
refresh token you need to then stuff all
the early access tokens in a blacklist
so that all requests coming through just
double check the blacklist to make sure
that it's not in there yeah that's
correct the question is like if you
don't mind waiting you don't need the
blacklist and that's totally true like I
mean the the whole the OAuth spec
doesn't even talk anything about
blacklist cuz they just they assume that
you're okay with waiting for it to
expire but I'm putting this in here
because this question comes up a lot for
us at storm path and so the answer is
like this blacklist scheme so if you're
using a Redis it's super simple you just
stuff the access token and the
expiration of it you know list and then
when you're checking and coming requests
just do a get on that token if it exists
in the blacklist reject the requests
otherwise everything's cool alright so
that's a crazy drive-by of like the
whole like access token scheme from kind
of the client and server perspective but
now we're gonna jump into browsers in
particular which present their own set
of concerns question yeah you have to
when the access token expires you have
to use the Refresh token to get another
one and if that fails it means the
Refresh token has been revoked and your
whole session is over yes yeah and their
access token yeah there's an exchange
going on there the question is like why
even use the Refresh token scheme if you
want to maintain a blacklist again it's
just like your mate you're making a
trade-off with this whole scheme of
wanting to use stateless authentication
but if you if you get yourself into a
situation where you want to use the
scheme but
all of a sudden you're like well I'm
what I need to maintain blacklist
performance-wise it's a lot easier to
check a blacklist and maintain a list of
session IDs for every single user so
again it depends like on your your
context but it's gonna be somewhere in
between these two examples it's like how
often do you want to check that that we
first took it hasn't been revoked like
how big do you want the window to be in
which a compromised access token can be
used by an attacker
so for super secure applications you
want to keep it short but applications
where there's not like a whole lot of
need for security you can make it super
long so it really depends on the
application like the needs of the
application so when you put something in
the blacklist you should have it
automatically expire when that access
token is no longer valid so because that
expiration time is contained in the
token you can know when you're putting
it in your cache layer just say hey
expire this when this thing expires yeah
all right so browser lots of browser
concerns about how to do this securely
it's this whole scheme is actually like
way stimple are mobile because mobile
SDKs provide all these ways to like
store data and like Sam boxes that are
protected to just your application but
that's not really the truth with
browsers there's a lot of trade-offs and
concerns that we have to deal with
something you're gonna see a lot when
you start looking at GWT stuff on the
web is people are storing GWT is in the
local storage but I'm just gonna
straight up say don't do that because
the local storage area just by the
simple virtue of the fact that it's
accessible by the JavaScript environment
is makes you vulnerable to cross-site
scripting attacks we can talk more about
what those attacks are but basically
like if somebody manages to get
malicious code on your site they can
basically steal the authentication
tokens
it's a big problem cookies are actually
a really secure place to store these
tokens if you set the HTTP only and
secure flags on the cookie when you send
them down to the browser what the HTTP
only flag does is prevents that cookie
from being accessible from the
JavaScript environment so by doing that
boom like you've you've made it like
impossible for an access attack to steal
your cookies
now that come cookies do come with this
other really annoying thing which is
cross-site request forgery as an attack
vector how many people know about this
one okay
I'm gonna I'm gonna talk on that one
before I'm done because this is like a
big problem let you have to pay
attention if we're gonna use cookies for
storage something else you're gonna see
out there is the authorization header is
being used to send the token back to the
server so in the OAuth land and you
start looking at the spec they say okay
great you've got an access token you're
gonna use that to authenticate a request
to me awesome I want you to send that to
me in the authorization header on the
request so you know this is fun this is
different we can use JavaScript to set
headers and all that but it's really not
necessary and in fact that kind of like
runs into a lot of cross-origin issues
when you start dealing with custom
headers in JavaScript but if we're gonna
go to the cookie route you don't even
need to do this so it's kind of like why
bother
and cross-domain requests are always
gonna be hell no matter what
authentication contexts or scheme you
deal with I'm sure you've run into this
before so just know that whatever you
can do to simplify cross-domain
situations is gonna help you out so
given all those trade-offs in my opinion
your mileage may vary this is what you
should do this is what we do at storm
path because you know if you're using
one of our front-end libraries we want
to make sure you're like as secure as
possible so these are the choices that
we've made we do do cookies with HTTP
only insecure because CSRF protection is
easy to get right but XSS is easy to get
wrong so we just have made the
opinionated
decision that we want to avoid XSS at
all costs and just deal with
implementing a CSRF solution you don't
want to use the authorization header
because once you're using cookies it's
not really needed and avoid cross-domain
are possible like you know I know
sometimes it's not always possible
because like your angular app is hosted
on some domain that's different from API
service X developed by some team in some
other place but if you have a choice try
to keep things on the same demand it
just makes things a lot simpler
especially when you start dealing with
like browser compatibility below ie 10
and that's just like craziness so what
does the authentication illogical look
like if we're gonna use these tokens and
cookies so the situation is users logged
in
we've sent down an access token and
refresh token store them in cookies on
the next request of my angular app Meeks
they get some data the server is gonna
glue these checks it's gonna say is
there an access token cookie if so is it
valid like was it signed by me is it
expired
if those chicks are okay then great I
can allow this request if they're not
I'm gonna be like alright hold on do you
have a refresh token okay cool I'm gonna
go try getting a new access token using
that refresh token if that works happy
that you know I authenticate the request
on the response I shipped down that new
access token so this is this is that
transparent mechanism we're talking
about where the the client basically
doesn't even really have to deal with
you know managing any authentication
stuff it's just letting the browser do
it's a browser thing of sending cookies
and saving cookies
if the refresh token requests for new
access token fails just this is like
game over like the user the users logged
out like force them to your logout field
so the question is do you transmit the
refreshed hook and the answer is yeah on
every request you're sending along both
so no once refresh token if if that
refresh token is wrong in any way it's
expired it's been revoked this signature
doesn't check out like it's this like
done because that's sort of like those
are the keys to the castle right really
the Refresh token is in a way replacing
that session idea cookie that where are
you still using that's like that's like
the point of failure there's something
wrong with that no more all right so
we've been talking kind of generally
about all these things so let's dive in
a little bit into how this stuff looks
in angular and you know these are
concerns you're going to run into with
any single page application which is how
do I know if the user is logged in how
do I know if they can access a
particular view and how do I know once
all that acts has been revoked I'm gonna
go through each one of these so is the
user logged in well
we've used that HTTP only flag so that
JavaScript can't touch it so a hand look
at cookies to know if I'm logged in alas
this is the one like valid argument for
putting your tokens in local storage is
that your your angular application can
look at them and be like aha there's
tokens and they're not expired yet so on
and so forth but is it worth the
trade-off of cross-site scripting and
possibilities my answer is no but I'm
also like security dude so there's a
trade-off there if you're going to go
the route of using cookies what this
inevitably means is you need to put some
kind of route on your server that the
application will hit to get information
about the current user
we call it slash me I think that came
from Facebook once upon a time just
Facebook still use a slash me thing
yeah so you know you're gonna have this
async operation which is annoying I
guess but in my opinion is way more
secure so how do you have you deal with
the fact that like I need to like do
this acing thing before knowing if I can
even like render the application to the
user well both ng route in UI router
provide a super convenient way to do
this this is a UI router example but
they have this idea of resolves we're
just basically like on the definition of
the view route you can define a few
promises that must be resolved before
things go forward an actual view
transition happens so this is actually
pretty straightforward you know you'll
have some kind of a authentication
service that'll have a get user method
that's X you're trying to promise it'll
do the work of like going around trips
that mirror out and then bring it back
the user data there's also some other
really cool things that you can do
you'll see these if you look at our
angular SDK for our product but we also
maintain a user object on the root scope
which is just no yeah I guess you're not
supposed to test groups root scope but
whatever like it works so we maintain a
user property there if it's null we
don't know who the user is yet so like
the off service if nobody's called it
yet but to get the user context or if
it's currently waiting on that mean
route that this property is known as
soon as the first time that promise is
resolved then we set the context the
users not logged in we said to false
otherwise you populated it with the
user's object data we also broadcast and
I'll thin a catered event when the user
is known so between these three things
like a promise that gets the current
user an awesome routes go pack and
authenticated event like it kind of
covers all the basis of like you know
helping all those crazy components are
going to enter it and a great like know
like hey am I logged in or not
and if you need to deal with the case
where the users not logged in when those
resolves fail on those view definitions
both libraries will fire an event an
error event telling you like why why the
viewstate couldn't be resolved so you're
off service needs to just like give back
some information like not logged in or
whatever that's the error properties on
these events again if you if you look at
the stump at that angular SDK you can
see a lot of this stuff in play okay so
the authorization concern you know can
the user access this view well again
there's another cool argument here for
storing the token and local storage
because then we could inspect the scope
and see like you know do they have scope
XYZ to access this view so on and so
forth pretty cool but again like you
know that's a trade-off you're making
security wise otherwise you know the
information can just exist off this
lesson mirror out like you just returned
that representation of the user that has
that information question oh yeah so the
question is like you know if it's in
local storage it can be modified but the
server can still like verify the hash of
the thing to make sure wasn't modified
yeah I mean those things are all true
but as soon as you start introducing
that round-trip to the server to verify
it it's sort of like this there's been
no point putting it in local storage
anyways so it hasn't actually saved you
that round-trip to get to get the
information you need okay so an
authorization example again we're going
to just like a leverage resolves here so
you could change if you need to
basically assert something about the
user before you show a certain view just
chain a promise on to your user get our
promise and then make some decision you
know about like does the user have XYZ
properties if so that's how I'm going to
deal with resolving or rejecting this
user promise for this view
that's a duplicate sign okay and so the
last concern you know how do I know when
this authentication contact has ended
you know either because the Refresh
token X bar or got revoked so because
we're like using api's or making an xhr
attempts as suit you'll as soon as you
see a 401 response from your api service
that means the tokens have been rejected
for some reason so in this case you can
just fire an unauthenticated event and
then people who need to like do things
in your application based on that can
respond to that and do something like a
redirect to the login view this would be
achieved by using an HTTP interceptor
and angular and pretty and pretty
straightforward stuff by the way I
learned something of a super interesting
about HTTP interceptors the other day if
you implement all the like response and
request interfaces but forgot to but
forget to pass along the promise that
comes in you can totally muck with other
people who file interceptors after you
so be careful about that
no I don't cover that specifically but
the idea is your the response from the
media route will essentially have the
scope in it so yeah me at that point
you're like going out of bands and not
of the token or not really using the
token to know but it's like it's trying
to navigate this trade-off of like do
acts you want this thing accessible by
JavaScript or not I'm at 38 minutes
which gives me two minutes left this is
like serious business time no there's
like flow diagrams and there's no cat
pictures I'm actually gonna blow through
this necklace s stuff because all your
cookies belong to me now and talk about
CSRF in the last two minutes cuz this is
a super annoying one that's easy to like
not know about
it's basically exploiting the fact that
HTML tags don't follow the same origin
policy so what does that mean well by
example
what it means is if like your user is on
some other site and that sites malicious
and it puts an image tag in here like
this that's making our quest to your
application that purely relies and just
like looking at the information that
cookies to authenticate the request it's
going to do this thing you've actually
got an API endpoint that takes
parameters like this and just says hey
you've got a session cookie like cool
you can do that well you know the
browser is going to comply in the
situation it says the request is going
to my app Chrome so I'm going to send
along the cookies from my app comm and
so your server just gonna like not even
know that this request actually came
from some other website which is super
scary so how do you do how do you deal
with this well if you look at the Olaf
security guides they're gonna describe
all these crazy things the synchronizer
token pattern is not really useful for
single page apps but the double submit
cookie one
is so let's just look at this flow
diagram this is the serious business
time part so if you want to combat CSRF
when you're setting a session cookie on
the way down or access tokens refresh
tokens whatever if you need to if you're
using cookies to store authentication
information you need to do this which is
you're actually going to set another
cookie with some random value in it and
then your client in this case JavaScript
needs to do the annoying thing of
creating this custom header when it
makes requests to your server and
sending that same token in the request
because attackers and other websites
won't be able to make to forge an attack
using JavaScript because when you try to
set a custom header like this in
JavaScript cross-domain it's not gonna
work it's gonna blow up the browser is
gonna say no I'm actually not allowed to
do that because I'm not allowed to talk
to that domain so this is one way you
can trigger the browser to enforce that
check is by setting this in the header
so on the server side it's super simple
you just say like did I get this same
value
you know cookie and a header if so
clearly this is coming from JavaScript
running on my domain this kind of just
examples how this looks from the
attackers viewpoints so if they try to
use the same image tag you know the
cookie will be sent along that's a sort
of token cookie will be sent but this
check is gonna fail because not coming
in as a header and similarly if they've
put some malicious JavaScript in the
page and they try to set the header to
try to achieve this workaround the
browser is gonna straight up just say no
don't do that
there's a few other things that you can
check but they're kind of just like fall
backs for all that so if you got the
slide show URL you can look at the rest
of this to ask me questions after but
that's a lot of stuff thank you don't
let them have your cookies and if you
don't want to deal with any of this
just you storm path because I did it all
for you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
