it one hmm okay well anyway I'm super
excited to be here to introduce you to
my friend Nick Colville I met Nick for
the first time when I was CTO at reddit
and we were doing a VP of in search and
we had been doing it for nine months I
think and we had maybe talked to 12 or
18 very good people but nobody quite met
we had a really kind of aggressive set
of criteria that we were looking for and
we could kind of take our time something
about the criteria we needed somebody
who had a track record of building large
teams quickly somebody who cares about
and knows how to build awesome cultures
somebody who cares about building a
diverse and inclusive culture somebody
who cares about improving the world
that's something very important to us
somebody who wants to win and somebody
who doesn't mind solving lots of hard
problems and I don't mean just tech
problems I mean various interesting
corporate culture management problems
that we also have to tackle and even
most important somebody who has better
taste and clothes than I do which
actually all was all the candidates so
whatever fine
so after interviewing a bunch of people
I chatted with Nick on the phone he was
up in Seattle and after about an hour I
turned to Steve and I said that's a guy
Steve's our CEO and so we went into sail
mode I told Nick I would do anything I'd
paint his fence I would mow his lawn
that offer still stands I think I still
owe it to him and then he join us as VP
avenge and his impact was immediate he
started really smoothing out everything
that we do making everything run really
well how I would plan how we execute how
we hire everything and then that was
extremely important because we were
rapidly growing and we continued to
rapidly rapidly grow in fact in the last
18 months I think right Engineering grew
by about 3x which is a lot to take on
and if it falls normal operating
procedure of a Silicon Valley company it
will grow 3x again in the next 18 months
so a lot going on before coming to join
us at reddit he was at Microsoft for 15
years as a general manager which meant
that he has giant teams and has to make
them work really really well and he's
right now he actively participates with
dev color which is a nonprofit that
works to maximize the impact of black
software engineers and he's also a
founder
color-code which is a scholarship that
dedicated to future leaders of color and
tech so please help me welcome Nick to
the stage he's going to be talking about
growing teams by 3x I'm Nick Caldwell
thank you guys for joining me here at Q
con day three I'll be a keynote speaker
and I want to do a quick reintroduction
of myself VP of engineering at reddit
previously it was a general manager at
Microsoft there's some power bi folks in
the audience here today really glad to
see you guys
before that school to MIT go bears
and for a cow any bears in the audience
there we go go bears I want to talk to
the few of you that don't know about
what reddit is this is gonna lead into
explaining some of the challenges that I
face so what is reddit reddit is the
front page of the internet a social
network where there are tens of
thousands of communities around whatever
passions or interests that you might
have so you know the way that we think
about reddit is is exactly that a
collection of passionate communities and
one of the interesting things about that
is it means that reddit has one of the
highest engagement scores of any site on
the web so here's Alexa you know top top
ten lists we've got Google YouTube
Facebook and read it and if you check
out that column daily time on site 15
minutes and 50 seconds next closest is
Facebook with 9 minutes and 50 seconds
so I won't explain why that works how
that works
reddit is unique in the following ways
reddit has pseudo anonymous accounts you
don't have to sign in with your real
identity and for those of you who are
asking about the future of Reddit it
will always be that way you'll always
have to be able to do pseudo anonymous
accounts we have passionate communities
with rules so that only certain types of
content can go into a community we have
voting and we have this thing called the
hot front page which aggregates all that
great content from across the entire
Internet when you apply scale to that
you get the following thing just an
endless stream of addictive you know
time-sucking content
we like to think of reddit as weaponized
procrastination so that's what I'm doing
for a living now where we add it read it
read is the 4th largest website in the
United States according to Alexa 325
million monthly active users 1.1 million
communities what's new this year new
executive team Steve and Alexis have
come back more importantly a new product
vision I think a lot of you are our core
editors might agree that the site could
be more welcoming and that is going to
be a core focus that was a core focus
for us last year now we've got a
foundation to build on it toward the
future and then wrap it hiring and
that's what this presentation is going
to be about last year we grew reddit
from 40 engineers we currently have a
130 plus about 25 part-time contractors
and I expect that that's going to
continue through through next year so
why why do I want to talk about scale
why is this presentation important to me
and why I hope you guys care about it a
few years ago there was a reports to
start up genome report and they surveyed
about a thousand startups ones that have
been successful ones that had failed and
tried to ask them why and figure out the
formula for a successful startup and
this was an interesting statistic within
three years 92% of startups fail of
those 43% failed due to issues with
scale and this is a really important
statistic for me because I've just
traded my cushy executive level position
at Microsoft - come soon reddit and I
would love for us to be successful so
with that in mind here is my first week
at reddit Marty introduced me to in the
first week - a 30 person stand up I
think I think the way to characterize
what we saw here was that reddit was
still kind of using the tools and
techniques of a very very small team but
trying to scale up with them so we saw
that 30 persons stand up we saw Google
slides tracking our work so we hadn't
fully implemented Jiri yet we had a lot
of people running around calling
themselves tech leads
but there was really no org chart know
like really formal management structure
and there was a lot of her a lot of
resistance to that as well
and then we had a really slow delivery
pace there wasn't a lot of things coming
out of the engineering organization and
with all that in mind tons of stuff to
do tons of stuff to ship I don't think
anyone looks at reddit and imagines that
it's done and we also needed to hire
about a hundred people so with Marty's
help and on the rest of exec team we
managed to fix all these problems and
this is what the presentation is gonna
be about I'll tell you about my
experience and the rest of the exec
teams experience at reddit first thing
we had to fix roles and responsibilities
so when you're in a really really small
company I think you know your classic
example for any Silicon Valley startup
is you've got your technical co-founder
and your product co-founder and those
two work together to effectively do
everything imaginable you know I think
the best example of this is like you
might have your CTO on sales calls if
you're at a really really really small
company but as you scale up you can
attract expertise and you can specialize
that CTO and and and product co-founder
split off into engineering disciplines
and product discipline design and then a
whole other constellation of specialties
this was the first thing we had to do at
reddit and I'll tell you a quick example
of why it mattered so much at reddit we
we encounter a lot of different legal
issues were a really really big site big
target and I want to talk to you about
our chief legal counsel her name's Missy
Tidwell and her first week at reddit so
in Missy's first week at reddit she
joined a meeting it was it was called
the reddit legal council meeting and in
this meeting were about 15 to 20
I see level engineers who were all very
passionate about the law all right as if
you could take 15 passionate people cram
them in a room and immediately gain the
equivalent of a Harvard Law degree this
is what Missy walked into she
immediately shut that meeting down and
to own own legal counsel at reddit now
the this extends to other areas of your
organization not just law but you've got
to figure out a way to tease apart
responsibilities as you scale now one
really common framework is this thing
called racy and maybe you guys have seen
this thing before you what you do is you
make a chart of all the people in your
or in your organization as well as all
the different responsibilities they
might have ray C stands for a
responsible accountable consulted and
informed so you make this chart and then
you assign people RAC or I depending on
their relationship to the different
tasks and the really nice thing about
this is you get very very clear
ownership outcomes everyone knows
exactly who's responsible for what after
you go through this operation and for
reddit there were kind of two
interesting things we had to tease apart
first was the relationship between
product program managers and engineering
managers we had a lot of people were
program managers and for those you still
have those in your organization you know
they kind of switch-hit they're doing a
little bit of running daily stand-ups
that are also doing a lot of the
customer interaction and so forth we
split that into two roles product
managers who are responsible for the who
what and why of what the product
organization is producing and then
engineering managers who responsible for
how and when things are going to be
built this immediately allowed us to to
get people focused on the things that
they were best at program managers
converting to product managers and
engineering managers allowed to to run
the engineering organization now the
second thing with engineering managers
going back to what I said at first we
didn't really have any engineering
managers at reddit when we started we
had folks calling themselves tech leads
and tech leads is a really really
difficult title I don't know if you guys
have tech leads in your organization but
remember when I was first starting as a
as a an engineer I asked my manager what
a tech lead was and he said no one
really knows kind of depends kind of
depends on your organization and you
know now like 15 years later people ask
me like what is a tech lead and I'm like
no but I do know
engineering managers are and I know what
architects are so I needed to come up
with a formula to convert all these
folks who are calling themselves tech
leads into roles that had more clear
function so I came up with the
voight-komp test for engineering
managers anyone Bladerunner fans in here
okay so you guys know what point Kampf
is you go in the machine you take the
test and it tells you whether or not
you're a human or robot this test will
tell you whether or not you're a
engineering manager or an architect and
what do you care more about people are
architecture pretty straightforward what
are your thoughts about shipping on a
deadline if you're an engineering
manager you don't want to ship things on
time you might have a gonna have a bad
time of it more interesting one your
p.m. goes to two of your direct ports
and tells them immediately start working
on a feature what do you do as an
engineering manager you've got to stay
on top of that and then finally you
spend one full day a week fishing
LinkedIn working with recruiting how do
you feel all right
this very quickly split our tech leads
into a class of people who cared more
about building the team and process and
so forth
and another class of people who cared
about the code the architecture now the
disadvantages of using this technique
this racis technique is it's it's
inflexible sometimes you do have people
who can switch hit occasionally you get
like an engineer who's really good at
design or has really good product
intuition and it also doesn't directly
address some of the deeper issues which
is trust all right and you can't scale
your organization ultimately without
trust so I won't go into detail on this
slide but it just talks about the
advantages and disadvantages of running
an organization with high trust this
comes from a book called the speed of
trust and I encourage you to to check it
out the long story short of it is you're
more efficient the more you can can take
dependencies that you trust later on and
talk about microservices and how that
idea relates to micro services but for
now just imagine that to fix this we had
to go to executive offsites with
leadership training coaches we didn't
quite do trust Falls but we did but we
did find a way to put our faith in each
other
and I think in general people feel a
ok2say that's not my job when they can
also say the person we hired to do it is
amazing and a quick tip for those of you
who are scaling your organization's and
you might have this problem now when you
hire people into your organization I
strongly encourage you not to put them
in a position where they have to prove
themselves to the organization before
you give them responsibility because you
just spent weeks interviewing them and
convincing them to work for your
organization I think a better way to
handle onboarding new people in your
team is to trust them first give them
tasks and then verify that they're
delivering what they said they were
going to deliver so trust but verify
when you're bringing new people into
your organization all right so that's
how we ended up in an organization where
we had good roles and responsibilities
but we still didn't have an org chart so
org charts are pretty scary I think the
most terrifying part of constructing
your organization really is deciding on
the structure who reports to who what
the responsibilities are etc so I
caution you that this next section might
be a little bit terrifying but it is
also one of the keys to success at
reddit now I want to introduce a concept
called Conway's law Conway is a an
academic many many many years ago he
wrote a paper about organizational
structures and and one key insight on
that was organizations which design
systems are constrained to produce
designs which are copies of the
communication structures of these
organizations and all that really boils
down to is you will ship your org chart
I think you can see this in products
many of you and I was at Redfin the
other day and I was trying to test this
on them I said you know when I look at
the red Finn product there's an area for
Realtors there's an error for people who
are searching for for real estate and
there's an area for people who are
trying to analyze data and I bet
somewhere in your org chart there's a
group for each of those three people and
they said yes of course and I think
you'll see that same pattern emerging
across pretty much any company so
Conway's law has been fairly well trod
now the challenge that then is
that your organization needs to
continually reflect it's the
organization's most immediate goals and
the best people for each goal should be
continually moved to where they are most
needed
now that's an ideal statement a very
very ideal statement but intuitively
that should make sense the the challenge
is reorg suck
nobody likes nobody likes switching man
raise your hand in this room if you like
reorge do you want to switch managers so
a real works suck people don't like
people build strong relationships with
their managers they don't want to they
don't like change in general and they
don't like the the risk and uncertainty
the feeling that the ground is moving
out from under them that comes with with
reorg but exercise to tell you a little
story about that read its first reorg so
reddit even when I got there there was
it was only about 35 people and we
needed to move one of our key engineers
around now you can guess why we needed
to move some around with someone around
reddit had a great front-end engineer
and we needed to get him into a position
where he could work on the site redesign
and in order to make this happen in
order to move one engineer from one part
of the organization to another part of
the organ that is a organization where
he was most needed we had to get HR
involved they called his wife to get
permission
and and in many of the PM teams who had
never been involved in a reorg also
submitted their their opinions through
back-channel just to move one engineer
from one part of the organization to
another so reorg can be really painful
just so you know like ultimately that
engineer became one of the the key
leaders at reddit you know he's now
leading our front end guild now I will
say that reorge have the following
advantage a they do put your resources
where they're most needed but more
importantly they allow leaders who are
comfortable with change and who want
most urgently to participate in the most
important aspects of your business to
surface so there can be good and bad but
I think that for the efficiency of your
organization and for surfacing new
leaders reworks can be quite useful now
with reddit it took us about five or six
months took us one month to get to that
first person moving and about five
minutes five months later
here's reddit's first ourchart so I'd
like to revise Conway's law in the
following way you are gonna ship your
org chart you just have to make sure
that you're continually shipping the
right one with reddit we ended up with
groups of a product groups around
significant investments like the site
redesign doing chat there's an issue t'v
call reddit social but vertical teams to
attack specific customer problems and
then share teams that go horizontally
and and are used by every part of the
organization those would include things
like your foundational infrastructure
team we have a team called anti evil
which which fights crime I guess across
the entire entire site and then each box
on our org chart has a very very clear
bounded time bounded mission statement
so this is what we ended up with after
five months and I'm pretty happy with it
but what's next if you go back and read
that original Mel Conway paper it's got
an interesting note at the end it says
the design which occurs first is almost
never the best possible the prevailing
system may need to change therefore
flexibility of the organization is
important to an effective design which I
think is
it's subtle but it's very very important
and I think that in today's modern world
it's something everybody who is
responsible for designing organizational
systems needs to pay attention to and
the idea here is that you can actually
reverse Conway's law that is to say the
architecture that you're building can
inform the organizational structure and
microservices and the and the strong
push toward that which I think a lot of
which is what a lot of this conference
is about enables that scenario
micro-services fundamentally change how
we think about an organization so this
is a really cool diagram I went and it's
called the it's called the Deathstar
architecture and on the left you've got
amaz on the right you've got Netflix
this is their constellation of micro
services that hold hold up Amazon and
Netflix and I think that if you end up
with an organizational and architecture
of this form that in the future mission
value and culture will probably end up
being more important than rigid
organizational hierarchy and if you look
at Amazon and Netflix and you examine
how those companies exist in how they
form both of these companies have
inch-thick
culture decks I don't know if you've
seen the the Netflix one is literally
like a hundred and twenty page twenty
page slide deck Amazon very similar very
very strong about cultural values and
they also have another property both of
these companies aspire to have very very
small teams so Amazon is famous for its
pizza box size teams I'm sure you guys
have heard that and Netflix similarly
they have I don't know if you guys are
aware of this but Netflix says we only
hire seniors because we want people to
act independently and they also have
very very small teams so I think that
one thing that you guys should be aware
about through that throughout the day as
we talk about culture and micro services
is how micro services are affecting the
shape of organizations it's something
that's fascinating to me okay let's move
on other things that change as you scale
people first photo on the top left that
is one of my my first teams at Microsoft
the the power bi team when it was only
three months old and what you can see
there is every single person that team
fits on my porch alright if it's on my
porch and then the next photo is that
same team a year later I can't even fit
everyone in the team into the frame and
I can also tell you unfortunately I
don't know most of the people in that
photo so the more people you have the
more disconnected you can feel from the
team how do you deal with that or I
guess I guess as you scale everyone's
going to have one of these moments the
elevator moment is what I like to call
it if you guys are madmen fans here's
Don Draper and one of his reports Don's
in the elevator his report says I feel
bad for you
Don says I don't think about you at all
now I'm sure you want yours experience
won't be that bad but you are eventually
gonna start bumping into people who
maybe even work for you that you don't
recognize and what do you do about it
well don't feel bad about it there's a
concept called Dunbar's number and it's
really a bit of research done about how
many people you can actually know and it
turns out the answer is 150 that above
150 relationships the human mind simply
simply cannot maintain the connections
and you know reddit we're up to about
300 total people now so we're well
beyond Dunbar's number but I'll claim
that you don't need to know everyone at
the party to have a good time so it's
safe if you're responsible for
organizational to design to assume that
subcultures are going to form but how do
you handle it well at reddit and I think
at most companies you can use a
technique of forming technology guilds
or affinity groups these are all great
ways to give people a place to call home
even as the company expands so it reddit
we've got you know front end guild back
end guild
we've got guilds for you know dungeon
and Dragons I mean you can really pick
anything you might want as long as you
give people some place to connect to
they'll still have that that that
feeling that they're at home
don't let anyone ruin the party so even
though subcultures are going to form you
have to make sure that they're not
forming in a way that goes against
your core company values and that's the
the final point make sure that your core
company values are crisp and it clearly
understood and that they inform all of
the subcultures that may form within
your organization
reddit solution guilds weekly All Hands
meetings where we celebrate our key
cultural elements and then one other
thing that we do which I'm not sure that
will continue scales we have company
mega events take the entire company to
Tahoe to talk about our successes our
failures and our cultural values but
what about communication I think that as
you scale you still need to talk to
people you still need to disseminate
information unfortunately this is an
unsolved human problem you can try all
of these different techniques
newsletters team sinks company meetings
interest groups documentation
one-on-ones posters onboarding press
releases off-site slack email wiki's and
dashboards unfortunately none of them
work you have to use them all I think
that in my lifetime I will see I will
see drones delivering pizza I will see I
will see self-driving cars I will see
stem cells solve most modern ailments
but I will not see a solution to getting
two groups of people 50 feet apart to
speak to each other you know I'm right
so how what can you do you do have to
try all of those things I'll add to that
you can beat the telephone game by
messaging with extreme clarity you have
to make sure that when you message the
you have something in it that applies to
everyone in your organization you have
to repeat repeat repeat and reinforce
get your leaders to understand the core
of the message and repeat it out and
over communicate so this is a photo of
some posters that we hung up in in the
in the wall of my last team because we
had quality problems and we had problems
with people implementing telemetry so
anywhere you would go in our building
you saw these posters quality and
telemetry and they became kind of our
core values for the year so extreme
clarity now I want to end this section
by talking about
you know engineering what gets harder
with scale and this is kind of the core
of what I did at reddit to try and get
them operating effectively there's three
things that change first is awareness
your or your company gets bigger
everyone wants to know what everyone
else is doing but they don't necessarily
want to say what they're doing all right
coordination all right you've got more
teams with more dependencies not only
need to know what everyone else is doing
but you may have to online ship
schedules and things like that and then
finally bottlenecks can hit your really
really hard so if you've got tons and
tons of dependencies in your
organization and your get you're getting
network dependencies a failure in one
part of your organization can knock out
you know the ship schedule for you know
multiple other teams so this is what
gets harder I want to show you oh and
let me just sorry one second let me I
think Mike clickers why does it get
harder I want to I think I mentioned
this before the reason I went to
Berkeley was I got an MBA so I want to
pull out the this hundred thousand
dollar slide my MBA enabled me to make
these efficiency curves so one common
thing is surely you can just add more
people into an organization and and
things will get more efficient turns out
to not be true as you add more people
into an organization their efficiency
goes down than that that's because of
communication overhead or breaks in your
process
coordination costs scope increase
eventually kill your efficiency and you
need a process change or reorg in order
to overcome this curve so with that I
want to show you where we started at
reddit this is reddit's first project
tracker it is a Google spreadsheet
excuse me a Google slide and this guy's
acting up it's a Google slide you can
see that we have copy and pasted JIRA
links into the slide very carefully some
of the items in the slide have green or
yellow checkmarks also hand edited and
most importantly you will see that we
have Aquaman and Batgirl
very frequently we spent more time
talking about the images Aquaman or
Batgirl than we did about the actual
information on the slide and there were
12 of these that we had to go
through during our during our stand-ups
so this is where we started now I needed
to come in and convert that into
something that would work for an
organization and that we could scale
with I want to caution anyone else that
finds himself in this situation to do it
carefully all right the reason for that
is you know you don't want to in an
organization that is not used to process
be the guy who comes and lands a ton of
process on the team they will generally
not react that well if you find yourself
in this situation I would say just avoid
boilerplate solutions if someone comes
to you with it here's an agile framework
book I'm telling you like back away
slowly all right there are some variants
of agile that promotes intra team
coordination and coordination more than
they promote actually shipping software
and that is a very dangerous thing to
bring into your team so I do want to
talk about the original Toyota Kanban so
if you guys ever wonder where Kanban
boards come from that they come from
Toyota you know many many years ago and
they had a process called Kaizen I think
for me it's the most important
inspiration for how I build engineering
teams and the idea was really really
simple if you were in a Toyota factory
working on the production line there was
a thing called the and on cord
above your station at the production
line and if you're working on a part and
something goes wrong you pull on this
cord and the whole production line stops
managers descend from manager heaven or
whatever whatever managers come from and
they come to your station and they say
hey what's the problem like what's wrong
with what's what's wrong with your
station and only then does new process
get added to the production line and the
reason I like this is because it means
that process forms from the bottom up
in an organic fashion and it's
tailor-made to what that production line
needs now stepping that back up and
getting a little bit more meta I think
that's important because your process
will become your culture over time and
for reddit we want to be really agile we
want to be flexible and I think that's
starting the company with this sort of
Bottoms Up organic process is going to
take us to the future in a way that I
want the engineering organization to
grow all right so let's walk through
what we did really quick this is red
it's JIRA evolution we started with a
actually Marty and I put this together
we started with a six step instruction
manual that we we came up with
definition planning staffing execution
launch and monitor any work in the
organization can be one of those states
we work with our IT departments to try
and get that into into JIRA and that's a
screenshot of it there this allowed us
to get two team dashboards in JIRA so
you can see this is for our reddit
community experiences team and you can
see across that entire organization all
the epics and what state they're in
backlog planning staffing execution
monitoring this wasn't really useful for
daily stand-ups but once we gotten the
team to commit to putting the stuff in a
juror we were able to get everyone
Kanban boards which word rate for
stand-ups problem here is now we we
still need to report out you know it's
not enough to stop at the level of
Kanban boards we've got a report out to
the rest of the team here is our first
attempt which was integrating our JIRA
with tableau this is maybe a little bit
too wonky but what it does is it allows
you to see a real-time dashboard of all
the work happening across all the teams
at reddit in real time along with like a
little health monitoring metric that we
came up with an and automatically
generated calendar I was pretty proud of
that
we we put it together but where we ended
up with and I think you'll think you'll
like it where we ended up with instead
of this is executive dashboards these
are updated in real time and people like
them a lot more because we brought the
cartoons back
that's where right now results of that I
think speak for themselves in 2017 these
are all the major releases we had new
moderator male launch of profile pages
self service ad platform International
reddit new video platform new search
platform new chat platform complete site
redesign coming soon Wow no one's happy
about that okay so that's what we did at
reddit now I know that there's a lot of
non managers in the audience I want to
kind of wrap up my talk with a couple
quick tips for how you can take
advantage of scale as an Icee so three
quick career tips for scaling first one
get comfortable being uncomfortable as
your organization grows and changes you
have to believe me that there is
opportunity in change comfort is the
enemy of progress and this advice kind
of applies more broadly as well like if
you're in a rapidly changing
organization you will see more
opportunities but just in general as a
software engineer one of the reasons
that you will like working in this
industry is because you get to
continually learn while I've given this
talk three new JavaScript frameworks
have been released but get comfortable
getting out of your comfort zone for me
that meant leaving Microsoft and joining
a startup that meant doing an MBA while
I was working full time find ways to
push yourself second follow the
investment so reorg
you know you may you may have a manager
your mayor is always gonna tell you that
the work you're doing is the most
important thing in the organization
trust me all right but nothing speaks
louder than a reorg
to tell you where where your executives
or your leadership team want to spend
their most spend all the bullets if you
will so follow the investments if you
can understand the reasoning behind a
reorganization then you understand the
priorities of your leadership team and
if you can take advantage of that you
can put yourself in the most valuable
valuable positions in the company and
then finally
process pilot if your organization is
growing and scaling it means that people
like me people like your managers are
all trying to figure out the right
process for your team and it's actually
very very hard because you never know
the right process upfront I told you
guys explicitly don't try and land on a
team with a this agile framework book
will solve all your problems don't do
that
you as an IC or as a manager in the
organization can help by piloting to
find the right solution the other thing
that's important about this as I said
before your process will become your
culture so if you want to have a great
culture try and participate in this
you'll help your manager and you'll help
your future engineers so that's some
quick advice final thoughts on scaling
fast at reddit to opportunities and one
challenge I want to leave you guys with
and these are these are both maybe a
little bit more personal to me I think
that at reddit because we're scaling so
fast we have an opportunity to do a
great job of diversity inclusion I
there's gonna be a huge track on this
later so I think will be interesting but
for me this is important because I
believe that diversity includes teams
build better products but even more
important I just think they're more fun
to work in and that often gets
overlooked being able to come into an
organization and meet all sorts of
different interests and types of people
is something that I just enjoy and I
think your team's will as well like any
cultural aspect you want to get this
fixed early as you scale because it's
extremely difficult to fix later on and
I don't need to to tell you guys about
all the different stories about DNI
problems in the valley right now but I
read it we believe as we grow we can we
can help solve this problem make it part
of our DNA from day one right right in
wrong ways to do this I think that
rather than hiring a head of diversity
the best thing to do is get your entire
executive team involved so it read it
each one of our execs has kpi's
associated with with diversity inclusion
we don't assume that everyone cares
about this topic but we try and find
ways to allow them to participate
through the employee resource groups we
don't complain about the
pipeline one of the fundamental things
that I learned when I came to Silicon
Valley from Seattle is the value of
bootcamps I think my my first week at
reddit we invited a group called hack
right to the company for mentoring and I
got to meet some of the hardest working
hardest hustling women who want to
switch careers and get into technology
that I've ever met in my life and since
then we've taken many opportunities to
hire boot camp graduates into into
Reddit and I can tell you for sure
they've become some of the strongest
leaders in our organization this is
something I wouldn't have expected but I
am now a strong believer don't complain
about the pipeline find ways to actively
change it and then the final thing don't
ever in your organization say diversity
of thought like I will find you I will
find you'd never say we don't see gender
or color like I will find you when you
say those kind of things it kind of kind
of means like if you tell me you don't
see color it means you don't really see
me and that can be very very hurtful if
you're a leader who's responsible for
building an organization be intentional
and be patient and stay focused you can
move the needle I think you have the
tools and the opportunity now and social
impact as your company gets better
bigger just remember you can have more
value to the world in the software that
you shipped here we've got us at hack
right we've got team reddit extra life
play video games raise money and nothing
wrong with that and nothing wrong with
that and on the right this is where one
of our directors went to Uganda to
actually to train some up-and-coming
entrepreneurs there finally a note to
managers about scale long ago when I was
you know kind of a new manager sorry I'm
getting stopped last story I promise
long ago when I was a new manager I was
trying to I was bold and I was I was
starting to trying to understand what it
meant to be perhaps a director someday
or even an executive so one day I went
to
the office of my senior vice president
his name is Kurt del bene and I camped
outside of his office until he showed up
and I asked him when he showed up if I
could come in and pick his brain and
after a long conversation I asked him
like hey you know what do eggs X even do
like what do you do in your office all
day and he showed me he took me over to
his desk and he showed me an Excel
spreadsheet and he said Nick I changed
the numbers in this Excel spreadsheet I
I'm not kidding you showed me that and I
I was just baffled I couldn't believe it
I thought he was joking he said I
changed the team sizes here and it
changes this budget allocation here
that's that's pretty much what I do but
he told me following that the hardest
part of his job as a leader as an
executive was remembering that when he
changed those numbers it affected
hundreds of people so as your
organization scales you can sometimes
find yourself in this very risky very
unsafe proposition where you forget
about people and you start calling them
resources so if you're a manager in this
room and you're responsible for growing
an organization please please be careful
all right just remember that people are
the most valuable part of any
organization and then the reason that
you became a manager in the first place
okay so with that I have a few calls to
action reddit is hiring I have to get
that pitch in we also have an internship
program if everyone's interested in that
follow me on reddit twitter media my
linkedin and my wife and i have started
the color code fund we're raising money
for future people of color in the tech
industry with that you guys have been an
amazing audience thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
