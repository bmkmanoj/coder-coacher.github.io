usually go in to find some sort of a tag
here for example private static final
string tag equals say FID Lib and that's
it so now that we have that tag we can
go in here say inside of this function
say something like log D tag
you know fib J I off and then we could
paste in this N and close this yeah
yes string concatenation is not the best
thing to do but it gets the job done
of course we need to import the log from
the Android util folder or a package we
click on that and it gets imported for
this one I kind of don't want to go and
just copy paste this in here I could so
I could go in here like so and invoke
this the problem is of course I would
rename it problem is because this is
recursive this would be extremely
expensive I would see a lot of these log
statements so instead of doing it this
way what I'll do is I'll actually create
a helper function like we did for C call
it private static long fib you know long
end and this is where we're gonna
essentially do this this code is gonna
just be part of this function and this
is gonna be a fib and fib yeah so this
is the recursive one and then here we're
just gonna go and call that function
instead so return fib of n done now
don't let this confuse you that we have
a static v function here and we have a
static fed function here these two can
not see each other and in fact the fact
that they did it look like they have the
same name makes no difference in fact
this function because it's static is
never exported so you know it's not seen
by anything outside of this native
library and this is private so it's not
they also gonna be seen by anyone
outside of this particular class so
anyway we now have logging here and that
hopefully will work
but what about logging from native code
like what if we wanted to do logging
here and here how do we do this and by
logging we of course I'm referring to
the androids log buffer that everyone
walks to so essentially I want the our
log cat to read to turn you know some
sort of old print some sort of entries
that are coming from C code some how do
we do this well well it just so happens
that Android improvise a library to do
exactly that the only thing is we need
to go in included library and then we
need to go and in you know link to it
and then call it so include the library
the library is actually itself in called
log our age but it's in Android oops
Android slash log age so this is how I'm
going to include it as a system library
and now that I have it I want to go and
use it the way that of course how do I
know what's available to me well it just
so happens that all these libraries all
these I should say header files are
available as part of the NDK so if I go
inside of in fact I can just let's say
pin it inside of my developer Android
NDK directory I'll find here are my
platforms and then I'll have the
different platforms that indicates the
supporter over the years and so 14 is
the latest one that I just happened to
be using and then I can pick for example
one of the architectures in this case
it's not architecture specific go to the
includes directory and then go into the
androids log h that's the file that I'm
actually importing or it's including as
a system system the other file so what
does this thing have well it basically
talks about you know how you can do yeah
logging but specifically down below it
defines the list of priorities that I
could log at and it defines essentially
a print function or I should say a log
or
right function in a lot print function
that I could use to log so what I do is
I would call this function specify the
priority specify the tag and specify
some sort of a you know formatted strain
plus variable number of arguments that
would be fed into that string so let's
go and use it here's the function I'm
gonna use I'm gonna copy this go into my
Eclipse and so for example say right
here I would go and say okay we're going
to log know how we're gonna do the
logging again the first is the priority
well one of the priorities that listed
here is the debug priority so it's going
log that so debug then the next thing we
need to do is specify the tag let's just
for the sake of argument be we're gonna
hard-coded here so I can save Lizzie
just for fun and then I can specify the
message so this is that message the
formatted string so I can say fib and
are of percent D right and then I would
say n there's only only one problem here
this percent D in when it comes to
printf essentially assumes that the end
you're feeding into this percent D is an
integer well in our case this is a long
so we would actually have to say an L in
front of it but because we're not 32-bit
platform we need to say well this is not
just a 32-bit long this is actually a
64-bit long so in order to get printer
correct we have to say L LD only then
will it actually print correctly in the
Java world this would not have mattered
we just say percent D for example and it
would that would get the job done so
let's do the same thing over here so
down below I'm gonna go right here
before I actually go and step through
this for loop I'm gonna say fib and I
and pretty much do the same same take
the same approach so I am now done now
the only problem is if I actually went
to my to my Fibonacci native and did NDK
build it would actually not work
it would say well this is an undefined
reference he doesn't know where this is
what this is gonna link against so in
order to help the linker I need to
basically modify my make file slightly
and what I'll do is inside of the make
file I'll add an extra little bit and
that is I'm gonna say local LD lib so
I'm looking at my keyboard and I think
something completely different
loco underscore LD libs equals and now
in fact it was just a plus equals in
case there any other other ones - L log
hit save and so now that I've done that
I can go back over here rerun the NDK
build and now it essentially the linker
knows where it what to look for more and
what my my code is gonna bind against at
runtime and so now if i refresh and
rerun hopefully I'm going to get the
logging working so let's go and run it
go back over here type adb logcat so we
can actually see their logs from our
code and so go back to the emulator put
some number here like I don't know
25 for junior hit enter and we get the
FIB Lib ji 25 that's good we can also do
that the NR uh-huh and so here's a
fiblet dot see that's the tag we used
and it produces these you know just
prints the the correct number so what
this was an example of is essentially us
let's go back over here using one of the
you know this case a simple header files
and then linking is the library provided
that implements the scalar file that
basically Android is guarantees will be
support in the future so part of the NDK
is essentially let's go and take a look
at this over here is not only to give us
you know the basic tool chain but also
to prove
I'd libraries for things like Lipsy Lib
em the Jana Heather's for Jane I itself
the compression library Lib
support for OpenGL one and two support
for Lib J&amp;amp;I graphics support for some
minimal support for C++ this has
actually gotten better or the over the
releases but initially it was really
really minimal support for open SL and
then of course support for building in
native applications in or Android native
API so I should say which are still you
know just a small subset of what the
Java API is support anyway what's
interesting is that Android if you go to
the developer and this or NDK
documentation and you open this up say
in a browser you will see a whole bunch
of obviously different things but one of
the cool things is you'll see this file
called stable API is that HTML this file
basically tells you what are the stay
stable native API is and specifies you
know the the math library C++ library
and so on and so on and then
specifically goes to this and says ok so
if you want to use Lib log you in you
want to be able to link to the two
against this library this is where
you're going to need to add to your to
your code and it tells you which file
you can take a look at to understand
what are the capabilities if you want to
do the container you know Z Lib
compression take a look at this file and
then this way you need to add to your
make file if you don't want to go and
use you know other sorts of like OpenGL
or opensl and so on and so on you're
basically going in looking in this under
the stable API search do not understand
how to you know appropriately include
and link to this code so that's it we
now see that this is you know possible
and quite easy to do so let's take a
look at one more thing and then we'll be
wrapping up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
