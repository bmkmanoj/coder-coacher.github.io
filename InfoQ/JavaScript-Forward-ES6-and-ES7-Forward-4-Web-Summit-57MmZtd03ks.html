and I guess I could say we are live with
JavaScript air so for those of you who
are not familiar in the audience
JavaScript air is a live broadcast
podcast all about JavaScript in the web
platform and we just started in December
so we've got a handful of shows on
JavaScript air comm and this show will
be available hopefully within the next
week when I when I can get the audio off
of it but I just quick shout out to our
sponsors we have egghead io as our
premier sponsor they have bite-sized
videos and they're amazing awesome
front-end masters is also a training
website check them out responsible by
track - yes error tracking they're
fantastic and code Cove is a code
coverage platform that's awesome and
well-loved ejs they do live code
coverage as you're typing your code it
runs your code like it's amazing go
check them out ok so I should probably
go ahead and introduce our panel and I
don't have my regular Google Doc in
front of me so I'm kind of nervous but
luckily I've got this so we've got
Cassandra perch and Tyler McGinnis and
Allan works Brock and behind lens Dorf
and Kyle Simpson and Bryan Kyle and
Tyler our regular panelist on the show
I'm your host Kent C Dodds and Allan and
Cassandra have graciously accepted the
invitation to join our conversation
Cassandra like five minutes ago so thank
you
Thanks so I I think a good kickoff for
our show is actually to get an
introduction to our guests because
they're not on the show every week and
so why don't we get an intro to
yuuka-san or give us like 60 seconds of
who you are what you do sure
so I'm a developer evangelist at off
zero during the day I like to talk about
user in identity management and then
when I'm not doing that I'm building
node BOTS
and supporting the node bots community
and absolutely gushing about everything
I love o nodebots so that's pretty much
what I do awesome and totally loved your
talk this morning anybody watching at
home go watch that talk it was very very
good also you just had a show with
JavaScript jabber about
right I did I did it was really good
cool I was listening to it this morning
so javascript driver is a great podcast
and not our podcast but listen to both
so Alan works Drock could you give us an
intro sure yeah so I guess my main claim
to fame for this room was that I was the
project editor for the development of
the Ekman script 2015 yes six
specification and and I was actually a
project editor for also es5 and he has
5.1 so and what that means in the world
of JavaScript develop standards
development is for es6 is I essentially
wrote most of the standards I I didn't
necessarily make all the decisions of
what needed to be written down that it
was my job to actually figure out most
of the actual specification material my
before that I've done lots of things
over a long career I'm a dynamic
language guy I was really heavily
involved in the early emergence of
object-oriented programming technology
and the small talk programming language
and building high performance virtual
machines and lots of other things and
that's kind of what ultimately led me to
JavaScript cool thank you you have a
very interesting background so before we
get into asking questions that I'll just
give a little bit of the format of this
for about 20 minutes we're going to be
just chatting amongst ourselves probably
generally about es6 c is 2015 and 2016
and then for the last 10 minutes or so
we're going to be taking questions from
the audience and the way that we do this
on the javascript air show is through
Twitter and so at the last little bit
I'll pull out my phone so don't think
I'm being rude and I'll be watching the
jsairquestion hashtag so that's
jsairquestion and so if you have a
question during the show that you'd like
to ask just go ahead and tweet to that
hashtag and all and I'll bring up as
many as we can in the
we have so great I think a good starter
question for our panel is is it is 7:00
or yes 2016 it's he has 20 2016 can you
explain a little bit about the reasoning
behind that sure you know going well so
first of all historically there is
there's been kind of confusion about
these numbers and numbers getting bound
too early to particular things in
particular there was a whole effort to
develop yes for which has been never
happened and we kind of had to skip that
number which was sent shock through the
world of standards people because that's
actually a document revision number yet
there was no revision for and so after
the long long effort to develop what we
all knew as es6
in pc 39 we really wanted to move
towards smaller more incremental
releases on a yearly basis and stuff and
doing that we just first first saw the
that having a string of kind of
meaningless integer numbers you know
once we went through four or five or six
of those was going to be kind of
meaningless and so we just sort of
decided to bite the bullet and say okay
we're going to start identifying the the
standard revisions by the year they were
released in the Linda long run
the feeling is most people don't need to
talk about those numbers right it's it's
just it's really just JavaScript that's
really all you need to say is JavaScript
you know the current JavaScript standard
and I'm so sorry to do really really
quick if you're moving your head and
that's okay to move your head just make
sure you move your mic with use oh sure
nobody hear this right so okay but
that's that's really interesting so I
think this is really big for the
JavaScript community that we're going to
be having your yearly releases can you
talk a little bit about the process for
getting features into javascript yeah
soso tc39 is
Standards Committee that is responsible
for developing JavaScript and it's made
up of members who represent companies
and stuff and it's it's that group of
organizations and the people who
represent them there who actually make
this decision of what is going to go
into revisions of the JavaScript
standard and during the development for
es 2015 es6 that was a pretty ad-hoc
processes people would would write
proposals and over real sort of a long
period of years actually those proposals
would evolve and consensus would be
built and then dozens and dozens of
these went into making the final
standard to have a more incremental
process what we're doing now is we
actually have identified a stage of
developments that go from we number them
stage 0 to stage 4 where stage 0 is what
we call a strawman which is sort of a
wacky idea and it progresses from sort
of wacky idea to yes the committee
thinks there's a problem here that's
worth working on at stage 1 stage 2 is
here's the shape of the solution that we
think we're going to follow the stage 3
is here's actually a specification of
what we think we're going to do and we'd
like people to to try this and browsers
and stuff to stage 4 where yep this is
this is locked down it's complete and
then it's going to be in the next
edition of the standard so how long it
takes a particular feature to go through
that process the depends on the size
what we're talking about if it's a very
small change like the exponentiation
operator it can go through through those
phases of quite quickly over a matter of
months
if it's a large and complex set of
features like async functions it can
take years it's likely to take years but
that's basically the process and then
when the yearly releases come out it's
basically about this time of the year
we look and see well what's at Stage
four those are the things that go into
the the next official version of the
standard which will be released in June
so you've mentioned that stage zero is
kind of the use I think the term wacky
ideas well they may or may not be waxing
but but they're but they're just you
know there's no strawman shape it's
wouldn't it be interesting to do the ex
yeah absolutely
so so with tools like Babel now all of a
sudden those stage 0 ideas are starting
to to get more adoption actual like
production code bases what's your
opinion is that a good thing because you
kind of get a tested before it actually
goes in the spec or is that a bad thing
because all of a sudden we have entire
communities around stage their own
features well it's risky I think as an
app developer you really if you're going
to be using babel in that way and using
experimental features you really need to
be aware of the staging process and
where they are if you really become
dependent upon a stage 0 feature you're
really taking a lot of risk you're
taking a risk but i mean that that may
never go anywhere it may be that defeat
the actual implementation the actual
details of it changes in a way that's
totally incompatible with what you've
done so you have you really have to
weigh the the risks there against the
benefit i mean how badly do you need
that if so when so you talking about
these stages of features and i think one
of the ones most people probably are
kind of anxious about is the async/await
which i think it is current status at
stage 3 is that correct yeah so it
almost made it into what we are going to
know is yes 2016 but it didn't quite
make it so let's just say that it comes
out a week after it makes it to stage 4
a week after you've put the official
stamp on ES 2016 so it will eventually
eleven and a half months later make it
into a spec but how do we talk about
that thing for that potentially eleven
and a half
do we start saying well this is es 2017
because it's already staged for how do
we talk about these features async
functions I mean I mean I mean that
that's the name of the feature if
something is at stage 4 that means on
the the tc39 kippa github site there
will be a complete specification for
that feature and stage 4 means that
specification is essentially frozen it's
not been fully integrated into the you
know the thick document that defines the
entire language but it's it's it the
intent is that it's not going to change
from that stage for a specification also
to be at stage 4 means that it has to
been implemented in browsers I mean
there has to be at least some browsers
out there that's already implemented the
the features so so you know it's there
and I decide to talk about the feature
by whatever the name of the feature is
but to push on that just a little bit
features are never finished right
there's always subject to so a great
example is what we know of its classes
that landed in es2015 es6
there's already several proposals that
look like they're likely to land at some
point in the future that augment that
syntax change some of its semantics
things like that so there does seem to
be a need in the discussion of features
to say well I'm talking about the es6
class versus the es 2018 version of
class and I assume that the same may be
true of other features like async/await
there may be things that land in that
initial spec and things that are at the
same time being worked on for a
potentially later spec
well sure I mean take something that's
even in some ways more pervasive you say
regular expressions there is certainly
room for evolution and regular
expressions and additional features but
most people most of the time they'll
don't need to make that distinction if
you make that distinct if you really
need to make that distinction make it
say you're I'm talking about this
proposed extension the classes are
about the zze extension to regular
expressions or or what have you or put
it another way how do you how do you
address this problem how do you talk
about emerging HTML features right is is
how is is what is unique about this
issue to JavaScript the fact that
basically when html5 came out they said
that's it there's no more after html5 so
it's all html5 even though it came years
after well but it's still continually
evolving maybe CSS is a better example
but makes sense I did have a quick
question if I could interject is that do
you feel like okay with that last answer
I'm just wondering if you have any focus
on a particular paradigm or way of
programming in JavaScript like is there
a like a guiding light for adding
features like I see we added classes but
then I also see a proposal for a flat
map or you know are we looking at
something like Scala in the future so so
JavaScript I guess the way I would
characterize it is a multi paradigm
dynamic programming language dynamically
typed programming language and I think
at least from the perspective of tc39
that's what we intend to maintain it as
and so we we look at all the paradigms
programming paradigms that are in use
and look at how well they're being
served by the language and if there are
deficiencies in the language where some
improvements and improved the an object
based approach we look at augmenting
language there if there are deficiencies
from a functional approach we look at
what those deficiencies are and
and try to fill them but maintaining
this idea that it's a multi-paradigm
language and and one of the
characteristics of a multi-paradigm
language is that features that support
different paradigms still have to fit
together and create a coherent whole a
coherent design so we have to look not
just in terms of a functional style but
we have to look at well how all these
functional feature is fit in when people
are using more object-oriented features
and stuff so so Cassandra I actually had
a question for you
that I'm interested in your perspective
on the progression of the language and
in your talk you talked about a tool
that you use to take a JSON object and
convert it into C code and what was the
name of that again babble bots
double box BOTS like babble bots I
thought when I first saw that I was like
well that's kind of an inconvenient
naming kind of confusing because we have
babble but then even what it actually
does it kind of does something similar
to what what babble does but what what's
your take on the new specification what
does that mean for the node bots
community like do you see in the node
bots community are they using the latest
version of the language with Babel or
anything like that so that's kind of
mning to that
so basically node serial port had some
issues when node moved to four and
adopted a lot of these these new
features so we just now I think in
December got johnny-five
and node serial port working
consistently with node four so we're
starting to see more and more of these
features come into node BOTS and from
from a global perspective what I found
is a lot of the features that are new to
JavaScript make it a little easier to
teach especially for users that are
coming from different languages because
of that multi-paradigm outside of
javascript if you're looking at someone
who's never coded before you can teach
them one way but if you're looking at
someone who's come from a background
where they used to program 15 years ago
but they're just now getting back into
coding you can also kind of leave that
and so because node box has such a core
energy
these new features are really starting
to help us out in creating better
curriculum and teaching people faster
and teaching people code that they can
easily translate from node BOTS into a
career in web development so cool what's
your take on that and being kind of an
energy education in general have you
seen es6 and and the future
specification being easier to teach so
it's tricky because I think it is but
then you have this problem of beginners
get into the field and they go I don't
know if I should learn like es5 or yeah
I've seen that question a lot like the
way I learned yes five or do I learned
es6 and even though I think es6 has done
a great job as far as like making it
easier to come from different
programming languages it's it is tricky
and this is kind of a natural thing that
happens to beginners because now they
have like two choices and obvious
answers like we'll just learn JavaScript
you can start with the S fact it's like
the same thing almost like as you were
mentioning earlier but I think because
we do put such a such a distinct point
between this is es5 and this is the s6
and now this is yes whatever that makes
it a little a little frustrating for
beginners but we can't just kind of stop
the whole progression of the language
for beginners so I think the challenge
is that browsers support different
things and so just today I had somebody
asked me what's the browser support for
array.prototype son because you you
really unless you look into the
documentation you don't know what am i
okay to use what do I need to polyfill
Kyle what do you think about this
subject yeah I I definitely think that
there are lots of differences between
the browsers and rather than being
scared of those differences I think we
should actually embrace that idea I'm
glad that chrome tries out a feature
first and edge is working on a different
feature and Firefox is working on a
different feature I think that that
helps in the way we normalize that of
course is through the use of tools so
some people have have sort of asserted
the idea that translation tools are kind
of like a temporary thing and a stopgap
and eventually go away my perspective
from the outside I'm not on the
committee but my perspective on the
outside JavaScript's gonna keep going
and there's always going to be a gap
between what they just came up with and
what I can use for supporting you know
customers so there's always going to be
a need for that tooling gap now with
respect to teach
I always think we're gonna have to take
a new feature and teach it in the
context of how we did that thing in the
version before and that's how I've
approached with es6 is to say I'm not
just going to teach you destructuring or
I'm not just gonna teach you this
feature of es6 I'm going to show you how
we did that thing before and why this
new declarative approach makes the code
more understandable more readable more
teachable so but at some point we're
going to pretty much do
maybe eye destruction you might not be a
perfect example but destruction will be
just like such a ubiquitous part of the
language that all browsers support it
anything that you're shipping or any
environment you're shipping to will
support this feature so in in that
circumstance you know years down the
road are you do you still plan to teach
in that method or what you just kind of
teach it just like you teach other like
property accessories I think I think
consistent with the way I teach
everything that I teach about JavaScript
I don't just want you to use a feature
as the sugar that's presented and not
understand what it's doing so the
structuring is actually a perfect
example because there is a set of
primitive operations that all of this
syntax sugar maps to and that's not just
an implementation detail that's an
understanding detail it helps me to get
a better mental model of what all of
these new curly braces and different
places that I've never seen before why
are they there why is there an equals
there I need to understand what the
fundamental operation to emulate that
would be and right now that's a bridge
between my current understanding of
JavaScript and the new stuff but five
years from now I still I'm gonna want
you to understand what D structuring is
doing so you know why it's important
that reminds me of Ashley Williams talk
from Jas Cove in May of last year about
the abstractions and the teaching
abstractions he's right like it'll
always be an abstraction no matter how
integral or how day-to-day it is a part
of the language will still have to teach
why that abstraction works and what that
abstraction does because if you present
an abstraction to a student without
explaining it eventually that's going to
go it's going to go down a bad path of
they're either not going to understand
it correctly because they they don't
know how it works or something like that
so yeah I definitely back up Kyle's
point we're gonna have to teach it
like an abstraction because it's still
what it is no matter what yeah oh sorry
I'm just gonna ask if you feel that you
need to know exactly what's happening
under the hood a lot more when you're
working in robotics then so as more
sugar gets presented the further you get
away from like memory management and
things that you kind of want to have
control over is that a thing that's a
great question so to to give some
preface to this I have exactly zero
formal electrical engineering training
I knew 0c until I started doing and like
about a year into node bots when I
started wanting to build things that
required some C so I mean yes and no you
start to learn how the things work as
you as you build up to them but like
it's certainly not a prerequisite for
getting into robotics you don't need to
already know C to get into robotics but
you will pick up some C and some memory
management while you're while you're
doing it but it's not nearly as hard as
people seem to think so that's that's a
good thing to have a layer of competency
understanding wherever you're at under
have some competency understanding of
the stuff in the layer below so that
you're making proper decisions I think
even I'm on a broader term I found that
beginners or when you new to JavaScript
it's really helpful to talk a kind'
about the history of JavaScript and how
we've got it I don't think we do that
nothing teaching because in my
experience is when we talk about like
hey we just had like pure Dom
manipulation and then like mootools came
and jQuery game that's super refreshing
because I'll what what the newcomers
seeing is they're seeing this like how
we've adapted and we've started to fix
these problems rather than just jumping
into like the virtual DOM and they don't
really know how we got there and they
just take that for like Dogma or
doctrine I think I think if you are
starting out or if you're teaching
someone starting out it's it's really
really helpful to kind of just start at
the beginning like 1995 and whether it
takes a while to get to where we are I
think them seeing the history of how we
got here in the problems we solve
getting here is really really helpful so
so I wonder see one perspective I take
on JavaScript is it's yes yet another
programming language and if you're
teaching somebody C or C++ or Python or
whatever I mean would you go through
that same thing would you try to go you
know go back to
the the earth the early stages of those
languages or in particular would you do
that with a beginner or would you should
you spend that time really focusing on
kind of the fundamental concepts and I
mean so so a four year see Esther yeah
that's exactly right I don't see a
source I don't know
but I think there's at least some merit
in that and I don't know I mean the
difference between like JavaScript and
even like see there's a lot more history
with CA I think so it so I think it
works with JavaScript I'm not educated
enough in the other complicating factor
there of course is that JavaScript has
to interact with all these other things
that actually aren't JavaScript like the
DOM and the other web platform features
a lot of people think of that stuff as
JavaScript and don't understand the
history of that stuff so you may not
necessarily need to go back and look at
what es one said about javascript before
we had try-catch for example but
understanding the the context that
javascript is interacted with those
other things i think is useful and maybe
maybe there isn't as much of an analog
in the C world because it seems like you
kind of do most everything all in one
you're maybe not as interacting with a
Dom from your C program like we have to
do in our JavaScript programs plus to go
back to Kyle's point about like having a
basic competency from a career
perspective knowing the history of a
programming language can be very
important to its future for instance
when I was teaching node two years ago I
had to teach the rift between AI ojs and
node.js because we didn't know who was
going to come out on top we didn't know
what set of features was going to take
over so like knowing the history of a
programming language can affect you as a
developer because you don't know you'll
know a little bit more about where that
language is going feature wise
popularity wise you know you can kind of
see what's going on on the horizon and
it can really affect how what you want
to learn and how you want to do things
in that language yeah I mean I totally
agree that knowing that multiple
programming languages knowing the
history of programming languages is
really important probably the most
important thing you can do if you want
to have a long career in in in the
software world is understand many
programming languages and stuff because
over time they're going to change no
matter what it looks like today ten
years twenty years from now it's going
to be different so absolutely
you need to do that but I'm not sure
whether it comes exactly at the beginner
stage or it's more downstream a bit once
you've mastered a programming language
now you need to start looking at other
programming languages and history and
stuff that's right - I think we're
painting with a very broad brush because
for example someone who's like an
entrepreneur doesn't really care that
Brendan Eich made this language right
they just want to build something they
just wanna like make money where someone
who is planning on getting into a career
as a software engineer I think that's
it's more critical to them I think sorry
just to kind of continue on that point
Dave Smith wrote a recent article that
was all about the importance of learning
to learn and I think that's something
that we we kind of overlooked we just
think okay I'm gonna angle err developer
and so I'm just gonna like build angular
for the rest of my life and that like
that is not advisable so learn learn
JavaScript but then don't forget to just
learn to learn and javascript is an
amazing language I love programming in
it but I'm not going to be doing it till
the day I die I'm almost positive of
that
it'll be programming in Haskell soon
that's exactly what I'm planning on
actually javascript is going to kill me
so I actually will be throughout here
kind of my perspective on where Java
Script fits in the world for the long
term and kind of why I decided it was
important to get involved with
JavaScript
I think javascript position in computing
for the next 30 to 40 years is
comparable to the position C had for the
last 30 years it is sort of the
canonical language that defines that is
central to an era of computing and that
there will be variations and dialects as
you can see say well there's C and there
C++ you you say Java is a variant of
that and stuff but at its core if you
thinking about what it took to develop
personal computing technology PC
technology C was the programming
language there was that the foundation
for that and I think the things were
going to be doing for the next
thirty or forty years it's JavaScript is
going to be at the foundation of that
there'll be many other languages
javascript is going to evolve incredibly
that may well be dialects of it and
stuff but you know it really is the
central language going forward here I
can see that in the hardware world more
like basically I haven't seen a hardware
platform come out that that had a ton of
traction that didn't have a seat at the
table for JavaScript developers either
via a dedicated j/s SDK or supporting a
third-party JavaScript SDK or even
making JavaScript one of their core
tenants so it's definitely in the
hardware and IOT space javascript CERN
to see that the table and so I think
that kind of reinforces that cool I'm
afraid I'm gonna have to cut it short
we've got about four minutes or so and
we do have a couple questions on Twitter
this has been actually a really awesome
conversation I wasn't planning on
talking about education so much and I'm
glad that we did because I think that's
really important in our community so
here we have a couple of questions from
crowdsource Labs doesn't it take longer
than a year for browsers to come up to a
new standard how will they ever keep up
well the the releases we're doing are
much much smaller right it it will take
it will take a good browser probably
about two or three weeks to implement
the new features that are there are two
in Ekman 16 exponentiation operator
please do not have these huge baskets of
features that implement yeah and I think
that's a common misconception just
because es6 was so big many people think
that each year it's just gonna be like
this huge evolution of the language
which would be really dangerous for the
language in my opinion and so yeah and
this actually kind of touches on to
Thomas Bernie's question briefly which
is 2016 feature is the most exciting to
each panelist and there there are
literally two features in s 2016 and so
fight me over the exponentiation
operator man I need that I'm all over
I'll actually has a new course on that
don't you coming out yeah no but let's
talk really quickly and and like Thomas
said briefly about each each one of our
favorite es6 or yes next feature I guess
we could say so for me I think probably
my favorite is Man destructuring I love
destructuring I think it's awesome it
makes things really expressive
declarative
so as someone who has to deal with
third-party data on a regular basis
where I just kind of have to move one
property to the other I really love the
arrow syntax I really like classes
that's a joke so this one sound avoid
class we could we could we had to
mention classes once in here right so
this is a really easy one but I don't
know I don't know why I like it so much
but I really love templates drinks
I don't know this because I'm just like
not that smart and just made sense but I
really like this so in the long run I
think the the module design is going to
have the most impact and influence over
anything that's in yes 2015 I like fat
arrows I'm a lambda kind of person so
for current features I would say other
than destructuring I would say
generators because you know from
tomorrow a mathematical term sort of
squaring the circle that's a thing the
thing that generators allow is a
synchronous looking asynchronous
programming and that is something that
we really just didn't have a paradigm
for the the state machine equivalent of
that was just so bad that nobody ever
did it and I think that it's leading the
way and async/await and other patterns
that are coming likely beyond that I
think that was one of the biggest
paradigm shifts that we got was getting
that sort of feature and understanding
how with promises that will change
asynchronous programming cool that's
definitely ones that one thing that I
haven't actually used yet so I need to
get on that that train Kyle said so so
okay so we have two more questions and
one more minute so this is from atomic
girl who I think is in the audience hi
Tom there he is
he says when teaching a beginner es6 do
you think arrow functions glazed over
understanding context how do you handle
that
I think the answer is yes but how do you
handle this
hey I can speak to the size of Kyle and
I so I think I think you shouldn't
mention arrow functions before you teach
context I think that's the answer in 15
seconds I don't teach arrow functions or
just don't don't let's grow I don't
teach arrow functions because I don't
think that they are actually useful for
getting rid of the function keyword the
way most people seem to think there's
one particular use case which is giving
you a lexical environment for the this
keyword or the arguments object I did an
analysis of my own code and that touched
about 2% of the code that I've ever
written so on the whole scope of things
it doesn't seem that compelling to me
but I agree with I agree that you teach
context long before you teach arrow
functions if you teach a beginner arrow
functions at all yeah I feel the same
way I think arrow functions the utility
for arrow functions for me is not the
lexical this which it probably should be
but it's it's more the ability to have
one-liners and I just love that well I
want to jump in there and say from a
function functional perspective you're
striving to write a single expression
without that's going to always return
something and if I use fat arrows I know
I'm doing it correctly if I if I have
the curly braces and have to do return
and all this stuff I guess you know the
functional the word function will make
you have to write return and it gives
you a lot more freedom to not write a
single expression yeah cool so we are
just a second over or two so you can
feel free to leave but I'm gonna ask
this last question so this is Ramona
Venkata who is actually one of my hero
developers in the codemod world but he
says many people seem to be unhappy with
promises swallowing errors is there a
way to make this situation better
they've already made the and by they I
mean the web platforms the browser
platform and the node platform have
already mostly solved this by adding
there was a spec for
unhandled rejection so it's kind of like
the new school way of window dot on
error it's a way to catch something if
you forgot to put
your catch you know method on your
promise chain or something like that I
would say chaining of promises is
absolutely the least important part of
promises so I don't get all that worried
about it because I'm gonna be using like
I said the the the async away to the
generator form the synchronous syntax
with tries and caches so I'm not all
that concerned about it and I think if
you get too obsessed about creating
these long promise chains then you have
to worry a lot more about that problem
where these other patterns kind of solve
that for you
that's a perfect answer enough said so
that's our show I want to give a shout
out to our silver sponsor a lie fluent
conf their exam
