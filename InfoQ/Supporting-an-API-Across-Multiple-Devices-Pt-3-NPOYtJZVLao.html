anyone hi my name is Scott Horza I work
at a company called accelerator I'll
tell you guys about that in a second how
many how many folks out there actually
have an API there that you're looking to
get out on mobile devices just like
quick show of hands so a few how many
are building mobile applications today a
lot more okay so yeah so my my 10 minute
talk is basically about all about
marrying the two of you guys up so
application developers and kpi's in
essence that's what our company does a
lot of other things we'll talk about but
if you think about today is really sort
of this fragmentation of lots of
different devices lots of different
api's the question is how do you
minimize them fragmentation how do you
build an outstanding application
experience that has you know seamless
interaction with the cloud layer and how
do you do that across multiple platforms
and how do you do that quickly and
respond to your customers needs that's
what we do at accelerator so are our
platform is called accelerate titanium
I'm going to get into the API portion
here in a second but here in Mountain
View California arm it's in essence a
platform for developing mobile
applications we you use web development
languages web technologies javascript in
particular our favorite so an open web
technology set to build applications
across multiple platforms and then
connect those into the API 0 choice so
in essence were sort of matchmakers if
you will we have about 30,000 acts built
on our technology today about 30 million
devices we get about 100 per day so
downloaded Wunderlist or get glue or
those of you out there with your iPad's
if you've downloaded the MVC ipad
application the wraps for kellogg's me
bay the only times app so forth those
are all applications built on top of
titanium and they're all built using
languages so pretty cool and then it's
sort of on and I mentioned I asked the
question up front or do we have API
developers we have mobile developers
because we kind of serve both audiences
so today we have about 225,000 mobile
developers and about including an
acquisition we made earlier in the year
about 1.5 million web developers and
that's sort of the demand side of the
equation all those guys out there
building lots of applications and then
similarly we have the supply side which
I'll talk to you about just all the
api's before I get into that you know
from our perspective in when we talk
publicly about sort of mobile
application development like our
objectives like what are we trying to
all do here with mobile there are
basically two questions that we asked
the first is fundamentally how is mobile
adding value to my customer relationship
so what is it about mobile and this is
typically again on the accelerator side
it's you know how did how do you build
that richness in your application then
secondly how do i scale how do I reduce
that fragmentation risk if you will
right how do I you know maintain
nimbleness in my organization this
basically the supply and the demand side
of the equation here and they'll become
more clear here in a second on the first
on how can I add value my customer
relationships we we tend to think about
the world here that we're supplying all
these wonderful api's and all these
services into is basically hitting on
these four goals really in mobile which
is when you think about relationship
that you have with your customers how do
I reach new customers that I drive
deeper engagement how do I keep people
coming back for more drive loyalty and
how do i increase monetization and
that's the experience that we're driving
on the on the SDK side with our with our
software and with with mobile
development in general but then there's
sort of the the problem statement to
that like you know if that's the
experience that I'm trying to drive
what's the problem with them that I'm
trying to solve for in order to achieve
this goal that I think that we can all
agree on that's really around
fragmentation so this idea that you have
multiple clouds AP is this idea that you
have multiple device types you have
multiple platforms and you have multiple
skill sets and that's basically the
reality that we all face when we think
about mobile and so when we think about
tackling this challenge you know then
you know we actually are our solution
actually is is one massive API and and
actually this idea that an API can not
only be a cloud-based API it also be a
client-side API and that when you
actually think of applications today
like the ones that I mentioned at the
beginning of this presentation in
essence they're just a collection of AP
is whether their client site API is
accessing the camera the database or the
UI or their server side cloud AP is and
accessing cool services like those that
have been discussed here and that's
basically what our platform does its
outer titanium integrate integrated
mobile cloud platform for enterprise
mobile and consumer apps basically what
it is cross-platform open and extensible
API and it's fairly massive today we
have about 3600 methods and processes
and they basically cover the gamut of
all those experiences that I just walked
through so for example if you're looking
at user experience or location or
messaging or advertising media camera
your social services Facebook Twitter
right a lot of these are client side
facing api's API calls and we actually
expose through our API all of these
services as as a Java screen 0 a very
thin JavaScript API and then we
basically build in natively the
underlying code within your application
that is accessed by these api's that's
our client side sbk and then then
sitting on top of that is the cloud
connectivity layer and this is where the
API is the cloud API is actually get
really interesting this is where you
actually think about you know how do i
plug in if i'm accessing all I
client-side api's how do i plug in the
cloud type of AP is that's where we
actually have an opportunity for you API
developers I was asking about that
question earlier so one thing we
introduced about a month ago this thing
called the open mobile marketplace what
it does is it basically offers API
developers a place to sell your AP is
and offer your API is as a cloud service
what you can do you can actually wrap
your native objective-c or your
cloud-based API inside of a thin
JavaScript wrapper a module developer
kit and then you can expose that to our
developer base
then you can have your developers
basically plug into said cloud API so
what would be a couple examples of this
well these would be a couple of examples
so so we have paypal for example or
urban airship or twilio or bump you know
we also have we have folks that are just
invent you know just creating modules as
you know sort of they're just coming out
of our ears we have guys from box just
did a module for their API guys from
Dropbox just did a module on we have one
for Salesforce flurry you get the idea
but the idea here is in parts actually
just got added last week but the idea
here is that you know two and a half
years ago we started with you know
building out a developer base so that
you get a lot of you know plug-in points
to tap into and then now having sort of
established sort of a platform for this
they need lots of good toys and things
to play with and so this is sort of the
toy box and instead of just us
developing the toys we thought we would
actually open this up for everyone else
to participate as well that's why we
call it the open mobile marketplace it's
a place where basically if you're an API
developer you can wrap your API drop it
inside the marketplace it's a cloud
service it's fine you can offer it for
free we have a subscription endpoints
that you can pick pardon if you're
selling that as a as a piece of content
we have a revenue share program so
that's you know in essence when you when
you break it down that's sort of the way
we see the opportunity here is
everything's turning into an API look it
on the client side it's one huge API the
cross platform allows you to be really
flexible it's on the cloud side you know
again it's a it's a pretty you know it's
a pretty interesting opportunity to have
for an API developer to you know to
offer your API to lynch of other
developers yes just the the last thing
so I got just two minutes left just sort
of show you one evolution of how one
customer of ours is taken AP eyes and
sort of package them together over a
period of time just to give you an
insight into sort of where our customers
go i'll use NBC as an example it's an
evolution of an api based mobile
strategy so we've been working for with
NBC now for about a year and a half
their NBC com team all the developers
because there
web developers actually start with us
you know saying look I've got a website
now I'm trying to go mobile how do I do
that so here's one on the actually took
them through basically we've got a lot
more apps that we've done with them but
these are three interesting ones started
with jay leno's garage last year just
one API internal API just a video feed
of jail in his garage videos that's all
this app does and if you try it out it's
not that sexy looking but it got them
familiar with what it meant to be a
mobile out of that then they added in
some engagement factors so they started
thinking about things around their photo
feeds their blog feeds or social foods
they started thinking about you know
dart double click Add publishing start
thinking about omniture for analytics
basically cloud services that they could
plug in and so in essence what's
happening here with this customer is
that they're starting to think about
their business in essence as a service
oriented business and whether it's them
providing their own service at to
themselves or assimilating services from
out in the ethisphere from you guys from
API developers that's in essence what
they're what they're building and all
this actually manifested itself actually
in the in the NBC iPad app which last
month hit number one in the app store
and they were able to what's interesting
is once you get into sort of an API
based approach we say what is the
ultimate goal of the api's I would
actually argue that the goal of it is
actually to reduce the fragmentation
level that's inherent in mobile and
reduce the plumbing that is associated
with actually doing all the nasty gnarly
backend stuff so that you can focus on
an outstanding user experience so that
you can focus on that engagement they
talked about at the beginning and once
again if we think about the goals of
mobile it is typically around those four
areas its increasing reach it's driving
deeper engagement getting people coming
back for more that's the loyalty piece
of increasing monetization and the only
way we're ever going to get there is if
we reduce the fragmentation if we turn
everything into an API we create api's
that then allow us to reduce that
plumbing and keep that iterative sort of
innovation spark if you will at the
forefront of our of our minds that's
basically where NBC is now a company
that's made the move from the web to
mobile and it's trying to push the
envelope there and reduce the plumbing
and they're doing it primarily through
ap is so I'll just kind of leave with
that customer happy to answer any other
questions during the Q&amp;amp;A session but my
ten minutes are up in in three seconds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
