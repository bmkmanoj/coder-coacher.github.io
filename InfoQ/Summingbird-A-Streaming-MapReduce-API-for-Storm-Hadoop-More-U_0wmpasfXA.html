uh this is something we've been working
on for a while we we had an internal
piece of crap version of it about a year
ago and I talked to some people at any
scholar last year and specifically uh
Paul I'll butcher his last name so I'm
not going to try it but I should
practice who gave me a cool idea which I
had not thought of and we'll see how it
came into play here but what is
something Barry did say it's a library
to represent streaming mapreduce in a
type-safe way so if you want to compose
together a lot of MapReduce flows and
that's something that I think about a
lot but I don't want to do it and with
some of the poor solutions that we have
now and I want to do it in a way that
will work in many different platforms
that was what we kind of developed it
for this is work with several people
sadly we lost Sam Richie so I is there
in black but uh shoe Singh hall and you
know Connell is now one of the main guys
contributing to this project now it's
all in github we do all the development
on github if you make a bull request we
to do it we deploy that jar internally
so till the open-source thing so what
was the problem we were trying to
address so the the main thing that we
wanted to do is make it easy to express
correct code to deal with billions of
events a day we were really biased
towards like being able to get it
correct and handling a lot of data maybe
we weren't as biased to making it super
easy to deploy because we have a lot of
people to help us do that and that's
like definitely an open area to make it
easier to deploy but we wanted to make
it easy to write the code easy to get it
right next we want to do it in code
common patterns in the types so a lot of
analytics loads work look very similar
to one another if you look at them long
enough it gets pretty boring so a lot of
people if you've heard about Hadoop
you'll see it like all these work count
examples and at first you're like well
that's really stupid why don't they do
something more exciting but if you're
working on these systems at all like
everything is word count it's just like
the words are not like like words and
maybe
editor's aren't like what you're adding
up but it's like almost all word count
so there are a few more patterns than
that but we wanted to take some of those
and encode those into the types and next
we wanted to improve agility of teams
within Twitter and get a lot of
voluntary adoption one thing that maybe
if you're at a smaller company or if
you're an individual and shouldn't Scala
we have a different viewpoint a
different I have a different perspective
is that I met a relatively large company
now and we're using Scala industrially I
mean we're like we're there we're like
they're writing the code and people have
their own opinions about how they want
to coat it so you have people who want
to use like more the scalzi style and
then you have some people who are more
like on the Ruby side like it's like
stat I think of piled Ruby right so you
have that whole gamut of people there
and you really don't generally force
people to use your library if you're a
library designer if you're if you're
working on platforms they have to kind
of choose and if a team thinks your
stuff is crap they're just not going to
use it so I'm using it myself but also
we the team needed to get voluntary
adoption or it's not going to be it's
not the project will continue so these
are the kind of main things that we were
kind of thinking about so why wouldn't
we just use storm I'm not sure how
familiar many of you are with storm
that's a good question why would we sort
so storm if you're familiar with
cascading at all which is a library for
programming Hadoop storm in my view is
basically a real-time version of
cascading it has a model of data where
everything is named but there are no
types so you can name them as like quote
age and like you'll get in any ref but
like that's the extent of it I'm
surprised how often I talk to java
programmers who don't really see
anything exactly wrong with that I'm
like I thought like I thought they were
like against the Ruby guys I'm like you
know how like the way you think about
the Ruby guys well that's what I'm like
just thinking about like what you're
saying but whatever that's just not the
case so um the next thing is this storm
has very few semantics and if you give
someone this kind of just like oh just
write some code they start doing all
kinds of things that are like they're
not very scalable they don't lend
themselves to
easy distributed programming and I think
it's just too much rope to hang yourself
so we really wanted to constrain like as
much as we could like ridiculously so
the semantics that we gave next that the
code is not portable so if you write
storm code you're going to run storm if
tomorrow you decide you wanted to play
some kind of vaca system or you want to
run it on Hadoop or you want to renounce
spark a lot of these semantically can be
made to work the same but if you just go
to storm that's not going to be the case
so what does it code wind up looking
like so I hope you have a feel for the
problem domain somewhat now so this was
uh this was i I don't know why I didn't
occur to us before but we had this
really Jenky way of running on multiple
platforms before i talked to paula d
mentioned this like why don't you take
this idea and then so we wanted to put
them like this so you have a platform a
platform is like you can think of like
acha or or spark or storm in like it's
like it's going to be the value p in
this type constructor and then on each
of these platforms you have a there
several abstract types that represent
the concepts that you're going to have
in these streaming aggregations so the
simplest one to think about the simplest
to maybe would be source and sink a
source is going to be something that's
going to it has one type parameter the
thing that the type that it's going to
admit so it's I'm going to get tweets
out of the fire hose and then a sink is
going to take one type parameter that's
going to like kind of eat those things
like if I right onto a cue that someone
else is going to do something that might
be a sink a store is a it's it's it's
really not the best name because it's
it's not probably what you think but
it's something that can you can merge
values into and we'll see more about
that in a moment and a service is
probably more what you think of as a
story aqui value store it allows you to
look things up by a key so if I give a
user idea and I want to know what their
bio is that's what the service gives me
not each different platform these might
be represented by different types but
conceptually these are the basic things
lastly there's a plan it probably isn't
even really needed but this is what the
work of the platform will do is that I
take a completed tale producer the
output of a total some kind of
aggregation job and I make some platform
specific
plan and then I guess if you that plan
if it's like a big set of acha actors or
if it's a storm topology or whatever you
go on and do your thing you deploy so
that's like kind of the basic thing I'm
going to skip over what buffer is
because you can see what it is but
whatever so once you've got this you can
then write business logic in a way
that's totally divorced from any of the
systems questions so here's well like I
said it's like we're in analytics so
we're just counting words all the time
all day long hope you like words ah so
here we go we have a word count it works
for any platform p we take a source it's
a producer on this platform p and it
produces statuses this actually is
working on the on tweets there's a data
structure here so the status has a text
associated with it and it's some java
library so we've got to put null checks
all over the place apologies so we
filter out all the tweets that don't
have no then we are going to flatten
them down in twos with some tokenized
function this organized function is not
on the page but it's just going to be a
regular expression that splits on white
space because we're not even like
everything's crap and then you map that
on to just the pair the word and account
this is the classic word count example
you must have seen it a hundred times if
you've seen it if you've looked at any
of these analytics platforms and last we
sum those up by key into the store so
that jam is a couple of concepts
together we were summing my key into a
store okay let's take a look at it so
what are these stores so there were two
libraries that I think turned out pretty
well I'm happy with them you may think
they suck probably they came out of
something bird and that were algebra and
storehouse algebra was like a ridiculous
like making fun of ourselves name but
somehow what happened was he kept saying
it it doesn't sound ridiculous anymore
so like if you if you get a chance like
just remind me how ridiculous that name
was but anyways storehouse r is just a
Combinator library for dealing with
stores it came up fairly often that we
wanted to
glue some stores together in some ways
and you can kind of think about what
that means like Matt values right Matt
values on a map as I'm sure you all know
and get burned by on some with some
regularity mapping the value is lazy
better keep that in mind so but
similarly you you would want that
laziness with a store like if I don't
want to map all the tweets to their link
I don't want to really go through and
enumerate all like like in building
tweets and compute their link and link
to materialize them but a store that
gave me a view of that that would be
handy that's a very simple type of
Combinator that we need so there's a
couple of signatures we have when we use
them to look things up that's that
service no shall we talked about you
just need this function from k2 future
option V future option could I like
argue that would be cool it should
probably be its own type or maybe I
should just totally geeked out and we
put the type thats everywhere or
whatever but it Simone that it's got
some like all the nice properties it's
fun merge is another thing that we we
use a lot and we're going to see what
where we use that in a second but it's
it's very commonly you have some key I
don't really care what the value is now
I just want to increment it like how
many times did I say Hadoop in this talk
and like it's like all you have to do is
merge in one more for reasons why which
I can like we talked about probably
later if you're interested what should
the return of merge me I argue strongly
that it should be the value just prior
immediately prior to the merge I have a
couple of reasons for and that's what it
returns but we have this fun stuff we
have this Combinator library it's called
storehouse it's on github and Doug here
like it's like totally jamming on it
like like making it not suck so thanks
Doug so what are the sums well we just
heard all about what the Psalms probably
are about their mana leads actually we
got really distracted everybody's into
the mono it we realized actually we
really probably just care about
semigroups and so one of the best things
that probably not a twitter is allow
people to finally start saying ma nguoi
tinh semigroup like all the time with a
straight face and like here's my like ad
engagement like counter semigroup and
I'm like that is so cool they're talking
about at engagement semi groups and
um anyway so on algebra we've got like a
crap ton of them like it's like the it's
like the hackish industrial version of
spire spires prettier letely we can all
admit that but this is this you go to
the your war with the algebra you've got
you know so so that's what we do but
what are the mono aids that we we use a
lot we use quite a lot of sketching
algorithms and those are probably the
big difference between what we've
focused on in algebra and certainly what
I've seen in scalzi or in spire so it
turns out that a lot of interesting
calculations approximate calculations
are representable as mono aids and this
becomes very useful when you want to
distribute over like huge amounts of
data I've talked about that i'm sticking
hear myself talk about mono it's frankly
but you can look that up it's it's
really interesting it's really uh it's
it's the parallelism that you can get
from the associativity is pretty
powerful and you can also do another
trick with it which i will talk a little
bit more about but if you're trying to
count a lot of things it's one of the
big things that I talk about a lot is
it's really foolish to have like
billions of tweets a day and then like
really obsess about trying to count
every single one so just because you can
build a system with the queue and you're
going to try to do this this is a really
really foolish thing because no system
is perfect you're probably dropping some
percentage of the tweets at ingest
putting them on the queue etc so it's
incredibly foolish in my view to then
like totally geeked out about trying to
keep an integer exactly right for all
these keys that you know the input is
got to be no more than like no more than
a you know it's there's certainly more
than 0.1% error right so why not use an
approximate data structure they can do
it for you with one percent one tenth of
a percent the storage space and that's
what all these things offer you super
fun and even I'm interested in some
problems like this and I think there's a
little bit of a mismatch between people
in the kind of data community and the
sheen learning community that I think
could get
lot of mileage out of a lot of the
algebraic concepts and even the category
theoretic concepts which are a little
bit distinct and what what people who
are really interested in say for
instance if you look at Haskell or scala
z less so I think I think I think Eric's
very interested in actually doing like
arithmetic in math and in things like
what you probably thought of his math is
it as a kid but like there i'm really
interested in this and i would like us
to think about this what happens when
you have these properties that we kind
of like and they're not always true and
that actually seems to come up a lot of
times like if we just heard about mono
aids and we heard like the property they
need to have this associativity so do
semigroups but what if you have an
object that doesn't have that property
exactly it's not exactly associative you
get like if you imagine a set a big set
of items and you can build out a table
you could say associativity put some
constraint on what that table can look
like what if you just go in in a couple
of places and break it like addition
modulo 3 ok and like in a couple of
places you like just change the number
20 ok you're gonna like if you unless
you happen to choose the place where a
zero you're going to break associativity
by doing that but what have you do it in
very very few places and you had an
approximation anyway you might not care
you might be willing to run this kind of
thing not not for addition obviously but
for an algorithm is going to estimate
like the direction of a vector if it's
off by a little bit you probably don't
care and you might leverage some of the
same systems benefits you've got from
the associativity to say I don't care a
better example or doubles and floats
they're not associative is I hope that
everyone knows do too i triple e 754
standard if you take a plus B and then
add see to it will not necessarily and
quite often be different from B plus C
but then a was added to it but it's
probably not meaningfully different to
you because you probably didn't care the
order in which you got these doubles so
that's another example where it's like
strictly speaking doubles are not
associative but it's not meaningfully
different because actually like what I
like average over
the three choose two ways to do that I
don't know so anyways back to like like
software i guess a lot of us are just
interested types and how we like put our
type parameters down so let's talk about
that a little bit in summing bird we
think of everything is a producer this
is like they're very similar models of
writing computation that many people
talked about i guess it's somewhat
similar to all the iterative stuff it's
you can it's a very simple concept but
the idea of a producer is it's something
that's going to come down the pipe and
one thing at a time is going to pop out
of this you're never really going to
have one your hand it's like really
something that like describes a
computation but that's kind of the model
and once you've got this you've got a
bunch of simple operations most of these
are mapping operations that take a
simple thing to take a single thing and
expand them out the other thing that you
can do so is it like this is another
annoying thing like as a community be
cool if we could like vote on what is
the name of the function that is kind of
like buying the monadic bond but isn't
monadic mine that you see popping up
like are all over the collections
library like that would be cool like
what do we just call it like cat map or
something or I don't know maybe we just
call them a monadic behind bind but
anyways this is not a monad it's an
applicative functor for those people who
are like in the house you care about
such things but it doesn't a flat map
method because most people who work with
the with a collections library think
they know what flat mat means it means
take a single thing out put it on to
more things but then flatten it down
okay and I'm not going to be the due to
Twitter's like now seriously man that's
not like flat map I'm not going to ship
it you're good I'm not another guy so
anyway is one of the cool things you can
do is you can look things up and you can
do some joints and we'll see more about
that but suppose you have it and you
have a producer of Long's that represent
a user ID you might want to say how many
tweets did that person make and that's a
lookup function okay other than that
you're doing your thing so all the
reductions so what I talked about we
wanted to constrain the class of
operations that you can do so actually I
all of the reductions you can do are
only semigroups at first we said mono it
turns out the zero is not very useful
you can think about them the zero of the
mono e being useful for stores like I
can have a sparse store where I don't
need to store zeros it's an efficiency
there but from a systems perspective I
don't think mono it is like really a
meaningfully better than a semigroup
when you're building these kinds of
systems um and we do get some
parallelism from using that which I'll
describe in a moment but the only we
have a producer if you have a producer
that is at uppal of k and v then this
can be implicitly converted to a key
producer and that gives us several other
methods so once you have a key down you
can think about things like you can join
as a stream comes through this key and a
value I can go take that key and look up
some value some other you and attach it
this is a we call this the left join
because it's um it's semantically
equivalent to like sequels notion of the
left join you can also join two streams
together by these keys you can probably
imagine how that sort of thing is done
but if I can if I take a this stream
over here as it comes in if I can write
it out to some store that can also act
as a service then I could I mean all you
need the ability to do is to write and
then read from services and those are
again one of our for primitives sinks
the service the stores we had some other
option map we have here a little bit
like this idea of the king cat map that
actually is a very interesting notion
for its closed under composition so that
function of something to an option of
something else is closed you can keep
you know cly's lee combining those and
it stays like that and the nice thing is
it's a contract that I'm going to take
things and emit 0 or 1 item back out
whereas what we tip what we call a flat
map it can go from zero to a huge number
for a systems person this might be
relevant if I'm about to go across the
network I might choose to prefer to push
up option up this notion that may
filters things out
change them and then send fewer things
over and then try to put reductions next
to flat maps which may dramatically
expand the number of items that I'm
working on so that's why we call that
out in this API okay so looking back
you've seen a few of these here we had
the filter we have the flat map we can
add more of these functions is an
interesting kind of API question where
do you put like compositions of these
functions in an API I'd be interested if
someone has some strong feelings about
that too like to tell me about where to
put them one thing is to junk it all up
and like you've got like traversable
once and like okay and now there's
10,000 methods I could have done with
for each and like maybe you just jam it
right there on that trait I don't know
maybe you do an enrichment and you say
like actually I have this class of
things but all and I'm interested in a
different one but we have some than here
they are and here i'm applying a few of
them here so I'm taking a producer of p
and i'm going to wind up producing
another producer at the end of the day
and then i can schedule it so um so
where the wear them on ads here you know
we gotta a we can't just we can't just
stick with mono it's there there there
there too limiting so we have to have
some kind of cred so we playing around
with mono aids mon ads in the in the
planter designs so the planners are
implemented as mon ads over the kind of
inputs that we need on these java based
platforms such as hadoop or storm they
have some mutable data structure
underneath and a common pattern that we
found very nice was the reader so we use
the reader monad to rather than to do
any mutation as we're planning we're
composing this computation so we get the
reader monad up there and then we have
some type that we define this flow
producer it's going to based on this
flow input produce a flow that's tree
fort and then we can go through and in
this planner that renders these graphs
of maps and flat maps that aren't flat
maps in some by keys we're really just
building up this computation that at the
end of the day once we've got the plan
we can apply to like storm
or like some system like Samsa or like
Hadoop to build up the actual
description of the real computation the
planner we actually had a few
implementations we've we've had 14 acha
that we experimented with a little bit
sign in production it's not actually
even a open pour request in the code
base now I'd love it as someone got into
that but we have some others that we've
built for for storm and for some
internal platforms that we've played
around with a little bit and the nice
thing is that we can share the
optimizations on these graphs in one
place so ways of composing these graphs
down in a nice way we can share at this
kind of like planner that brings things
to a certain physical layer and then
only have this last stage of rendering
that physical layer into into a like a
meaningful representation on the
underlying platform so what are we doing
next we're trying to get a lot of shared
lift for optimizing the hell out of
algebra particularly like it's nice to
write these functional codes for
instance we have the very functional
implementation of most of the algorithms
that we that we right let's think for
instance hyper log log but then these
people are deploying like oh this is
awesome mono is great hyper lot of logs
cool let me go count a billion things
per second and then it's like this
blows up immediately so so it turns out
we've got to like like drop some purity
in some places you do some profiling and
look internally in terms of some of the
methods like if we really have to we
might do use of our with the API and
everything else we try to keep clean and
I think that's a really interesting area
how can we optimize a lot of these
sketching algorithms which are really
heavily numerical algorithms but make
them still fit nicely into a way that
you can reason about them in very
functional code the other thing that
we're doing is just a lot of different
store implementations the storehouse
that's suitable for use even without
with an Akha back end or other backends
that we could write we're thinking
perhaps a finagle based back end which
is another kind of platform of Twitter
it also used outside of Twitter but we
have implementations for Redis memcache
my sequel Cassandra
so we've a lot of back in Zira and
that's nice and I would love to see a
backend for acha but the fact that the
matter is it probably won't come from us
just because our hands are full but we
had a sketch one that in one of the main
guys in the team made but I'm sure
someone else could like jam went out
really quickly who is motivated to do so
we're more motivated to build the spark
planner which is something we're gonna
be working on sin and and the finagle
planner so anyway I hope some of you
might be interested in streaming comp
cute and be interested in making this
easier to use some areas that could be
easier to use is the deploy process
twitter is going to be a big company so
someone's going to help you deploy
everything and like I just make this jar
and it just magically runs on billions
of tweets but if you're like dog who I
like as far as I can tell like basically
is like running meetup off his laptop
like it sounds like it's a it's a hard
thing to do so so come help us out with
that there's the github the google group
etc so thank you all
uh so no no no similar story at all and
part of the issues part of the issue is
the following if you have this notion of
this graph that you're going to them
plan in the render in the submit I guess
we could try to abstract over how other
platforms would do that but in storm it
wouldn't even be that well defined
because sort I mean it's really focused
on a stream computation where you define
it once for all time and then you just
shove like data through it forever and I
think you can imagine kind of staging it
up really quickly and maybe something
like a code would be good there
especially with the sampling kind of
picture where maybe you're only sampling
some of the items that come into your
inputs and just kind of see how it works
but we really don't do that much of that
mostly because of our gate is the scale
of our data like that doesn't really
it's not that practical at a different
data scale it might be more practical so
if someone worked on that that would be
awesome underscore eight that's like I
don't know like ask Josh or some type
safe dude about like what's going on
with their like Doc's but uh
so uh really uh so it's so it there's
this service type with a sink it's
really what it is so that plat there's a
platform p and that platform p defines
this notion if we go way back it has
this type buffer which is exactly
service with the sink it probably should
be something that extends the services
saying hey spoiler alert like that's
only been used like once and production
so probably push on that a little bit
we'd realize others like some all kinds
of things wrong with that type but
that's the type that it needs so its
buffer and so for whatever reason the
Scala when we generated the Scala docs
on that it created rather than buffer it
created underscored service with sink
what was that it's not actually well so
there's pee we know if you scroll up
this is on the producer p so i would
guess are the platform p so i guess it
would be p so p hash store would be the
way to refer to that abstract type
normally i guess it should be p hash
buffer but I don't know why doesn't show
up and when we write in the code it is p
hash buffer yes oh it's been really so
that's been that's been cool so the
first thing is what's annoying is people
like oh you're only doing ma noids my
things on a mon wait I'm like how do you
know really you have a proof that that
is not a monolid I don't think you have
a proof it's not a model so I have to go
and like say and even even when I will
admit it's kind of hard I was working
with fabien over there and he's like I
want to do this thing and I like I'm not
sure it tomorrow like oh it's a male
come on so we can sit down with it it's
kind of like that old joke it's like you
have this like it's like is that really
trivial and the professor pisses around
looks at its terrace takes a little bit
and he goes off to his office comes back
and say yes it is actually trigger and
the
so so that happened and then we worked
on it we write some unit tests and like
no actually like this damn thing that I
said was a mono it wasn't a model but
then I went home and I thought about it
again like no it is am on wood and so
there is some amount of that okay that
having been said most people are adding
up numbers or sets or hyper log logs or
countenance sketch it's totally clear
how what those patterns are and I think
about between two thirds and
seventy-five percent of our streaming
jobs now analytics jobs are on something
Berg rather than like pure storm so it's
been very successful in that way people
hate I would love to talk to I'm gonna
run out of time oh I've got a few a
minute one thing that I really so I got
really into like let's make it as
correct as possible the first time
around but it turns out like people
don't like I mean I don't know I got it
this morning got on the jet on the
treadmill at the gym I don't know how
many of you did but it's like people
don't like them taking their medicine
and so I get the first like thing you
got to do is like right down all these
types they don't like it now they
certainly don't like it when they deploy
their job and it fails and then like
haha should put some types like they
don't like that either but it's kind of
like you know I didn't really want heart
disease so should have gotten on the
treadmill you know but nobody really
thinks that way and it's like some kind
of medicine that they don't want to take
so we're trying to find this balance
like we could have geeked out about
serialization I had some tweets with
with with Heather about like pickling
versus like like the jank fest that we
have but the thing about our jank fest
is its hire Jake no um is that uh that's
probably true but the thing about that
is is it people really don't want to
specify serializers for every stage of
that operation and most of the times
they won't be needed because the
compiler is going to crush these things
down and most of like very few of the
types will cross between mapper and
reducer it's not needed so that's an
example of a case where we relax some
type safety we don't like there's not a
type-safe proof that you have
serialization and most people seem to
like that until their stuff doesn't work
so I don't know it's like it's something
I really like to have a like a
roundtable on anyways I'm out of time
thanks a lot
