know about lambda with all the
excitement about lambdas coming in Java
8 the usage of lambda is going to become
more widespread and as a result what I'd
like to talk to you about today is my
own personal experiences in using
lambdas for several years and things
that can trip you up about them they are
not a free lunch so first of all my name
is Jamie Allen I'm the director of
consulting for type-safe where the
company that makes Scala the language we
also make the akka concurrency toolkit
as well as the play web framework and so
we've been using lambdas on the JVM for
quite a few years now and as a person
who works with clients you know it's
very frequent that I see people using
lambdas especially for the first time
getting their feet wet with it and it's
you know it could be a little tricky if
you don't understand the dynamics of
lambdas so I'm here to explain that
first of all I want to be perfectly
clear about this I love functional
programming I don't want anybody to
think that I don't love functional
programming with what I'm going to tell
you today to me functional programming
is three things it's immutable state not
having mutable state in play inside of
your application as much as possible it
is also referential transparency and by
referential transparency I mean the idea
that you performing an operation on some
state that results in a new operation
our new new value doesn't change the
original value is anybody here ever used
java's stringbuilder anybody ever shoot
their foot off using java's
stringbuilder by doing something like
reversing the string what does it do it
reverses not only the value you get back
but also the original string builder
string so that's not referential
transparency that's referential
opacity we want to avoid that sort of
situation this is one of the reasons I'm
not a huge fan of javascript javascript
doesn't do this well and finally
functions as first-class citizens
functions can be passed around they are
objects they are types they are their
values themselves their first-class
citizens that represents functional
programming to me anytime you hear
people talking about these fancy words
like endo functors or ma nodes or
anything like that that isn't
necessarily functional programming it's
a way of functional programming its
category theory so you know that is not
the key concepts of functional
programming this is what I love and this
is what I want to use in my programming
now lambdas are merely an implementation
detail of functional programming they're
one of the ways that you can write
functional programming style code a
lambda is a function literal a literal
is just like a string whenever you have
open quote you know foo or hello world
end quote that's a literal right in the
string a function that is a lambda is a
literal it is just defined for where it
is being used at that particular call
site it's not bound to any name it
cannot be referenced it cannot be used
in any way aside from where it is
defined so implementation detail of
functional programming and I'm going to
step out a little bit on a limb here and
I'm going to say not that lambdas are
evil but they can get you into trouble
first of all let's look at what lambdas
are on a couple of different languages
here's Java 8 anybody here play around I
think George just asked us anybody here
playing with Java 8 right now it's nice
you can download it running on your
computer things work pretty well it's
pretty close to being ready and the
lambda here is merely me saying that I
want to take a number under a collection
of numbers and add one to every single
value it's silly it's pedantic but this
is a lambda you
see it here in orange so the first thing
I do is inside my public static void
main is i define a list of integers you
know arrays.aslist one two three and
then I have the values that represent
the changed values after adding one to
each one of them by saying numbers I
have to stream fi it I then map over
this collection mapping is a way of
saying for every item in do this so for
each number add one to it and return
that I then collect that and put that
back into a list in Scala we have a
slightly different syntax we can create
an application without having to say
main merely by extending something we
call the app trait and I could define my
numbers is a list of one to three and
then I can map over them and again the
lambda looks virtually identical to what
we saw here in Java the other this
pointer thingy here this arrow this
rocket some people call it is slightly
different but generally speaking this is
very similar syntax right closure
anybody here have a program in closure
all right there's one let's first think
that this syntax is beautiful just want
to point that out closure is a lisp on
the JVM and whenever you run a lambda on
closure first of all you have to
understand with closure it's a lazily
evaluated language so if you're
wondering why I'm doing this print line
here that's because if I don't do it it
won't actually execute the code you can
do a print line before and after and you
will not see any result from this lambda
being applied so this is how I'm forcing
evaluation and I'm mapping over every
element and adding one to it it's a
little different but you know let's
first love this so and finally JRuby
very simple syntax here you take your
array
have one two three you do a collect
operation to it and apply this do to do
for every end add one to it these are
very very basic very simple lambdas but
in each language you can see how there's
a similarity to them so what is the
problem first of all this code is not
reusable there's no way for you to say
with your lambda that I want to take
that code and use it somewhere else
either you have to pull that out into
some sort of external function or method
or you're going to end up being not dry
you're going to start writing code that
it's going to be in the same place in
multiple places are the same code in
multiple places and that's one of the
worst things we can do as programmers
because if it turns out there's a bug
inside that code we have to change it
everywhere that we put it it's bad we
want to avoid that they are not testable
in isolation anybody here and adherent
of test-driven development me I'm not so
much a TDD person I am a person who
believes in testing I don't care if you
write tests at the beginning or at the
end or whenever but if I write them and
I prove that my code works and I have
that ability to tell that whenever I
change something that I've got you know
regression analysis I know that I
haven't broken anything I'm still
meeting my functional spec that's
important to me lambdas don't let you do
that if you have lambdas this code only
exists where you're using it you can't
reference it you can't test it by itself
now when you're doing something as
simple as adding one to every integer
inside of your you know collection
that's probably not that big of a deal
to you but believe me once people start
using lambdas they get kind of crazy
with them it's very easy to start
writing multi-line lam does it do all
kinds of funny stuff and when you do
that and you can't test that nice
elation you can only test that by
calling some method in which it lives
you suddenly have a lot more test cases
you have to write or worse yet they get
ignored you're not covering all the edge
cases of just that lambda
maintainability one thing you may have
noticed about the lambdas I showed you
earlier is that you had to look at the
code to figure out what it was doing who
wants to do that not me I want to be
able to just look at a method call or
something that explains to me what the
code is going to be and if I need to I
can then go look at the method and that
will tell me you know what's going on I
don't have to you know parse through
this mentally so with lambdas you can't
do that you have to look through all the
code and the more complex they get the
more time you're going to be doing this
and if it was somebody else's code new
are stuck maintaining it you know good
luck lousy stack traces so lamb does
especially you know whenever you're
talking about languages that are not
java right we've had to sort of finagle
our way through you know making our our
languages run on the JVM we wanted to
add language features like lambdas but
in order to do so we have to meet the
contract of what bytecode looks like on
the JVM and in order to do that
sometimes things look a little hairy
I'll be the first to admit this Scala
stack traces especially involving things
like lambdas can be difficult to read
and that's the same with closure it's
the same with JRuby do a degree Jay
Ruby's pretty good about this actually
so what they do is when you create these
lambdas they do something called name
mangling these compiler developers have
to figure out a way to just call it
create something referenceable inside of
at the bytecode and so they named mangle
something to get a something to to call
and the stack trace is that you see
represent that name mangled stuff very
difficult to read we'll get a look at it
later actually we'll look at it now so
here is this is job aid and with Java 8
wanted to neat things about you know
Java bringing this to their own platform
is that
they control the platform and they can
make their lambdas look pretty darn nice
however that stack traces that is
however note a couple of things here in
the lambda that I'm running I'm just
dividing by 0 it's just a stupid way of
making an exception happen that's you
know inside of this lambda and I say you
know inside the stack trace we see that
my lambda demo class is referencing
something called lambda dollar sign zero
and then you look at the source line and
it says one what one that's not on
source line one it's going to be
difficult to figure out you know as you
deal with more complex types of
exceptions and you have to look at much
larger lambdas that can be multi-line
it's been very difficult to figure out
what it's talking about because it
doesn't map directly back to your source
ah but this isn't just Java here's Scala
remember I said about how this stack
traces can be a little difficult when
you're dealing with lambdas yeah here
you see a case where I've got some
lambda tests and a non fun is the actual
class that was generated by the compiler
in support of this lambda now you do
find out the exact line number of the
source code where the lambda was you
know referenced that is correct that
line number 23 that will help you a
tremendous amount because at least you
know where it was however as developers
it's very easy to fall into the trap
that hey you know i can write code in
such a concise style if I just you know
put a whole bunch of things in one line
anybody ever see pearl in language pearl
and the things people can do with pearl
sometimes you can do that with Scala you
can do that with other languages as well
you know because you don't we do want to
write something it's so beautiful
concise and pretty and
not maintainable or give you good stack
traces you know to get good stack traces
you have to write your land does a
certain way every single line of code
must be distinct so that you get that
line number that is useful if you write
stuff and you just start stringing it
all the way out someone source line
you're not going to have that because
the JVM does not support anything other
than you know line number fidelity for
where your error occurred it's not going
to tell you the column number now that
we can do about that closure you have to
dig through here to find where your
lambda was because it's not necessary is
going to occur you need to find out what
you wrote that caused the problem you've
got to look through here and find you
know the exact point in this case my
lambda is called FN underscore
underscore 10 but the source line number
is correct and that's a good thing and
this goes on and on by the way the stack
trace out of this is just you know
really really really deep but you know
yeah at least you have the source line
number very useful to have jruby they
didn't do have bad with us actually and
maybe it's a function of me just doing
something silly that they can say well
that's an arithmetic exception you know
we know how to deal with that maybe if I
did something there was a lot less
pedantic it would have been you know
much more verbose stack trace but you
know the line numbers correct that's
great we want that so another part of
this that you know is sort of related to
our problems with stack traces is that
this is also difficult to debug the
tooling for how you use a debugger with
lambdas can be dodgy depends on what
you're doing people who use closure they
typically aren't ide kind of people
they'll typically write in Emacs and you
know more power to them but if you're a
Java developer in Scala developers what
we
typesafe you've really had to work to do
is make sure this are you know Scala IDE
support for how you use lambdas you know
is good because it used to be that you
would put a break point on the line of
code that was going to map over your
collection and then if you stepped over
you just went to the next line of code
which could be something you know
totally unrelated to lambda if you want
to step into you couldn't you couldn't
see the iteration now the Scala IDE does
do that it will show you the iteration
how many people here program and Scala
or have programmed in Scala few one
thing I didn't show you with our lambdas
is that you can define a placeholder
instead of saying numbers arrow numbers
plus one you can just say underscore
plus one if you do underscore plus one
you can't debug that you can't watch
underscore there's nothing for the
debugger to say you know well yeah it
might be able to come up with a name for
it maybe but then do you know that that
is the name that it assigned from the
compiler or from you know the the
debugger it did that didn't tell you so
you know when you use these wild card
type you know placeholders you lose the
ability to debug and the inner ability
through the collection can be tough
depending on the IDE so a quick
digression how many people know the
difference between a lambda and a
closure this is one of those topics that
you know you hear people talk about
closures if they're in the groovy world
it's sort of the general term for
lambdas anyway but there is a
distinction in programming language
theory lamb does function literal
closures mean that you're closing over
external state I am doing something
where I'm referencing a value from
outside the context of the lambda I'm
closing over hence the name closures
easy to confuse with the language
closure I'm no idea why rich went with
that name but makes for interesting
discussions so closing over state is one
of the big
problems you can encounter with lamb
does it is very easy to find yourself in
trouble when you close / external state
why on the Java platform in order to do
so you have to have a final value right
you have to just like we had with
anonymous you know implementations of
interfaces if you want to reference
something from outside of it it has to
be final great that's awesome except
what if it was a collection you can
still change what's inside that
collection right that's not that's not
immutable that's not protecting you from
shooting yourself in the foot if you're
referencing something from outside the
context of your lambda in a closure here
you can very easily get yourself into
trouble imagine if it's code that has to
be thread-safe say it's mutable state
that you're referencing somehow like
that collection inside of your lambda
now you've got to worry about thread
safety semantics inside of your lambda
can't synchronize it get a lock no it's
not good and even better anybody here
ever work with futures and asynchronous
programming yeah I love them they're
awesome and in Scala we use lambdas to
apply the behavior that's going to be
executed you know off thread great stuff
except race conditions can happen all
over the place if you don't know what
you're doing you're closing over
something from outside the context of
the future you have an expectation of
what that value will be at the time you
wrote the code but the time when it's
executed is not known to you you don't
know when that thread will be scheduled
for execution on the box on which it's
going to run and as a result race
condition very easy for the closed over
value to be different than what you
expect at the time the code runs so be
very careful when you're using a few
cheers and lamb does so what is the
solution to all this what are we going
to do about it we want to write code
that is maintainable we want it to be
written in a functional style I am going
pretty fast actually we want to write
code that's maintainable and in a
functional style but we also want to
have something that's gonna be usable in
production when things go wrong we can
figure out what the problem was so how
do we do that from this point forward
I'm actually going to be showing Scala
because I didn't have time to do this
for java and the other languages but it
will be very simple stuff one option we
have is named functions we can say that
we want to bind our what was a lambda to
a name and now it's not a lambda it is a
function a function taking arguments and
resulting in some other value that can
be a good thing to do it depends on the
language actually and the way the
compiler scopes the result the the
implementation of the function in byte
code will affect how this results in
stack traces and stuff like that right
so if we use a named function and here's
an example in Scala you'll note that the
first thing i do is i have this value
add one to value that is actually a
value it's a function value and i say
that takes some integer i'm going to
call it X and I'm going to add one to
whatever was passed in and now whenever
I say that I want to map over my numbers
1 to 20 I'm going to apply this function
to it you know for every value call add
1 to value and this will work yeah one
thing about it though the stack trace
still sucks this is on us at types safe
and our compiler writers we have to do
this better but as of now if you look at
the stack trace you'll see that we still
have our non fun why we named the
function it should be
me the add one to number right yeah no
not in this case so given that what do
we do anybody ever heard the term ADA
expansion ADA expansion is the idea that
you can take a lambda and not a lambda
function I'm sorry you could take a
method and lift it to a function right
you can take any old method that meets
the contract of how a function would be
used any method and lift it to being a
function now depending on the language
this is either done at runtime or
compile time mostly compile time on the
JVM right it's got to know that this is
going to be something that can execute
appropriately on the JVM but ADA
expansion can be really useful for this
case we want to use methods as functions
in skala if we use a method it can be
lifted just like I was saying but what
syntax do we use in order to make this
work here I have taken my previous
function this bad function which is
going to do the you know for every value
divided by 0 and obviously it's going to
blow up all I've done is change what was
a vow to a deaf and then Scala that
means is now a method as opposed to
being a stable immutable value now if I
look at my stack trace I do see bad
function this is good now I have
something that tells me where the error
occurred not just with the source line
number but also with the name of where
the code is that caused the problem
that's fantastic except there's
something about this code that's not
really good my bad function that define
because it's a method it's going to be
evaluated every time it's called and I'm
saying on the right hand side of my
equals here that I have some function
right it is going to generate a new
function every time
I try to use this uh this code we don't
want to do that that's not that's not a
good use of resources on the JVM yeah
they're short-lived objects and
allocations are cheap and all that but
you know why why do I do that so we do
want to stick with deaf but instead we
just want to use regular method syntax
not function syntax and let the ADA
expansion magic work for us when we use
this bottom example here where we just
pass in some int is an argument to a
method and then we perform the behavior
inside of our method we get stack traces
that are much more usable you have to
write code like this if you're going to
deploy in production I'm telling you
this now no no the dynamics of the
language that you're working with so you
understand when things go wrong how to
understand and you know deconstruct the
problem through your stack traces so
what are the benefits here the benefits
are we can't close over variables when
we use a method candling we can if we
can call or use something that's you
know defined at the class level don't
you know if you can avoid that sort of
thing in general that's probably a good
thing that's where you tend to run into
thread safety issues right whenever you
define things at the top of a class if
you can keep them local to a method
you're going to be in much better shape
internal variables are operands you know
pass in as opposed the things that
you're just referencing from somewhere
else hopefully you get better stack
traces it's much more debuggable you can
put a breakpoint on the method it
doesn't matter that got lifted in as a
function it's still going to break on
that method that's good and it's more
testable because you can just write unit
tests against that method and make sure
that the the basic behavior that you
were trying to put into a lambda
in isolation works as expected you have
easier maintenance you now can look at
the code and see that you know I'm
calling this bad function as opposed to
mentally parsing what we're supposed to
be happening there and you ever
usability so rule thumb keep your lambda
usage to the smallest possible use cases
the smallest expressions you can think
of yes you can use lambdas if you want
to just do you know add one to every
value anybody can figure that out and
generally speaking you were probably not
going to have a bug there right unless
you have to worry about things like
thread safety and yeah but for the
smallest examples yes go ahead and use a
lambda you're not going to want to go
through this process of you know using a
method or something like that in every
case but no the threshold have an idea
internally of what the threshold is
where you want to say all right this
lambda is starting to get complex I want
to pull this out I want to test it by
itself I want to have stack traces that
are usable and be able to debug all this
right no that threshold for me if it's
more than one line it gets pulled out as
language creators this is on us this
excitement about lambdas can't be
allowed to just Wayne this excitement
about functional programming it's a
really big deal and we have to provide
you with the tooling and the resources
that you're going to need so that you
can take advantage of this in production
not feel like a man why did I go and use
lambdas you know why did I go with you
know a language it's supporting this
stuff that I keep hurting myself with a
type-safe we're very focused on what we
call the developer experience anybody
who's gone to our website recently we
have a new tool called the activator it
used to be that if you wanted to start
using Scala you had to download all
these individual tools or maybe use app
yet whatever it wasn't the greatest
developer experience and we know that we
hired somebody named James war
who came into our company and
immediately identified this as one of
our biggest problems an activator solves
this now we're focused on being able to
get you up and running building an
application in either play framework or
akka there's all kinds of templates that
we're building for this you know as
easily as possible the developer
experience for what happens after you
write the code we all have to do a
better job of the language creators be
involved in your community whether it's
with the Java JCP process the jsr s
whether it's in the Scala mailing lists
they close your mailing lists the JRuby
Charles Nutter is extremely accessible
very very great guy so be involved with
these communities help them make you
better with your lambdas thank you I was
actually a pretty short talk anybody
have any questions okay personally the
question is can I talk about the ID
experience across the three major ones
just as NetBeans IntelliJ eclipse I
can't particularly from Java because i
personally use sublime text I don't know
if anybody's ever heard of sublime text
it's a really awesome editor I'm a huge
fan and in my experience with Java 8 is
fairly limited so i wrote my java 8
inside sublime and i didn't use the
debugger that's inside of NetBeans or
eclipse or intelligent now for scala i
can tell you that the debugger support
in Scala IDE and which is a club space
and IntelliJ are both very very good if
you set breakpoints you can step through
your lambda but again it's how you write
your lambda and what's inside of it you
know if you've got multiple things on a
single source line what you can do
stepping is going to keep showing you
the same source line for all the
operations that resulted in that single
line of code right the byte code is
different but the source line wasn't
this is actually something to think
about anytime you're doing something
that is meta programming or dsls
embedded dsls
if you're going to write something where
the compiler is going to take liberties
with your code to result in byte code
that could be completely different from
the source they can be very difficult to
debug because you've got the source
you've got one line you're sitting there
and saying step over step over and it's
just staying there on that one line as
it goes through all the byte codes it's
got to you know deal with for that
single you know operation you were doing
they got blown up into a bunch of bytes
byte codes so keep that in mind the
question was how our methods exposes
functions in the Java context how does a
de expansion happen i'm really excited i
got to meet Brian gets this morning it's
a personal hero of mine I'm a big fan of
you know JC IP Java concurrency and
practice the book he wrote back in two
thousand six and I asked him this
question I asked him you know how is ADA
expansion going to be supported and he
said yes so this is a good thing you're
going to be able to use methods and they
will be lifted as functions in Java the
implementation details of method handles
and Sam's in the particular case of
lambdas alex is back there I could see
him I hope I'm getting this somewhat
right but this isn't something I know
deeply from Java 8 it's using method
handles under the covers to represent
this lambda right and as long as you
have a method that patent that has a
value you know let's say one parameter
it can be lifted I don't know how a
method that has multiple arguments can
be used for a lambda upper lifting in
Java he I think that he said you could
have multiple multiple arguments in a
method that's going to be lifted and
alex is nodding so that's right I don't
know how the values are passed as
operands when only the first one
represents the value from the collection
that you're mapping over so alex is
gonna be giving a talk about lambdas i
think tomorrow morning yeah and he'll be
talking a lot about the dynamics of how
they're implemented and stuff like that
so he'll have answers for you about that
when you define it as a function I'm
sorry the question is when you define a
method can other classes and other yeah
can they use it yes as long as the
accessibility is public right if you
limit the accessibility it's just like
any other method right one thing that we
tend to ascribe to in the Scala
community is that we want to write code
that's expression oriented we want to
have elemental atomic pieces of code of
behavior in these small chunks that just
return a value they do one thing in
return a value do one thing return a
value and then build up from these
libraries of expression oriented
functions you know more complex
functionality it's very reusable and
very testable as you add them together
and start building things it does make
your tests a little more complex but
they would be anyway if that was just
one method doing all those things right
so but having those in little itty-bitty
pieces you know makes a big difference I
would assume it's the same way for Java
maybe a little more verbose but you know
you still don't want to have big long
complex methods right you want to have
small ones I will the question was i
mentioned that i'm not a huge fan of
javascript and I mentioned they had some
issues with the way it does functional
programming so could i elaborate on that
and I'd rather not I will say this
referential transparency as i described
javascript you have no guarantees of
that it will be interesting actually in
when we talk about nuts orn I've been
saying it wrong all this time I have to
make sure I say it correctly it's good
to know that you know where that word
came from it's going to be interesting
to me to see how the dynamics of
JavaScript are maintained on the JVM you
know is this is this lack of referential
transparency going to be included in the
implementation on the JVM when everybody
knows that it doesn't make any sense the
fact that I'm operating on something
shouldn't change that value if I want to
result in something
new right if I'm doing something
something to get another value should I
change what was there in place I don't
want to I never want to do that Ricky
the Creator closure has this really
great way of talking about value versus
identity right value is the point in
your heap where the value exists if you
have a five and number five that's in
your heap as an int or an integer I'm
sorry that is the value right you never
want that to change the identity what is
the name of that five whether you call
it foo whether you call my int whatever
you can totally change that to point to
other places but you never want to
change that five because what if
somebody else is relying on that five
beings that exact memory space that's
how you get yourself into concurrency
issues right so value versus identity
javascript is terrible about this okay
well thank you very much
