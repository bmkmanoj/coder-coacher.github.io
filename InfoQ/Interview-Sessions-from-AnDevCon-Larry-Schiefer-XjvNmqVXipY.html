in the grand foyer of the grand hyatt
regency here in San Francisco I'm with
Larry Siefert Larry you're an instructor
with us here at new circle you're also i
believe the CTO of high cues yes that
was a little bit about yourself and what
you're passionate about sure so as you
mentioned I'm the CTO for hike use we do
software development throughout the
entire stack so we work from bootloader
all the way up through end applications
on embedded systems desktop systems but
most notably mobile and with a big focus
on Android in addition to that I also
author different kinds of training
online training and as you mentioned I
do teach for new circle and periodically
do in-person training excellent so let's
get right into the technical meet up our
beat here so tell me a little bit about
the world of security so you do embedded
you do security and I think you've
mentioned you're working as well with
Android studios let's start out with
security sure so what you take right now
in the state of security in android you
know it's really interesting I think
there's a lot of things good going on
within the platform that are making
aspects about the platform very secure
underneath the hood I think end users
are still left vulnerable and that's the
biggest complaint we're seeing in
Android the way the permission system is
set up it's very confusing most users
don't understand it and right now it's
an all-or-nothing thing and we don't
really know where that's going to go if
that's going to change at all but I
definitely see that as one of the
weakest points in the system so if I'm
an end-user right now and I'm trying to
be a security conscious end-user what
are my options I mean like I want to
install facebook but I've got you know
facebook says it wants access to my
contact list is there any protection I
have unfortunately right now there's
really not so the biggest protection you
have is using the google play store as
opposed to a third-party marketplace
some kind of alternative marketplace or
sideloading apps so one of the biggest
threats that we have out there is
tricks people do to get the end user to
turn on side loading which would then
allow an app to be installed outside of
the marketplace or outside of the Play
Store and that can leave you susceptible
to all kinds of problems you know people
can steal your contact information your
private details you know they can start
sending premium SMS messages without
your knowledge so all those kinds of
things can happen very easily if you're
not careful about where you're getting
your applications from fair enough and
what are some of the innovations then
that are kind of happening that you see
coming up in the future that might
really help change the landscape um
right now it's unclear right so we don't
know exactly what Google is working on
behind the scenes you know there's
always the rumor mill and what's going
on and you can find certain hidden api's
down within the AOSP framework that
could selectively you know turn off a
permission but I think that's a really
hard problem to solve with the way that
Android applications are constructed and
the way the security model is created
you basically state I'm going to use
this feature in this permission and you
code for that because it's a one-time
thing it's an all or nothing at install
time and so if we start turning those
things off selectively as a user what is
that going to do to the end application
it's going to throw security exceptions
internally and the way the development
paradigm is or the programming paradigm
you ask for the permission you code for
the feature you're not necessarily
expecting to receive that security
exception and so if that were to change
behind the scenes and enable that kind
of feature without some other kind of
provision put in place within the
framework to handle that you're going to
end up with all kinds of apps already in
the marketplace which are going to fail
unexpectedly which would be really bad
for app authors as well as the
experience for the end user mmm
excellent so for people right now it's a
November 2014 is Android studio ready
for prime time it's an excellent
question i think it is again i've been
using it for a long time we made the
switch over very early within my
development teams i think it's very
stable for most end applications it
still has its occasional glitches
they're still working out
things you know if you're willing to
live life a little on the edge then
moving to you know the canary channel
can also be done it's usually where we
sit and we developed from which works
out okay for us so as long as you're
willing to deal with that but you know
it doesn't have any more issues than
I've ever seem to be clips so fair
enough it's not like eclipse has no
mercy right exactly excellent how do you
like the new build system Gradle based
you know I enjoy Gradle I think it's
it's an interesting way of working with
things the way that it handles
dependencies in the the dsl with the
domain-specific language you know it's a
very interesting way of doing things and
I think it has a lot of power that's
available to it my biggest complaint
like everyone else is the speed it does
slow your build down significantly and I
know that they're working on that so I'm
hoping we'll start to see some leaps and
bounds there certainly before we get to
that official one point Oh Oh excellent
so uh what about testing now the the
state of the art when it comes to
testing and Andrea especially you've
been doing a lot of custom application
development custom roms and it seems
like there's not necessarily one good
way to do testing but you know all of
our viewers are like if I want to get
started testing what where's a good
place to start if I want to just get the
biggest bang for the buck what do you
guys do so normally what we do is we use
the J unit framework and we try to test
our internal components as best we can
particularly the the model for our data
specifically or any kind of core
libraries that we build internally we
will try to unit test them as best we
can we'll also typically run something
like monkey against our applications and
make sure we're dealing with you know
strange inputs or being you know
hammered with lots and lots of input but
unfortunately beyond that it's kind of
tough right the test framework if you're
going to use Robo juice or espresso
something like that they work and
they're a little better at dealing with
the UI automated testing but it still
hasn't met exactly what we're looking
for so we rely on a really good QA staff
they work right alongside our developers
in an agile environment so they're
involved from the very beginning
we don't just develop and then hand off
to QA at the end of a project we keep
them involved throughout the project
development so they're very well aware
of our UX design and the business logic
and what's going on and so they've got a
stake in it throughout the development
process which is pretty key for us in
making sure that we release quality
products o exit now when you mentioned
the J unit are you friendly like just J
unit engaging at testing the business
logic or your furniture really using the
instrumentation and running on the
device where you're actually driving the
UI predominantly it ends up being just
the J unit but we do use some of the
instrumentation we're needed very cool
and what about calabash you guys doing
any kind of like behavior driven testing
or UI automation know at this time we're
not fair enough so Larry you were one of
the few developer or Google developer
experts tell us a little bit about what
it means to be a google developer
android developer expert and what that
program is and how other people might
look at and be interested in that
program sure so the google developer
expert program is something that Google
established a couple of years ago to
basically pull people in who really work
hard with the community to make people
aware of Google technologies and help
promote Google technologies they tend to
be experts in a specific field or
multiple fields of Google technologies
so it covers a wide range of Google
products and I was recently accepted as
an Android gde so what are your
responsibilities and what's the vetting
process like so responsibility wise it's
all about community engagement so it's
it's coming to events like this it's
speaking at events like this possibly
responding to questions on forums
writing technical articles you know
possibly writing a book or training
materials things like that is really
what Google is looking for in their
Google developer experts program on the
given technologies to remind me with
follow-up question was so the follow-up
question was what's the vetting process
if somebody out there says I could do
that okay so spouses the vetting process
for we
a blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so
the vetting process for becoming a
google developer expert is you have to
be recommended for the program either by
a Googler or someone who's an existing
google developer expert at that point
you go through a bit of a process with
Google themselves where you'll be
interviewed by other Google developer
experts as well as people within Google
to make sure that you are of the type of
caliber that they're looking for for
their expert program and that you are
staying engaged in our want to be
engaged with the community to try to
promote those products and coming from
that angle then people are writing
applications for Android now and you've
been seeing lots of code written by
different companies what is the number
one mistake that you see developers and
I neatly making that if you could just
tell the world guys watch out for this
it's going to change your life what
would it be understanding the
fundamentals of the application
environment that you're working in and
the building blocks and components in an
Android application so most developers
especially when they first get started
they don't understand how the components
interact with each other or even what
those building blocks are and what
they're used for and most especially the
threading model and how each of these
components is really running in a single
thread and so it can really trip up a
lot of people and caused a lot of
heartache and do you see anybody
innovating in the world of threading
like to come up with design patterns and
other techniques that are making
coordinating amongst those threads
smoother and easier and helping to
eliminate some of those resource leaks
not so much from the resource leaks
perspective that I've seen however I
have seen some things out of like the RX
Java camp and RX Android the reactive
extensions and some good things coming
out of there I have yet to actually
apply it in one of our projects but
everything I've been reading and
researching on it it really looks like a
lot of promise it eliminates a lot of
the concerns people have with threading
you know using observables
and really handling things in a very
different way and I think it really has
a lot of potential to help new to dal vs
they get familiar with it so watch for
RX job on an android yeah i think so
we're going to watch out for it thank
you very much for joining it all right
really glad you came out thanks for
having to enjoy the conference alright
again appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
