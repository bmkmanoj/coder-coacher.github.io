good afternoon my name is Victor I'm a
software engineering at the New York
Times
laughs collar that's why I'm here today
and I'm first-time presenter in this
event so I'm a little bit nervous right
now especially in this room I took a lot
of exam before the New York Times we
have editors they're distributing the
content to their party like Reuters and
AP as a side business we wanted to keep
it from the domaine CMS that we have so
we make a separate system top black B
oops sorry
okay we have the system called black
where to serve in need so we build it in
order to migrate from Alaska see work
for that is coming from my own school
window application so we decided to move
on to a single page web application one
of the biggest challenge is that we need
to handle a fairly high volume of the
real-time user interaction why people
reading your article may think every
article is written by a single author
but that's not the case actually every
article at least worked by five to ten
editors some of them are responsible
responsible to write paragraphs some to
add notes some to proofread a lot of
things to do writing different version
of the article on a timely basis let's
say breaking news or the Olympic result
so imagine every user added require a
virtual lock of the article resources in
order to not stepping on each other's
toes every save or update need to
broadcast to order user and we're
talking about 300 to 400 article per
days so at the evening time at the peak
hour I'll console you I may not be
taking crazy like the trading system but
I can tell there's decent amount of
update floating around and we decide to
use scholar to be our exciting backend
and we and we choose a playful work in
the occur as ausrotten and the web
suckers as our engine so how do we
actually volition let me bring this up
overview of a system and I can give a
little bit talk before that this is the
current current version that we have in
our production system about the
development staging we have upgraded the
framework accordingly in different part
of system but this is what we have right
now we're happy with that especially
when the merger of the actor in the
future library in Scala that make the
code more consistent
we're still looking forward to upgrade
to the plates upon to so let's start
with a singleton actor here we have a
actor here is the root actor creator
from the actor system sitting there
forever waiting for any message to come
in it served as a gateway slash router
for or any incoming message from the
Raps web sockets so this is the
implementation actually just a singleton
object just a single object returning a
ladies value of the of the actor it is
actually pretty good pattern to follow
when you're actively to talk to you
outside of your active system because
you could centralize all the message
through a single end point so one my
favorite user Yoda lock in the master
knew is saying hey this is the first
subscribe lock into this user account
let's create a child note so boom a
child know a child actor Khalif note is
created as well as the either ad in
numerator we return to pair to the front
end so the connection is done
Yoda is happy using the WebSockets right
now the eighty or eighty implementation
here is a little bit tricky because we
need to route every single message to
the parent of the current note which
happen to
happens to be the master node and the
enumerator is much strict forward just
the decoration so now you're the design
locking again on the other machine or
odd cap I don't know but this time the
master was saying hey we already have a
leaf no for this user account so let's
simply just return to it already and
enumerator to a simple HD connection and
yes the multiple multiple connection
through single account share exactly the
same instance of the iterator and your
numerator and that is the trick how we
have a single update a single message
push could resell at the end of the road
multiple frontline we got the update
simultaneously this is pretty cool and
we have a second user locking that
waiter as you expected the same flow
happen and the question come here when
you don't want to talk to the deaf
waiter saying hey I want to grab the
lock of an article do they talk to each
other directly the answers now in here
and you use another actor called
broadcaster all the broadcast message
should come from the leaf node go to the
master note and the master master knows
you send a specific message containing
the original message as well as the list
of all the alive leaf node to the
broadcaster and the broadcaster we have
some custom logic inside to be oh and
say hey we should leave their editor
relative one of the benefit of system is
that our when the other data is coming
from an SAT controller or from even
outside of the system let's say we have
our own main CMS that is couple years
ago operating Java using active reactive
MQ we can have the same message work for
message flow coming down to the system
it is much easier to debug and maintain
so as I said the master node is sitting
there forever but the leave not actually
have its own life cycle when a user
lockout let's say Daffy waiter in this
case
the masternode we receive the
unsubscribe message and every decide
like hey is this the last connection of
the user account if yes then it will
basically send it was send a poison pill
down to the leaf node and to cue it of
course at the same time it will release
all the resources that has been claimed
by this user account garbage collected
everyone happy so um that's actually
it's a slight issue here is when there
is a only tab and user got refreshed the
application the system will queue the
leaf node and we started right away
creating right away this is a
performance glitch that is collectible
at least none of the user has been
noticed and come thing about this so but
I still see this as a limitation that we
have so far so this is a simple overview
of the system that we have there is a
lot of future work you've done let's say
like introducing layers of supervisor
actors and in relative to you scale up
originally and maybe isolating multiple
failure zone by user properties each
account stuff like that xx traffic
structure we have applied a lot of Desai
pattern or the system that we have some
Uplander some are being like some of the
conclusion of the being done no matter
what they are really helpful and result
did user feedback a really good they're
happy about it we have a really sharp
learning curve during the project play
for what really really allow us you pick
up development really quickly akka we
spend some time to get everyone to
familiar with the concept of the actor
and h synchronizes tomahto but still it
has a really sharp learning curve our
team have two back-end developer one
random person and a technical lead we
spend three months for appearing scripts
building the system from scratch and
have the first first piece of code CD
production and of course that was a
single user pilot at that point but that
was
pretty impressive so after running it
floats me for a couple months already
use a very happy with the new technology
compared to the old school window
application merged with the Microsoft
Word they are now using a black beard to
doing editing and sharing sharing their
work seamlessly with their worker yep
welcome to new technology so we do have
a lot of fun building your system we
experimenting a lot of different
frameworks we fight for methodology and
patterns to do it to have a better
solution and we got stabbed in the face
by the system failure and the
performance issue but there those are
really good scholar experience so what
do we learn from that there's couple
pointer what I would like to share here
first the feeder ABI API in play
framework is one of the most powerful
and yet easily be over overlooked
components as a design applied
discriminability discriminant identity
to all the HTTP requests we took
advantage of this pattern to apply the
authentication and creating a lot of
access lock so this is small piece of
code actually wrapping up all the
requests that we have and trying to do
the authentication one by one on the on
the request base this is pretty nice and
neat next one
when first work on the system I wrote a
couple helper function a private helper
function in the controller and then I
found out hey I can't uni test it
because test package cannot access it
luckily actually Scala allow us to have
a qualifier on the modifier so we can
basic we can actually sing like private
scrap black ass controller saying hey
this guy's is the scoop of this guy
actually is within the package so the
test interrogation now can access the
function directly happy testing and next
okay Jason inception is really cool but
sometimes you may want some some
therefore flexibility should write a
couple couple version of the implicit
right of your zero lives object we zero
lies about object and let's say in
different situation maybe your front end
just asking for for the preview for the
bootstrap you can just show like only
the required or the necessary necessary
field that you want or if you're Sir
Isaac a database object that have a lot
of relational components you can get
everything at once this simple code is
actually defining the wrong right and
trying to pass to the JSON adjacent a
thought hazard in the second list of the
set yeah the second is the second of the
parameter list which is supposed to
getting an implicit function so
all the message actually form a command
system in the actor model to tell each
other of some other actor to do some
sort of work although this website could
allow a duplex connection duplex
communication we basically allow all the
command action from the front line
coming through the restful call rather
than the westphall
restful I mean rather than the WebSocket
message the reason is that it is a
better practice for the MVC model on the
front end and there is also easier to
keep track to validate and to do locking
and tracking on the backend side and
what we need what when they really need
to is you need to apply some you need to
apply the play JSON validation API they
are really neat and we are looking
forward to have the well we're looking
forward to the plate soup on three
generic validation API they are even
better and one of the bonus benefit of
that is we can keep the actor logic as
simple as possible because basically we
T we take all the expensive competition
out of the actor live it to the
controller level this is what we want
alright next when we're using future
within the actor receive function you
have to be very careful threading is
dangerous even in Scala
when dispatching a work to the Future
within the receive function you have to
remember that once the future is
finished when it's done the center the
center reference is no longer there so
the code is is actually really back home
because it will result into that letters
just send it at the sender reference no
longer there if user really need to do
that you can actually capture it in the
local variable so last one
sometimes just dispatch your work to
future rather than setting up a new
active system creating multiple actor
that we actually do the same magic when
using future one thing you have to
remember is well suggestion is that
define your own execution contest aka
the threat poo
we learn it from a really hard way
anyone who is smiling now know what I'm
talking about
there is a blocking call you want a
future in the system almost take down
the anti system that we have in
production one time so ok this is the
end of the presentations we have a lot
of fun during the system that I would
like to share also so please feel free
to lock to visit a block there our block
for the black beer should be posted up
soon very soon next week and you can
also contact me through email so thank
you very much for your time
