hands of those of you who've been in
front end engineering for less than a
year okay how about between one in five
years okay about more than five years
okay and who of you works with rails
okay who of you has worked with ember
Jas okay good let's be dimensioned I'm
Anthony bowl I'm senior web engineer
over a crowd flower we r the leading
micro task crowdsourcing platform if you
know what that is great if you don't
know what that is think Amazon
Mechanical Turk if you don't know what
that is talk to me afterwards I can tell
you them we are we're growing we're
about 47 people we received eight
hundred million judgments from four
million plus contributors around the
world and i'll talk about the growing a
little bit later first things first i'm
going to be speaking with the context of
ember j s100 breed for there's been a
lot of there's been a lot of volatility
there's been a lot of changes been a lot
of growth in the last year and right now
we have very stable library in pre for
as we like to call it I come to you as a
practitioner I'm not a member the core
team I like you use the use a library
use a framework in my job and I just
happen to use ember Jas and I've had the
privilege of using it for about a year
now Sid nicely spelled out at NBC he
alluded to the concept that MVC in the
front end is different than the back end
I just want to emphasize that ember jss
NBC is not to server sighs so if you're
coming from server side if you're coming
from a web application development
perspective
if you've been working a little more on
the back end if you get into ember and
you say hey this should be like what I
know you need to check some of those
assumptions at the door because it is
substantially different we won't talk
about that right now it's a lot of scope
for this slide and at this point of the
presentation but it's good to know and
if you get into amber and your little
confused that's okay if if you remember
nothing else from this evening from my
presentation and anyway at the end of
the day you know all frameworks have
philosophies all have assumptions baked
in all make trade-offs and I believe in
number Jas as the the best framework
that is making the trade-offs so that
you can build well factored applications
ones that are easy to debug ones that
are easy to maintain and ones that are
easy to add features for if you were
developing ambitious web applications I
really think you should give ember.js to
look it's really exciting to be here
with you this evening share my love
forever Jas because I've been preparing
for this presentation for just over 10
years it's a great time to be in the
front end you know I when we talk about
single page applications or excuse me
snappy performant applications Model
View frameworks Model View star
frameworks controller BM what have you
and then f2 we front-end engineering all
of these concepts are mixing together
right and they have been for quite a
while I started off in 2001 using
javascript I was doing some work back in
that day with ie and what I'm what I'm
what I'm hoping to convey is that my
professional growth has kind of
paralleled trends in the industry over
these last ten plus years and so you
know I think about the early years of
doing front-end engineering and I think
about the recent years and I think about
the earlier Xand I'm guilty just like
anybody else of writing a lot of
spaghetti code of abusing global
variables of
oh I don't know you know you had to
think about event setup and teardown if
you if your hand rolling your own
applications now if you're doing a lot
of JavaScript do you still have to do
that i would say you don't need to do
that this day and age because there are
plenty of frameworks to choose from but
you know 2001 and 2006 I was kind of
getting my shops together started using
prototype of script tag list a couple of
JavaScript frameworks came on the scene
at the time they were good for doing
some rudimentary sorts of events set up
some Dom manipulation they're really
good and then I was at Yahoo for three
years of course we dog food a lot of Yui
a great framework you know a lot of
people who uses jQuery yeah yeah Yui a
great framework a lot of a lot of work
has been done by that team making it
into a framework that developers can use
to be productive but this you know this
this transition from early years to
later two years to to recent times helps
us understand where frameworks have come
from and where they're going to you know
a modern JavaScript framework needs to
do data bindings it needs to handle
events it needs to make that easy for
you state management if you're doing a
robust ambitious web application you
have to think about state and it'd be
great if their framework could do that
for you data synchronization you're not
living on an island so you know whatever
you're doing in the front end is going
to have to push stuff to the back end at
some point or probably will and the
other thing is you know a moderate
framework should be testable I'll talk a
little bit more about that later I first
came into using ember Jas early last
year at shop at to me I was in front an
architect for a brand new product that
we had a limited amount of time to get
to market and we took a look at a couple
of different frameworks backbone and
ember amongst them angular unfortunately
was not on my radar at the time I
can't remember why there were a number
of frameworks then there are more now so
you know we were taking a look at that
and decided for amber because out of the
box I could be productive it was a team
of three I was a front end guy and so we
ramped up quickly on that I was that
concurrent very briefly doing support of
typing with mr j s for big data and now
today i'm at crowd flower like i say
with being a senior web engineer i also
contribute documentation to the amber
framework I'm the ember GS generator
maintainer for yeoman if you've used
that product before and just Peter
alluded to I I teach the pro amber Jas
chorus at Marikana it's a two-day course
if you'd like with junior / tonight next
course is coming up in April so we'll
talk briefly I'm here again this is my
completely biased perspective on
comparisons of the frameworks you know
backbone JSI I will I must I must
disclaim that I don't have professional
experience with backbone.js nor with
angularjs but you know I played with
them I evaluated them and it's at a
point in time a backbone really great
for a lot of components very modular you
can string thing two together as you
like building your applications as you
need to and I do appreciate the
flexibility of that you know the big the
big con is you always have to recreate
the wheel essentially I mean every every
new project maybe you know maybe you
need that flexibility because you're
you're varying from project to project
in terms of the scope of the project but
you do have to wind up recreating wheel
and so if if I were to take backbone on
a camping trip I like to do that here in
the Bay Area not take backbone on a
camping trip but like to go camping and
if I were to do it I would have a knife
and a fork and spoon because back one
would give that to me to be able to do
what I needed to do ember on the other
hand has a core team of people who were
our contributors to sprout core jquery
verb and rails so they bring a bunch of
experience to the table in terms of how
you should how you can build web
applications particular for the front
end and so this convention over
configuration is just still a little bit
from the rails community and flows
through into ember Jas I think the
biggest thing is like is like I alluded
to out of the box amber is very powerful
you can do a lot of things with it the
downside to that is a learning curve is
not trivial you can get you can get
functional I can get productive but
expect to spend a little bit time
learning I think it's a Swiss Army knife
like I say it's an all-in-one the
framework itself is very very
comprehensive in terms of what you'd
want to be doing whether you'd want to
be doing data synchronization whether
you want to be doing state management
whether you'd want to be well you're
going to need to think about your event
bindings you need to think about your
Dom manipulation and so amber takes care
of that for you lastly angular HTML had
been designed for apps not pages of
course we think back you know 15 years
ago 15 years plus internet was very pain
centric place now that's not the case
right we're doing rich Internet
applications we're doing single page
applications snappy performant
applications and you know the the big
thing I mean it's got its got a decent
sized community it's got the corporate
back and there's there's a lot to be
said there's passion in the community
but there's a lot to be said for having
the corporate resources to continue that
beak on the verbosity I I like to look
cleanliness of ember Jas in terms of
having the the separation of concerns to
truly have your presentation your
interaction and your markup separated
and spork you know it's a spoon and a
fork can get a lot of things done with
that so enough talking let's see some
code well we're gonna see a little bit
of code
walk you through very trivial example I
want to set your expectations where they
should be this is something that is
going to be very trivial I just want to
get your feet wet with some of the
syntax so we've got a template ember.js
comes with handlebars out of the box you
can use other libraries if you like but
this is a choice that the framework has
made for you so you don't have to think
about it it's is it a treble little
choice I don't know I mean there might
be a reason it might be a business case
for choosing something else but out of
the box it has handlebars the view don't
think of it as the mark-up per se think
of it as an in-memory representation of
the mark up with all the bindings that
go with I'm a controller you know I said
with MVC I think we've had we've got
viewing controller so far all we need is
a model we're going to route a little
bit of syntax might be a little
overwhelming right now that's okay this
is for Steve management and then finally
we've got the concept of an object you
put them all together you have an
application this bare bones and if if
the transition goes well and bring open
yeah all right so uh yeah the total
world there's the application we've got
the initialization essentially the
creation of the application at the
global namespace level we've got the
object that we're creating and we're
binding that to a essentially controller
I don't have any views in there I didn't
instantiate interviews at in creative
you so how does the framework know to
actually put on something that I see in
the browser convention over
configuration it's a naming it's a
naming convention that I'll emphasize a
little bit later because it becomes a
little more important but it's good too
it's good to know that the framework
takes care of a couple of things for you
so much like this is challenging okay so
app dot set
that knee is named SF html5 let's see
Epis er sorry user 17 oh is that excited
anybody did it did me a year ago I
thought that was great it's a little
less exciting now but that you can have
that you can have that sort of
programmatic interface to something in
the DOM and have it automatically update
it's a great thing so I mentioned it was
a little bit trivial it's ok just wanted
to get you kind of in the flow of things
that's all next time I would like to
talk about something that I've whipped
together in the last couple of days
wouldn't it be great if there was this
like online radio streaming service that
you could have I don't know stations
based on your favorite artists and then
you could like listen to the tracks from
those artists what they'd be great if it
were even browser-based sounds great
doesn't it so whipped it together it's
up on github who who can pronounce my
username there we go brilliant so so I
bring you the sauna fekete or is the
project that I've been working out and
before we get into some of the code
there I want to emphasize the naming
naming naming naming is so very
important convention over configuration
we have templates may have used we have
controllers we have routers we have
models and they follow a naming
convention if you miss type stuff
doesn't work and the the error logging
is getting ever better but you need to
be very cognizant as you're getting into
the framework that names have meanings
capitalization has meanings to one thing
yeah it doesn't non this one so let's
get into let's get into it
yeah so okay
okay so um that's a wide screen isn't it
so so I'm from Michigan I've been out of
Michigan for a while and a couple years
ago I found out that there's like a lot
of great music a lot of great
electronica coming out of Chicago in
Detroit so you might recognize carl
craig and stacey pullen called craig
from detroit States bone from Chicago so
as I was putting together this a post
like okay what could I do pull in
something I'd be interested in doing and
that is creating this radio streaming
service like there's nothing out there
like that right so what I'm going to
walk you through is is dubbed I don't
have any back end to this yet I didn't
get that done for tonight but i'll show
you fixtures that is the way that I that
flesh out some of the data that i can
use in the front end in the framework so
i don't necessarily have to have access
to end points that are serving up json
necessarily i can do a lot of
independent development before tricking
out with the actual back end calls what
we'll do is yeah we'll just walk through
it real quick so i think he sounds on oh
yeah it sounds on so let's see so stays
pullin all right oh so we've got we've
got this mocked service of doing a call
back to server having done a search for
Stacey getting a couple of tracks and
then then we'll click on one of them
okay and oh yeah get it to play yay no
so uh so what's going on here there's a
lot of things i'll show you the code in
just a moment this is built with twitter
bootstrap using the fluid layout with
the soundcloud html5 widget and with
Amber Jes another thing we could do is
all right if we've got some sort of
search box and we want to be able to
look for somebody maybe a little more
low
go Justin Martin maybes san
francisco-based oh ok then we get you
know a new track from him after comes
back from the back end and you know same
sort of thing get right into get right
into that track that might be some good
base some good background music but it
gets a little more drum and bass e so
maybe not appropriate for tonight ah
let's take a look at the code really
quickly let's see let's see so let's
take a look let's take a look at the
JavaScript first how big is that that's
fairly big well I'll just I'll walk you
down it very top creation of the
application once again we've got the
setup of our routes we got this concept
of resource and concept of route it
helps for nesting if we switch back real
quickly to my Earl you might be able to
see that we've got this this pound
stations three tracks 30 I'll get back
to that in a moment but all of the state
has managed in the Earl and that's very
key the framework knows when you enter
this route we hit this Earl to set up
the views that are needed in the Dom it
tears them down as well when you exit
that state all done for you by the
framework back to the code really
quickly so so yeah so we've got the
routes that we need to set up a couple
more routes we get to the controller's
before too long we've got we've got some
interaction between the views in the DOM
and the controller you noticed might be
tough to see from here but under the
search controller we've got this we've
got this interaction with this play
where we've got a controller bound to
view essentially the text box was a
search view that's bound to the search
controller
naming very important and so when you
press enter in the text field you've got
this change event provided to you by the
framework and that helps you invoke the
search which would actually proxy to the
station's controller which manages the
stations that we saw a display those
does the round trip comes back it's the
data pops it in in a collection style
and the station's list would update so
let's see what else i mentioned that i
wanted to show okay so models models we
have here i'm not going to get in
tonight as i'm running almost short of
time i'm not going to get into amber
data that is the additional component
that goes with amber jas that allows you
to do the front end back end
synchronization we have the declaration
here as a as essentially a template if
we go further down we can see where I've
stubbed out the data with the fixtures
just so that I can be productive in the
front end without avex actually having
to have the back end end points
available take a look at the mark up
real quick pretty standard header this
is beautiful this is beautiful right
here this is the single page application
this template this handlebar provided to
us essentially sets up the entirety of
the application we have a couple of key
words if you're familiar with rails
partials function a lot like in rails
but this outlet thing what's this how
that thing doing this outlet thing is
where the framework takes what it knows
about the state that you're in based on
the Earl and essentially serializes
everything into that right in
yes or anything let's see so so there's
a couple of other things there's a
couple of other let's see we've got a
couple of other we've got a couple of
other handlebars set up these are
templates that are used in the
application you can see our stations our
stations view this thing is a view this
tracks is a view and this currently
playing track is another view and those
are bound to different controllers by
the same by similar names so what else
let's see that about wraps it up for the
demo I think there's it's like I said
it's under it's on github I don't have
the slides up yet I'll work with SFL
html5 you get those up sometime either
later today or tomorrow morning back to
the prezo keep in mind naming very
important I started talk about testing a
little bit you should do it what do I
have to say about it you know I've got
something I have some experience I would
say if you're looking if you're looking
to see how to do it with amber Jay s
take a look at the actual project they
have a lot of q unit tests so you can go
in you can take a look at that there's a
reg file that invoked phantom jas to
actually run through those it's very
informational i have i've got about four
years of selenium experience and
selenium is great you know it's it's
beefy I was looking at the lebowski gem
if you're in in the Ruby world which
essentially does what I did and to other
jobs by cobbling together the scripts
you need to have to fire up the demon
and have the test run and shut down the
demon cleanly but I love love love
capybara discovered phantom Jess and
poltergeist a couple months ago and just
cannot say enough good things about them
as a headless JavaScript engine to use
for your acceptance testing I don't know
I'm I did say that
like I said amber Jas they do use
phantom Jas in the reg file to actually
kick off the Q unit tests so I would say
go look there because I don't actually
have much experience with that but I'm
going to need a very soon put together a
couple list of resources for you as
mentioned i teach the programmer JS
course in Marikana coming up in april
two days click on the length you go
straight there the peep code screencast
it came out last week also very nice
resource to getting to get up to speed
on the framework the most recent
iteration of the framework and a couple
of other videos Tom Dale Peter wagonette
and you who two cats all from Tilda
they're all core team members of a
member je s but they're all at this
company called Tilda that is doing
consulting for the framework and then a
host of other links that you might find
useful I had one other summary for you I
think amber is great because the
pedigree I think the people bringing the
experience that they do into the
framework to help build robust web
applications as informed by years of
experience the community has seen
tremendous growth in the last year I've
been a part of that a lot of changes in
the API but it's stabilizing now the
stabilization is a big thing in terms of
the documentation in terms of the API
the data synchronization ember data
which i mentioned earlier has come a
long way and the conventions baked into
the framework to help you be productive
with the framework out of the box made
long strides that was a good time to
hook train to the Ember wagon especially
because of jobs this is not exactly
scientific
this was pulled off of indeed com the
watermark doesn't really show up as well
as it could but four hundred percent
growth in the last year and that's kind
of how I got my job so oh speaking of
jobs it's mentioned and with cauliflower
hiring if you like if you work with if
you want to learn more about mas and you
have a rails background so rails real
shop rails 3 that is and as I also
mentioned earlier you know it's a great
time to be in front end development
because because of the frameworks and
because you know Java scripts has really
come into its own in the last few years
it's hot now and that's great to see
because 12 years ago it wasn't really I
mean it was kinda and the first browser
wars ended and then you know there were
other things going on but resurgence
right now but not only is it a great
time to be in front end engineering
because of all these great things
happening within the community but if
you join us soon we have a ski trip
coming up in a month so like I said
great time like to thank a couple of
people the ones in both the top helped
me out in terms of preparation the ones
in the smaller font to the left hand
side I'll have something to do with the
core team and the ones the right are
people who have been active in the
community and who I've learned from
either explicitly or implicitly with the
contributions they've made contact
information is there thank you very much
any questions
