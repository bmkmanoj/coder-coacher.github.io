guys about tonight is um a fable from
from days of yore
um it's actually what a guy like me in
fact it's about me way back in the day
and so I've got a little bit of a
problem and I'll admit it and it's
unfortunately not a small problem it's a
really big problem um I really like
Super Mario Brothers and like really
like it really really liked it and so
many years ago when the Nintendo DS was
announced I was really really excited
that the suit new super mario brothers
coming out it was a 2d platformers I
think the best Super Mario is all are
and I was super stoked except it was
around Christmas time sometime in the
early 2000s and back then I didn't have
a whole lot of disposable income and it
seemed like a really big investment to
me to go and get the Nintendo DS and to
get the game and I was a little bit
worried about it because I knew I'd
played a lot of Super Mario Brothers in
my past and I was worried it might
consume me but right after Christmas a
little bit of cash saved up I've gotten
some some gifts from some very generous
people and I decided you know what screw
it I'm gonna go get this thing and it's
gonna be awesome so at the time I was
living in a place called Prince Edward
Island we're out here on the east coast
of Canada
yep half the crowd and so I went off and
I drove up to this place called the
Future Shop which is our version of Best
Buy in Canada and this is the future
shop that I went to add a photo I found
on the Internet of that future shop at
about the same time of year it is no
less welcoming today and then it was
back then I went in there and I laid
down my hard-earned cash to buy the
Nintendo DS and get the the new Mario
game and it was awesome it was
everything I had hoped it would be it
was so cool you could not just become
like big Mario but like crazy big Mario
that like destroyed all the blocks that
was super cool and so I played it and I
played it a lot and I be all the levels
and then I beat all the levels and the
secret levels and then I beat all levels
and the secret levels with all the coins
and then you I don't know how many of
you guys are familiar with the Nintendo
DS but you could save three slots and so
I did it again even faster and then I
did it all over again even faster than
that and so after the end of three
months I played it just about every
single day and pretty for many hours and
I realized I was just about to reset the
device so I could do it three more times
I realized I needed to put a stop to
this and I said screw it I stuck it in a
box mailed it to my sister in Los
Angeles and I've never seen that damn
thing again but there's a lesson to be
learned here I you know was out 170
bucks and three months of my life and to
to throw into sort of sharp relief what
an idiot and Daniel is which I which I
love to do I'm gonna tell you guys a
story of my own this is a story from a
simpler time and actually quit show
hands if you remember when Nintendo was
new and looked like this raise your hand
okay good okay I'm glad to see that some
of you are also old so so this story
takes place in the year 1986 and it's
actually a story about my wife my wife
was nine years old in in 1986 as was i
but i didn't know her at the time and
and in she like every other
nine-year-old American I don't know what
was going on in Canada who wanted a
Nintendo more than anything and this is
what a Nintendo looked like back then
for those of you who didn't raise your
hand big bulky you know device and and
they were fantastically expensive so 199
dollars in 1986 is a lot of money and
you know if you're nine years old at any
time this is a lot but in 1986 to to let
you guys know in 2013 dollars I mean
it's over $400 so a lot of money and
actually for you Canadians I'm not sure
about the conversion but I may be that
one
so I'll enjoy to get you on a float
really just so you guys know the
craftsmanship that went into this I
research that that's how many liters you
can get
I spelled leaders the Canadian way so
just so you guys know that the care that
went into this slide but anyway my wife
is very industrious nine years old she
does chores around the neighborhood
scrimps and saves her allowance and she
saves up enough money to buy a Nintendo
and she's just about ready to plunk down
her hard-earned cash that's right at the
last minute she gets cold feet god this
is a really big purchase you know I'm
nine years old I don't she thought that
but you know so she she made an
arrangement that for $4 she'd rent a
Nintendo from her neighbor and so all
weekend long she'd have a Nintendo all
the games and she could play as much as
she wanted and see what it was like to
own one so this is the scene that I
think my wife imagined it would be like
family and now this is a this is a like
promotional promotional material from
Nintendo from that era and if you guys
look closely at this family they are
tremendously excited to be playing
Nintendo in fact the brothers are so
excited they don't seem to notice that
Super Mario Brothers is actually a
one-player game but but this is like you
know in the 80s Nintendo was new and
this is like how you felt he's God you
know and and and this is what she
imagined that her family would all be in
on it but the reality is more like this
and this is
if not it's not an actual photo of my
wife I found something online but I
think this is what what it was like you
know she's like eyes bloodshot up until
3:00 4:00 a.m. you know playing Nintendo
and by the end of Sunday night she took
it back and gave it to her neighbor and
she was like I cannot handle owning a
Nintendo and so for $4 in just 48 hours
of her time she learned what Daniel did
this idea of renting before you buy has
a lot to do I think with them
prototyping and software development and
that's what we're going to talk about
tonight
so Jacob I've worked in a bunch of
startups and a bunch of companies and
now at Google Ventures as a design team
we work with the portfolio companies
that Google Ventures is invested in
which is just over 200 companies now so
we've got a lot of experience working
with some really great product teams and
the way great product teams frequently
develop products is they'll come up with
and you might recognize this for this
process is the kind of ship early ship
off and kind of process you come up with
an idea you know your hypothesis that
you want to test you engineer as quickly
as you can so you're building a Minimum
Viable Product you you know let
everything go of it that isn't
absolutely necessary to keep it really
simple and lean then you launch it get
it out in the wild get it into real
users hands and then you measure the
results we've discovered that this
really actually isn't a very good way to
build software at least it's a it's a
sub optimal way to build software and
we've been working on a process that
that shortcuts is because the problem
with this process is you frequently
start with a bad idea I mean by
definition you're testing a hypothesis
and by definition hypotheses these
hypotheses you're close you can adobe
add extra but you they're frequently
wrong and so you could be engineering
actually an idea that's no good um even
if it's a good idea now you spend a
whole bunch of time building it and
unless you guys are much better at doing
projections than I am you frequently
spend a lot more time doing this than
you anticipate and now that you've
invested the time engineering it you
kind of look back and like oh well it's
good enough I guess we'll just launch it
you put it out in the wild
spend a bunch of time you know
communicating to users that you're gonna
launch it and the lovely data that
you're hoping to to get back after
launch is often a lot Messier and a lot
more open to interpretation than you'd
like to think and now that you've got it
out in the wild you got this feature
that may not actually work that well and
even if it's not the best feature a few
of your users are going to think it's
the greatest ever and so it's
really hard to roll it back without
going through a lot of political trouble
with your your user base and instead of
iterating you often just move on to the
next shiny idea and just leave that old
one kind of festering you know in the
pile of code that you now have so what
would you do instead with a lot of our
portfolio companies is a process over a
week that really shortcuts this and what
we're doing is we're going all the way
from ID aiding my clickers working
pretty poorly um over the course of a
week we go from idat to sketching to
prototyping to testing and inside of a
week we can validate whether or not I
our hypotheses were correct we call this
a five day design sprint we've done this
now with over 70 of our portfolio
companies so I'm going to tell you a
story about one of these Sprint's and
the company that I'm going to talk about
is Blue Bottle coffee so if you guys are
familiar with Blue Bottle coffee it's a
it's a coffee company that we invested
in it's not a clever name for a software
company and and they have a number of
cafes in San Francisco in New York City
and fact if you go to the Ferry Building
just nearby here you know there's a
those of you who are from San Francisco
there's a bunch of shops inside for
commuters and tourists and there's one
in particular that always has this long
line kind of stretching out into the
hallway and it's not the store that
sells the only mushrooms it's saying
it's so you guys know the funky store so
so it's Blue Bottle coffee they're
really known for these these are these
long lines and and there's a reason why
there's a long line and in fact in fact
if you look closely at that at that wine
you may notice a familiar
gangly praying mantis style figure and
then that is it is in fact me waiting
room mantis with only one shirt yeah
yeah so so it can be hard to find shirts
in my size but fine whatever
good stick with it so so they're you
know they're I am like building getting
my coffee and I can tell you if you
haven't been the blue balls it's really
fantastic coffee and you this wonderful
in-store experience beautiful interior
design and wonderful friendly baristas
knowledgeable a great coffees
world-class but blue bottle also had a
website or still has a website and on
the web store there you can order coffee
beans and they'll ship the beans to you
freshly roasted and blue bottle wasn't
happy with the performance of this web
store so we made an investment in them
they came to us said could you help us
redesign the web store and so we did one
of these Sprint's with them one of the
first things that we want to do in a
sprint I think one of the reasons why
people like to ship early and ship off
and is it gives you a deadline if you're
shipping and got to have things done so
you can ship them and I'm tend to be a
natural procrastinator myself and I'm
sure you guys aren't maybe one or two of
you also procrastinate from time to time
and I find a deadline really helpful so
we manufacture one at the outset of our
sprint what we'll do is if we're doing a
five-day sprint we'll start off by
setting up a deadline on Friday that we
can't get out of we'll recruit five
users usually just using Craigslist
we'll find customers who look like the
company's customers and we'll bring them
in for four five separate interviews and
once we've set that deadline once we
know those people are coming in on
Friday and we haven't even started doing
anything yet were like holy crap like we
got to get something done you know we're
very focused and it can be every bit as
tense and in a positive way as a
deadline to launch with marketing lined
up another thing that we found is really
important is having the right people in
the room during the duration of the
Sprint you know their laptops closed and
what happens is there's more right
people to have in the room than we
generally you think when we're doing
projects so in the example of bluebottle
we have folks who you'd expect like
engineers and designers and product
people the people are going to be
actually building the website it makes
sense to have them in the room but we
think it's
also really valuable to have a broader
array of people from the company so in
this case we've got James the founder
we've got the CFO people who really know
how the business works and and why it
works that way as well as people like
customer support and marketing who are
on the ground and know about how the
cafe works and all of the things that
make it a great in-store experience so
it's good that we've got all of these
potential insights because this is this
problems actually pretty hard blue
bubbles got you know if you go in there
there's 15 different kinds of coffee and
15 brown paper bags that look more or
less the same except they've got a
different name on them and if you have
to decide which coffee you want and
you've never had their coffee before
it's gonna be tough got to prove to you
that it's good and and and help you make
that decision and I don't know how to do
that so one of the first things that we
we did not may be very surprising is to
look at how other companies do this who
we're successful and if you look at
coffee sites you go into coffee stores
you'll see this pattern where the coffee
is organized by the region that it comes
from so you can see here Latin America
Africa Indonesia and here it is again
and here it is again you'll see this
over and over and it's not just these
small boutique coffee shops that do this
here's a menu at Starbucks they you know
know a thing or two about marketing and
you can see when I'm all in Colombia and
Ethiopian coffee a quick show of hands
if you know the difference between
Guatemalan and Colombian coffee raise
your hand oh well in person okay okay
one person okay so and which is awesome
I mean I don't need to likes to call you
out that's totally awesome but the rice
just want the rest of you to know that
you should not feel bad it's yesterday
nothing to be ashamed of we even had a
guy at in the user studies at the end of
the week when we showed him one of these
sites and he had actually admitted that
he he roasted his own beans at home she
was buying raw green beans and then
roasting them and he like was so
sheepish she was like guys I really
think I should probably know this but
like depends how I roast them you know
they taste so different at the end so
even he thought stymied by it have you
were like dude like don't feel bad if
you don't know nobody knows we're not
roasting our own beans here so you know
not to make you feel bad but normal
people don't understand what with us
and and so well once we kind of like
tapped into that we were like well you
know we asked James the founder of Blue
Bottle what do you think we should do
because James really wanted to bring the
cafe experience to the website so we
said how do you handle this in the cafes
he said well you know we train the
baristas that if somebody comes into the
cafe and they're you know looking at
those 14 brown paper bags and there they
are
they're trying to make a decision when
they ask for a suggestion will train the
baristas and that's an actual burst it's
not me wearing a hat so it trained them
to to ask the person how do you make
your coffee at home because if you make
your coffee with a French press or
Chemex or drip it's gonna help the
barista tell you like the kind of beans
that you're gonna enjoy and I remember
that like right when he said how do you
make coffee at home I kind of like
looked over at Daniel and Daniel's eyes
got big and it looks like this beam of
inspiration outside the window just just
like that it's just like that it's a
photograph so you really literally what
happened and but that insight about
organizing the beans by the way you brew
at home is something that we never would
have gotten if we hadn't had all of
those people from the company in the
room when we were working on the project
so we've gone through some research and
we choose some challenges that we think
you know like choosing between those
those 15 brown bags of coffee that well
we want to test and so the next thing we
do is we're going I da ssin process to
try to figure out how we might actually
solve those problems so we actually get
everybody to be drawing and we spend
quite a bit of time at this we actually
spend most of one day sketching ideas
and what this person is drawing here is
actually like a little version of an
interface for tackling a problem
we usually get people to sketch several
panes so they're actually not sketching
like a screen but the sketching an
interaction of how a user might actually
go through a process and we don't do any
group brainstorming we actually very
explicitly avoid this really leads the
groupthink and leads people kind of
off-base a lot of the time and let's
kind of the loudest person in the room
frequently get get the
other people to rally behind them um so
will you have everybody sitting around
the room all sketching on their own and
I mean everybody not just the designers
who might be able to draw prettier stick
figures than everyone else this is James
the founder so everyone here is
sketching a whole myriad of possible
solutions to to the problems and in the
end we've got a whole bunch of ways that
we might actually test something and
it's great to have like 10 12 14
different you know well thought through
designs but obviously that's too many we
can't prototype 12 different designs so
we have to decide and another little
trick that we use is to vote rather than
having a big discussion sure that some
of you have experienced what I have
experienced which was sort of marathon
meetings where you're like duking it out
and trying to decide academically what's
the best design what's the best way to
solve this and we really don't want this
this to happen so a little trick is
something called weighted voting the
idea is that everybody in the room gets
as many of these little blue stickers as
they want they can take these blue
stickers and put them you know all the
papers or up all the drawings or up
around the room now put the stickers on
portions of ideas that they think work
well or they think show promise and
they'd like to see us explore or at
least you know consider so by the end of
that process everybody going through
like that you've got kind of like it's a
heat map you know you guys have seen
heat maps on the web so you basically
see there's like clusters of blue dots
around things that that are interesting
that people are finding compelling and
we'll talk about those quickly we'll
move you know around the room fast and
talk about those different spots and
then we we wait the voting so in this
case we want just one or two in this
case it's it's not James the founder
people to make the decisions about what
we're going to prototype so James gets
six of these red dots they're big and
red they're gonna buy drown out the blue
ones and he'll go around and put them
just on the parts that he wants to make
sure that we prototype and then we'll
try to figure out how to make that work
so by the end of that process we've
gotten you know some very opinionated
James's take on what's the best way to
go after he's heard all of our arguments
and we've got this this idea of
recreating the cafe so taking that
beautiful interior design of the cafÃ©'s
and actually trying like literally
translate that onto a webpage another
idea is to tell the story of the Blue
Bottle so there's all this knowledge and
expertise that the Blue Bottle team has
it comes through when you talk to them
and what if we actually like went
text-heavy
and tried to like just put that right on
the web and then the last idea that one
that made Daniels eyes light up with
Glee is is this idea of sorting the
coffee beans by the way that you brew
coffee at home nobody else does that so
we're not sure if that worked but James
is pretty compelled by it by trying that
out but there's like these three
different ideas so now we have to pick
which one we're gonna prototype and what
we decide to do and what we often do is
to not decide we were actually gonna do
like a battle royale and prototype all
three of them and pit them head-to-head
and see which one does best because we
don't know if the answer in that sitting
in that room and however it is now
Thursday morning and we've got only one
day left to do this prototype so so what
are we do yeah so this might seem a
little bit crazy that we've spent three
days out of five doing research and
ideation and now we've left ourselves
with you know we don't work until 4:00
in the morning to get this done so we've
got you know eight or nine hours to
really pull together three fairly
significant prototypes but we've got
some tricks that help us move really
quickly here so you may not think
there's enough time but what we have is
a whole bunch of ideas sketched out with
fairly good fidelity so when we were
doing those sketching exercises earlier
in the week we don't let people kind of
hand wave like oh people will click
somewhere and then this other thing
might happen they're very specific in
terms of suggesting how an interaction
might work so we can actually go back to
our little pieces of paper and there's
real copy on here there's real
suggestions about where you know the
photography might go and where the
buttons might go so we're able to lift
those ideas and take them straight into
the prototypes and as I was showing on
the previous slide we're doing even
though we've only got one day we're
doing actually fairly complex
interactions so we're stitching together
you know 10 or 15 screens to build a
full fairly immersive
prototype for the users coming in the
next day and the way we commonly do this
is we use something like keynote we're
trying to build prototypes at what I
call like a Goldilocks level of fidelity
it's neither too basic so we're not
doing paper prototyping we're not using
something like balsamic we're also not
focusing on the very high fidelity we're
not sweating whether or not the buttons
are just the right shade or the corner
radii or exact but we want it to be just
at the right fidelity where users who
come in on Friday will have consistent
disbelief we don't want them to think
that they're looking at a bunch of
mock-ups necessarily we want them
thinking I'm looking at real a real web
app here and with keynote we're able to
do this fairly quickly and also to
involve non designers in the prototyping
process because it's not like teaching
Photoshop in a single day to some people
um we also have a few tools that we use
so we use something like keynote Opie a
lot of the time if you guys aren't
familiar with this it's totally worth of
what hundred bucks or something it comes
with a whole bunch of default form
elements and and just general widgets
you can drag them into your keynote
files particularly for pro tect and is
it a mention immensely useful and so in
the end we've gone from having these
three basic concepts so we wanted tests
to three fairly sophisticated web apps
fully sketched out we even create fake
brands in the case of a project similar
to Blue Bottle because we don't want
people who are already familiar with the
brand to be to be somehow swayed into
liking or disliking things um so in this
case we've created telescope coffee
which is the storytelling mock this is
the the skeuomorphic you know recreate
the cafe idea called Linda nalli and
potting shed which is testing the the
coffee filtering mechanism so so now
it's Friday morning people are gonna
come in stranger so we do not know we're
going to come in and look at these
prototypes that we made just a few hours
before it's extremely tense time but I
want to talk for a second before I
reveal to you what happened in the test
we're gonna tell you about just about
research because a lot of small
companies we talk to a lot of small
companies and
a lot of times I don't want to do
research or haven't done research
because there's a perception that it's
really complicated like how you know we
need like a behavioral psychologist to
conduct the interviews and we need like
a special room with a one-way mirror and
you know like an eye tracker ladies or
eye trackers yeah we can't do testing
without lasers that'll even if we have
to have a laser eye tracker we can't
start and and so the the way that we've
set things up is very unsophisticated
not that Daniel and I aren't
sophisticated but but the method is
unsophisticated we've basically got like
a laptop which has a webcam built in and
we're running keynote fullscreen and it
looks like you're you're in a browser
looking at a real webpage using Apple TV
or GoToMeeting will project what's on
the screen and the webcam video of the
participant over to another room where
the rest of the team can watch but in
that room there's just one of us doing
the interview and then one of these
folks at a time who we've brought in you
know we've posted this ad on Craigslist
and asked people to come in and then
filter down on on the right folks so we
do five of these interviews or showing
each person all three of the prototypes
and mostly just watching and asking them
questions as they go through and kind of
observing what happens so what ends up
happening is the aim of the day is that
we get we get data without launching and
Daniel talked about the problems when
you launch something into the wild you
may have a large number of data points
but you don't always know why something
works or doesn't work when you do this
kind of study you don't get as many data
points but you really do know why you
can hear people talking about you can
watch their faces react you know why
some things work and some things don't
it's quite powerful what we find out in
our battle royale is that this this idea
of recreating the cafe doesn't work at
all people really do not do not like
that but that's good so we weren't
excited about that idea a head of time
you know I'll admit but we were able to
find out that it sucked without having
to launch and and go through all that
painful process Daniel described earlier
as for the others
it turns out counter-intuitively that a
lot of text actually works people might
not read all the text but it lends
credibility to
the telescope coffee concept and how do
you brew at home also works people find
that some very intuitive way to pick
beans so those kind of risky ideas that
James had each of those was a bit
counterintuitive turned out to pay off
which is great
and now that they've got kind of some
confidence so they having seen people
react to these designs they they felt
like they could go all the way around
and build the design for real so here's
the the design post sprint you can see
at the top it's got this filtering thing
how do you brew your coffee at home it's
go to blue bottle dot-com this is how it
works and and you can see there's
there's actually a lot of text in here
in fact like you see a block of text
like this I think this kind of goes
against everything I think is true about
the internet this doesn't look like
something that I you know want to put in
design but turns out this helps people a
lot they care about the story of the
coffee and having that confidence
bluebottle went ahead and like designed
it and built it as you saw they launched
it and now they have those large number
of data point real-world metrics and the
new design is doing quite well so it's
been out for a couple of months and
they've they've doubled their sales
growth and they've doubled the time
spent on site which is totally great but
at the same time that's it's just a
website right right so I can imagine you
might be sitting there and being kind of
skeptical that this is like a
one-size-fits-all process and first of
all it's not really a one-size-fits-all
process we use many of these elements
every time we do a sprint but we tailor
the sprint frequently how we do the
prototyping even how we do the ideation
stuff depending on the specific
challenges that are coming to us and
we've had a lot of success with a lot of
companies across a lot of different
fields and doing things that are
significantly more complex than an
e-commerce site like you saw with Blue
Bottle we've done work on iOS and
Android a lot of mobile work with
companies like pocket we've worked with
a mobile fitness startup called bit star
quite a bit with a lot of success and
bluebottles customers are kind of
everybody you know anybody who's kind of
in the upper echelon of the the coffee
business and but we frequently worked
with with much more difficult to
users for studies we've worked with
everybody from investors so circle ups a
company that lets investors connect with
businesses to do fairly significant size
investment so kind of minimum ten twenty
thousand dollar investments a company
that works with woodworkers a lot
geneticists which is a very interesting
challenge farmers this company called
the climate Corp even with doctors this
is a project we did with a company
called foundation medicine so we're
working with oncologists on on a report
about cancer and we've even worked with
startup founders we recently redesigned
our website we launched it maybe about
two weeks ago and when we were working
on it earlier this year we actually went
through a sprint process ourselves and
came up with a bunch of hypotheses about
how kind of what are the important
things for investors when they're
considering raising money from any of a
myriad of venture capital companies and
we found a bunch of users a bunch of
inventors and had them come in and and
test out a bunch of comps with them and
learned a lot about what's important to
to those founders we even use this
process in kind of crazy ways um we're
I'm currently in charge of redesigning a
build our building in Mountain View
California with a significant budget and
before we got started we kind of laid
out our basic ground rules and then we
were engaged in architect to work with
us and I don't know what if you guys are
you know have ever done
corporate architecture before but you
frequently get presented with images
kind of like this one they're really
hand wavy the architects will talk to
you about you know oh yeah people will
just gather in the stairwell and they'll
have all these you know impromptu
conversations and idea sharing across
your organization it's total BS they
have no idea if that's how people do it
and most architects build buildings in
there never watch how people actually
use them so you get these things I just
like friendly ghosts walking around your
office
there are file cabinets at jaunty angles
I don't know how many of you have clean
desks like this that's your
your office will never look like this um
and one of the things that came up when
we were talking about the redesign was
um how entrepreneurs would would use
this space and one of the suppositions
we had early on was that there was this
meeting space just outside of the main
conference room and it was totally a
dead zone no one ever used it
and there were two theories on this one
was either it was a shitty place to sit
with an uncomfortable couch and a weird
video meeting screen that people can
appear on and talk to you like staring
at you if you sit on the couch um that
was a pretty good theory I think they
know it it was a shitty space and so no
one used it and then the other theory
was that as part of the ritual of coming
into a VC people don't really linger
outside meeting rooms and there really
aren't casual conversations like that so
we really quickly picked up this
furniture and threw it in a storage room
somewhere else on Google and we put in
kind of more casual environment and
actually we're putting like coffee and
drinks and stuff intentionally out on
these things to encourage people to
gather there apparently we didn't get
rid of the robot screen thing but maybe
he was the problem yeah by prototyping
this we actually discovered you know
actually kind of sat nearby here and
watched a bit no one used it like nobody
ever used it and so you'll notice that
our new oh so the assumption that
spontaneous gathering happened was a
false one and you'll notice that our new
that these are the floor plans from the
new building we were able to reclaim
quite a bit a whole space to have a
significantly larger meeting room and we
there is no such thing as a hangout
space a spontaneous gathering space
outside of our our meeting room so we
got like pretty excited about this
process ourselves and you know like a
person with a hammer we're kind of see
everything through this lens and and I
want to leave you guys with sort of
three of what I think are the key
elements that we found make it work
again and again the the first one is
that notion of creating kind of a crazy
external
Deadline that you can't get out of it's
amazing what you can accomplish in a
week if you only have a week and you're
forced to only have a week the second is
to build things that you are okay with
throwing away things that are just good
enough to appear to be real but that
aren't actually real and that's an
important distinction and then lastly to
do research with people who are outside
of your team your company people who
will be seeing these things with fresh
eyes and reacting to them as if they're
seeing for the first time the statement
did you see up here we you know I hear
this a lot I say this a lot but kind of
interested in the idea of like editing
this statement because what everybody
really wants to do is to learn early and
learn often and when you phrase it in
that way you open up the possibility of
renting before you buy and learning so
that you can ship with with confidence
and know what you're getting into before
you go to all that expenditure the big
long circle and that's all we have yeah
talk about that yeah so we obviously
haven't had a ton of time to go through
an incredible detail about how we
actually conduct these design sprints
but we've written about it at length and
you go to this link there's a series of
five articles they explain how each day
of a design sprint works and it's been
really kind of neat over the last year
so we've heard from maybe a dozen
companies some fairly large ones that
have taken the idea of design sprints
and started using them in-house so we've
never even heard of before we just run
into them at conferences and events like
this one and it's really neat that I
think the the guide that's been written
here is in enough fidelity to really do
it on your own yeah so check it out
thanks watch it guys so much for having
us I think it's about time for some
questions
I come up with like 95% of the bad ideas
personally so that's it no I um no
actually so everybody sketches so yeah
we're sketching right alongside the
everybody from the team everybody who's
in the room so he's asking sorry I got
asked earlier to repeat people's
questions so online people can hear so
he's asking um how do we get non
designers to be to act the act of
sketching participants as part of the
sprint process I think a big part of it
has to do with setting the right level
of sketching fidelity so we're really
clear at the beginning that this isn't
an art contest and that we're much more
interested in words than we are you know
words and shapes and arrows than we are
in specifically how it looks and I think
this goes both for the designers as it
does for everyone else even if a
designer is capable of drawing you know
beautiful pictures I would encourage
them not to do it in the sprint I think
it's really easy for us as designers you
know we great power comes great
responsibility I think we can be very
convincing by making pretty things and
 wave our hands really fast and I
think if we focus on the things that are
really important actually you know the
activities that our users are gonna do
you know the behaviors our users gonna
do will realize that painting putting a
picture of coffee up there that looks
exactly like coffee beans is not the
point and just writing the word coffee
with a big X that means photograph works
pretty good too I think that helps a lot
to put people at ease I think it also
helps to set the expectation that you're
gonna put these all up on the wall
afterwards and we're all going to look
at them and scare people yeah I think it
scares me though personally I think it
scares them in a good way but but I
think it makes people take it a bit more
seriously and if you give them enough
time we'll give people you know 30
minutes an hour more than that to do the
sketches it when you emphasize text it
levels it levels out but forces people
dancing you know to what I was saying
a second ago I've seen Jake so he's kind
of is the the ringmaster for a bunch of
these prints
I've seen you actually draw on the
whiteboard drunk okay for the next you
know X hours we're gonna do you know um
you know uh concept sketching and a
concept sketch looks something like this
and you sketch one out and then they
realize that you you're not Picasso and
so maybe you're not so intimidating yeah
we also added mean to like the answer
this question for 20 minutes but but I
love this stuff so that we want to make
sure that people don't start with like a
blank canvas problem or they're just
like oh my gosh I have to draw a UI and
I just find paper so we started we have
them take notes on things that are round
the room so they've got 15 minutes to
just like look around and write stuff
you only have to think they just write
down things that they think are
interesting and then we have the mind
map and we said could just mind mapping
for 15 minutes and just quietly on your
own and then you're doing like us we do
us quick sketching exercise and and then
after doing all that then we do like the
actual schedule I think that helps you
people have a lot of stuff to draw from
what we're even using like fairly low
fidelity markers so it's a fairly fat
tip marker when you're working and uh I
mean it's like your fancy pants
designers aren't can't shades in
you know like we do talk about what will
be successful what collectively like
what metrics they'll measure after the
thing launches and and you know for
something like this it's it's pretty
simple it's things like sales growth and
time on site but I think a lot of the
we're looking less at task completion
kinds of things which i think is often a
metric for usability studies and we're
more looking for like what happens we'll
all of us who are working on it you know
we'll be in the room watching this live
when the studies happen I mean not
literally in with the person rifle will
be in the other room and and you just
know when you take notes and you say
like what went well and what didn't go
well and you know we track all the stuff
after each person we write it all down
by the end of the day you see these
patterns this thing again and again this
didn't work you know and I know that
sounds like very wishy-washy but I think
the reality is that a lot of it just
becomes obvious when everyone watches at
the same time
that's another downfall with a lot of or
stumbling block I think for traditional
research and larger companies is that
the researcher does the research and
then they have to
write a report and then they have to
like explain it or pitch it to the rest
of the company but when everyone watches
it it's it's a different it's a
different story another way to think
about the research too is that we're not
necessarily doing a lot of super nuance
testing here and we're not doing a you
know 200 person ethnographic study over
matter of months we're testing some you
know a few core hypotheses you know five
or six things that we're really testing
across five people and so if you see a
pattern across four out of five people
it's fairly you know kind of big
building block kind of fundamental
problems not a bunch of little
ticky-tacky
small improvement kind of stuff it is
important to make a list like what just
exactly Daniels saying of what the key
questions are and it's a little bit
different than like a success criteria
yes it's like there's there's hypotheses
that we're wondering about and one of
them might be does the does the website
looking like the cafe make people feel
like it's high quality does a lot of
text make people feel like it's high
quality does you know our people able to
find beans that they're excited about by
by sorting by region and you know things
like that and and we'll always make sure
that the person who's running the
interview knows like there's these three
questions we really are burning for us
or these five I think that helps to
having the right people totally matters
yeah so I mean I'm frequently when you
see design breakdown within
organizations it's almost never because
you know your Photoshop comps aren't
good enough it's usually political
policies and it's frequently your bad
relationships between people within
organizations and so it's really crucial
for us to make sure that the real
decision-makers are in the room or else
I mean we've had a few sprints go
sideways when we weren't able to get the
right people in the room I think there's
a lesson we've kind of learned the hard
way and then we've gone and done a
sprint for a week we came back with a
bunch of lessons and those lessons end
up being left on the floor
they don't really end up making the
product because the the you know the
core people weren't there so a lot of
it's like pre sprint communication it's
explaining kind of what the importance
of this
two people talking about like that we
want their voice to be heard early in
the process because you know the the
decision-makers are frequently kind of
you know what core voice within the
organization and sometimes it's just
cajoling people figuring out you know
soft basic soft skills of working within
an organization figuring out kind of how
to how you know what what what factors
to kind of lean on in order to to
convince somebody that this is really
worth spending a full week of their time
and we've been fairly sick I know and
again that's a hand wavy thing but
politics within organizations are
frequently a hand wavy thing and there's
not like a single bullet that that gets
people in the room fact bullets are
terrible metaphor for that I think that
in yeah oh I'm sorry I'm strictly repeat
the question so the question was with
the small amount of time how do you how
do you pick which parts of what might be
a large problem to focus on and I think
that a flippant but a part of the answer
is that the the short time constraint
actually helps with that focus a lot
because when you know like we only have
four days until people come in there's
only so much we can prototype in a day
and especially after you've run a sprint
you get a sense for how much you can do
in a day using you know whatever tricks
you you can that helps you pick how much
big disco because you're like yeah I
just we can't do that much and if you
bit off more than you can chew you just
won't prototype at all and it won't be
in the test on on Friday but but the
other part of it is the other parts are
we try to talk about it ahead of time so
we try to find out what people want to
focus on well trying to narrow it a bit
but I think it's actually easiest to
make the decision about what the scope
once everybody's in the room and you
will make a map on a whiteboard of who
are all the user types so you guys are
considering who are the people who we
might bring in and try to pick one of
those and how do they move through the
product well it's just like really make
a really very simple you know like this
happens arrow this happens arrow this
error happens doesn't take a real long
time to map that out and then you try to
have that discussion about like which
piece of this which
pieces do we focus in on but you
surprised I mean kind of contrary to
what Jake's saying you'd be surprised
how broad the scope can be like that's
Blue Bottle sprint we just showed you a
little piece of it we were testing what
people's first reaction is kind of
coming to a store kind of what their
level of trust is with the with the
coffee maker we're testing can they
figure out which beans are the right
ones for them and we are also even
testing ways to do a subscription
service because there are several ways
to do a subscription service we actually
kind of compared and contrasted in two
of those comps oh this coffee company
does subscriptions oh I can do it
monthly or I need to commit to entire
year we're able to test even those
things all within a week so fairly
ambitious but they're the big
low-hanging fruit kind of problems that
the company was knew they were facing I
guess so we almost never choose the the
problem so we're gonna tackle
we mostly tease it out of the company
themselves okay again if it's if it's
not important enough for them to do it
in the spring and you know they're
unlikely to ship it yes sure um so
that's a that's a great question it's
kind of who's involved in the
prototyping phase on the fourth day it
varies
obviously you need to move that quickly
you need at least some familiarity with
the tool so sometimes it's just you know
a few of us doing it we really like to
be able to evolve a product manager or a
designer if there is one on the the
other team the more people the better
not just have more hands but also to
have them learning by doing can be can
be really really helpful so that's again
you know keynotes a lot more
approachable than Photoshop but I'm
still not expecting somebody who's not
at all familiar with keynote to jump in
and be pounding away but we also can't
ask them with other things that aren't
necessarily working on the computer we
have people okay I'm gonna need copy on
this page it's not all the way thought
through yet
sketch it out on a whiteboard now I'll
copy it into the doc or you know work in
notepad and just send it to me lots of
stuff like that and I'm not sure if
we've to emphasize this enough but the
writing in these things is unbelievably
important
more than ever value copywriting after
doing this kind of program typing I'm
because I can visual design with the
best of them and uh you know one of the
guys we work with John is okay visual
designer it's a really good writer he'll
 destroy me all the time and
things you find out when you do these
battle Royales week after week that like
you're like John's just crushing you
again and again and the writing really
matters much more than than we ever
realized
so tasking you know hopefully more
people can do things like copywriting
that kind of thing so try to disperse it
and we actually find one last thing on
that is that having people who are good
writers as part of your team that you
bring in is really helpful having
marketers people you know might not
think of it that first blush as being
part of the design and engineering team
will help a lot depends who you who we
have yeah the so two-part question for
those to see if the first part is how do
we structure the the interviews with
users and the second part is how do we
bribe them to show up in the first place
so for the first part we it does vary
depending on on the on the the project
and you know how far along the the the
product is that we're working on we'll
sometimes you know well we're not a yep
you know completely opposed to doing
like an a/b test on something but
generally speaking we do user interviews
and the Michael Margolis is a research
partner on our team will write an
interview script and he'll this is
actually kind of a nice trick
he won't participate in the sprint with
us all the time but we'll check in with
him on Monday when we decide who are the
kinds of people that we want to bring in
and then like on Wednesday we'll say
here's what we got so far does it make
sense to you or starting out Wednesday
on Thursday like midday Thursday we're
prototyping and he'll be like whoa what
about you know he'll know ask us a lot
of tough questions because he hasn't got
Stockholm Syndrome for being in the room
all week and and so that helps quite a
bit but the interviews are basically you
know a little bit of a warm-up asking
the person about you know what they do
you know how do they buy coffee and how
they do things today and
and then sort of walking them through
the prototype and mostly observing them
and Michael I think is an expert at the
sort of the pregnant pause you know
he'll say let's say things like some of
they'll be talking I'll say and if you
just like freeze like that for long
enough people will keep talking and tell
you more in terms of recruiting people
um it really depends on whom who we're
looking for so as I was saying we've
done tests with oncologists and
investors and you know a lot of common
folk so we use Craigslist frequently um
and the pitch is basically you know
you'll get a hundred bucks
hundreds usually an Amazon gift card um
so we do you'll pay a reasonable market
rate for somebody come into research and
we do a screener um so you know you or
don't just say on Craigslist like who
wants 100 bucks that doesn't work very
good or very well and it works very well
but not so what what happens is it
actually click through and go to like a
survey that they fill out we kind of
bury the questions in the survey that
are the kind of the crucial ones for you
know we don't the first question is and
do you love coffee you know that's kind
of like in a set of questions about kind
of food that kind of thing and but when
we're recruiting say founders to come in
to you know see the the new you know
Google Ventures site that we're working
on we obviously aren't looking on
Craigslist very much and we're using a
lot of social connections to figure them
out people who are kind of third level
Friends of people we know so they're not
terribly familiar with us and they're
not friends with us but they're you know
obviously fit our criteria and even they
like $100 gift cards um so how do we
convince kind of the bigwigs to show up
for user studies um well obviously not
gonna borrow them into the room and not
let them leave and but they frequently
are there because we've convinced them
in the day one you know when they were
there to help us with the research of
the value of actually watching some of
their customers actually use their
product and you'd be surprised how
infrequently a lot of
people see that stuff and then you know
you give them the opportunity that just
grab a coffee sit down
you know let's watch these together it's
actually not that hard to convince them
we do record them obviously so you can
watch them afterwards you know if
someone's not able to attend but um
again it's like that question I was
answering a second ago it's some of this
is soft politics and uh it's just a
matter of kind of finding the right ways
to come in to the right people it's also
not always crucial that the the decider
if their time is limited be in the
sprint all day every day five days you
know if if they're sometimes will just
decide like what are the right
checkpoints and just like we have
checkpoints with Michael who's outside
of the room it might be that that's the
best way to involve a founder whoever
the decider is but it's important to
have them what's what doesn't work is
when they're when they're not involved
in when they don't see the progression
throughout the week so so it's not like
a non-starter if you can't get that
person for 40 hours yeah we we have
tried that and we've actually been
talking recently about you know trying
to do some more experiments around the
the timing of it part of the reasons why
we stick to five days or stick to what
you can do in before a weekend basically
because sometimes we'll be three and
sometimes will be four days is probably
cuz it's easier mentally to kind of
think like okay I'm gonna do this
unusual thing for my company but it's
just for a week like it's kind of easier
to think of committing to week than
committing to two weeks it also helps to
have a sort of continuity that people
are are just you know like in this room
we've got the stuff up on the walls we
just do this every day and you don't
have time to get distracted away kind of
stays in your mental Ram and I also
think that a week turns out to be it's
kind of some nice coincidences about the
amount of work you can accomplish in a
week the amount of prototyping you can
do in a day and how much you can show
people in like an hour
interview and and how much you could
digest and it turns out that like a week
is about right for all all those things
something we do frequently though is
that we'll do multiple sprints in a row
and the first sprint
volve more people you know including
ourselves and the entire week and then
in the follow-on week they'll be instead
of like two or three of us involved with
them maybe one of us will be there to
help them you know kind of remember how
the process works and instead of one of
us doing the user study one of them
might do the user study because they've
seen how those are done now and your
whole goal as a design team is not to do
design necessarily with our portfolio
companies there's 200 companies and only
five of us it's to teach them how did
how to do great design and so I think
that process you know not only helps us
scale but also helps kind of wean them
off of our team for running the spring
and helps them kind of keep doing this
on a repetitive process over the next
year two years three years um to be more
successful and it helps us fix the
things that we inevitably get a lot of
things wrong the first friend yeah so
then you're just modifying the the
prototype and it's Princeton like two
and three yeah yeah so two-part question
just to repeat for for the viewers in
the ether the the first part of the
question is when do we ship the stuff
does it happen right after the sprint
and I think that the second part is was
really more about like how does this
kind of fit in with ship really ship off
and what how do you know why would you
rush to ship and I can talk about the
first one I think that we I don't want
to get the impression that we launch
this like right afterwards actually and
I also don't want to give the impression
that we think you should be sprinting
all the time sprinting is a really good
way to make fast progress on a big
problem doing something new for the
first time doing a new feature or or
redesigning of a significant part of a
product but it's it would be exhausting
to do this all the time you know 52
weeks a year so we usually will do
sprints and you can think about it as
like we're trying to steer like a really
big boat and then once we feel pretty
good about the direction we're headed
then you know it's okay for them to do
things the way they usually do things to
go through all the use cases as you said
or you know figure out all of the
details there's there's a lot of details
left unexplored in in a prototype like
this and we know that going in we won't
answer all the questions
well I mean it really depends on on the
product and but in in almost every case
you know there's the rare case where we
would do a sprint and find this I'm like
oh my gosh that's such an exciting idea
and it worked so well we want to try to
they want to actually build it for real
but understand it like what we're
showing here it's not real like it's
totally it's it's useful as an idea but
it's not something that they can go and
implement you know the keynote mock-up
so they still got to build something
sometimes they might get really excited
in like write something up in code
really quick and and you know launch a
you know fake door or something to get
some more real data but there's always
gonna have to be a you know a step of
process where you actually make the
thing real do the real design work do
the nitty gritty and that stuff is
really important and I don't think that
doing that stuff fast and and you know
trying to ship that as soon as you can
once you're confident that's still a
good thing it's just nice to have that
confidence first because it is it is
costly sure so so how do we adapt this
process for different environments um so
first of all we kind of choose the tools
that that are appropriate so obviously
you know if you're building a mobile
phone app we may not use keynote it's
not very good on an auto mobile phone we
I use an app a lot called Flint oh
that's um really good for our stitching
other of fairly high fidelity prototypes
so choosing the right tools and then the
depending on the tools we can also do
things like get into context so we work
with sidecar for instance who's a
ride-sharing service and we've done some
studies with them that actually involve
getting in cars with people and you know
using a mobile interface while you're
bouncing down the San Francisco Road is
obviously a lot different than sitting
inside an office and so that's you know
very successful breeding wave dad
alright so as far as this is a process
it's also not like a prison that we get
locked into we're really flexible in
terms of particularly in terms of
recruiting the right types of people in
terms of how we run the user study so
it's not always in an office it's not
you know we actually did a study
recently
that's public right I don't know we're
gonna say the truckin one I don't know
okay B I mentioned we work with truckers
you can imagine that that study was not
you know in a corporate office oh so
we're actually um you know getting we
often get out in the field and do tests
like that so and in terms of like you
know building like physical objects
versus stuff
software its to be you know Frank we
don't work with a lot of companies that
are doing physical objects but I do
think that if you have the notion of
like we're gonna try to build and test
something in a week
now what like the people are coming in
like oh my god now what how do we how do
we do it and how do we try to make it
real that you get awfully creative and I
was actually recently talking to this
like just out of interest to a fortune
500 company that makes these like
industrial pumps and they like heard
about the sprint process they were like
we're interested in trying this but you
know how can we do it because we've got
to make like a pump that somebody can
use on an assembly line and I was like
well you can't I don't know how you're
gonna prototype that in a week but and
they were like well no don't you know
we've got these 3d printers and we you
know and they were like I was like oh
like me maybe there is a way which is
basically a long rambling way of saying
that I I think that if you if you have
pressure and you're motivated and you
know you know your domain you probably
can think of something that's that's a
fast way to fake it that it doesn't
involve the full production</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
