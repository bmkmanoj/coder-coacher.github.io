particularly personal pleasure that I
introduce Julian Guthrie and Dan Cray so
they're gonna talk about how to make a
spaceship so this it comes from a book
that Julian wrote which my son and I
read so I got it for my 11 year old son
as a Christmas present last year I
bought him this book that I thought he
would really enjoy we then went to the
Hiller Aviation Museum which is in San
Carlos so just about twenty thirty miles
south of here
to which we are members and Julian was
there doing a book signing with the guy
who piloted the second spaceship one
which you'll hear about that was a
fantastic book signing she was a great
speaker we ended up getting connected
after that and now he or she and Dan
Cray are so Julian is a is a an
award-winning journalist so she worked
many years at the San Francisco
Chronicle she is the author of how to
make a spaceship she is also the author
of a book called the billionaire and the
mechanic which is about Larry Ellison
sir quest for the for the America's Cup
she is currently working on a book that
is going to be near and dear to all of
our hearts called alpha girls coming out
in 2019 which is about women in Silicon
Valley and the struggles they've gone
through and the great achievements that
they have made that one has already been
optioned for TV and movie rights and
then recently how to make a spaceship
which you will hear about today was
optioned for TV series so that's pretty
cool
Dan Cray is the engineers engineer so he
is a structural engineer he helped make
sure the spaceship one you're gonna hear
about actually was space worthy and air
worthy because it had to be both he was
particularly instrumental in making sure
this really goofy an amazing feather
design which you will hear about
actually was a fly ball thing he has
checked out and been a structural
analyst on more aircraft than probably
anybody else in the world because he
works for scaled composites that's Burt
Rutan's company they continue to build
at least once a year a new airframe a
new aircraft from scratch and Dan's the
guy that figures out whether this thing
is actually going to fly so please
welcome Julie
Guthrie and Dan Kray good morning
everyone thank you for that great
introduction it's fantastic to be here
and I appreciate again the invitation so
you may think what is having to make a
spaceship have to do with what you all
are doing well it's really something
that's very similar and that is
architecting designing the future that
you want and I'm going to go through
this pretty quickly
I wrote this this book that was about
340 pages and I have for your sake I
have winnowed it down to kind of five
key takeaways that I hope will inspire
you here at the conference and going
forward with your own moonshots with
your own crazy dreams with whatever it
is that you are trying to succeed at
that may be really difficult so the
first is follow your passion and this
one gets very very important as the
story goes on here if we can get the
clicker to work just there we go I don't
know if I have to get closer here okay
it's not who I am underneath but what I
do that defines me so the reason why now
we're clicking ahead the reason why this
is so important is because there are a
lot of people in your life and this
makes speak to especially the
Sebastien's in the room the young people
in the room but all too all of us where
there are others who have an idea for
what you should do or what you should be
and this is a story about finding your
passion so the story starts with this
boy named Peter Diamandis
who was the child of Greek immigrants
and his family came to America
struggled his father became a doctor and
it was expected that this son of Greek
immigrants follow in the father's path
and here he is as a little boy Peter
Diamandis
with his you know toy medical kit
checking his mother's pulse and when
people met him
they said hello you know future doctor
Diamandis so he was really on this path
and but he loved to he loved science
he loved tinkering he loved to make
things he was not as interested in
medicine and this is really a key thing
so between the photo that you just saw
in this photo something really important
happened it was July 1969 Peter
Diamandis was 8 years old when he got to
stay up late his parents let him stay up
late and he watched the landing of
Apollo 11 on the moon and he was this
little wide-eyed boy who was completely
transfixed as he watched man set foot on
another celestial body for the first
time and he had so he sets out that
really set him out on this
entrepreneurial kind of adventure story
where he so wanted to become an
astronaut and here you see him in this
picture he's a rocket boy he's making
he's tinkering he's building he's
testing out all sorts of chemicals he
and his buddies were hoarding explosives
in their bedrooms don't try this at home
but in dividing up the stash so that if
one stash were discovered the other
would be safe making starting with estes
rockets and making motors of all kinds
and rockets so remember this we're going
to come back to him I want to introduce
you the next so the next kind of
takeaway is take big chances which is a
key theme in this story all along if you
can dream it you can do it Walt Disney
so next we're going to introduce you to
a key person who Randi referenced and
that is a fellow named Burt Rutan and
here he is so you met Peter you saw
Peter when he was a little boy and you
know you see that he has this love of
space and love of rocketry this is Burt
Rutan when he's a little boy and
his love is always please always
aviation he's this kid who there is no
way if a plane is flying overhead that
he could not look up that he has to
study that plane a dream of planes and
it was just in his marrow in the same
way rocketry was for Peter Diamandis so
by the time he's a teenager he's
building these very impressive national
award-winning model planes and it's
interesting because this is true too
Bert throughout his career and that is
he never wanted to build anything from a
kit he always wanted to build something
of his own design his brother dick Rutan
who you'll hear more about later and who
goes on to become a very famous pilot
and a decorated military pilot so dick
Rutan the older brother would fly these
build and fly these model planes from
kits and crashed them and the younger
brother Burt would pick up the balsa
wood pieces and build something of his
own design again he didn't want to make
something that someone else had already
built so here he is looking a lot like
Elvis if you can see him in this plane
this is he starts making these kits so
that you can build a plane basically in
your own garage and this was called the
very vague and kind of cool delta wing
there and Burt is flying it I love that
picture so he's making again planes of
his own design and very improbable
flying machines you know and this was I
took a picture of this when I was in the
Mojave Desert this was Burt's old
drafting table which I thought was
pretty amazing now this is when Burt
Rutan became famous and this was the
start this was the taking big chances
embodied this is a plane called the
Voyager flown by his brother dick Rutan
they set out to do what others said was
impossible and that is build and fly an
airplane that can fly non-stop non
refueled around
globe and they succeeded 1986 this lands
Edwards Air Force Base they're on the
cover of every magazine across the globe
small team doing very big things which
is going to be another take away here
beautiful plane improbable looking plane
basically a flying gas tank I think they
had something like 17 gas tanks in in
the wings all the way down the wings so
super innovative next take away small
teams do big things and I think this
probably applies to all of you and what
you are doing here and trying to do and
I'm sure succeeding in doing so I love
this quote very highbrow where we're
going we don't need roads back to the
future and that's true that's all about
innovating and that's all about making
things of your own design and you know
not making things out of a kit as Burt
Rutan has done very successfully so now
we're back to Peter Diamandis and here
is this quintessential space geek who so
does everything he wants to just to
become a you know part of the astronaut
corps but still trying to please his
parents he goes to MIT he goes to
Harvard he gets his medical degree to
please his parents but he has no
intention of ever practicing medicine
here he is getting his degree he also
thinks secretly and this shows how badly
he wanted to get to space he thought
maybe if I go to Harvard it will advance
my chances of getting into the astronaut
corps and maybe I can glean some details
so that if so I can live really long
that will eventually allow me to get to
space so he again he goes to MIT he goes
to Harvard he gets an aerospace degree
he gets a medical degree and but at this
point once he gets out with the six pack
of degrees he you know he is sure that
space is his
and he has founded a national student
space club he has founded an
international space university he has
started a rocket company while he's at
Harvard he's clearly an underachiever
here he's meeting arthur c clarke the
scientist and science fiction writer and
I like his feathered hair do you see
some pictures here so here at this time
this was the early 1990s and the Space
Shuttle too many Space dreamers
aficionados the Space Shuttle was flying
but it was over budget and it was under
delivering and Peter is starting to
think there is no way he's going to get
to space and he needs to somehow come up
with another way to get to space he
doesn't think he's going to get into the
astronaut corps even if he does his
chances are flying are so slim so he
meets with this team of space geeks and
rocket scientists in Montrose and I love
the white board it says small teams can
do big things and he's writing you know
all these propulsion aspects and he's in
his element so this is 1993 so he has
his aha moment in an unlikely place or
maybe as the writer should say in a very
likely place he finds his aha moment in
the pages of a book a great book he's at
his parents home December 1993
Christmastime he reads the spirit of st.
Louis by the great aviator Charles
Lindbergh and he had always thought that
the young airmail pilot Charles
Lindbergh flew as a stunt to get from
New York to Paris he's reading this and
he's scribbling in the pages and he
realizes that Lindbergh flew not as a
stunt but to win a $25,000 prize put up
by a French hotelier named Raymond or
tag and so when Lindbergh lands in Paris
in 1927 he arguably becomes the most
famous man on earth but more importantly
he really jump-starts the commercial
airline industry and Peter thinks oh my
god what
if I could do the same thing that or tag
did through Lindbergh through an
incentive competition for commercial
space and what if I could jumpstart an
industry again that did not exist at
this time so in 1996 in science st.
Louis which is where Charles Lindbergh
found his backers Peter Diamandis is on
stage he announces a 10 million dollar
prize for the first team that can build
and fly a manned rocket to the start of
space twice within two weeks and startup
space is 62 miles 100 kilometers and the
von Karman line an internationally
accepted starter space so he announces
this he's got astronauts on stage within
me as Buzz Aldrin you can see the famous
mutton-chop sideburns Burt Rutan is
there and that's the start this is the
start of the race he announces this
prize and again the key thing is private
companies non governmental and at this
time only the world's three largest
governments China US and the then Soviet
Union had managed to get man a machine
to space and back so this was an
impossibility in many people's minds the
incentive competition was again launched
10 million dollars experts are clueless
don't listen to the naysayers experts I
should have put our sometimes clueless
don't listen to the naysayers but a good
thing that's definitely key to this
story and so I love this part of it so
once this is launched so success is
being able to move from one failure to
the next with enthusiasm said Winston
Churchill so who do you get when you
announce this this 10 million dollar
prize an incentive competition and this
is something great that can be utilized
in different ways by many different
types of companies today so you get this
maverick who's living in the Mojave
Desert in an octagonal house burned
house of his own design
you get a guy who has for his mailbox
the tail section of an airplane
conventional right you get Burt Rutan
there he is behind his computer who is
intrigued by this has always loved space
you also get these other great
characters Steve Bennett who's in the UK
who drops out of his job in the Colgate
toothpaste Factory and sacrifices
everything you get
Dimitra popescu who's in romanian who
drops out of engineering school and
risks everything built a rocket in the
back of his father-in-law's backyard and
bucharest amazing story you get you get
these off-the-grid types you get these
think different types when you launch
this sort of competition you get Pablo
de Leon down in Brazil you get a guy who
will probably look very familiar to all
of you fellow named John Carmack who
launches armadillo aerospace thinks that
he can take what he's learned in
programming for video games famous quake
and doom and apply it to rocket science
can he do that so they're all in the
quest to win this 10 million dollar
prize and more importantly to create a
private path to space that just did not
exist so here we have I'm going to move
forward
you saw that briefly if you didn't blink
the inside the cockpit of spaceship one
here's the feather mechanism which Dan
will talk about as he was he's going to
tell amazing stories from the inside and
building this but this was Burt Rutan's
aha moment we talked about Peters this
was birds so I'm gonna try to move
quickly here the the another key
takeaway is to persist so as no I'm
gonna move forward here so as these
teams are madly building these you know
these crazy contraptions and flying
machines
you have Peter Diamandis key point he
launches the ten million dollar prize
remember in st. Louis and ten million
dollars for the first team that can
build a fly a manned rocket to the start
of space minor detail he didn't have the
10 million dollars when he announced
this very bold so he goes on this as
people are building you know these these
these Rockets he is knocking on doors
he's told no 150 times you know why
isn't NASA doing this what if someone
dies risk-averse there's Elon Musk on
the left side in the baseball cap he
talks to Elon he talks to Jeff Bezos he
talks to Richard Branson finally he
finds someone who was willing to take
the risk I love it that it happens to be
a woman this is anusha Ansari she is a
engineer she had had a very successful
exit with her own company this is anusha
when she's growing up she was a dreamer
of space a lover of space she told me a
fun story about when she was sleep out
on her grandmother's patio in Tehran and
she would pray every night to the aliens
please please take me away this is a
true story so we'll come back to her so
okay the day has come I'm flashing
forward here the buildings the the
spaceships are being built in the Mojave
Desert Burt Rutan and his team including
Dan here they have their spaceship ready
they've built the mothership they've
built the motor the hybrid motor they've
built the rocket they're test pilots are
straight out of the right stuff tens of
thousands of people descend on the
Mojave Desert for these the first flight
to space and then to XPrize flights so
here you have people coming in and this
was they hoped history in the making
this beautiful spaceship one the
mothership the white knight coming out
being pushed out of the hangar in the
dark of night morning very early morning
in the Mojave Desert everything on the
line here it is in that beautiful
morning light taking flight will it work
or not will they succeed every flight
was full of a
the pilots risking their lives their
stories are incredible here is Richard
Branson looking up watching this next up
I think we're gonna see another famous
figure who started this whole
captivating adventure for Peter
Diamandis Buzz Aldrin who happens to be
next to the woman in the sunglasses is
the wife of test pilot and that's a very
special woman there here's Peter
Diamandis with his father everything on
the line watching this Peter Diamandis
his father obviously finally realizes
his son is not going to be a doctor in
this moment though all of these dreams
so here you have spaceship one drop
launched going faster than a speeding
bullet 3,000 feet per second almost
straight up white the pilot white
knuckling it there thousands of people
on the Mojave Desert floor below all the
media there what a spectacle it was on
this beautiful day so there is victory
there is ten years eight years in the
works there are dreams that have been on
the line there is the impossible that
was suddenly made possible after ten
years of hard work of course a new Shawn
sorry and you have the whole team you
have oh I forgot to mention there was a
secret backer he stayed secret for some
time of of the Scaled Composites
spaceship one program and that was Paul
Allen you can see him in the cab behind
Burt Rutan and here's Peter the
quintessential space geek with Burt
Rutan in that moment after victory was
made so dream big changed the world
which is what this story is about and I
was so proud that I got to tell it this
is a great line by Burt Rutan the day
before something is a breakthrough it is
a crazy idea so remember that someone
tells you it's a crazy crazy idea it's
probably full of promise promise and
it's probably something you should be
pursuing
you're just gonna wrap up here so I
don't cut more into Dan's time so here
you have this team small teams doing big
things building the world's first
private spaceship pretty amazing this
girl who dreamed of space went on to
become the world's first private female
space explorers spent ten days at the
International Space Station John Carmack
there I love that picture he's the CTO
of oculus rift he's still working on
rocketry and the rocket boy himself made
history with this dream he said today
spaceship one hangs in the Smithsonian
Air and Space Museum they meet the
gallery of flight milestones of flight
gallery in the Smithsonian and you see
it's hanging right next to the spirit of
st. Louis thank you very much I hope you
take this talk and you find your own
innovations your own ways to innovate to
do great things in small teams thank you
very much Dan come on up all right
spaceship one last time spaceship one
flew was 14 almost 14 years ago but the
story behind spaceship 1 is timeless
let me fly ins but one behind me let me
see that black sky
On June 21st 2004 a privately made
rocket plane launched into history it's
a mission to become the world's first
commercial manned space vehicle this is
not good if successful the flight of
spaceship one will open a new era of
space exploration
forward to see that black sky so how
many here have seen the documentary
black sky Jude okay alright
the the move it was pretty dramatic and
it's almost like it was overdramatized
but notice that stressful there's a
crazy program by the way I'm in awe of
you guys and you guys live in a
different world than I do I'm a
mechanical engineer and aero engineer so
you guys amazed me how many people have
seen the spaceship one in the
Smithsonian or came out to the high
desert to see apply cool alright that
was a crazy time when the little town of
mohabbat rippled by the population by
three times you know I was like it's
interesting time so spaceship one first
non-government manned spaceship to make
two several flights to space within two
weeks going onto windy and sorry XPrize
that Julian is talked about and built
and flown in less than three years by a
few dozen people and I you know for 14
years I've asked how is it possible that
was just an amazing program and the
simplest answer is just think in my
opinion the incredible leadership of
spaceship wind designer Burt Rutan
that's what made the program successful
up to that point since 1972 Burt's
companies had developed over 40
different aircraft types the graph is a
altitude versus airspeed so this is what
we're kind of used to that airplane that
I put it in the upper right corner
that's Proteus that's still being
operated today by scale composites is
about four thousand hours on it it's a
quite a striking airplane able to go
over sixty thousand feet so then Burt
comes to us and says we're going to
build a spaceship
and so that the cluster of points in the
lower left corner there that's the
performance that you just saw it's the
same graph altitude versus airspeed and
you know we were wondering what makes
him think that we have the capability
build a spaceship it goes over three
times the speed of sound and over three
hundred thousand feet you know space we
pretty much figured Burt had lost it at
that point
I like the David Copperfield but uh the
Burt he confidently laid out detailed
steps for what he thought would be
success and eventually went us over keep
it simple well how do you keep a
spaceship simple I mean sounds like
spaceships in her stomach that would be
inherently complex but now there's no
cabin heat or cooling for the pilot
which sounds like ridiculous but the
flight from when it's dropped from the
mothership to when it goes up and comes
back it's only five and a half minutes
that's not that long you know and I
emailed Burt actually last night and
maths Amos the head engineer just to
confirm that that was true cuz it's it's
amazing to me there's no and the pilots
Ward like lots of layers of socks and
clothes again
so so no but no cabin heater cooling to
the pilot small round windows minimising
structural stress and weight maybe not
pilot stress but they've made my job
easier
no pressure regulators for the reaction
control thrusters no active stability
augmentation survey ship once all hand
flown there's no oven tation at all no
throttle it's either on or off yep again
sacrificing pilot comfort no front wheel
you're only landing you're not taking
off yeah that's that's bird I tell you
you know precisely no propellant pumps
it's off it's a pressure fed system no
real thermal protection that we say we
did but not really no separate pressure
and tank the nitrous is actually
pressurized itself at about 700 psi
there's only one rocket motor control
valves and in other words only one
moving part you know and no in fact your
retraction method but it's just like the
Space Shuttle it's a one-way gear just
comes down so I need to do and this
story is one more than there yeah rocket
motor assembly was just glued to the
fuselage with silicon is it seriously
it's just like fun the fuselage walls
are just bonded to the to the rocket
motor so this is kind of a cool cutaway
because it kind of shows how the rocket
motor arrangement is so it's the big
ball there's the nitrous oxide tank it's
a hybrid rocket motor so I have liquid
half just is solid so that the solid
grain is there is the the tube in the
back has kind of leave it off the back
of the pressure intake that's it's a
rubber is the fuel so the valves in
between the two so the way the whole
combustion process starts is there's a
valve that opens up spills the nitrous
set down through the the fuel which is
the rubber lined tube and is like little
fireworks sparkler things that kind of
get the whole thing hot and the
combustion process going the one of the
cool things about
spaceship one those it has to fly
subsonically supersonically in a space
so it requires three different kind of
control systems so subsonic lee that's
what all those push rods
you see in there they go to the control
stick so it's just like your system down
at the local airport the west you go
supersonic Lee those don't work so now
there's electric actuators on though on
the upward tails and on the bottom part
of the verticals that the control it's
supersonically but once you're in space
those don't work because there's no air
so now yeah there's a little like
reaction control thrusters that are on
the nose and on the on the on the
wingtips that can control attitude and
that's just like a blow down there cold
gas thrusters from it's like a scuba
bottle the 6000 psi is that too much so
these are the basic steps that Bert laid
laid out that kind of want us over that
maybe we could actually do this and this
this was the turning point for me I've
been with the company for about 13 years
at that point and I've seen a lot of
structure but I couldn't for so so the
first step which is really critical as
build the mothership as identical to the
spaceship one as as possible and that
was this that's genius
it's just no coincidence that the
cockpit of the mothership looks just
like the spaceship because it's from the
same tools that's from this it's the
same material same windows same
everything as many of the systems were
replicated between the mothership and
the spaceship the navigation that the
pressurization matter of fact we'll talk
about the feathers shortly but the the
pneumatics are racing over the feather
of the same that the lower the landing
gear on the on the M on the mothership
so every time they flied the mothership
there they get to exercise all those all
that structure and systems that are in
the spaceship so it you know quickly
identify any problems really plus the
the pilots can fly the mothership as
much as they want and simulate the same
landing profiles and get used to the
cockpit environment it's just it's just
a brilliant way to get comfortable to
spaceship of course next step build a
spaceship
and then after that it was mostly just
test test flying uh you know they make
sense of course to carry the spaceship
on the mothership and see all the to
interact and then drop just the
spaceship it's it's a lightweight glider
there's no propellant on board so then
the pilots can evaluate how it flies on
the glide it's just a very very
incremental you know test plan that was
laid out that just I get it I can see
this happening is just amazing drop test
and exercise the feather the briefly the
feather is what can folds the fish bone
in half we'll talk more about it it's a
very unique feature on spaceship one
fill the nitrous tank and just and just
release it it's sort of a there is some
thrust but not a whole lot of thrust but
it exercises the whole rocket motor
system far the rocket motor for a short
duration burn is this one it always
makes sense fire the rocket motor to get
high enough for a supersonic reentry
with the feather that's kind of unknown
again to the feather fold spaceship one
and half talked about it first full
rocket flight to space and then now
we're ready for the Ansari X PRIZE just
two more fights we're done almost that
easy
so oh this is kind of fun graphics these
one on the side of the of the mothership
to record each one of the spaceship one
flight so the first two or that I just
the captive carry it wasn't until we got
to to fight eleven that we actually
fired the rocket motor and Brian Vinny
Brian bid he's the first guy to step up
and take the the rocket motor fly and
forever be my hero to be the first guy
to hit the roof the rocket fire button I
put this picture up because anybody
knows the significance of the and number
328 kilo Foxtrot
I'm impressed future aeronautical
engineer the fan here knows what this
300 320 8,000 feet
so the third third from the last flight
the the altitudes of each one of the
flights to put about the airplane so the
third of the last flight 320 8,000 feet
so when that was the first thing we went
to space Mike Melville took that flight
and and now pylon was in the control
room there watching the altitude and
it's just like just barely got to
320,000 feet actually three and 28,000
feet like 490 I think so just barely
over what's to find a space like so
there's a matrix where every pound that
the spaceship went is overweight by it
cuts off like 129 feet in altitude
so after spatial atlanta Burt goes over
to mike it says good thing at a light
breakfast this morning so anyway here's
the breakthrough Burt was really very
concerned about safely in reentering
from space and one one day you came to
him that if he folds the airplane in
half that that could do a couple of
things for him it could I creates a very
stable configuration where it can
passively just orient itself or reentry
now the Space Shuttle an extra 15 in the
60s had it carefully re-entered the
space at a certain pitch attitude
otherwise it breaks apart you know
matter of fact one of the x-15 is did
break apart cuz it entered a kiddy
Wampus angle coming back into the
atmosphere so Burt was very concerned
about that so I came up with a feather
there's so you can be it could be
rendering re-entering upside down
sideways it doesn't matter there's
nationally right itself and the second
thing that's really important is that it
provides a lot of drag so you need to
start decelerating as quickly as
possible as you start coming back in so
it's a very active simple and safe and
no act no active control required this
is the basic profile but once you drop
from the mothership the acceleration the
boost is like a little over a minute
three and a half minutes of
weightlessness coming back in is about
about a minute
the max deceleration is well it's five
and a half G's deceleration coming back
again but only 16 seconds over 4 G's so
set that bad really relatively if you're
a fighter proud of something back
so anyway okay so as we're getting
closer closer to actually flying flying
this this spaceship that folds in half
you know these guys that the rapist gays
in the world to me our test pilots Doug
Schoen Mike Millville peaceable Brian
Binney after I think the role of them
you don't tell him you want to call him
scared but they were curious so I can
sense the tension so I went home built
up I'm really a modeler I like modeling
so I built a model of the spaceship one
that could do a full feather
here's the feather
their recovery
50 roll
[Laughter]
so the next day I took it into scale and
walked past Bert's office hey Bert Bert
you might want to take a look at this
I'm gonna fight on the ramp versus come
back here let me let me take I'm gonna
look at it he says it's dude flimsy it's
not gonna fly
I said well flew okay yesterday so so we
go out of the ramp I put it up people he
launches it for me do the full feather
land and Bert he got so excited he runs
over shakes my hand he says wait right
here not I'm gonna have all the test
pilots lined up so they can watch it was
like see I told you it'd work yeah
interesting also there was a university
Errol professor at the contract that
Bert that thought his feather design was
a bad idea but to go into a fatal spin
and break apart and Bert just answered
to here with it we've already done
subscale RC model testing and it works
just fine it splits which was this but
there was a dinner genuine concern about
supersonic reentry
and that was and that was we started
that was CFD there's no wind tunnel
model ever done a spaceship one was all
CFD or model testing so you know Bert's
management sales is pretty interesting
in that he was able to just paint this
this reality that he'd kind of laid out
in front of us and we just got seduced
by you just kind of fall into it you'd
get so excited and passionate and you're
your believer you know I don't know how
he cast that spell but I've been it's an
amazing a lot of it is it gives people a
autonomy people that he trusts to you
know he also trusted if you have
questions you'll come back to them and
ask certain questions you know but it's
a it's interesting interesting
management style he has he always had to
show how to percent confidence and he
had to especially to the test pilots
but I've never seen anybody work harder
than him - one of the questions I had
though I said Burt I've worked on lots
of composite structure but not one of
the rocket motor backyards rumbling I
don't know what's gonna do to the
airframe and Burt says well it's
suspended in silicon it will damp out
you know and what you're in space the
acoustics don't put you know and
whatever but at least he knew my concern
this is cool picture Parlin and Burt
Rutan in the back my Camaro on top the
second to be at last Ansari X PRIZE and
I guess Julien I like the same same
slide and the milestones a gallery with
the Smithsonian next to the next one one
of the things I wanted to say real quick
though is you know that was 14 years ago
in a while and Burt made a big point
about trying to inspire kids at that
time whenever whenever spaceship-1 was
on public display to have kids come
behind the ropes and touch spacious want
to be next to it during the space
flights a bunch of busses were rented
and picked up the kids and brought them
out to watch the historic space flights
and I was fourteen years ago and I'd
like to think those same kids are now
the engineers that are working on what's
currently happening with space
exploration Bigelow shuttle launches and
these are all version these are all
amazing programs I guess we have time
you want to be interesting to see
spacious one flagon anybody wants to say
hi
this is the economy version
oops attended your role oh well there's
some trimming I think
Oh
my best further invitation here
that's the first to coupon so Dan and
Julian will be doing a book signing
right after this if you want to get a
book you can and then there's also an
AMA session so if you want to ask Dan or
Gillian any questions about spaceship-1
they'll be available to do it after that
