dart tips we continue our tour of the
dart language by taking a look at
variables think of a variable as a
nickname you give to an object instead
of referring to an object by some formal
computer-generated serial number like a
three to six CD to 5a you can instead
give it a meaningful name like password
or response code or home address once
the object has a nickname you can refer
to it ask a questions or retrieve its
data
dartz variables are certainly familiar
and easy to learn but there are a few
cool features like optional types to
show off let's get started here's a
simple dart variable initialize with the
value there are three parts of this
statement var which declares it as a
dynamic variable answer which is the
nickname or variable name for an object
and 42 which is the object itself we say
a variable is a reference to an object
because the variable simply refers to
some object living in the virtual
machine it helps to remember that dart
is a purely object-oriented language
where everything is an object variables
are how you get a handle to these
objects I use var to declare the
variable is dynamic which means that the
variable is perfectly happy to refer to
any type of object using var is a terse
way to write dart code especially when
the variable is initialized with an
obvious value tools such as dart editor
can easily infer that this variable
refers to an object of type integer
however sometimes it's beneficial to be
even more explicit with the types
variables can refer to for example
here's a variable that is not
initialized to a specific value it's
impossible for the tools or your fellow
developers to know what you intend to do
what is results supposed to refer to a
number a string luckily you can easily
say I expect this variable to refer to
an integer with darts type annotations
here's an example of a dart variable
annotated as an integer
notice how VARs replaced by int it's
clear that I'm saying I expect result to
refer to integers if you accidentally
assign an object that is not an integer
to the variable as this example shows
darts check mode will throw an error all
thanks to the use of type annotations
you can learn more about check mode in a
previous video but for now all you need
to know is check mode gives you a
feedback if an object's type does not
match its variables type
so type annotations are great when
variables are declared but not
initialized but that leads to the
question what value is an uninitialized
variable set to you by default that is
if you don't initialize a variable with
a value what value does it have
specifically what is the variable age
set to in this example hint it doesn't
matter if a type annotation is used any
variable that is not initialized when it
is declared has the default value of
null in other words if you don't set an
initial value when you declare a
variable is set to no this is a simple
rule and is not affected by the presence
of type annotations
because remember type annotations are
optional finally pun intended as is the
case in most programming languages
variables in dart have the ability to be
well fickle they can refer to one object
and then another without a care in the
world here in this example the variable
name refers first to the string Bob and
then later to the string Alice this is
confusing because code might have an
assumption that a variable refers to one
and only one object in some cases if a
variable get to reassign subtle bugs
crop up what if you can catch those bugs
earlier by saying this variable should
always refer to this object and that's
final
luckily in dart you can mark a variable
as final which means the variable cannot
be reassigned after it is initialized in
other words a final variable is one that
has been given an object for the final
time and no more object assignments are
allowed if you do attempt to reassign
the variable as this example shows the
code will fail to compile using final
with type annotations is similar as
shown in this example you can use both
the keyword final and a type annotation
at the same time using final is good
practice to clearly mark variables that
should not be reassigned many subtle
bugs can occur when a variable is
accidentally assigned to a different
object the keyword final is another way
to clearly express your intent to your
tools and fellow developers will revisit
final after we introduce classes and
objects and there's this whole con sting
we haven't even talked about yet so
we're not completely done with variables
but we'll leave the rest of future
episodes the short short version of
today's show variables in dart can be
dynamic or typed variables are given a
default value of null unless otherwise
initialized and variables can be marked
as final to ensure they only ever point
to one and only
object thanks for watching my name is
