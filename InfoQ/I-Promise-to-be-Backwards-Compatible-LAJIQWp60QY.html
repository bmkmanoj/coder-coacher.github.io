I'm Brian English you can find me online
everywhere at that username get up
Twitter whatever everywhere I use a
username I work at DNA which is a pretty
big Japanese mobile gaming company we
got offices here in San Francisco and
all of our game servers use nodejs so
that's why I'm here today and of course
we're hiring like crazy so if you any of
this stuff is interesting to you come
and talk to me afterwards so I'm here
today to talk about converting existing
api's over to using promises both
internally and externally and so what I
mean by that is the innards of all your
methods are using promises all the way
down the chain so we've been going
through this process at DNA for the past
few months and so yeah let's just share
it so our team builds a set of common
game server code so that other game
teams can use it and so we have sort of
a an our ad tool or two for building
game servers so yeah originally all of
that code was just call backs all the
way normal node stuff but we started
taking a look at promises we realize
this is pretty cool stuff it'd be great
to have our API is looking this way so
we started experimenting and kind of
fell in love with it and so here we are
today so yeah what one of the bigger
concerns was backward compatibility so
we have lots of game teams depend on
this code and so we wanted to make sure
that they didn't have to move all their
code over if they wanted to using the
new features of our API or anything like
that so backward compatibility was a
pretty big concern so that's one thing I
definitely want to talk about today also
I realized I probably have the only talk
here at forward j/s it has backward in
the title so I think it's pretty
reasonable though because backward
compatibility is pretty much the only
way of moving forward if you want to be
responsible I think so also any of the
stuff I'm going to show you today of
only really done from a node.js
perspective I haven't done in front
front end work in years so if you're a
front-end JavaScript developer use
browserify
alright so probably some of you maybe
most of you already know what promises
are but best to go through a quick intro
I think so let's go through a couple of
the basics so here's the definition both
from the promises a plus spec and from
the es6 draft so promises a plus says a
promise represents the eventual result
of an asynchronous operation alright
that's not very clear i think the es6
draft says it a little better so that's
a promise as an object that is used as a
placeholder for the eventual results of
a deferred and possibly a synchronous
computation so I think that that
definition is a little bit better
because it describes it as an object and
not just as a placeholder and not just
something that represents something
because it is definitely an object okay
so the most important thing about
promises that is that they're basically
little state machines you've got three
states that can be in pending fulfilled
and rejected that can only be in one of
these states at a given time and they
can only go from pending to fulfilled or
pending to rejected and not from
fulfilled to rejected or the other way
around so basically once it's hit a
fulfilled or rejected state it's done
that's the end of the state machine so
the fulfilled and rejected states also
have values associated with them so
these values basically represent the
result of your computation right so in
the full in the fulfilled case that's
just basically the result of what your
function was doing right so if you're
thinking of this from a node perspective
it might be equivalent to the second
parameter in your callback whereas the
rejected case that's your rejection
reason is what's called the spec is
what's its the value that's associated
with that state and the rejection reason
hopefully is an error class object like
an instance of the air class in
JavaScript okay so also I want to point
out that some frameworks some standard
some specs will refer to fulfilled as
resolved i'm going to use fulfilled for
this presentation if you prefer resolved
but just substitute in your mind i guess
alright so I guess the next most
important thing about promises is that
they have a function on them called then
so that's where a lot of the magic
happens that's what makes them really
useful to us for dealing with
asynchronous code so here's an example
I've got at this function get result
promise which returns a promise and so
because of that we've got a function
then on it all right so then takes in
two callbacks the first one is one that
will take in your resultant value like
again if we're talking about the first
value or sorry the second value in a
node callback and the the second
function would be like the first
parameter so more of your error object
so only one of these will ever get
called because again we're dealing with
the state machine it's only going to be
either in the fulfilled or the rejected
state okay so there's this there's this
syntax and then we've got this syntax
here right so we've got then and catch
so the important thing here is that both
of the callbacks in then are optional so
just doing then like this without a
second function being passed into it is
totally fine so I means we're only
dealing with the success case so in the
air case he'll get caught by this catch
down here so catch is equivalent to
running then with no first parameter and
only the second parameter so yeah so the
great thing about them is that we can
start chaining things together like this
right so with then you can you can do
all kinds of stuff in there it doesn't
have to be just really doesn't have to
be just reading the resulting you all be
returning something right so here i'm
reading the result value and then I'm
adding 12 and then just passing it along
and the way you pass it along inside
then handler is by returning you could
also throw an error in there and that
would be that would make the function
that's returned by then rejecting
promise sorry we made the promise we're
dating promise they're real so yeah
that's great so then returns promises
that's that's a very important thing
right there so
also you can you know instead of
returning value can also return a
promise which will basically make the
the promised return by then fulfill with
the same value as that promise there the
one that's returned by getting another
result promise okay so that that was my
quick intro to promises hopefully you
still think promises are cool so if
you're like me and like the company I
work for you have a mountain of really
old code and you know it's not
necessarily straight forward to converts
you know all that mountain of code into
stuff that uses promises all over the
place so I mean let's start from the
bottom right sometime somewhere you're
going to have to use a function that
returns a promise so we can go forward
with the examples that you saw so
unfortunately for us from the node
perspective none of the node built-ins
return promises instead they're all
callbacks though and there are some
modules on NPM that will return promises
but not very many and the standard is
still callbacks pretty much everywhere
so I mean what do you do right wait I
mean we could start wrapping up all of
these api's with the promise constructor
but I haven't even talked about the
promise constructor yet because most of
the time you don't need it and you don't
need it because of some cool libraries
like blue bird so blue bird is a pretty
awesome implementation of promises
written by this guy named Pekka Antonov
now petke is very very big on
performance so Bluebird turns out to
perform very well compared to some other
libraries and it also provides a bunch
of nice little helper functions it'll
help you get going so I mean promises
are in es6 draft right so some
environments will support them they'd
natively I mean you can get you can get
them in chrome but they're like slightly
off spec I don't remember the exact
details but I mean libraries like Blue
Bird and Q are going to be helpful no
matter what because they're always going
to provide extra helper stuff on top of
the spec
so yeah we use Bluebird at DNA we're
pretty happy with it and it's pretty
easy to use like everything in node
you're on NPM install it and just
require it so basically we're going to
require Bluebird and use it as our
promise implementation just like that
we're not going to be like barb Bluebird
equals blue bird or something like that
it just makes things a whole lot easier
so let's see that in action this is one
of the most important features of blue
bird is the function promise if I which
you'll see on the third line they're
basically it'll take any function that
accepts a call back as its last
parameter and make a promise version of
it so here I'm using read file from the
from nodes FS built-in library and just
yeah I'm running read file reading a
file called stuff that JSON and passing
into json.parse so again i can use json
parts here just like any other function
as my then handler function in this case
the fulfillment handler function and the
reason i can do that is because json
departs will take in a great big object
in this case a string and then return
one thing as well so this takes in one
thing return this one thing everything's
happy it's great so it can be used quite
easily as something and then so that's
one interesting thing is that it doesn't
always have to be asynchronous code that
ends up in your fulfillment handler sore
your air handlers okay
so yeah this is permissive I all that's
another useful thing on bluebird /
mystify all is great because it'll take
any object in this case I'm just taking
the FS library in and of itself it'll
find all the functions on it and
basically create an asynchronous version
of them and by asynchronous what I
really mean here is something that
returns promises so you might see that
in some I further slides I'm using a
sick a sink as a suffix on something
that would already exist and the idea
here is I'm just taking a function that
would already call a call back that's
passed soon as the last parameter and
then and just operate that way as if
it's in promised land so it's pretty
cool okay cool so also it's important to
note that functions like promise if I
infamous file as they are in blue bird
and probably some other libraries are a
little bit performance intensive so if
you're doing this in node probably you
don't want to do this like in a request
response cycle you probably want to do
this all its start up during your
initialization time if you can obviously
there's some cases you can't and you
know just deal with it all right so
that's all cool but you know as the
title of this talk and kind of a point
of in Harper down is backward
compatibility right so I mean when
you're adapting your code to use
promises in this way you're probably
gonna want to be backward compatible for
some amount of time maybe not forever
you know depending on how you do your
release is maybe you're using December
or something like that and you want to
push new major release later on but for
a certain amount of time you're going to
want to be backward compatible in order
to make your API consumers happy so blue
bird makes this very easy so here here's
an example I've got some function get
user it's getting some something from a
DB then getting something else from
another DB so it's gotta do a couple of
things that are asynchronous and this
let's just say this is like an existing
function in your internal API right so I
mean now I've gone permissive I to write
so I mean get from DB and get other get
from other DBA sink so these are
functions that I'm assuming we've run /
mystify all on the library that provides
them right so now I've got these
functions that return promises here and
that's great everything's great
returning promises everything's nice and
cool so backward compatibility needs to
happen and notify is the function that
will do that for you so Bluebird
provides this function called notify I'm
sure some other libraries do but we've
spent so much time of glue word that
I'll keep referencing Bluebird so notify
will basically take in your callback and
call it normally like you would expect
in node land where the first parameter
is any areas that happen so basically
it'll be the result of your rejection
handler right and then the second
parameter will be whatever would be
passed into your fulfillment handler
right so the other thing is that if you
know if a callback is not passed to this
function it's assumed that it is intent
on returing that the color is intent on
getting a promise out of it so you know
if you just call the gate user and some
argument it would actually just go ahead
and return a promise so that's very cool
does everything for us we're nice and
backward compatible so yeah this is uh
those are some pretty simple examples so
we have all kinds of code that does some
slightly crazier things it's not all
it's just a matter of you know returning
a promise or calling a call back or both
right there's there's weirder things
that happen so say for example you have
some kind of hook function that you call
inside your function and what I mean by
that is something that will be running
somewhere deep inside your function
maybe a couple of callbacks in that kind
of thing it's just allowing the color of
your API to do some other extra stuff
inside the course of calling that
function so I mean we could just go
ahead and assume that it returns a
promise right it would be nice and then
we could just convert everything as we
were converting before that's all fine
until we try and be a backward
compatible all right so if we're doing
that then we have to deal with the case
where this hook function can either be
returning a promise or calling a call
back we don't know which right so I mean
you could try using you know the premise
Phi function that's in blouberg but
this isn't going to work because it's
already making the assumption of calling
a call back right so it's not quite
there but we're really close right so
this is sort of a simplified version of
the premise ified function that's in
blue bird and it turns out that this is
almost all that we need in order to get
this done right so let's look at what it
does one thing I want to point out here
is I'm actually using the promise
constructor and I didn't introduce it
before because most of the time you
don't need it but in this case you do so
just a quick overview when you use the
promise constructor so you're going new
promise and you're passing a function
that takes in a full fill and a reject
function so basically you can do all the
asynchronous stuff you want inside this
constructor and then just make sure you
call you call your fulfill and reject
functions so the way I'm using that here
is I'm basically taking I'm taking the
function call as it was right with with
the arguments object there and then I'm
pushing on this callback function then
we're just going to go ahead and call
that function right so the colic
function i'm putting on there it takes
an errand result and i'll call you the
reject or the fulfill function based on
the value sorry based on the results we
get back so that's great I mean that's
pretty much all there is to promise if I
but again what we really want to deal
with is also the case where the function
does return a promise and so we don't
have to deal with all of this callback
stuff right so it turns out to be
relatively simple all we really need to
do is take the value that's returned by
the function that we're permissive
fiying and then check if it basically
quacks like a promise right so promises
all of a dot then so we can check for
that there's a few other things we can
do but this is just a simple example so
if it does look like a promise we can
just go ahead and fulfill that and then
the resulting promise will take on that
fulfillment value the fulfillment value
of P in this case okay so one
interesting thing that we ran into with
this approach is that when we had built
some api's that have that notify at the
end right so they could return a promise
I didn't call a call back depending on
how you call it you pass that function
into something like this well then what
happens right because its intent on
doing both and this is intent on doing
both so the result of that actually is
pretty simple when you think about it so
your function is going to return a
promise always right so even when you do
notify and you call it with a call back
it'll still return a promise so that's
what we'll win basically right so doubt
that one over root be returned because
when you call your function the call
back there that has rejected fulfill in
it will only be called at some later
time you know if I'm thinking a node
language will be in some next lib UV
tick or something whereas the promises
return right away so right away we could
go ahead and fulfill it so the first
thing that ends up calling fulfill orbit
Jets will win right because again it's a
state machine you can't go from one
state to another after you've gone from
pending right so that ends up working uh
I also want to point this is a rather
optimistic version of this function like
I said like just checking if there's
something on I called thought then is
not sufficient but yeah this this is
good enough for example all right so
here's our original example I can use
that safely / mystified function that
I've built over here right and just call
that on that hook function as if i was
doing / mystified before right so it's
exactly the same we're just going to
wrap it up with safely promise if I then
call it and that will guarantee us a
promise so that's great now we're
backward compatible both with either
taking a call back or returning a
promise and with the hook function
either taking a call back over turning
promise so that's great so now we have
some backward compatibility it's great
so yeah before we moved over to doing
promises everywhere most of our code
took advantage of a sink Jess like most
people who do all kinds of note or other
code that involves I held a lot of
callbacks we'll definitely have some
experience with a CAS or similar async
helper library
so it turns out you can do basically all
these things that you would do with a
CAS with promises just the same so let's
go over a few of those things so here's
one parallel is a pretty common one
basically you're firing off to
asynchronous actions and waiting until
both of them are done so here I'm
assuming that do something one into our
functions that take in callbacks and do
something asynchronously and
independently so there's no state shared
between them or anything like that so
also I mean when you're using a sink
parallel and you know that these
functions don't require any context you
can just go ahead and pass these things
in right but instead probably you're
going to end up with some functions that
have some context so you have to call
them on the object itself or do some
bind or something like that so here I've
just wrap them up in functions make it
easy all right so the parallel
equivalents or rough equivalent with
promises will be all now all is provided
by pretty much every promise library i'm
fairly certain that it's in the es6
draft so you should have it everywhere
you have promises so here I'm assuming
that I've rats this library called
promise promise if I all so now I've got
these async versions that return
promises which is great so the
interesting thing here is that I'm just
calling these functions in the same
scope that I was in before right so I'm
just taking these and I'm returning
promises and the promises themselves are
being what's passed into promised at all
and not functions that return promises
so that's a key difference and I think
it makes things easier for me so in the
in promise at all if any of these
functions rejects rather than fulfill
then the first one that rejects that'll
be the rejection reason that is assumed
for the entire objects that's returned
by promised at all but if in the case of
success where all of these promises do
in fact fulfill then all those
fulfillment values will be an array
which will be the fulfillment
value for the whole promise that's
returned by promised at all so that's
cool let's look at waterfall waterfalls
a pretty big one this this one was all
over our code before we started
converting over to promises so basically
in waterfall you're doing some
asynchronous action and then doing
another one right after that this
dependent on the value from the first or
maybe it isn't doesn't really matter
also a sink that serious would be the
same thing except we wouldn't be passing
this some value along alright so again
the same assumptions about a library
that we're using your augs alright so I
mean with promises this is dead easy
right the whole structure of then is
basically there to help you do this sort
of thing right so we're taking the value
that's resolved sorry that's fulfilled
from do something one a sink which again
this is a premise file has been applied
to this object library right and we're
getting some value out of it and then we
can just go ahead and pass that to the
second function and return that and the
whole thing returned by this will assume
that fulfilled value so that's dead easy
but sometimes you don't have a set of
functions that you control right or
maybe you do control them it just some
other place that is you end up with the
dynamic set of functions one good
example is something that would do this
is if you use Express expresses
middleware chain or connects middleware
chain right so a whole bunch of
functions get added and then executed
like within a nice asynchronous chain
right so I mean you can use async
serious racing waterfall to do that in
you know callback land so with promises
it's not quite as simple but it's pretty
close right all we really have to do is
use something like reduce and I mean
reduce you have in pretty much any
reasonable newer JavaScript environment
on a raised right so you can just call
that and just use that to tie all the
then blocks together all right so I'm
actually starting the chain for reduced
with promised i resolve
so what promised our resolve does is it
gives you a promise that is basically
already in a fulfilled state so you can
go ahead and just use that to start off
your chain so the result will end up
effectively doing the same thing as this
right pardon me so we take our array of
functions we just iterate over it and
we're calling then inside each one or
sorry we're calling then around each one
so yeah that's that's pretty much others
for series another big one that we tend
to use all over the place is whilst so
here we're basically talking about we
passing in two functions and then a call
back sorry that's three functions i
guess so the first one will be your
condition right so this will be executed
each time a loose and then if it's if it
returns true then it'll go into the next
function executes that do something
asynchronous and then call the callback
that's passed in alright so that's cool
but we definitely want a promise version
of this so you can construct a method
like this to help you out with general
cases right so here again I've got a
condition and in action and action is
the function we're going to run at each
loop iteration if condition is true
right so here I've gone and basically
done a recursive call so in the
waterfall or series example I mean we
were able to make a nice linear tree of
ends we can't really do that in this
case because at each step we have to
check whether the condition is still
true so instead it's it ends up looking
rather recursive so yeah that's that's
all it really is to doing effectively a
while loop in in promised land all right
so I mean here it is an action it looks
exactly the same as like our original
case except with no callbacks right so
this will return a promise and basically
this this should iterate five times and
everything should be great so we found
ourselves doing a lot of this sort of
thing making little helper functions
like whilst and doing something around
reduce and that sort of thing so we put
together
library of them we call it thrush
because it's so I mean Bluebird is a
member of the thrush family so we
figured it'd be some pretty interesting
naming so some of the main or sorry out
you can get on our github page and NPM
install it and all that good stuff and
you can use it pretty much the same way
you would use blue bird because
basically we extend blue bird with these
extra functions so anything that's
available on blue bird will also be
available in thrush so we've added the
safely per min supply function that I
showed you before that's the one where
it'll either return a promise or call it
or sorry it'll take a function that
either calls the call back or returns a
promise and make sure that for sure it
will return a promise we have a function
called series which will do a lot of the
stuff that you saw that would be similar
to a sink water fowl racing series or a
sink for eh there's a whole bunch of
methods to kind of wrap them all up into
one and also the whilst function that I
just showed you okay so yeah there's
also a few other little functions in
there that basically we built this to
help us convert from code that was very
heavy on using a sink Jess over to using
while Bluebird and promises all right so
there's a you know depending on how you
design your API there might be a few
other things you may have to deal with
for us a lot of it came from the fact
that so you can only pass you can only
have one fulfillment value and one
rejection reason and not both right so
if you have some function that you know
you're calling your call back with you
know known the first parameter because
this is because it's a success case and
then you know two parameters after that
instead of just the one well then you
might have some interesting things
happen so here's an example of that
right I'm doing get things it's doing
something one doing something to all
nicely in series colic style making sure
to deal with my errors right pardon me
so and then we're calling the callback
with two results and this is this kind
of thing was pretty much littered all
over codebase still kind of is
but this this isn't that big of a deal
right you think it would be because you
know you only need you're only supposed
to have one fulfillment value but it's
not a big deal so one thing we could do
is we could call permissive eye on this
whole thing now bluebirds original
premise ified will actually go ahead and
take those two parameters and wrap those
up as an array and that array will end
up being your fulfillment value which is
great so we what we want to do when we
convert our api's over is emulate that
behavior so that we can use Bluebird and
other libraries that behave just like it
so we would do something like this right
so notice I've taken to the first result
and brought it into a higher scope you
know that's because in in the previous
example right we still have access to
result one in the scope of the callback
of do something too but that's not
really the case here because everything
is all nice and linear right so it
brought result one into a higher scope
and now I'm able to return an array with
resolve one result two at the end of my
promise train so I mean we could also
have done something like pass it along
as part of the fulfillment value but you
know this is pretty easy to do all right
so the result of this again we have an
array of the results right so I can call
that function you know I've got my
results object and there we go it's an
array with two objects in it that's
great so blue bird will also provide you
a function called spread and this is
great because you can take an array that
is your fulfillment value and then just
treat each element of that array as if
it's a parameter to your function that
is your fulfillment call back so that's
great other other than that spread
operates almost goes out to the same way
as then okay so we also want to maintain
backward compatibility right so
obviously we're going to do notify but
now if passed in a second parameter
notify and that's an options object this
is actually a very new feature in blue
birds so you know if you haven't used
blue bird in a while or or something
like that then you may not be familiar
but basically there's a you can pass you
in an options object to notify in this
case I'm using the options spread is
true and what that'll do is it'll make
sure that any
array that's the fulfillment value of
the promise that you're calling notify
on will be spread across the callback so
it'll be calling it back with if there's
no area you'll get null and then the
first element in the array and then the
second and so on so that's great it's
nice and backward compatible its
operating exactly the same as the
function we had before except now it's
returning a promise that does
effectively the same thing so that's all
good so if you write a lot of node.js
code or any other code that does a lot
of asynchronous stuff you know that your
stack traces are not as great as they
could be right in node you're going to
end up with things that stop it like
what is next to call back something like
that and it's not great right so like
here's an example of a function that
does a does something asynchronous does
a couple of things in some then I just
come by to put them in but anyway
somewhere along the line we've got it
then that throws in errors so that will
create a rejecting promise and then
we've got a catch rejection handler
there that will just go ahead and log
the stack so I mean when you run this
you know assuming there's actually
something in those then blocks all
you're going to end up with the stack
trace it looks something like this so in
the interest of making this fit on the
slide I replace the big long references
to like locations in blue bird within
blue bird blue bird is pretty crazy in
terms of how many stack frames two dads
so you end up with some very ugly stack
traces this way and again it stops
before you even see like where this do
something a sink was called right you
don't see that at all you see is here
test us 59 that's that's where the air
was actually thrown so it's not really
enough information so you can actually
tweak Bluebird a little bit and the
result of this is you get from previous
events so blue bird will actually tie
asynchronous things together and remove
itself from your stack traces so you get
some nice output so here is showing me
test us one aunt Astra has five in here
so those are two sites that are relevant
to the code here right so line 1 and
line 5 are where things have happened so
that's great actually has some useful
information now so you can activate this
in node by setting an environment
variable Bluebird underscore debug
equals 1 or if you're in a browser or
just you don't want to mess around with
environment variables you can just call
promise long stack traces and that will
do the same thing for you and you can
get all that set trace data okay so when
we did this when we made this conversion
obviously we have to take testing into
account now we use mocha like I'm sure a
lot of you do and what we found the
easiest thing to do was is double our
tests so for every thing that was
testing some code that was a synchronous
we have two versions of our test code
we'd have one that was all call back
style and one that was all promise style
and the advantage of that is that now
we're absolutely sure that both sets of
API is work and we're still backward
compatible so that's definitely
something to do and the other thing is
if you have any plans on removing the
callback cell of your api we may or may
not we don't know it may not be a good
idea who knows but if you do have such a
plan then it's very easy to just go
ahead and delete that whole set of tests
just by keeping them nice and separate
but making sure is two of them but there
are some weird quirks in mocha in
particular so if you're using mocha with
the version less than one point 18.0 I
you're not going to be able to do the
cool things you can do in later versions
so it would be great to just pass it or
just return a promise and then you know
if it fulfills correctly then it's a
pass and then if it rejects then it's a
failure we can't really do that in old
versions of mocha so you're going to
have to treat it like any other
asynchronous code and you know get this
function done and then call it with
notify right so that will make it behave
just the same as any other callbacks
tell code would but luckily in versions
of mocha greater than one point 18.0 or
greater than equal to you can just
return a promise and like I said if you
just return a promise that fulfills
it'll be treated as a success case and
if it rejects will be a failure case
so yeah we we're doing this now we're
using mocha I think what is it one point
20.0 and so we're doing this pretty much
everywhere now so I mean there's
obviously the question whether this is
worth it i mean we did spend a lot of
time going through this conversion
process and yeah it was definitely a lot
of work it took us at least like three
or four months since we started taking a
look at this but i think the best way we
can measure this kind of success of this
kind of project is by talking to the
people who are consuming our API right
and seeing what they think and so I did
have a few conversations with the game
teams that are using our code and they
seem pretty happy with promises they
definitely feel like they're using a lot
less boilerplate code and a lot of them
didn't like a sink Jess some of them did
almost something and they're also pretty
happy with the benchmarks they see from
Bluebird I mean benchmarks can be a
little misleading but but the benchmarks
for Blue Peter pretty good so and
they're also definitely happy with
backward compatibility so we didn't
force anybody to upgrading their code or
side grade which are we want to look at
it convert so they were pretty happy at
doing that at their own pace so that was
a good thing yeah that's all I got hope
you enjoyed
thank you so you can actually grab all
these slides on github it's just my
username Bengals / for a jsf promise
stock you can also npm install it so
this presentation is all in the terminal
right questions okay so the question is
would it be a rational approach to have
a set of code that is all normal and
call back style and then call promise if
I all on it and then provide it that way
yeah it wouldn't be that terrible right
so so I distributed actual performance
now so yeah there's definitely a
performance difference I mean we're
taking things that are not native to the
language not native to the framework or
to the environment and we're adding all
kinds of like you saw all the stack
frames that were added right like it's
not going to necessarily be it might not
be faster it really depends on how your
code is structured right and to be
honest when it comes to performance
you're probably going to run into other
performance bottlenecks anyway right so
but for our sake we just decided to
convert everything internally and inside
all of our API is just because we find
them a joy to work with no so we are
testing stack is basically just mocha
and and sun on so i mean with that stuff
I mean it's fairly easy to make stuff
work it you don't need any extra help us
with that I'll definitely look at chai's
promise though yeah so the question is
like the safely primitive I function i
provide here is fairly similar to what's
in blue bird and you know why doesn't
Bluebird provide a similar thing you'll
have to ask petke know so I had a few
conversations with him on IRC and
basically it came down to its it's
simple enough to do on your own there's
there's no real reason but he sees no
real reason as far as I can tell from
what he for my conversations with them
but for us is it's very useful so we're
really happy to put it in a separate
library and use it that way ok so the
font let's just go ahead and grab it oh
sorry to my list screen here perfect
dose vga 437 yeah okay that was a lot of
stuff I don't know if I can repeat all
that but i think a lot yeah yeah so I so
for those who didn't hear you use
discussing some stuff that he was doing
with javafx which ends up actually from
what it sounds like it sounds like it's
doing a lot or what you were doing not
sure if it was what you were doing what
javafx was doing ok cool so just using
similar stuff to what javafx was doing
from what it sounds like you're doing a
lot of the same stuff that happens
internally in blue bird so yeah well I
highly recommend taking a look at blue
burden and thrush so yeah
sorry one more time this a lot of doors
open okay cool alright cool well thanks
guys
