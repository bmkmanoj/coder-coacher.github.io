cutting-edge features and some great
developments in html5 there's some
really exciting stuff happening and if
you seen we passed out some stickers
I'll tell a little bit more about that
than and when we get to that so first of
all introduction my name is Peter
lubbers I'm as you can see for my
license plate the html5 enthusiast I
wish I had washed my car before a guy
kawasaki took a picture of it and then
put like 200 2 comments on it so I work
at Google I am a program manager in the
google chrome developer relations team
and mainly working on html5 and the open
web platform and we'll talk a little bit
more about them so before we get started
I think most of you are pretty familiar
with html5 by now you've heard a lot
about it and 805 at the high level just
to take one quick step back you can
define as sort of the combination of
HTML CSS and JavaScript different API is
that make up great web applications it's
mostly featured mostly revolves around
the building of web applications not
just static website pages and to do that
you have all these different feature
areas and they can work really well
together so you have things like the
mark-up offline and storage you have
connectivity and real-time features you
have performance specific features you
have multimedia all of those things
combined make for some really exciting
applications and if we're looking at
when html5 will finally be done there's
some news I mean up until now we've had
we've been talking about 2022 that's a
date that's been through
around a lot and often people would say
oh my god it's never going to be done
and that's actually just recently has
changed so there's a new plan to
actually finish and by finished we mean
putting it in a recommendation stage by
the end of 2014 and then HTML 5.1 by the
end of 2016 so that still doesn't change
that much in what you're doing on a
day-to-day basis but just to give you a
sense that I think there is a definite
sense of urgency with 2022 being so far
out that it was like well who cares
we'll just have to focus on what's
really working but now there's a more
modular approach even than before and
that's the plan so what does the cutting
edge look like now if you go to this
town in England then this is the statue
of the cutting edge but for us here in
San Francisco the cutting edge where the
bleeding edge really often looks like
that it has a lot of red in it
appropriately and so typically you might
find a feature that is only available in
one or two browsers and it can be all
the different kind of browser and that's
usually a sort of an experimental
feature something you can turn on but
the flag or something especially the
special build of a browser that you can
take and try it out in and then if that
has legs then often you'll find out our
browsers picking it up and that's how it
moved forward now this is as it happens
to be Web Audio I'll talk a little bit
more about Web Audio later the thing
here is that the audio and it's not this
different from audio element the audio
element was in a similar stage only like
three to four years ago so often by
looking at the sort of cutting-edge
features you can find that that's
basically looking at the future all
right now to turn on these cutting-edge
features so there's a couple of things
you can do one of the first ones
is here so you can go to for example if
you're using chrome you can go to Chrome
flags and that has the old this whole
list of experiment so chrome flags and
I'll share the slides and they have the
URL on it you guys there's a whole bunch
of experiments you can turn on I don't
suggest turning all of them on actually
Paul Irish wrote a little script to turn
them all on when you're in the console
with it that crash the browser so in
addition I would say use all of the
browser's right so download latest copy
of Firefox and there's a special build
that's called the Aurora build that has
sort of that's the latest in
cutting-edge same for opera opera up
next you can get the latest version of
ie so try things out in all the
different browsers and all the different
browsers are definitely turning on
different things at different times so
it's good to play around with it like
that now you're probably familiar with
these and these are the resources you
use can I use com mobile html5 dot org a
quirks mode from PPK those are sites
that you can go to to find out a little
bit more about where the support is for
a different features of your interested
in Web Audio try it out then you you
like it in a soccer but where is it
actually supported and then it can be
sometimes a little bit of a bummer that
it's only in one or two browsers but
that's basically how you go about it and
so these sites are probably stuff you've
heard about already and today I'm
actually really excited to talk about
something new in that space and want to
introduce to you web platform docs how
many of you are already contributing to
web platform dogs okay okay so web
platform dogs it's a new website that
was created by all of the browser
vendors and other companies like
Facebook nokia does it all came together
so it's a pretty monumental step forward
it's kind of on the order of like
something like html5 itself working on a
single canonical site for all of web
documentation so documenting that all of
the web standards all of the web api is
reference material and so on but not
only that it's not just kept there as a
single place it's also something where
everyone can join in and contribute so
let me just stop this and maybe come
back to that later it's a we'll just
dive right into it okay so web platform
dot org so that is the main site and the
current product if you will is the docs
so we have documentation and tutorials
this is an effort that's been going on
for close to a year now and it's not
been behind closed doors on purpose it's
just the the different stewards of the
web platform that org try to you know
pull something together that was
reasonably good but then release it to
the public as soon as possible so that's
it's currently in an alpha release and
you'll see that it has the documentation
and you'll find that it has things like
concepts tutorials and then a whole
bunch of referencing from information so
a lot of this reference information was
given by for example Microsoft donated a
lot of msdn content Mozilla donated a
bunch of mdn content Google donated a
bunch of html5 rocks articles so all of
this information together the aim is
that this will be the one place to go
for all of your web documentation
certainly that's not what it is today I
just want to be very clear on that we
need your help so to do that you can
simply go in create an account and then
you're ready to go so for example
okay so of here okay so let's say I go
to a tutorial and every one of you is
probably a subject matter expert in
something so connectivity for instance
there are some experts here in the room
after all this is the real time room so
WebSocket for example you can go and
drill in you'll see an article in a
tutorial on web socket now you'll see
right away to that there are some flags
applied to this so this in this case it
says needs flags but there's a whole
bunch of other flags that you could
apply if you were to apply them now
here's some some content and right away
I can say okay I'm going to edit this
document Joe and edited and I'm in the
edit page I can say okay this is missing
some relevant sections I need some you
know this might be already covered
somewhere as a move candidate so I can
do all these things and then here is the
actual contents just like Wikipedia it's
actually a wiki where anyone can
contribute anyone can just jump in and
edit so if you have an account you're an
editor so we had some really good luck
in the first 24 hours I don't know the
stats for the first week yet but the
first and so this launched exactly a
week ago and in the first day we had
something like two and a half thousand
people create accounts we had over
750,000 pageviews really exciting stuff
but I think what will be really exciting
is if all of you start contributing even
just a little bit right and we tried to
set it up to where anyone can contribute
we created a whole bunch of five-minute
tasks half an hour tasks to 24 hour test
or anyone can with even just a little
bit of time can help out so this is
really the the core of it it's very
simple and those are getting started and
lots of other stuff that you can take a
look at so definitely urge it to do that
and to summarize it's really the
canonical version of the web platform
documentation but with an edit button
right whereas before you might have a
site that has great information you
can't change it right and especially if
you know a lot about a specific area
that's great where you can really help
out I want to talk a little bit about
features I'm pretty excited about its
it's called web intents actually it's
web intents not web intents and which is
a client-side framework for allowing you
to use a preferred web application to
act on specific content types so let's
imagine that you had let's say a picture
on one web page you want to create a
meme out of that so you would download
that picture go to your favorite meme
editing website and upload it finally
you may download that again or simply
share the link so you can download it
and upload it to Twitter or you can
simply share that so that's a lot of
work for a simple process a simple way
to simply take it take an image add some
captions to it and share it that's a lot
of back and forth because these sites
aren't really cooperating now with web
intents you can change that so let's
take a look okay
okay so web intents I'm going to go to a
little application that the Paul Kinlan
at Google wrote for for the specific
purpose the demo the power of web
intents alright so the first thing is I
need to choose an image now rather than
downloading it from some other site and
uploading it I can use web intents to
pick a file in fact when I click on it I
can use a tool here capture browser that
I've set up to actually do that I click
on one of my tabs and it automatically
pulls that in ok so now I can
okay so now that that I have that I want
to share that or I want to put that so
instead of then downloading that file
again and uploading it to Twitter or
sending the link to Twitter you can
actually use a share intent so so far
reviews a pic intent the the share
intent that takes both links as well as
images so for example here you'll see
that as soon as I share that my default
share intent will go to my an
application that shares it on Twitter so
without leaving that page of pooled in
an image i can send out a message
basically a text string that will do all
the work for me so i don't have to leave
the browser constantly so this is one of
them so i can do
ok there's my tweet I can tweet that so
I'm all done now if I wanted to actually
share something like that you notice
that it comes back to twitter you see
the deep integration that's already here
in the chrome canary build notice that
it has here i can say use another app so
the share intent is triggered to my
default twitter a handler but i can also
pick any one of these other apps so i
can share to gmail i can use a bunch of
other apps some of them i may still need
to install so there there is a sense of
trust for these application you sort of
registered those but once that's done
you can you can pick those and very
quickly move around so that's the web
intents ok all right
so first person to retweet that gets
copy of my book how's that ok all right
ok so to do that it's actually a
two-step process first you need to
define in your page like an intent so
you have an intent you have an action a
Type image for example and that sort of
wraps up the intent on the other side
you do you prepare sort of an intent
handler if you will to say ok when that
is called I take action on that so
that's that's pretty it's very simple
and easy to implement and there's web
intents org for more information and
there's also Paul Kinlan biweekly Google
developers live show which is called web
intents Wednesday if you want to know
more information a lot of those episodes
have already been recorded now one of
the areas that I'm really excited about
is all of the different things that are
starting to sort of stream across the
network as well as in the pages now so
we've been monitoring this for a long
time with originally i worked at causing
in the sort of early days of web socket
and before that there was sort of the
regular xmlhttprequest and then trying
to make that stream was not not easy and
there's been an amazing amount of new
types of data transfers of course in the
past that was strings for example when
WebSocket first came out you may recall
it was just a utf-8 string with a bite
on either end and so that didn't scale
or that didn't work for clearly for
binary payload so that was added late
last year that was all added and
browsers now support binary sockets as
well and of course you can get around
some of that by packaging it as a JSON
object but really now we're starting to
see
more and more support for actual binary
objects and typed arrays and so on and
also streams this is literally just
landed last week in the specification so
it's not in any browser yet but you can
actually have an xml httprequest now
take in a stream as a response type
that's pretty powerful that's almost
kind of what we originally wanted with
for example WebSocket the streaming data
of course is the xhr will still be a
one-way stream but and you would use by
a directional WebSocket for for
bi-directional data but it's interesting
where like how fast these specifications
are moving forward and what is what is
possible there's also media strains will
come back to those in a little bit the
media streams are specifically exposed
with getusermedia and then later also at
web RTC they use for example the input
from your video camera and from your
microphone okay so first let's let's try
an example with getusermedia that users
that media streams so getusermedia is an
API it's been around for just a little
bit and it's starting to really be in
most browsers so see here
notice that as soon as I use that at the
top of the page I'll get a warning that
this page wants to use my camera and
microphone sounds is also working great
let's see if I use that then the camera
it's not working let's see if the next
example is working let's try this it was
working in the speaker's lounge 20
minutes ago okay let's try let's try one
other thing see
ok so that's that one is working see so
this is a very basic getusermedia
example it takes the camera I had to
allow that and then I have the access to
the video so make and pipe that the heir
to a video element or can do some other
interesting things with it so let's see
if I can get the other one to work again
one moment
yeah so this is pretty cool like you can
actually move your hand you notice
what's happening in this application is
that I'm just step out of the way before
I hit it with my head it takes the
camera input and it types it to a canvas
on the right in canvas you can take that
and do some pixel manipulation kind of
look for a light and dark and that
basically creates the tracker and that
tracking see fine-grained control and a
little bit of a bad angle but just
something you can do with getusermedia
and while we're at it let's just try one
more time this is an application that we
build recently with Cirque du Soleil it
was launched about a week ago we're
answering a couple weeks ago
okay this is not quite okay you're
supposed to kind of feel like this but
maybe it's the light on this try this
out it's called mophie Conte rave oh
okay at least part of it works right so
as an example of some code that you
might use it's actually quite simple you
use the getusermedia API to get either
access from your video camera or from
your microphone and then you capture
that and you either pipe that to a video
element or you do something else with it
for the sound for example you can work
with Web Audio to change the sounds and
do something interesting with it so
fairly simple now web RTC extends that a
little bit more web RTC is a new sort of
protocol for real time you know web
communication using let's say the video
streams or it could think of it like
skype but in a browser using open web
technologies so it uses the get user
media the media stream that is generated
by that and it takes that and pipes it
over a peer connection to appear so
imagine that the two people want to talk
you can perhaps use a common server for
authentication getting token so that you
can connect directly and as soon as
that's set up you would be streaming
towards each other so it's kind of like
having a server in your browser as well
to to communicate but otherwise that the
main video feed would go through the
central server which would not scale
very well so that's pretty pretty
powerful there's a great application I
don't even think i'm going to try to
attempt to do this right now with the
conference Wi-Fi but definitely check
this out i'll post the slides and it's
it's a little game called Who am I where
you play against another person
and you have to guess who they are some
sites from sort of celebrity that's
pretty cool okay the web RTC in addition
to using the get user media and taking
that feed in you also then need to push
that over a period here explains how you
can create these new peer connections
send your local data over local peer
connection and receive information over
the other peer connection it's actually
I mean it's it's not super simple but
it's fairly quick to get started there's
a great html5 rocks tutorial that
describes how you can create a simple
application like the one I showed you
earlier okay now continuing on on the
under streams there's Web Audio and I
mentioned the the cutting edge support
in the beginning Web Audio is currently
in very few browsers and it's not to be
confused with the audio element so the
audio element that's supported
everywhere I mean we have the whole
codec issue where some browsers support
one codec and others to others but
really thats everywhere and the support
for web audio is something else it's an
API it gives you the ability Chris
Wilson at Google did a lot of work with
this and they'll show some of his demos
he said it really well I said the
ability create rich audio applications
without a degree in audio engineering
because it gets very complex very
quickly so the advantages from that over
say the audio element would be that you
can do a lot more with it and you can do
in real time modifications to sounds you
can send you can connect for example the
sound to something that changes the
sound and then to the output so it's
effectively you're working with a whole
bunch of nodes that are connected and
showed us here in the web audio
playground this is the part that chris
wilson put together
a very simple example would be you get
an audio source an audio buffer and you
can connect that audio buffer to the
speaker and that's if and this is a
visualization of how you would code this
up as well so it's very simple you
create these nodes and then you can for
example add some gain node so here's a
gain node put that in the middle and I
connect this event to the gain node and
then I connect it to the output and I
run it again I can run it with a lot of
gain so that gives you an idea of
what you're doing in your program now a
typical program will have quite a
complex node structure but this gives
you somewhat of an idea that you can
take a sound that's happening it's much
more precise and you can take that and
actually perform operations on it so you
can just give you another another
example here for example the vocoder is
a pretty cool one the vocoder takes you
can take a sound this continent should i
download this new version and then
composition let's cancel it for now so
here's a WebGL visualization of the data
that is being spoken as from us an OGG
file that is loaded already and now sure
now that's pretty cool but what's even
cooler and this is literally just landed
a few weeks ago is a live input so you
can take live input again just takes to
get user media input so allow that and
now it's taking the live input and it's
modeling the there's created a
visualization based on the life input
and I'm putting in here so all of that
pretty pretty cool you can change it on
the fly you can create all kinds of
utter cool effects you can play around
with this this is all on github and you
can hack away on it
ok
ok
so at the high level this is the Web
Audio you create an audio context you
create audio buffers or you can load
audio buffers from existing files or you
can take that live input and then you
hook that up to a destination so
effectively you're you're building out a
node structure of taking for example a
sound running it through something else
based on events in your page so you
might think of a game and this is
obviously the thing that was really
sorely needed for doing any sort of
gaming the audio element would just
wouldn't cut it you could have a game
where a person is standing in the street
and a car is moving from left to right
and you could take that same sound and
perform modifications on it so that it
sounds different as the car is driving
so things like that we're just simply
not possible before you would have to
have all these different sound elements
pre-loaded here's another little demo I
wanted to show you Paul Lewis just
created this arrow twist this is handle
this is a pretty cool one where here's
the live microphone room so now is
creating a WebGL room that actually has
all these particles floating around that
react based on the live input sound so
it it you can play music see how it
reacts in this space pretty cool demo
not perhaps not the most practical demo
but cool nonetheless ok
ok
that's the audio room now the next thing
you want to talk about this web MIDI and
when we talked about having these audio
streams and these audio buffers that
we're taking and connecting up on all
these nodes and performing actions on it
one of the things you can do is use like
synthesizers and other equipment to make
that work and MIDI has been around since
the 80s to do exactly that so MIDI is
not really it doesn't really necessarily
have anything to do with sound but it's
you sort of like a control protocol so
there's MIDI equipment that you can use
to change the way things work let's try
this out so here's a little mixer board
and
they're ok so we're going to go and try
this out here's the whoop-whoop demo
let's see just make this a little
smaller one second
ok
alright so here's the demo that again
chris wilson put this together chris is
also on the web MIDI API he's writing
part of the specification alright so my
my youngest son is an aspiring DJ he's
15 years old and he put together a few
little mix's for this he's very much
into dubstep and with his last name
being lovers he is trying to create a
new genre called lub step let's see if
it works so let's see here well okay so
here's good good turntable now
hold on don't club yet let me just try
this one more time with this little dude
entity okay should be working one more
time with feeling
many times you have to restart the
browser when you add a new MIDI device
let's try that one more time okay so by
the way you notice here that they have
like drag-and-drop enabled so it's
something that a few years ago very few
website could actually do so it's just
one of those things that just evolved
pretty well okay here's the mixture
bullet meeting
so
they're yeah so
tippy Calle Calle mug there okay okay so
fun stuff you can do with these
different devices and so web MIDI web
MIDI think of that more as a protocol
for it's almost like websockets sending
small messages so that an actual MIDI
message is very small and there's the
different channels that you can pick up
on the velocity note numbers and so on
and you can map that all to let's say
this keep this little mixer board and
also there's one final demo here
another pretty cool one is the
this one I think yeah so you can create
whole pianos and things like that so
it's just simple messages that are sent
and received and if you look at the code
for web MIDI of course to do the whole
thing would require lots more code just
to basically map every single key to one
of the MIDI messages but if you look at
it it's basically a matter of sending
and receiving and just once you've got
that all flushed out there's already a
great little polyfill that chris road to
make this work so you can actually see
that in action right now while the
browsers actually have the native
support for done pretty cool so another
cool cool little thing is the the
gamepad API in so you notice that a lot
of these examples have something to do
with gaming and I think out of all of
the different application types games
push the browser forward probably the
most right they need they have very high
requirements so it it helps to to push
things forward and the gamepad API
unfortunately I can't demo it because
it's a you can literally take a USB
let's say PlayStation controller or an
xbox controller plug it into your lap
your laptop unfortunately my kids knew
that was gone for a whole week so that
they said that PlayStation controller
staying at home so I can't show it to
you but try this out we actually created
the little google doodle with gamepad
support so if you go to this URL again
i'll post the slides later you go there
then you can use and then in this case
i'm just going to use the keyboard and
I'm suck at hurdles
okay I'm an ultra-marathoner another
mother's frantic so here thanks for the
tip yeah close that so actually if you
want to see how this is all built
there's a great article again on html5
rocks that describes end to end how this
particular demo was built and it's
pretty cool there's also related to that
there's a pointer lock API where you can
request the pointer not that the pointer
doesn't interfere when you're playing a
game for example if you happen to move
the mouse slightly it can sort of lock
that out so you're not disoriented ok
sir gamepad API fairly straightforward
you check if there's gamepad support you
start polling basically you're
constantly checking see for the input
and fairly straightforward you you you
can pull something like this together
again use a few libraries that are out
there already to make it a little
simpler
ok
ok
the last part want to talk a little bit
about some speed and performance areas
that I've been pretty excited about the
first one is the postmessage now
postmessage not a very sexy API but it's
something you use a lot in a lot of
applications and in the past again it
was just strings passed around then you
start passing objects around maybe as
Jason and stringify and then parse all
that takes a lot of time and again if
you're trying to build games that do a
lot of perform a lot of operations very
quickly then you're going to run into
some problems there so all of these were
not too efficient and there's now a new
way for posting messages if you will
using transferable objects so
transferable objects is zero uses a zero
copy architecture to post those same
messages use that in workers or in the
actual post message call to go to a
different context and the results are
pretty amazing you can get up to 50
times faster than regular post message
using this zero copy architecture so
let's take a look at that you're going
to run a little test and you notice that
I fill a 32 megabyte buffer pass that
around basically the round-trip rate
here we have a round trip of three
milliseconds and five and four so you
notice that it's around let's say three
to five three to six milliseconds now of
course to compare it I need to pop open
on our browser and let's try it out here
okay so in this case it's see the round
trip here took 91 milliseconds and 94 93
and let me just refresh this here so you
can see that there's a pretty amazing
difference in speed and when you start
building again if you start focusing on
let's say those games and other more
high performance applications these
things really start to matter
ok
okay another quick demo wanted to give
you poor performance related is this one
here so here's an existing demo that
somebody created using M scripting so
basically a C++ sort of physics demo and
basically takes these blocks they drop
down and it emulates exactly what would
happen and you can pan in you can you
can see this all from from different
sites so I can take this I can even move
some of these blocks and this is an
existing basically a C++ program and it
was then sort of cross compiled into
using this M script and library to
JavaScript using WebGL and to sort of
the physics emulation and there's a lot
of calculations happening as you might
imagine and so similar so anyway so
that's with five blocks and it's moving
pretty well I just wanted to show you
one thing that we've been working on as
well at Google is it's called Native
Client and it's an open project we're
definitely hoping to have more people on
board on that but here you can so John
mcCutchan was one of the engineers on
that project thought it would be fun to
compare and say take a little bit larger
payload so it took 400 random cubes and
using Native Client acceleration modules
to actually speed up the way that this
works and you can actually hold parts of
them down and move them
you can take blocks and you know wreak
havoc on the rest of the boxes so you
can see that okay so this is using
effectively direct C++ code running in
the browser and it's it's passing that
it's in a what we called like a double
sandbox so it's very secure but its
native client code running and
effectively interfacing with JavaScript
again these post message and
transferable objects are used in all of
this to pass messages back so you're
actually rendering everything on the
client in JavaScript but you're using in
this case what is called Native Client
acceleration modules to speed up parts
of your works an interesting approach
this is a way that some of these games
may eventually maybe better to use that
kind of an approach than to build it all
the way from scratch using javascript
okay so that's just a an aside really
ok
keep clicking the wrong ones okay so
that concludes the presentation now you
may have seen a lot of other things like
okay it's cutting edge I mean we could
spend now two days talking about it
fortunately we have lots and lots of
other talks there's some great stuff in
the CSS area that I didn't touch on some
many many other api's but it had to pick
something also wanted to talk a little
bit about the web platform dogs so if
you're not a member of the San Francisco
html5 user group definitely sign up we
have the largest html5 user group by to
see many familiar faces it's also we
have free we have live streaming events
as well as recorded events so definitely
check that out and the final thing I
wanted to mention is the Google
developers live we've started at the
beginning of the last quarter a new sort
of TV program for developers it's called
google developers live and specifically
i think you will be interested in the
chrome channel of that and that we have
lots of different shows for example
there was a show on how we built that
movi canto raivo application from Cirque
de Soleil so we have a complete
behind-the-scenes look at that just last
week we had 12 different programs on the
air we talked about performance we
talked about chrome applications we
talked about the open web platform
there's a lot of good stuff that we're
pushing through this channel so
hopefully you'll come and check it out
and you can often ask questions live and
then these sessions are all recorded so
even if you miss them they're there at
the same URL for waiting for you okay so
with that want to thank you and I'll
stick around for questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
