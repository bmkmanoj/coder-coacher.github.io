thank you all for coming here today
today's talk is going to be really
different and so I hope you'll give me
some latitude this isn't kind of stuff I
usually talk about but I think I can
keep your attention for the next hour
it's interesting stuff and I'm gonna
begin in a way that I don't usually do
with a funny joke so here we go
it turns out no wait for it turns out
Scott Thompson and I have two things in
common neither of us have undergraduate
degrees in computer science
neither of us work for Yahoo
so I'd like to tell you a story way way
back in the 20th century before maybe a
few of you were born some kids at the
University of Illinois at
urbana-champaign created a multik web or
multi Internet client this client could
speak ways and gopher and FTP and finger
and world-wide-web they added an
enhancement to world wide web called the
image tag which allowed web pages to
contain pictures and at that point the
web turned into something really
interesting there are a couple of guys
who were working about the same time at
the University of California in San
Francisco which coincidentally is
located in this very city and they
wanted to display some animated stuff in
the mosaic browser and at that point
they hadn't figured out how to add that
stuff to mosaic so they had to hacked
the embed tag and the embed tag allowed
them to run a separate application and
instead of having that application be
launched by the browser the browser
would provide a rectangle in which that
applications content could be shown on
the web page itself that was an OK thing
they then went and got a patent for it
and it took a while to get the patent
but it was finally awarded so what do
you do when you get a patent will you
try to shakedown people with your patent
so they went to Microsoft and say you
need to give us a whole lot of money and
Microsoft wrestled with them for a
number of years and ultimately at the
very end
Microsoft lost and was forced to settle
with them thus emboldened they decided
to go after a whole lot of other
companies and shake them down as well
because if they were claiming that their
embed tag patent was much broader than
just one tag that
it actually covered all innovations that
allowed for interactivity in the web
browser including JavaScript so
everything that we're doing and will
ever do in web browsers was their idea
and we needed to pay them handsomely for
it so they went after all of these
companies and we're demanding big bucks
from them and some of these companies
might be surprised like frito-lay
they were going after everybody and
after they've finished with these guys
they're gonna go after everybody else so
if you're a patent troll you might have
some flexibility as to what venue you're
going to sue people at if you are
technically right and have a really
strong case and can express it well you
probably want to try it in California
because jury is here tend to be well
educated tend to be technologically
savvy will there's a good chance at
least one of the jurors will understand
what happened and will be outraged at
the wrongdoing and you'll probably get a
really good judgement on the other hand
if your case is not that strong then you
probably want to be in East Texas
because the jurors there tend to be much
less educated technologically naive and
assumed that since someone brought stuff
to trial they're probably right and
there's a good chance they'll find in
your favor so in February of this year
everybody convened in Tyler Texas and
we're not everybody a number of the
defendants dropped out they decided to
settle and their good reason to stuff
settle for example Apple settled because
the facts of the king of the case were
the same as they were from Microsoft and
Microsoft after a long expensive
struggle lost
you know so what likelihood is it that
you're gonna do better in East Texas so
a number of the defendants decide to
settle with the troll and but a few
companies decide to go on and fight them
because it was wrong you know this was a
bad patent that should not have been
issued and it was being applied much too
broadly
so Yahoo's outside counsel led the
defense in the first phase of the trial
and one finished the trial in the first
phase convinced the jury that the patent
was invalid in the jury invalidated the
patents that was a huge victory that was
great for us because if they hadn't done
that they would have gone after the rest
of you and they didn't I was never
prouder of Yahoo than at that moment
Yahoo had stood up to the trolls in one
that was a great thing so after that I
wondered you know well what should we do
next I mean we had this close call it
could have cost us hundreds of millions
of dollars maybe more who knows and we
won so what can we do from that
experience to try to make the world a
better place I would have said let's
march on Washington let's get together
all of our co-defendants all the
Internet companies everybody who has a
stake in this thing representatives from
all of the open software projects all
the big ones little ones everybody will
and let's get free delay to come with us
and
boy and everybody else that's let's make
it fun it will go to Congress and will
say we need relief from the patent
system you're killing us this is not
working it's unconstitutional this was
supposed to be for the benefit of
inventors and it's not working for the
inventors it's working against the
inventors against innovation that the
state of the art and software
organization today is open-source
that's the smart way we finally figured
out to organize software projects and
the patent system is fundamentally
incompatible with open-source and so I
would recommend to Congress that they
pass legislation which would compel the
Commissioner of patents to review and
revoke all software patents
and that would include all algorithms
all information flow data formats codecs
everything so you know if there's ever a
legal review of something which turns
out to be a software patent that the
Commissioner must revoke the patent we
didn't do that what did we do instead a
month after we beat the troll we decided
to become a troll
so we sued Facebook now I'm not a fan of
Facebook I don't like their privacy
policy which was why I cancelled my
account
I don't like linkedin's either but I
yeah but I think Yahoo was wrong for a
lot of reasons to do this
one is that we created a threat for
ourselves because Facebook not
unrealistically and perhaps not
unsurprisingly decided to get some
patents of its own and sue us back some
so now we're at risk again so we're
adding risk unnecessarily to the
business but more than that we created a
lot of dad will in the software
development community because most of
you do not like patents or and do not
like patent trolls and we were acting in
a way which is offensive to the
community and that's going to turn out
to have consequences but more than that
we issued a press release in which we
said we were hoping to resolve as a mcli
amicably but Facebook was refusing to be
amicable amicable is from the Latin
meaning friendly but we didn't mean
friendly by amical amicable what we
meant was we intended for Facebook to
simply surrender and give us a lot of
money because we demanded it and save us
the trouble of having to go to trial
that's what they meant by amicable that
they were not being friendly in my view
that was dishonest that was a dishonest
thing to say in a press release
so you know their words people have used
over the years to describe the executive
management of Yahoo bumbling clueless
yeah uncool yeah
dishonest no this is something new this
was a new thing for the company and it
showed that company's commitment to
becoming a patent troll
and I decided I didn't want to work for
that company anymore so I left and I
ended up going to PayPal which might be
service surprised I ended up there for a
couple of reasons one is I've got two
good friends who work there and they
assured me this is a good place to be so
on the strength of those friendships I
decided ok I'll take a risk on these
guys also they were very kindly designed
to position specifically for me which
will allow me to do what I would do well
have the autonomy and the resources to
do that and that's a very nice thing
very attractive so that's great so I'm
at PayPal now but I still spend a lot of
time thinking about Yahoo I still have a
lot of affection for the company I still
have a lot of good friends who are there
and a significant portion of my net
worth is still invested in the company
so I would like to see them do well and
I thought about why they haven't and
what it all means and what I would do so
one of the things I like about Yahoo is
that the company thinks at scale it is
one of the first companies in the world
that had to do that they had to work out
the problems of how do you create a
website which could potentially reach
everybody on the planet no one had ever
done that before and they figured it out
some really smart people worked on it a
lot of smart people over the years have
come to the company in order to work at
scale because it turned out that was a
good place to do it and a lot of those
people are still there which i think is
why the company works and why it
deserves to be saved now a lot of people
have left and they've gone on to other
companies like Google and Microsoft and
Amazon and eBay and Rackspace Etsy in a
lot of other good companies where
they're teaching everybody else how it's
done but a lot of this stuff originally
came from Yahoo Yahoo doesn't get enough
credit for the good technological stuff
that it's done for example the first
globally distributed no SQL database was
developed at Yahoo in 95 I mean they've
been doing this stuff for a long time
thinking at scale is not officially in
the company's values management I don't
think has ever understood the importance
of that but you know a decade and a half
of really bad management has somehow not
eradicated that from the company culture
so the company's been in turnaround for
for going on seven years I joined the
company seven years ago just as the
first of the turnaround started CEO
Terry Semel at the my first All Hands
meeting apologized for the decline in
the company's stock price and was
promising that next quarter they were
going to turn it around and he said that
every quarter until they ousted it and
then Jerry Yang replaced him and he said
in a hundred days I'm gonna tell you
what I'm gonna do and he came back in
hundred days later and said next quarter
we're gonna turn it around and he kept
saying that until they ousted him then
they brought him Carol Bartz you know
what happened there and then they
brought on the new guy he barely lasted
the quarter and then he was gone now
there's a new interim CEO I've not met
him I don't know the guy I don't know
what he's going to do but based on the
performance of his predecessors I'm
guessing that he will try to dismantle
all the changes that the last guy
started but he'll try to do it in a way
which does not actually correct any of
the deep problems in the company and
then he will promise to turn it around
next quarter
that doesn't seem to be working so I
would maybe consider something else so
if you look at Yahoo's business you know
what does Yahoo do not and I'll point
out that everybody's all concerned about
Yahoo how they're mismanaged and always
have been and it's not working and all
that you know I was profitable Yahoo has
always been profitable they've got this
nice little money machine that no matter
what you do to it seems to keep making
money it just doesn't make as much as
everybody would like it to it's not
Google it could have been Google but
they decided not to be Google it's not
Facebook could have been Facebook but
they decided not to be Facebook either
so what it does is and this is not
unusual they offer lots and lots of free
services and stuff horrible
oversimplification but they make lots of
stuff and they make it available to
people for free and then sell
advertising and they make I don't know
let's say $1 per person per month giving
away all this free stuff and if you know
how to scale that turns out to be a nice
little business and that's what Yahoo is
it's not in serious danger you know it's
not AIG it's not Lehman Brothers it's
not even General Motors it's this little
company that's just disappointing and
given what it has it should be able to
do so much more than what it does but
what it does is still pretty good one of
Yahoo's problems is that it's organized
into properties they never figured out
how to operate a really big company
you're the company of the size that it
actually is so it's organized as a
hundred little companies that share a
cafeteria and each of these properties
has its own general manager its own P&amp;amp;L
and is operated pretty independently
from all the rest of it this has been
called silos and it gets in the way of
the ability of the company to innovate
and to recombine its its assets into
more valuable for us
so that that's a fundamental problem
it's been recognized for a long time
there's a saying at Yahoo that there
should be one Yahoo so that the CEO will
say all developers it's one yahoo and
then tell their managers and you're not
going to miss the quarter and so the
managers say you're not going to miss
the quarter and so if making the quarter
is not compatible with the one yahoo
thing that we're not going to do the one
yahoo thing and so nothing happens if
the companies also figured out a way to
misuse agility one of the nice things
about agility something hello
if anyone seed sees Dave telling me
missed a call so one of the good things
about being agile is that you shorten
the deadlines or the intervals in which
you're doing work so that you can adapt
and go forward and that's a good thing
but it requires a lot of discipline on
the part of management not to use that
to fail to think through where the thing
is going and so projects very commonly
will get spiraled around and constantly
refined and changed till they become
unstable and fail to ship or if they do
ship turn into something that's
embarrassing that has to be killed
shortly after so Yahoo is now searching
for another CEO and it occurred to me
hello
um okay so what would I do if I receive
you I don't expect this is going to
happen but you know just thinking out
loud where what would I do with the
company so should tell you a little bit
about myself I do not have a degree in
computer science I do have a degree in
broadcasting from San Francisco State
University which coincidentally is
located in this city at the time I was
there they did not have a computer
science program so that's why I didn't
get one we were beginning an
informational science program there and
I actually worked for that program for a
while but I did not get a degree in it
some years later I started a company
called electric communities I was the
first CEO and the last CEO and we did a
lot of interesting things we developed a
fully distributed highly scalable 3d
avatar world many years before
Second Life we worked out a model of
capability security which is now being
used to improve JavaScript and turning
javascript into a secure programming
language we were one of the world's
first companies to do ajax we were doing
highly interactive JavaScript
applications in 2000 on the other hand
during the company's most interesting
phase I was not the CEO I hired another
guy to be the CEO he's really smart and
helped us to grow so you could say I
don't have experience at growing
companies we did not survive the dot-com
bubble collapse Yahoo did we didn't and
Yahoo is about a hundred times bigger
than my company was so
maybe I don't have any experience and I
don't know what I'm talking about and
that's all probably true but this is
what I would do first I would tell the
street that I'm not going to fix it next
quarter that it's going to take some
time so we're going to take a year and
do some rebuilding I expect that
revenues will be down while we're doing
that and that's just the way it's going
to be the street will not be happy to
hear that and we'll probably hammer our
stock price but on the other hand when
you tell them that you're gonna do it
next quarter and you don't they hammer
you anyway so let's try telling them the
truth and see how that works we've tried
everything else so I would optimize for
customer value so one of the things that
Yahoo pioneered was the bucket test
where we could give a different
experience to some tiny fraction of our
audience and we would look at how they
react to that and decide if we want to
make that change for the whole site and
one of the benefits of being Yahoo is
that the audience is so big that it's
statistically significant even at tiny
slivers so that's really good
so we're constantly looking to improve
the value of the site now there are a
couple of ways of looking at that value
one is we want to increase our ability
to monetize and the other is we want to
increase the value to our customers and
sometimes those are compatible but a lot
of times they aren't so given that
choice we always decide let's go for
monetization let's get the quick buck
and every time a CEO says and we're
going to increase revenues and turn it
around next quarter what they mean is
let's push that file over harder that
way and it keeps going over hard and one
of the consequences of that over a long
time is people get annoyed that they
recognize this value but the site is not
creating a lot of value for me and it's
just in my face all the time and
annoying and some people leave and
generally they tend to be younger people
in 10
be more technologically savvy people and
after a while the company notices this
and goes oh no the hipsters are leaving
us what's going on we're not hip enough
and so they start wearing their caps
backwards and pulling their pants down
and you know we're hip hey come back see
we're not stodgy completely missing why
people are leaving so if I were CEO I'd
say okay for a while we're going to turn
it back over this way way too extreme
but I want to start building value for
the customers I want to give them a
reason to come back and to engage with
the company and try to rebuild some
loyalty it's going to cost us a lot in
the short term but I think it wins in
the long term
also we've tried to create a culture of
excellence
Yahoo doesn't have that it has pockets
of excellence there are some teams who
have set up their own values for example
the Yui team I think is an excellent
team and they've been doing after
excellence for a long time sometimes not
appreciated by their management but
they've done good work son the best
javascript written on the planet is
coming out of that team I would try to
make that a universal value of the whole
company everything we do from now on
it's gonna be excellent we just need to
do that I would bet the company on or I
would fork nodejs nodejs is a great
thing and I would bet the company on it
but I would not bet the company on joint
ID I see joint doing some stuff which is
amateurish maybe a little childish so I
would fork it I
I would then give that back to the
community you know it would be
industrial-strength and secured and
designed to operate at Yahoo scale and
we'd make it available for everybody for
free I think would be a good thing I
would decide oh the company so right now
some of the properties are vertically
integrated they've got their own
development teams and their own
technology development they're
developing their own platforms they do
it all but that doesn't work with the
one yahoo thing
so in this rebuilding year I would
restructure so that all software
development will be centralized
providing development services to the
properties and I would re-implement all
of the properties immediately in the new
nodejs
structure and do it as a set of combined
Obul services so that we can finally mix
and match and leverage all of the
amazing assets that the company has one
of the things that yahoo has screwed up
is groups so groups came into Yahoo as
an acquisition 12 years ago and if you
go to Yahoo groups today you're
basically looking at a 12 year old
website it has not changed virtually at
all since then now it has been
recognized many times over the last
dozen years
this thing's old we need to update this
and so the project will get started and
some very bright designers will go look
at it and go okay we're going to
architect a new system or enhancements
to this thing which will make it so much
more valuable but it'll get mismanaged
and then we'll kill it and then a few
years later we do that again and we do
that over and over and over again
turns out groups produces a lot of
revenue for the company it produces a
lot of loyalty because people are in
those groups and will stay in them for a
long long time we want to encourage more
people to come in and have that
experience so I would focus on this one
and do it over again but this time get
it right and listen to our users again
pushing the dial that way try to make
groups at work
and fully integrate it with the rest of
the things so if there's a group that's
interested in sports say it's a fan
group it's integrated with Yahoo Sports
so it's all right there if it's an
investment club Yahoo Finance's in there
so we can take all of the other things
that we know how to do and make them
available to the group's so that they
can increase the value of their groups
for themselves I would fix research so
Yahoo had a brilliant research
organization a lot of it was gutted in
the last layoffs but even before that
happened
research was misdirected so the job of
research should be looking over the
horizon looking at the opportunities
that are coming up and make sure that
we're positioned to go after those and I
wasn't doing that instead they were
helping to push that over so research
was almost wholly looking at how can we
improve monetization this week so I
would build a different kind of research
organization I would be looking for
looking over the horizon trying to
figure out what we should be doing also
using research to help design the
company that I have in mind
an organization but I want research to
figure out exactly what that
organization should be I want to look at
what is the ideal structure for a
company like Yahoo it isn't a bunch of
semi autonomous properties it's got to
be something else I would have research
looking at the management science of
that thing and figure out what it should
be and the evolution path to get us to
that thing I would also enhance the
ability of research to connect to the
universities I would be trying to
encourage research in the universities
encourage teaching of web as
architecture at the university is a lot
of universities still aren't looking at
that they think it's not important
enough for a significant enough but it
is and so Yahoo should be working there
as well
then I would march on Washington and
it's still not too late to do that I
think it is still worthwhile to get
relief from the patent system and I
would bring back Jerry Yang Jerry Yang's
title used to be chief Yahoo and founder
of course and he was brilliant as chief
Yahoo he had some autonomy to go around
the company looking for opportunities
that were being missed or looking for
things that could be improved or things
that are falling through the cracks and
he would go and just take care of it
himself
so it didn't matter what the rest of
management was doing he was busy making
the company a better place unfortunately
he stepped up to become CEO didn't work
out and eventually he was forced out of
the company which is a shame if I were
CEO I would invite Jerry to come back
and resume his position as chief Yahoo I
would want him on my team and finally
and this is the last thing I would do is
I try to figure out what is Yong used to
be if the press wanted a giggle they
would ask Carol Bartz this question what
is Yahoo and she would stammer and get
confused and know you know so how could
you be managing company and not be able
to answer a simple question what is it
if there are a lot of ways of looking at
it there's the the blind man and the
elephant approach you know Yahoo is a
software company and its ability to to
make money depends on its ability to
make software it's a media company
it's an operations company it's a whole
lot of things and if you look at all
those separately it doesn't make a lot
of sense
the last CEO said we're all of those and
we have to do them all well and that's
true but that's not any kind of focus
that doesn't you know that's not
something that we can all get together
on so I would look at it from the
customers point of view and in this case
the customer is the audience you know
and I would ask what does the audience
think Yahoo is Yahoo is where you go now
is where you get the free email and the
free photo support
and financial services and all that
stuff so I would rebuild the company in
the image of what we want to look to the
world because I think there's still a
huge amount of value in that then
finally this is the very last thing
don't forget your semicolons
thank you for your applause was slightly
premature but thank you and good night
hello this this is Doug Crockford ok
sorry ok so we've got a couple minutes
for questions can we do some questions
what do I think about CoffeeScript
I love CoffeeScript I think CoffeeScript
is a brilliant experiment it shows that
if you take just the good parts of
JavaScript and put a much better syntax
on it it's a really lovely programming
language
I wish JavaScript looked a lot more like
CoffeeScript
that said I would be careful where you
use CoffeeScript I think it makes a lot
of sense for experimentation for
prototypes or one-offs for hobbies I
would not use it in production it's not
a fully baked language it's not a
standard language it it's unfair to
require everybody who might come after
you at that job to learn this thing
because it's not a mainline thing so you
just don't use it in production but I
highly recommend that everybody learn it
because there's a lot of stuff the
language can teach you okay so I guess
we're done so have a great show today
folks thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
