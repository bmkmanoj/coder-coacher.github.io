my name is Kent C Dodds and I work for
PayPal I like to start out my talks by
giving some expectations so a couple of
things about what this talk is not I'm
not going to give you a bulletproof
method on how to get rich quick I'm not
going to be talking about money
I'm not going going to be talking about
position in the corporate world that's
to me that's not what is important you
need to make enough to you know pay your
bills and stuff but beyond that that
that really doesn't matter as much to me
what matters to me is is being helpful
in the community and and developing your
skills really well so we'll be talking
more about that and also your mileage
may vary my experiences are my
experiences and I hope that this will be
useful to you but not all of my
experiences will necessarily apply to
you exactly so be careful with that so
I'll be talking about my personal
experiences some of the things I messed
up and some of the things I got right
and hopefully by the end of this
somebody will be inspired and if you are
please let me know because it keeps me
going so let's go ahead and get started
I'll give a brief history of myself I
graduated from with a master's degree in
information systems from BYU in April
2014 that was less than just a little
bit under two years ago and in that time
I've been able to contribute a lot to
the community both open-source and
JavaScript community in general so I
have been invited and spoken
internationally at conferences I do
egghead videos anybody familiar with
egghead you know a kid is so javascript
training videos and I I'll be giving a
front-end masters workshop a couple this
year I've given workshops at lots of
conferences and I I have a podcast
called JavaScript air who knows what
JavaScript air is a couple people those
of you who maybe saw it today the live
show today so I've been able to to give
back to the community quite a bit and
people will often ask me how were you
able to accomplish all this so quickly
and so I I'm not I'm really trying very
carefully not to turn this into a
breakfast but hopefully this kind of
gives you a little bit of context into
what I've done it and this talk is more
of an answer to the question of how have
you been able to do do all this in so
short a time so unfortunately the the
top three things that have impacted my
career and and my my experience the most
are things that are totally
circumstantial and you can't control it
all so I'm really sorry about that but
the first is privilege
the second is privilege and the third is
privilege so unfortunately in in our
world we are so dependent on privilege
to be able to do things there are many
people in the world who don't have
access to a computer I was privileged to
have access to a computer all of you I
expect our pillage to have access to a
computer so you've got that that's good
for you but I I was also privileged to
be raised in a really strong family
where I and in a really safe environment
where I didn't have to worry about my
safety or or my family I was able to go
to a really good school where I learned
a lot and developed the skills that I
needed to you know stick to problems and
solve problems so I and then I I and
married to a wonderful wife who is
extremely supportive of everything that
I do and so I am insanely privileged and
I'm really sorry that you can't really
change your privilege and you can't do
anything about that but I think that a
big part of who we are and who we become
is what we do out of the circumstances
in which we find ourselves and so
hopefully the rest of what I talk about
today will be applicable to you in
whatever circumstance whatever privilege
that you have in your life so the first
thing that I want to talk about is the
importance of learning learning hasn't
made a huge impact on my career and if
you're in this industry and you don't
realize that you need to continue learn
continue to learn let this be your
public service announcement you need to
continue to learn or you're going to
have a hard time in this in
Street and so on storytime really quick
I was working at I was an intern at USAA
in San Antonio it's a financial services
company and I wasn't actually doing any
JavaScript there but I was really
interested in JavaScript and so when my
wife and I moved there just for the
summer internship we got an apartment
that was about two and a half miles away
from my desk so I would walk to work and
I found a library that had several
O'Reilly books that I could borrow and
read and I would read them on my walk
and there was a really busy street that
I had to cross to get to my to my work
and sometimes I would stop reading to
cross so that was good
so doing doing this made actually a
pretty significant impact on on my
career I read books like maintainable
JavaScript which is actually kind of a
heavy book to read during a walk but
javascript the good parts and angularjs
up and going and filling my brain with
all this information made a really big
impact on on the things that I I was
able to to learn and develop as I
started out in my career and so the I I
don't read quite as much now I should
but now more of the things that I
consume our conference talks and blog
posts if they're not too long and
tutorials and egghead videos and
front-end masters training videos so the
just consuming as much as I possibly can
to learn as much as I can and so one of
the challenges with with doing this is
you have so much the anybody else
overwhelmed by how much stuff there is
to learn yeah right you can feel free to
raise your hands I am overwhelmed
there's so much stuff we had to talk
about Elm today I still haven't looked
into Elm and I feel like I'm I don't
know like ancient history but there's
just so much and so something that I
recommend that you do is look for places
that you can find curated content
and these slides are available you can
go to kcd IM / 0 to 60 and that will
take you to my slides and all of these
things have links to them so if you're
interested in looking at the things that
i consume you can look at these here but
and I'm totally serious Twitter I I
totally use Twitter all the time Twitter
is amazing even though they implemented
modal's which like what but whatever so
consume as much content as you can but
even more important than that I think is
to strive to learn from others so you
know wherever you work there are people
who know more about something than you
do and find out what those things are
and and have conversations with them and
if you really legitimately are the
smartest person at your company then
teach the other people because that will
teach you as well so have conversations
with others at work on instant messaging
clients and I know Stack Overflow kind
of has a bad rap because they like
extend prototypes of built-ins why I
don't know but avoid that stuff but
there are things on Stack Overflow that
you can learn from and then co-working
spaces if you work remotely find a place
where you can work with other developers
and rub shoulders with them and meetups
and conferences are a fantastic place to
to rub shoulders with other developers I
don't really go to conferences and
meetups so that I can see the talks
because most of the time those are made
available online afterwards anyway I can
do that in the safety of my own you know
nook in my house what's a value about
conferences and workshops and and
meetups is that you can talk with other
developers and share ideas and and you
know learn from the experience of others
and that's something that you should be
striving to do at this conference so
come talk to me later so I can learn
from you after you know at the after
party or something finally I have a
quote here from George Evans every
student can learn just not on the same
day or in the same way and I think this
is really really important we need to
realize and accept the fact that we are
all different people and we learn
differently
and we learn at a different pace and so
strive to find out how you learn and
then consume as much content as you
possibly can that applies to the way
that you learned so if you learn really
well from blog posts and then find
really good blogs that you can follow if
you've learned really well from videos
then go to places like egghead i/o and
front-end masters in Pluralsight and
code school and learn consume in that
way
and I think this will be really
beneficial to you full disclosure I get
money when you subscribe to egghead and
front-end masters so I'm I mean that
full disclosure but seriously it's
really important to invest in yourself
and in your learning and so don't be
afraid to spend some money to develop
your your own skills so after learning
the the next step in your process of
contributing to the community and
developing your career is to build stuff
I've actually run into people who don't
believe that failure is a way to learn
and if you're of that opinion let's have
a conversation because that in my
opinion is totally wrong and failure in
my experience failure has been a
fantastic way to learn and by building
things this and applying your knowledge
it's the only way to actually learn and
understand so stephen r.covey says to
learn and not to do is really not to
learn to know and not to do is really
not to know and this really if you are
not applying the things that you're
doing then you're going to have a really
hard time learning the things that
you're consuming spending all that time
reading those blog posts and and doing
all the you know consumption of this
information so you need to identify what
is it that you've learned consumed that
you're interested in and then go and
build something that applies to that so
a couple stories are examples from my
experience this is the first ever
application that I built and I built it
at school with a friend of mine
Mackenzie cope and it's spend my sense
calm you enter in a price and it will
send you back listings from Amazon that
that price so it's kind of good it's
it's for like white elephant gifts I
think is what is best for it but yeah I
guess another full disclosure I make
money when you do this but I haven't met
a red cent off of this app so don't
worry about that
but and what this app application taught
me was the importance of maintainable
code because I've tried to update this
app before and no I can't do it because
I wrote jQuery spaghetti when I created
this and it's awful and so I learned a
great deal about the importance of
maintainable code I also shipped a note
server with this application and so
interfacing with a platform provider to
be able to ship the application server
and so I learned a great deal from from
this experience
next is infinite wpm so I built this
when I was learning angular and this is
like one of those fun websites where you
can like look like you're a crazy hacker
and you're like oh my gosh I'm typing
like crazy look at me I'm amazing this
if you're interested this is actually
angular 1.0 with a KO fide variable
names but anyway yeah just like going
crazy and I'm amazing coder but I I
built this just because I wanted to
learn about angular and I want to learn
about firebase and so if if you do this
nice hotkey you can see this list of of
other code samples and you can even
submit your own code sample so you could
say blah and I haven't actually tried
this so hopefully this works but I'll
just do like hello forward and we'll add
the code and then we'll open that one
and look and so I actually learned about
storing data in in firebase and I can't
believe that actually worked but I
learned about angular learn about
storing data in firebase
I also learned about github pages
because this is hosted on github using
github pages and so by building this I
was able to learn a great deal I'm I'm
not even sure why I included this I
think it's just kind of funny because it
says stored on our secure servers and
basically that just means it's stored on
firebase so
whatever this one's kind of interesting
so why is Facebook so slow and popular
and slow today so this little
application is kind of funny you type in
you know something here and then it my
server will go and ask Google and Bing
what they would suggest if a user
entered this into the search bar and so
what
and then it'll highlight the things that
are common between Bing and Google and
so that kind of gives you an idea of
what people are searching for and
indirectly an idea of how people feel
about these things so people generally
feel that Facebook is slow and popular
and then also kind of interesting
why did the wood chuck chuck wood it's
amazing and so what I learned from this
experience was I wanted to learn about
web sockets and so doing this typing it
uses web sockets to interact with them
with the backend and and get me these
these results I also learned about using
sort of unofficial api's from third
parties and so like I I show you all
these things not to say that these
things are amazing
but just to say like these are are part
of the path of me learning and growing
and developing and you need to build
stuff to learn like none of these things
are really all that great finally this
is my final example of building
something but Jean ejs is a library that
I've built a couple of years ago and
when I was an intern at Domo I was
adding keyboard shortcuts to the
application and I quickly found out that
you run out of keys to do different
navigations and things very very quickly
so does anybody know what the keyboard
shortcut in Gmail is for archiving an
email address yeah it's because it's
crazy it's e the letter e which I think
comes from archive V of course and so I
decided you know the way that I
interpret interface with my laptop is I
use this thing called Alfred where I can
search my entire computer you probably
you likely use if you're on Windows
you'll use the built-in windows from
or you might use spotlight and so I
built Genie J has to bring that
experience to the web and then having
done that at Domo we had a hack night
and I implemented this thing that I
built on the side for my learning
experience I implemented it into our
application and actually you sort of
accidentally committed it to master but
I I demoed it and it like didn't really
go over super great I didn't win
anything and I was kind of bummed about
that but Merritt Christensen one of my
hero developers who worked with me other
time went and got the CTE or the CEO
Josh James and brought him over and said
hey like this is pretty cool you should
take a look and he was like oh yeah that
is kind of cool and Merrick said yeah
and this guy's an intern so that's kind
of cool too and Josh was like yeah that
is kind of cool and I said that's right
Josh and if you give me a job offer
right now I'll accept it and the other
engineers in the room were like I think
josh is gonna cut off his head and he
actually stood there first thing he's
like okay and he grabbed a paper slid
slid it over to me with a pen and said
what's your number I wrote down my
number I slid it back to him he said
okay we can make that work and here's
the result of that so building things
just even for fun can actually get you a
job which just knows that was pretty
awesome and now I have Josh James
signature and if he ever become well he
is kind of famous so maybe that could be
worth something someday
so if it's a good idea go ahead and do
it it's much easier to apologize than it
is to get permission now I'm not
suggesting that you go ahead and just
push anything into master that you think
is a good idea because that's that's not
a good idea don't do that but if what I
am saying is if you think that it's
something that would be valuable for you
to learn don't be afraid to just go
ahead and try it and Grace Hopper will
think that you're awesome build a
compiler so Thomas a Edison said I have
not failed I've just found 10,000 ways
that won't work
so again failure is a really key part of
our development of our skills and the
the whole process of building things
teaches you a great deal about the the
things that you're using so you you
really delve deep into okay so how do
WebSockets really work and you learn a
great deal because you're not doing it
right and you need to figure out how to
do it correctly and so I think that this
is just a really great way to solidify
our learning finally and just kind of as
a caution Coco Chanel said don't spend
time beating on a wall hoping to
transform it into a door
so while it's very important to kind of
beat your head against the wall and and
work really hard delving deep into these
concepts that you're trying to learn
don't be afraid to stop and ask somebody
for help somebody who knows because you
can really like do you motivate yourself
and get and become demoralized by how
difficult it is for you to accomplish
the thing that you're trying to do and
so like there there are people who know
how to do what you're trying to do and
reach out to them and you know be polite
about it and look for for help so after
you learn and after you build something
if you really really want to solidify
your understanding of the things that
you've learned and and skills that
you've developed you need to teach it
and share it with other people so
Aristotle said those who know do those
that understand teach and so you can
know as much as you want but without
teaching you can't really understand it
Ashley G Williams one of my other hero
developers said teaching is nature's way
of letting you know how sloppy your
understanding is and this is very true
once once you start to explain what let
and const is to a beginner who's never
used these things or experience maybe
the problems with VAR you realize that
you really have no idea how that
the semantics of those those things work
and then you have to go and figure out
how they work you solidify your
understanding and then you can teach it
so here's another story from my life
right after the first ng-conf which is
held in Salt Lake City it's the official
angular conference i i'm n taste while
at that conference and i was so jazzed
about angular and i thought i was like
you know the the sweetest thing ever and
so i decided i wanted to hold a workshop
for it to teach my classmates about how
how do you use angular and so i reached
out to firebase because like you're not
getting anybody to go to something to
learn something unless you have food
there and so I asked firebase to sponsor
and they sent some stickers and and they
bought pizza and stuff and I was able to
get a bunch of people there and and I
really had to prepare a great deal for
this workshop so that I could distill
this kind of information in a way that
total beginners could understand some of
these people have never even done
JavaScript before and so that posts a
different challenge and if you're going
to be doing a workshop like this until I
totally recommend that you do doing
workshops it's a really good way to
solidify your understanding then
especially with introductory workshops
you need to make sure that people who
are coming to the workshop set up their
environments before they come this is
sorry this is a bit of an aside but
setting up the environment for a
workshop is like or or for a beginner in
general is just one of the hardest
problems in education today and so for
this I created a screencast that
demonstrated this is how you install
node this is how you install NPM this is
how you install git so everything that
we needed for the workshop and this is
how you clone my repo and if you see
this then you're good to go
and so yeah totally recommend that you
do workshops and that you give
preparatory material so you can actually
get into what it is that you're wanting
to do
but by doing all of this I learned a
great deal about how about angular
itself so that I could teach it in such
a way that
kind of put all the pieces together and
this this made an impact on my career as
well because angular has played a huge
role in my experience as a developer I
don't really do it right now but but
angular what made a big difference for
my career and so learning it really well
was what's good but I highly recommend
that you like focus on JavaScript as
well so this is another quick story of
how I got into egghead so like I said
egghead is an online training site that
has bite-sized videos they're like five
minute videos that teach on specific
topics and they're fantastic
and and I learned a lot about angular
from john lindquist who kinds kind of
runs or is the the main author for
egghead and the original author and so I
was building a project that required
both web and a mobile web application or
like a it was going to be a native web
like in a Cordova with angular and I on
it and I got the whole web thing already
and it was awesome authentication was
working great but then I built the
mobile side and it was a real problem
because there were different domains and
so you had problems with the cookie
couldn't be set for the session token'
couldn't be set for authenticating the
user and that like totally just ruined
my week until I figured out what web
tokens were and I this is another
example of beating your head against a
wall trying to transform it into a door
cookies cannot be set cross-domain
I could it can't be done so I beat my
head against the door a wall for a while
and then I asked somebody on IRC and
they said oh yeah JSON web tokens like
that's how you do that and I learned
about that and then I built that and
then I went to teach that and I I went
to a meet-up in the area and had this
this repo and this example of how you
accomplish this and then John this was
recorded and uploaded to YouTube so
everything that you do see if you can
make it like if it's possible for you to
get it up available on YouTube so that
you can benefit more people so you can
give back to the community from your
experiences and so john lindquist saw
this on youtube and you said hey you
read shots when you said hey would you
like to turn that talk into a series for
us on egghead I said absolutely I would
and after a lot of work through the
scrutiny size of John linka sand and
Joel I was able to get a series out
there and now I've got like 80 for
videos on egghead and it's been I this
has made one of the biggest impacts on
my my career and and my ability to give
back to the community is a ton of my
content on egghead is free and a lot of
it has to do with open source and so um
egghead made a big difference for me but
the the takeaway here is try to teach
the things that you learn and take that
whole experience of that teaching and
try to make that public so other people
can benefit from that as well
Tom ship we said while persistence
offers no guarantees
it gives it does give luck a chance to
operate and so this the final story
about teaching I really love going to
conferences I think it's a lot of fun to
rub shoulders with other developers and
meet new people who have common
interests the problem is that
conferences are not free and especially
if they're out of state and so and also
companies aren't really interested in
sending you 2 million conferences
because they want you to actually work
go figure
so the companies are interested to send
you to a conference if you can represent
them at that conference by the way I
work for PayPal and so I I decided ok if
I want to go and in most conferences
could and and should and do pay for
speakers to travel and to attend the
conference and to stay there and so it's
pretty much mostly free for if you're
speaking at a conference
so I decided okay if I want to go to all
the conferences that I want to I need to
try and find a way to speak
and and to share that you know the
experiences that I've had so something
that I do is I take the workshop or the
the meet up talks that I've given and I
think of other things that I've learned
and I feel like I could teach
confidently and I make a whole bunch of
talk proposals and like at the beginning
of the year whenever and then I identify
all the conference's that I'd like to
speak at so I go to lanyard calm or or
there a couple Twitter accounts that
I'll link at the end of the slides but I
identify all the conference's that I'd
be interested in speaking at and then I
just like blast them with all my
proposals anything that's relevant don't
like send you know how do you use the
canvas API to a SAS conference like
don't do that
but blast them with with any like
anything that's relevant to their
conference and that you feel like you
can you can present in you know like
confidently and and then you might get
lucky basically and that's that's been
my experience my first conference that I
gave out of state I got lucky I was the
replacement for somebody who dropped out
in fact this very talk I was actually a
replacement for somebody who dropped out
so sorry you're getting the dregs right
here but and like as an example ng-conf
last year I really really really wanted
to speak at ng-conf and so and I didn't
get a ticket so like the only way I
could get there is is to to speak at
ng-conf and so I submitted like eight
proposals they were solid proposals all
of them and I could speak on all's and
confidently but I just like blast them
and I got five minutes a five minute
lightening talk and it was it was great
and I was able to go and yeah it was a
lot of fun
so if conference speaking is something
that you want to do then don't be afraid
to just totally watch them they love it
I've never had a conference that said
hey like could you stop proposing I hope
that I don't so the other thing is free
99 so what I mean by this I don't have
any cool quotes that talk about making
stuff free but do as much as you can to
give to the community and when you give
to the community
community gives back and it's so
incredibly rewarding I'm not saying like
the community's gonna pay you money or
anything that's not what I'm motivated
by I'm motivated by when people tell me
that what I've done has been helpful for
them and saved them a great deal of time
one of the my favorite parts about
open-source is that I can spend five
hours working on adding a feature or
fixing a bug and it saves hundreds of
developers thousands of our cumulative
hours trying to solve that same issue in
their own applications so that is an
incredibly rewarding experience and so I
encourage you all to get into open
source and you know feel the love from
from that wonderful feeling so do
everything that you can to just blast
the community with with good content and
yeah and then like Buy in so doing that
like whatever it is that you if you are
really just kind of motivated by money
that really will get you recognized in
the community and I've gotten jobs from
my experience giving back to the
community so don't be afraid to try this
is Wayne Gretzky he said you'll always
miss 100% of the shots you don't take
so if if you think oh I kind of want to
start this Meetup but like I'm not good
enough to start a meet-up like I don't
know anything or I kind of want to start
this podcast but I don't know anything
about podcasting or whatever or I kind
of want to do this workshop and I want
to ask somebody to sponsor but like
asking somebody for money are you King
don't be afraid to try because you don't
know whether or not it will be a failure
until it actually is and that failure is
going to teach you a great deal and so
yeah just give it a shot you'll be
surprised what you can accomplish and
what you can give to the community and
and how that will impact your career so
this is my father-in-law so take that
for what it's worth but I think my
father-in-law is the bomb and he said he
often will ask the question Kent is it
more important to be smart or to be a
hard worker and he asserts that it's
more important to be a hard worker and
then who asked is it more important to
be a hard worker or to be nice
and he says it's more important to be
nice so you can be the smartest person
in the world but be a total jerk and not
work hard and nobody wants to work with
you and you can be them you know you and
smart enough and a really really hard
worker
but if you're not nice nobody wants to
work with you either
and that's not going to be helped very
helpful for you in your career so really
you need to focus a great deal if you
have a hard time being nice and if
you're always trolling people then see
what you can do to to stop that habit
because people appreciate and listen to
people who are nice and empathetic to
other people so here are some resources
that I have available to you you can the

to sixty and so you can get all these
resources again all the things that I
like to consume you can find on that
slide each one of those images is linked
and I really really appreciate feedback
on my talks I've got that kind of
personality so if you could go to kcd -
I am / 0 to 60 - feedback and fill out
that Google Form it's really short I
would really appreciate that and that's
it for me thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
