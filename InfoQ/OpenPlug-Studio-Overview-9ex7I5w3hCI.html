name is Alex gabar with alcatel-lucent
you know alcatel-lucent obviously makes
all this 4g LTE equipment that powers
these carriers across the globe so after
Marco here kind of gave you the big
overview of what all this is what is all
this stuff I'm going to hear kind of
from alcatel-lucent how we are answering
kind of that last question there which
is how do you now take advantage of this
stuff what are the tools out there how
do you get access to these api's for the
carriers and really start to build the
apps that take advantage of all these
all this new technology that's that's
now available via the phones so just a
little bit background on myself I came
from a cross-platform company real
mobile I've also worked at mashery
previously with software development
tools company and then previously with
Microsoft so a lot of experience in the
cross-platform mobile app development
space as well as Android so I'll kind of
thread that in here as well differences
between developing native versus the
cross-platform tool that is out now
being provided to the developer
community to build on top of the LTE
networks so obviously the big challenge
there is a developer is you know all the
different platforms to develop for and
then we've all these new things
available to us we've got location so
you will you can now make a p.i call and
say get for this phone number and it
will return back the location so you
don't actually have to use the devices
GPS and use down the battery life to get
that devices location every time you
want to make a location request so
that's one example of use of the api's
that the carriers are now providing to
you and you can actually get access to
something today but I'm going to talk
about where that's kind of going and how
these carries are hopefully going to
start working together so that it'll all
and some projects that are in it that
are actually happening
so you can make your app for one that
will write once and run across all the
carriers but things like the address
book s SMS also carrier billing so you
don't have to get taxed by the fees that
the app stores hold on you using the
carriers there are initiatives there as
well to do in that billing that go
through the carrier API so that the
charge shows up on their cell on their
cell phone bill and the developers get
that money back from the carriers
instead so one product that hope that
alcatel-lucent actually acquired about
almost a year ago now was a
cross-platform mobile app development
framework called open plug open plug
studio it works for Android iOS and
Windows Mobile in symbian it's so it's
really designed for global apps it's
actually based out of Europe such a lot
of usage all over the world with this
studio and it is a single IDE it's
basically in the Eclipse IDE with
libraries built-in that let you then
build for multiple platforms at once so
it's just a UI Frank it's just say app
framework just like PhoneGap roads from
a mobile app seller ater using those
we're using like sencha and phonegap
it's not as copper with that question
great questions so actually open plug is
provides it uses native UI components so
i'll show a demo here in the near the
end and i'm actually going to show you
using the native UI components just to
make it the simplest example of that is
that android phones all have a back
button iphones do not so when you
compile an app using open plug your iOS
version will have a back button your
android version will not have a back
button in the UI and it is it is now
free since alcatel-lucent acquired the
company they took it and made it free to
the world so developers can use it and
so it's it's free to go to open plug
calm and download it it's exactly a
license is free go make use it but make
money bill use it to build apps and make
money and you keep it all yeah but so
yeah so just background open plug studio
is cross platform you use actually
action script for the scripting language
and then JavaScript as well all the
views are done in XM
CSS so it's super simple to kind of get
started with it it does also support
native extensions as well so like I you
know I built an augmented reality app I
had to do native extensions for
android/ios using Xcode and then Eclipse
separately but for standard mini most
apps now you can just simply use all the
one tool itself and then also it's just
getting that that native UI so that was
a great question that's really the main
difference here with open plug studios
it leverages the native device UI
components so there's no performance
overhead of a you know compiled in
runtime or any extra graphics that's
being brought in for the buttons and so
forth it's leveraging the native the
native UI components so these are just
some quick samples here it's been used
for location-based apps to grab location
it's been used for graphically intensive
apps so there's actually app for instyle
it's a women's magazine owned by time
that was built with open plug very
popular and very very graphical you know
wouldn't you know a lot of the apps that
I've seen kind of using the
cross-platform frameworks you gives me
you sacrifice a little bit on the UI or
just takes that much more effort to make
it look that streamlined but open plug
makes it really easy because it's all
just JavaScript XML and CSS makes it
very very easy to make these apps look
very nice so just really quick here and
on the technical stuff it's all
xml-based CSS actionscript JavaScript it
also acts as a plugin for adobe flash
builder as well so you can stall it as a
plug-in for that or you can download a
standalone IDE which is just eclipse
bundled with our yard libraries it can
guess you access to all the device OSAP
is for the location the camera the
contacts really any of it that but again
we're all talk here in a second about
leverages network now to get things like
location supports rest and soap services
so I'll talk to you in a minute here
about the newer versions of open plug
are actually going to include code
snippets that will be for the carry API
is built-in so getting the location
instead of having to get gps it will
actually have a code snippet there for
you that says here's how to do that
using the carrier's api to
save battery life for these apps so the
toolkit you can download it it open plug
com it's a fully contained SDK in an
eclipse plugin we actually one of the
coolest things is that if some of you
have two windows computer only and you
struggle just at least you know
simulating iOS apps and you may or may
not have access all the time too am a
computer it does have a java-based
simulator as well as part of the tool so
for windows development it's cool you
can kind of quickly look at your android
and your iOS version and alternately
sometimes the android simulators kind of
you know slow to load and kind of
difficult it's got one of those built in
so it just kind of helps accelerate your
app development testing it looking at
really quick you have to load up the
simulator every time so here's a use
case we're doing actually in france
right now with the three top telcos
there and i'll mention other once we're
doing with with us-based ones as well
but what we're doing is taking all of
their api's and aggregating them in
creating a med api for developers to
build apps in france and say get
location and it's going to then do that
across whatever carrier it is so it
won't matter that it's if it's going to
orange or sfr it'll just get that that
device is location based on the
triangulation from the cell towers that
already knows so that's kind of on the
initiatives that alcatel-lucent is doing
to kind of make life easier for
developers to leverage these types of
api is it will soon be available as 4G
LTE becomes more towards a hundred
percent based on what Marco showed you
it's still not fully there yet but as it
gets there the these meta-level api's
will be in existence for you other
things I want to mention too is things
like the wholesale application community
is trying to create a global carrier
billing API so that you can just build
built-in in your apps and doing that
billing with with just one API that will
work across all carriers across the
globe so that's I think back apps
dot-com is their website but a wholesale
application community it's not fully I
think it's about to be launched with all
the biggest carriers in the US are
working on the project and so that's
something alcatel is actually also
actively helping to make life easier for
developers
again to take advantage of these api's
so next part is a demo actually so this
here is the Eclipse IDE and this is I'm
going to quickly I pre-recorded this
here just to show you so that you're
looking here is a is the view code for
that for the main page okay and so right
here it's just showing this is a UI
catalog here so i'm going to show you
it's kind of a saint we give you a lot
of sample apps built in so this is just
the view for that you I catalog here and
then it's going to go ahead and choose
the device and then run the simulator so
it loads up right away super quick and
off to wait for it like you'd on the
Android one and you can play around with
your app test it out and and that's just
kind of in the tool now so now I took
this app here and we're just going to
quickly show you that st. the same app
in the android simulator so here's
android emulator and so here's that same
app now just install the APK file and
you can see a running here in the
android simulator as as you know the n
train simulator can take a little longer
to load so here it is so just show you
some samples here so it's nice is this
tool this sdk has all these things built
in for you so accelerometer gyroscope
you know native device components the
codes already there for you so you can
kind of use this you I catalog we give
you to pull these out and use these code
samples and pop in your applications but
so things like popovers and little stuff
you know the the framework contains all
that code for you already so you just
reuse that I'm gonna be simple and so
there is like location in here and
things like that and so in the newer
versions of open plug it's going to
include carrier API calls in that in
these libraries just to make it super
easy for you to pull these in your apps
and take advantage of 4G one thing I
want to mention there's a bunch of
questions about qos so one thing we're
working on is is the simplest example of
qos to be like you have like a video a
video streaming app and what would just
be would be a pop up and say which data
rate do you want to download this app do
you want to download it at you know
120kbps or do you want to download a
small version or the large version so it
really puts the actual the question of
qos into the consumers hands so they
because they own how much data they're
consuming so is as the app developer you
can let them to
use how much data they're going to be
consuming and that's kind of the biggest
concept of the qos so BQ as aware as
well so if that if there's a data rate
or throttling on their account too it'll
adhere to that but from the consumer and
developer perspective that's kind of
simplest example of just letting the
consumer choose how much data they're
going to consume when they choose to
stream that video so let's go the next
one here is so this is just the iOS
simulator and this is just showing you
here I'm in open plug again I just built
it for iOS it's the same app but you'll
notice here the UI is different so it's
leveraging the native device you I so
that was the accelerometer here here's
those popovers same ones you can see as
I just didn't the other one in Android
but it's got the iOS consistent look and
feel so you know one thing that's always
you know important is to for the user
experience if they're an iphone user
they kind of have this expectation of
the shiny blue at the top if they're an
Android user often the apps have you
know the native stuff is a black dark
background so they're just used to that
kind of look and feel so that's a big
kind of thing here the open plug is
maintained that consistent user user
experience across the apps that they
have with their normal device it doesn't
look like some totally different app and
make it make them feel comfortable with
it and then I just did two other quick
examples here of some graphical apps so
this is a another simple one here again
this is a view this is just going to
show some graphics with some popovers
and a lot of this sample code we give
you as well as part of the the build so
here you can see I can select the
different devices here to use for my
simulator and and so you know with the
fragmentation of Android it often
obviously you have to support all those
different resolutions this one here is
loading up for just a 480 x 800 I'd just
be more of a graphical app just to show
you the tool being used for that and
again just this is the Android inter you
know you I here and that will wrap up
and we'll do the next one here which is
just going to do it for iOS I did for
iPad
so basically you would just you know
drag and draw just create your different
graphic files for these different images
and put them in the tool you draw you
can it makes it super simple and then
here would be for iOS so it's a little
different right doesn't load up right
away nice thing with a simulator here it
gives you again it's really quick and
easy I can resize it and then just view
there's the same thing but it's using
kind of warrant iOS look and feel and I
can see the planet information there and
click off and and that's really it so
there's just some examples of apps built
but the main important thing is that
this tool it's a free tool for
developers and more and more and more
and more it's going to be including the
existing code to build on top of 4G LTE
and make it easy to get location based
on the device location from the network
so a lot of these things you know
carriers are concerned about consumers
having their batteries dying and then
blaming the carrier but it's often
because the apps you know pinging GPS
every half hour or ping it too
frequently in carriers are going to
start locking down on that as well
because they're aware they're not
they're getting the support calls from
consumers people are walking their
stores so that's what we're really
trying to help is build provide these
tools so we can help developers make
better apps that leverage the network
and make make consumers network and the
developers happier and make everyone
more money okay so that's it and yeah so
let's open questions again developer
open plug calm is the site you can
download it for free and check it out
but go ahead on the right here the
accuracy of the location so um so that's
a great question so GPS itself like as I
understand GPS we is like developers and
we when we query GPS or on Iran devices
it's you know it's within like a hundred
meters or something right and that's
actually go as I understand it's
actually governed by the US government
for how accurate the GPS can be so like
military can pinpoint you within a foot
to GPS but just the government just
doesn't allow the GPS coordinates to be
that's precise for the general public
for security and their own safety so in
it actually will be more if it'll be you
know
comparable and it depends where you are
if you're in a highly populated San
Francisco downtown where you've got 50
cell towers within a mile of you that
all the triangulation will have that
much more precision than if you're out
in the middle on the highway or in the
middle of nowhere and it's trying to
triangulate you between fewer towers so
it'll vary depending on where you are
but it would be comparable to using GPS
if you were asked for the gps location
is the power usages as much as GPS with
using a location API for the carrier
also know it the power consumption is
far lower because all you're making is
an API call to you know carrier calm /
AP I / get phone number it is a
parameter to get located in get location
and it's going to respond to you with
that location so it's a single API call
so it's just transferring data over the
network the GPS is actually going to
fire up the gps radio on the device if
the person has Wi-Fi enabled location
services turned on it will use the Wi-Fi
to ping wife local Wi-Fi towers and that
uses a lot of power so the whole goal
with location-based services to the
network is to lower that power
consumption sir yeah okay so the
question is you have to have a Mac
computer to create the iOS apps open
plug does actually create the Xcode
project so you get the actual Xcode
project so no you don't but not you to
install that anywhere you'd have to have
a jailbroken device to do it so you need
to then go into a Mac using Xcode to do
the provisioning and and play by Apple's
rules with the udid to get that app to
get that Xcode project installed
anywhere but if you hadn't a jailbroken
phone it would just you only need an
open plug to install it correct yes yeah
so open plugs an apple partner so they
get you know as I understand Apple only
sends out you know betta device or early
devices about two weeks before their
announced and released so it's not much
lead time but we do get as much lead
time as possible and you know with with
that that's definitely one thing that
open plug that's that's the goal and
that's you know part of the whole the
hope product is to be as
quick to market as we can with that so
as new as the new versions come out yes
and like supporting iOS 5 is something
we're working on too yep yeah um the
question is you know he's saying
appcelerator right now has better like
UI widgets support for iOS but not
really that much yet for Android and
they're working on that and so it with
open plug it's we're actually really
50-50 on iOS and Android you know right
now the open plug tool only supports
windows 6 not windows phone 7 so that's
just like to you know we really move
open plugs moving with the market for
smart phones you know and alcatel-lucent
we talked to the carrier's nast them
what what do they want to see and what
do they want to help developers with and
it's just those two right now iOS and
Android but it's 5050 and that's like
that you I catalog I showed you you know
that's got pretty much all the UI
elements in that one little ant app so
it's got all the sample code for that
there to make it super simple and it's
5050 it's the same for both yes sir Owen
okay so you want to in your app push
have a little button make a sound
recording app yeah that would be in the
tool itself the native extensions stuff
is really only for like certain things
that are really really kind of messy
like mented reality kind of is
leveraging a few things but most
standard device api's are available in
the tool so camera audio recording audio
playback video playback getting the
contacts using the GPS if you wanted to
that those there are libraries for all
that code and classes for it in the in
the tool in the SDK so the question is
what's the motivation for alcatel-lucent
to provide this free products like why
why why would I tell want to do this why
did and so that you know the question
that I've asked is why why did alcatel
by open plug what is the reason well I
the reason is and it's a great question
um it's the reason is really you know
kind of as he saw Marcos presentation he
kind of explained the state of the world
of 4G LTE and here's what's happening
here's all you know the freeways are
being built and it's going to enable all
these you know different you know
to now exist subvert suburbs in and out
burger can now exist and so that kind of
kept getting asked of alcatel-lucent is
how are you going to enable these
applications how are you going to enable
developers to know what the heck is
going on with the carrier api's I've
signed up for the verizon API myself and
it was like you know 10 doc documents
with digital signatures going through
the process I mean it took hours just
sign up for their API and and so some of
the other carriers are like that too so
it's not an easy click here giving your
email address and we'll give you an API
key and you can start building sandbox
API calls so we what we wanted to do is
really enable apps and show the carriers
and work with the carrier's to enable as
apps to other initiatives we're working
on with carriers are along these lines
where you know everyone's always annoyed
but with some of the carriers you know
are getting calls all the time right now
from consumers saying my battery is
dying I need a new phone well it's not
your battery you've installed too many
apps some of those apps may have you
know they're leaving services running
most you know ninety five percent of
consumers probably don't know how to
install that you know app juice defender
or one of those apps it's going to
control your power consumption and so
the care what alcatel is working with
the carrier's to do is to help that the
application ecosystem around whatever
device it is android/ios webOS who knows
right we want to make sure that the
consumer experience is good and that
they're happy they're carriers and that
the carriers can provide the level of
customer service and privacy controls
and security that the consumers demand
and so the argyll with open plug is to
really facilitate better development to
help leverage the the network carrier
infrastructure better because when you
know the iphone doesn't work in a
certain big city tech kind of hub in the
world who gets blamed is it you know
you're calling up AT&amp;amp;T and you're angry
because your iphones dropping calls who
are they going to call and get angry
with because they're they're getting bad
calls so there's that kind of chain and
that's why we you know the better apps
the better apps that are out there the
better the consumer experience the
bigger win for but all these people in
this chain here
and that's why alcatel-lucent is
powering all these carriers you know
other things we haven't really talked
about today or like femtocells with
geofencing you know like on you know we
sort of have automatic check-ins right
now with like you know Google Latitude
can do automatic checking this for you
but it's going to suck your battery life
down you know femtocells would then
allow maybe you know a femtocell
location would then ping when this foot
when this device phone number or device
ID gets within this femtocell geofence
then ping to this server and let them
know that they're there and then do this
so for you know a very localized
couponing that would work but if you do
that with using the device GPS you're
going to suck down the battery so these
are the kinds of things that you know
alcatel wants to help the carrier's
provide better cell phone you know
smartphone experience to the consumers
and and we're trying to tell you better
you know to help expose these api's you
know alcatel works with the carers to
expose these api's we want to make sure
they're consuming the right way you know
have you know things like certification
programs you know maybe on the horizon 2
for the carriers where you can have you
app can get not just certified by Apple
to be on the App Store but it can get
certified by AT&amp;amp;T as well because they
went through their certification process
you know I've heard of a start-up that's
doing like you know what I'm going to
add app crashes on the device instead of
just saying like appcrash error the bat
pop-up will actually have the developers
email address or phone number so you
know that okay call you know or in
submit bug so it'll end then put do a
push bug submission to their JIRA system
so hopefully that it kind of answers
your question of why alcatel is doing
this and its really to help developers
build better apps and make it easier for
developers that you know want to build
good apps and know what's out there to
make them better and really just kind of
help that and facilitate that if as we
kind of wrap up here you know last
chances but open plug calm is the
website so please feel free to check it
out you have to just sign up as a
developer that you can download the
Eclipse IDE or you can download and you
install you download one file it'll ask
if you want install it as a
flash builder plug-in or if you want to
install the standalone and then go ahead
and start playing with it the cool it
runs on Windows and Mac I just had the
recordings on a Windows machine here but
we run it on both and you know feel free
to play with it and then you know that's
where to kind of keep an eye on what the
carriers are going to be doing we are
working Alcatel's working with several
carriers you know not just the French
ones we showed there but several
carriers around the globe to bring in
their api's into the tool so we are
considering possibly releasing open plug
as some carriers are looking to maybe
white you know white label it and say
here is our developer tool for
cross-platform development we've got a
lot of code built in here to access our
new 4G LTE api's and build those into
the tool if nothing else just to help
you and learn how to build these apps
and take advantage of those carry api's
and make it simpler and easier to get on
board and that's kind of what the tools
alright thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
