don't know where he is maybe it's just
still the time for the demo part
directly so what we do is so called
Michaela it's a online cloud-based html5
animation platform basically we create
HTML 5 animation in the cloud you don't
need to download or install anything and
it just open your browser start working
them okay Nick html5 and measure as you
can imagine mini mini platform support
html5 including 2002 point three billion
smart devices like including smartphone
in the tablets today I mean in 2015
today I also learned that actually we
also have 1.5 billion you know a smart
TV connected to the internet so it kind
of the huge marketing device will be
supporting html5 but one single pane 1.4
html5 development is the like a tool
like adobe flash which can help you
easily create html5 admissions so which
in turn can turn into many many
applications like games obviously in
advertising tutorial and ebook something
like that so I would directly jump into
the demo part because let's see I can
just click on this this is our kind of
the online environment doing this html5
animation as you can see it's kind of
very friendly I mean interface for you
to do kind of like a flash like
animation we include like layers and all
kinds of the professional star for you
to work on this the animation stuff like
see all this detail something like this
and all see canvas see through onion
skin like options something like that so
I don't have too much time so instead of
the creating things from scratch I will
be just just doing things like showing
some existing demo and then just show
some ideas from there Missy
so this just give you some idea about
what kind of doctor what kind of
animation we can generate it this is
kind of using a purely using our
environment create kind of like our
coding car anyways kinda Chinese were
just saying a happy birthday to E and I
have large gift for you including me
myself it's gives you give some basic
idea what kind of animation we can
create using this idea using this demo
some other things include this is a
typical County in this lecture display
advertising we can create the same
effect as you do for our typical at
Adobe Flash it's basically actually
something very interesting for this demo
is a pay attention to the to the power
actually the skin the body of the power
of the car that is using advanced the
feature called masking use this kind of
a mask layer to mask any image content
so you can get this course can in the
body of the of the of the of the body of
the car this is another interesting demo
it's kind of a hierarchical or simple
base that make sure you just basically
create this car as a symbol and then you
can just use this trajectory or path
based and mission so that you can have
this car moved along this trajectory so
it can keep this kind of a foot or
physical realistic effect this is not a
demo we we need yes is the anyway so
this is demo just to show you some idea
about how you can use is camera motion
to two different things this this
animation is done by using a condom de
first its script based animation you do
this the JavaScript like go to in play
and that's the end of Franco back to
control the playback of your animation
so that you can just for example the
push-up is actually you can just repeat
many times as you want so that you can
just have a precise control what
animation other things it's like
yeah this is the one are we call it as
motion comics as motion comics is a very
interesting one especially good for this
mobile really like I or your tablet or
your or your iPhone or smartphone so so
let's take a look at the the source of
this animation let's give is better idea
what kind of the things is can do let me
first base for you about this animation
yes is that so two things you I would
like to pay attention to is about the
pay attention to this camera so we have
this camera view so you can add the
camera and edit this camera as you edit
any objects on your screen so that the
pay attention to how this theme is
zoomed out in the pen into different
part of the focus on different scene and
also pay attention to this a purple
color which is the which is the
trajectory of the which is the trajector
of this of this detail if you can just
me feel free to edit these curves as
you're adding any other object or any
curve and eventually when you render is
a final rendering you give you the
camera motion connect together with this
part based admission it's very
interesting helpful tool for you to
create kind like for storytelling or
kind of like like that what else yeah I
think that's pretty much a very quick
about overview about what what kind of
thing we can go so for using this is my
web tool to create you know for
animations coverage can turn turn into
many many interesting application
including games so we are also looking
for partners in this html5 gaming
development if you are interested in
snow main in creating html5 based game
I'd like talking of the event so I have
left the remaining two minutes for any
questions you have it's very good
question so uh so as you can also the
questions as a flash developer how hard
it is to migrate into this developing
environment for creating html5 animation
social answer is very easy because we
don't want to invent a new way of this
kind of user experience you just feel
yourself very familiarize with the
environment including such a short car
and the way to is such as the audience
game
and we also have our additional I even
easier than the way you do in adobe
adobe flash like we have I just shows
them like a sparse I editing thing and
the camera motion thing is actually our
developer find is even easier a faster
than developing the flash of flash
environment it's a very good question so
we have a full bunch of the export of
some of the questions that can we export
this animation and upload into a YouTube
something like that we have a bunch of
export option as you can see how you can
export it to single image such as a
specific frame you can export that into
image sequences which is helpful and
very useful if you want to develop it in
your native application like in iOS and
Android device we can also export like a
javascript-based animation into standard
long package you can play anywhere and
also we have this CSS exporting options
with 10 works whole thing into a at eom
domain as a typical web page so as you
can see here we have option even to
export any created animation in do so
called the video in a week we are in now
another version we even have a demo to
just there is one click you can just
directly export no created animation in
the YouTube directly here's answer is
yes thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
