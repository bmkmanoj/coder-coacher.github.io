about is why cradle why another build
system right can you hear me well even
in the last rows so requirements for
build systems have changed tremendously
in the last 10-15 years
I remember when n came out I was so
happy right I could I could finally
compile and jar my stuff up and copy
some stuff around that was all I wanted
to need to do basically and I finally
didn't need my ID anymore to do that
right so that was before test-driven
development that was before agile
development so I don't tell you how old
I am
that was a definitely way before DevOps
that was definitely way before the whole
idea of continuous delivery right and
all this advancements in software
development put a complete new load on
requirements or onto the build systems
right building the jar and copying some
stuff around and compiling is the tiny
fraction of what you need to do when you
automate your enterprise you have a
heterogeneous software stack Scala
JavaScript mobile applications C++ and
when you want to do full continuous
delivery you want to you need to unit
you how many guys you need to you need
to standardize on this heterogeneity you
want to have a standard binary
dependency management for all these
different platforms you want to have a
standard workflow and it's staging that
the software often it's to collaborate
java needs to talk with C++ or
vice-versa
etcetera etcetera you have you have a
software stack that has grown in size
the average software stack is much grow
much bigger much larger than it has been
ten years ago so you have you have
performance issues feedback feedback
cycles are often way too long so when
you want to do agile development it's
even more important to get that in shape
right that means you want to integrate
very often teams that work across
continents want to integrate very often
not as in the old days where everyone
was doing a job and then
after one year you try to integrate it
right so the requirements have changed
tremendously and out of out of those
requirements Gradle basically was was
created the heart of Gradle is doing the
heavy lifting right for for the
requirements of nowadays project
automation and one important important
part of that story is it's the it's the
difference between declarative and
imperative build systems right what what
does it mean how does this affect the
design of cradle I guess you all known
imperative build system in a java world
which is m and you all know in the
clarity of build system which is maven
so who of you is using and mostly for
building java stuff who views using
maven who view is using Gradle thanks
Peter for them so yeah that's that's
kind of the market share we we used to
sometimes end is more than may even
sometimes the other way around
okay so let's start with some demo of
grail and action to illustrate some of
the concepts I will be talking deeper
about in a couple of minutes so this is
the imperative layer of Gradle right you
we don't call it targets we call it
tasks and you can start with an empty
Gradle build script right and create a
task and you can execute it and it says
hello world Wow
there's more to say about this
imperative layer but you have this this
is this is the low-level layer of
Kreitler
right so now let's say you want to build
a Java project right well you could now
do it the end way compile task create a
compile task a process resources task
test tasks etc but you have a more
collaborative way of doing this right so
here we have a Java project production
code lives in sauce main Java test code
lives in sauce test Java some might
notice pattern and okay what can we do
well we can't a cradle hey cradle this
is a Java project
and if we now ask Cradle what we can do
with this
oops we have now a full lifecycle of
working with the Java project right
can you read well in the last row
otherwise they are still there are more
seats available okay but it's not
impossible to read okay so you have a
full set lifecycle for dealing with the
other project you can build you can test
you can compile you can jar you can Java
doc et cetera okay so let's try this out
let's try to build this Java project we
have some compile error well we need or
Apache comments collections right so
let's add that so we tell Gradle hey get
your repositories or get your
dependencies from maven central and we
declare for compiling we need comments
collection here we go run it one more
time yeah another error another compile
error what is missing well J unit right
so we have to tell hey cradle for
compiling and running the test you need
a unit good we add that boom we now
build and everything should be fine okay
so so pretty similar to may even write
you just say the Java project declare
some dependencies and you stick to
certain conventions and everything works
out of the box okay so if we look now in
a built there's a build directory the
convention is that the jaws end up in
the lips directory well this jar doesn't
have a version number
so let's declare a version for this
project 1 0 and let's reax acute the
build and here we go there is now a Java
standard 1 0 dot jar ok now let's add
some requirements the requirement we
want to add is we have integration tests
we want to run as part of
this project right and those integration
tests have specific external
dependencies that are only that only
applied to the integration tests like
XML unity
okay so how would you solve that
requirement with mainly I want to run a
integration test with specific external
dependencies within the same project I
compile my production code and I run my
unit tests maven build masters
provide your solutions right so you
would you would write your own
integration test plugin so the
recommendation as the recommendation
would be create another sub project
right basically the maven way is that
you don't have your integration tests in
this project the maven way is create
another sub project for the integration
test that works right it's just not the
way you want it to do it okay the tool
wins the framework wins another time
right but can be done that way how would
you do this with ant pretty easy just
copy your sorry yeah please
with with an an IV oh yeah and an IV you
could easily solve this yes yeah
absolutely that's that's my point
with an you would just copy another job
our target another copy target for
copying the resources and and then a
test target that executed with IB you
could deal with the external dependency
management and would easily solve this
problem not very declarative right but
you could easily solve it which is good
the absolute quality of end right
it hardly locks you in until things
become unmaintainable right yeah but
that depends a lot also on the skills of
course of and built masters so car
definitely wouldn't accept the attribute
unattainable for the Netflix for good
reasons I'm sure so okay how can you do
this with Gradle well you could do the
end way right you could say I create a
compiled task and et cetera et cetera
but can you can you solve it
declaratively so here we have the
integration tests right source
integration test Java so let's let's
tell it to Gradle hey cradle I have
sources I give them the name in tech
integration tests they live in source
integration tests Java and the resources
live in source integration tests
resources okay and if you now look at
the tasks you see there is an intake
test classes tasks you did right
I could have declared it directly all
those tasks but I have here in
declarative element sauce at intake test
and my declaring I have sources by
telling cradle to what I automatically
get the how what can I do with those
automatically get an intact test classes
tasks that compile stores make sense
without explicitly declaring these tasks
so that that's the so it's a declarative
way of saying I have additional sources
right let's let's execute this in tech
test classes class oops again compile
error after compile
arrow okay couple of stuff is missing a
unit is missing ah or cradle person is
missing which is part of the production
code well in my integration test I
usually need my production classes to do
the integration test right another thing
that is missing is Orca XML unit which I
which I need so let's take ray LaHaye
for compiling those guys I need the
output of the main source set the Java
plug-in is adding two source sets with
the name main and test one represents
the production code the other represents
the unit test and I can access them I
can I can ask them hey main source set
give me your output and this output
should be part of the compiled class
path right for the integration tests
okay now what do I do with the external
dependencies well I declare an
additional scope right a dependency
configuration how we call it I call it
in tech tests and I tell it this intake
test dependency container I should
contain all the dependencies of the test
runtime container which has all the
dependencies of test compile et cetera
et cetera those ones here compile test
compile test runtime they are added by
the Java plug-in and I can further at
dependency containers right so and now I
add a dependency to this intake test
dependency container and then I can
check Gradle hey the compiled class
class for the integration tests should
have all the dependencies assigned to
intake test right okay so now let's
compile the whole thing and let's see if
that works
yes successfully compiled ok let's
continue let's execute the tests right
so we create we create an integration
test task specify the test classes door
saw sets in tech output classes to end
the class pass for running the tests
where we say the runtime class part of
the intake test we haven't defined that
yet we define it runtime class path is
the output which is the output of this
intact test object the compiled
integration test plus it's compiled
class path right that's what you need
running the integration tests okay so we
run them and everything should be fine
well not strictly so where we are
okay let's first see that they are that
they are really have been executed our
nice test reporting and personal
integration test has been executed right
plus person test which was a unit test
so one thing we haven't done yet the
Java plug-in defined a particular life
cycle for a Java project
this integration test task is not part
of the life cycle yet you have to
execute it explicitly but if you tell
cradle built a whole project integration
test won't be executed so the Java
plug-in it's a check task as a life
cycle task to a Java project and all the
code quality related tasks hook into
this check task so the check task
depends on J unit tasks they depend if
you add them on a check status on fine
park tasks you get the idea and now we
tell the tractors hey you also depend on
the integration test task moon we can
now tell Gradle build a whole thing and
yeah everything is built including that
the integration tests are executed so so
you took basically the standard life
cycle for a greater Java project and
extended it with your own requirements
right okay so now this first this Java
project is not a Java library
it is a java application it has a method
it has a class person that has a main
method right so you want to you want to
be able to do something with this
application you want to build a
distribution with start scripts and you
want to you want to be able to run it
from the build script to see if
everything is okay so how could you do
that well I already told you how to do
that again two ways you could do it the
end way create run tasks that that that
that calls the main method create
this zip toss that builds the
distribution etc but you can tell cradle
hey this is not a jar normal Java
library this is an application the
application name is super app the main
class name is orc cradle person okay so
and you see now by adding this you now
have an additional in zip task and
install app task and to run task let's
call the run task the run task compiles
everything and executes the main method
the application basically write the
install app task builds the application
and you can see there's known install
directory with the super app directory
which has a bin directory with the start
scripts and the Lib directory with the
needed with the necessary dependencies
right so and it is extremely easy to
extend cradle to extract the specifics
of your company into into a plug-in and
to share it with the rest of the world
so the application login is an example
how we extend the Java plug-in in in the
cradle cord institution but you could
easily extract stuff with cradle so I
created a create a directory here I
create a file called integration test
cradle and I now go to my build script
and cut out
all the stuff I've added for dealing
with the integration tests and now I go
into my project and say hey apply the
integration test plug-in so and that way
you have defined now your own extended
standard this is this could now be your
enterprise plug-in apply to any to all
the projects in your company and there
is now the notion of integration tests
being part of your normal Java story
right and going back to yeah how could
you do this with maven write it norm the
answer would be create another sub
project which works but that's not the
way I want to how I want to model that
in grading we have integration tests
that are that are testing the whole
distribution they should live in a
separate sub project but we also have
integration tests we have 30 or 40
components right which are component
specific with which only test the IDE
aspects and those integration tests they
belong to this project I don't want to
have a tool that tells me no they must
live somewhere else to score doesn't
know I want to live it there that's
where they that's where the code belongs
now if we would follow this pattern
where that that we would have to create
for every component a component -
integration test project we wouldn't
have in Eclipse nor for the project we
would have any project at one point
that's the scalability thing the Refresh
in Eclipse is not your best friend right
so so we think it's extremely important
that you're able to model the stuff
exactly how you want way how you want to
have it right so declarative yes rigid
no only when you want to be Richard with
your developers you can tell the story
with Gradle but the build system
shouldn't be Richard with the build
masters of the world they know they
don't name on the main better than the
build masters we provide standards if
they suit you use them but you must be
able to extend them and to tell your own
story and now
become basic it's that this lies at the
heart of cradle there is a fantastic
interview a couple of years ago between
arashiyama the gang of four arashiyama
and Bill Venice on our team are calm and
Arish talks about the dangers of doing
frameworks big frameworks right and and
he's saying the danger with big
frameworks is at the beginning it's fun
you get all the functionality for free
but once you haven't requirement is's
that is unanticipated by the framework
you start to fight with the framework
well and you start to lose 100 percent
right this was the case with EJB to
container manage persistent who has
survived this no geez and this is the
case with some real systems which I also
have survived so so what is our answer
to that so at the heart of cradle is a
built language right a toolkit because
that's Irish Gamez recommendation build
toolkits and optional smaller frameworks
on top of this toolkit right a toolkit
that has no opinion with some frameworks
that have an opinion because the creator
Java plug-in is a little framework it
has an opinion it has two opinion two
production code lives in the same
project it's the unit test code so the
guys from LinkedIn have a different
opinion they have separate projects for
production code and unit test code so
and for good reasons that one reason is
they want to have clear class pass in
Eclipse Eclipse doesn't have any class
pass scope right so so how would they
how would they deal with that well if
granted we're just the framework we
could say well just the blood of Java
block in then your production code
project has a test task well but it
doesn't really hurt and your test
project has some production code
compilation step it doesn't really hurt
well just go ahead somehow somehow it
will do the job right and then and then
you hire a new person right and this
person works on a production code runs
the test
hey tests are successful well there are
no tests
right in a production code so he commits
the stuff stuff is broken so then you
decide hey every new developer must get
his build system briefing telling me all
the pathologies all the stuff that is
weird it shouldn't be as it is but he
has to be aware of no no no that's not
how you should model your production
domain and that's not how you should
model you are a bill to make the same
principles of you know of good design
you apply to a production code you
should apply to modeling your bill
domain and in fact there are a couple of
smells if you read the refactoring book
for you can you can transfer to the bill
domain forcing someone to create a sub
project just for a couple of classes
right that that's for me a lazy project
smell corresponding to the lazy class
smell of the you have in your production
code right unnecessary abstractions
etcetera etcetera there's give a whole
talk on that topic so okay but what is
the greater solution right it's the
solution is hey don't use our
opinionated little Java framework right
but don't go back to Adam and Eve to the
lowest layer and now use the Gradle task
to do everything on the low level use
the build language you have you have
very a very rich language to describe a
Java project right sauce sets etc this
is a domain-specific language for
telling your your story for Java
projects right so and with this it would
be very easy to tell the story what
LinkedIn Java project is so integration
test is also an opinionated plugin one
integration test for a project it might
be exactly what you want for your
company but maybe you have a couple of
teams that are saying hold on sometimes
we have multiple sets of integration
tests per project right with different
external libraries now you could tell
tell them or then create another sub
project right no that wouldn't be the
solution the solution would be
extensible you can create your own
language elements
you could easily I don't have the time
to show that
like like there is a source sets element
to declare sources you could add an
integration test element where people
could just use it into creation test
tell the source directory and everything
would be set up a task to compile them a
task to run them etc etc and that would
be the solution right you might have an
opinionated framework but you also
provide a language element for people
that need more flexibility but for but
for them it will be very easy I don't
need to do much copy and pasting they
say exactly what they need integration
tests and that's the whole purpose of of
writing the sls we come across a lot
nowadays of companies who are now using
Scala preferably for creating DSL for
domain expert domain experts in the
financial industries domain experts in
the biotech industry etc etc right they
don't they don't want to know anything
about Scala
they want there are experts in their
domain the same is true for build
systems software developers shouldn't be
experts in build systems they are
experts in what they want to do with
their software projects and you should
provide them a language where they can
easily describe the requirements and not
have wiki pages of the wiki pages or
they have to deal with that so this is
this is or when you can read this in the
last in the last row you'll get this
book but what build system is that
and for some reason where we can you
give you you can realize what it is so
this is a build system from a company
caught emitted logic they do a new
building automation pretty complex stuff
big building automation right so not
home at home not private homes and they
have a hundred plus developers and also
a hundred plus sub modules and they have
a pretty complex matrix depending on the
building type and the customer type they
must assemble distributions right which
are specifically configured so this
distributions take a subset of their of
their components configure them in a
specific way
everything on a CD or whatever now you
speak whatever and ship it to the
building right very high QA requirements
there's no way to easily have a hotfix
right and enter domain which is pretty
sensitive you don't want to screw up the
climate how do you say and you know what
I mean so climate control so what you
see here was necessary for a normal
developer to add another sub module this
was a lot of copy and paste and those
were all different property files they
had to touch an extent to add their
their new module to the android
framework and those were smart guys but
they pushed end to the limits right
right they wanted to have some something
that models their domain but they
couldn't hide the complexity so this was
extremely error-prone and developers
were completely they hated it a dead one
points boycotted it is that we don't add
any other sub module it's fixed us we
don't deal with this anymore
so their pain was so high this this is a
critical as this is their software stack
right the pain was so high that they
switched to cradle when greater was zero
point five point two our first big
enterprise built right so and then one
of the things they laughed was that they
could create a DSL for their guys so now
a software developer doesn't need to do
anything with n they they're not even
aware necessary that they're using
Gradle let's say hey for the for this a
product we use we need two sub
components we have some dependencies for
the dock we have this documentation text
requires license and specify a launcher
this is a specification this is a story
that makes sense to you with a little
background iíve given you right for
that they're building some kind of of
application and distribution this big
progress fight okay so one thing that
may even really added to the domain was
the idea of standardization
absolutely and
sanitization based on opinionated
frameworks with the built by convention
approach and they did that long before
it was hyped with something like Ruby on
Rails so I really give them credit to
come up with such a mechanism very very
early and and many people love maven
because it took them out of there and
nightmarish completely non standardized
built environments right so and and we
for a standardization is a very
important aspect specifically for for
larger shops and but the main point for
us is not that Greater provides some
out-of-the-box standards for you like
this is a Java project this is nice to
have right but the real value add for
companies for us is that Gradle is a
standardization toolkit that allows you
to define your own standards for all the
stuff that are done that doesn't come
out of the box with the build system and
I guarantee you there is a lot I mean if
I look at the Gradle build what we have
to standardize and and do for our
automation which is on a lot not so
large scaled and then any significant
Enterprise build we think this is this
is this is very important that it's easy
for you to standardize the stuff and and
deploy those rules across the whole
companies how to do this we will learn
later
so another thing so even if you don't
care about standardization if you say
hey I'm from a pretty small shop we
don't have many teams right we just want
to have a good build system cradle is
not a Java build system where you might
be able to squeeze building other
platforms somehow into it right it's
extremely open and flexible for any
platform right Java Android C++ Java
Script etc and we are very excited that
we are working together now with the
Google Android team to make cradle the
next default build system for building
Android apps and
libraries so that that's great news for
everyone I think you know also for us
this way for the Android world and
because there are some issues with
building Android apps right and and the
Android the Android SDK people what they
did before they were thinking about
tools they were writing a build spec
what should a build system for Android
to be able to do and they created the
terminology like product flavors and
build types and they could take this
back or we together took this back and
extend it the greater the language to
capture that you can say hey Android I
have this product flavors a free version
and a paid version you can specify that
and and under the hood you get all the
complex logic out of that and it's
pretty complex you know with all the
emulators and the specific testing
requirements this yeah you can specify
the what and to how it's done for you
and it integrates deeply with the with
the existing Gradle build language so
when you specify a free product flavor
as a three source set gets automatically
created which then can further configure
etcetera etcetera so even if you don't
care about standardization the fact that
cradle is extremely open will will make
it a first how to say a tool of choice
for you know modeling any domain right
and so and give you a very good
experience whatever whatever software
stack you're using yeah one interesting
thing about a declarative elements they
are credible I mean it's very hard to
query an end build to ask ask an input
for anything hey what are your source
directory is what are you test
directories right you might have some
conventions but you couldn't ask the
build you could have some heuristics or
whatever and having the clarity of
elements you care you know I haven't
have an object graph can say hey give me
all the product flavors that are free
and whatever overall my software stack
oops
so there was the declarative layout but
at one but you also well at one point
the what is one thing but as the build
master you also have to defined a house
somewhere right
what how should things be done so cradle
also has a very rich imperative layer so
in that respect we think graders also
the better end so on the low level and I
will show you some examples why we think
this is the case so task dependency
inference okay let's take this example
from the integration test and now let's
add the requirement hey I want a jar
task that just up my compiled unit tests
for whatever reason I want to have that
okay I tell crater hey tests all set
give me your output and you specify a
naming pattern and and you now can
execute this test jar task and what is
kind of interesting is the classes are
compiled the test classes are compiled
and then the joyous build did we tell
this to cradle right no we didn't the
only thing we specified was that it
should use come on then it should use
the test output and this output object
is a rich object that knows a lot not
just that it's not just a string that
represents the part right so
see here's the Java done a test one hour
in cradle the output objects know what
needs to be done to create a Content so
the test output object represents the
directory of the compiled unit test
classes but it also knows that it needs
to compile tasks to create a content of
this directory so you encapsulate that
in an object that's reasonable
object-oriented design compare this with
the end you have a property with the
name class sister right and then you
have a target compiled tests which
pushes the stuff into class sister then
you have a test target which depends on
compiled test and it's the class sister
you have a test jar target which depends
on compiled tests and just the classes
to her now let's assume the rules how
you create a binary of the unit tests
are changing let's say you don't compile
them anymore
right let's say you must get them from
some zip zip file in some binary
repository you write could be with end
you have to go to all your build scripts
and and change to depends relation right
you have to say everywhere don't depend
on compiled test now depend on extract
zip file right you have to repeat
yourself you say you need to class
sister and by the way class is to depend
on compiled test used to clap right and
so you have to specify this rule over
and over again when you change it you
have to change it over and over again in
greater you can specify classes to a
property as a rich object and tell this
property hey you need this task to
create your output and then you just
tell cradle hey you need this output
property and the wiring of the tasks
happens automatically right so just one
maintainability advantage right another
thing smart exclusion I mean this is the
build master tool let's say I want to
build a it depends on B B takes usually
50 minutes some talking
generation and now you're debugging
something in a you want to you want your
working with it you want to execute it
you know you have to execute it five
times a minute
and now B always takes so long so what
do you do in end Tommy
well yeah but you you might not want to
touch the B but would be away another
way you might also don't want to touch
it you could introduce skip properties
unless right okay I mean better than
nothing right so but you have to say it
explicitly I want I want to define this
property to skip this task but then
let's say B depends on C and E you also
have to say or them also have to define
the same skip property for C and for D
so you're told and already B depends on
C and D and now with the skip properties
you tell the same story another time
right with greater you don't need to do
anything
I mean skipping is just a built-in
feature and when you when you execute a
and skip be the task C and D will also
be skipped because B depends on them if
none of the tasks that are executed
depend on them it's simple but hey it's
it's it's cool and I mean other built
system don't even have the notion of
skipping right you depend on the mercy
of their plugins whether they are
capable or not and that's what built
master painting yes I mean when I have
to do execute something over and over
again always have to wait I mean it's
ridiculous I mean so hey one of the
highlights are doing fine time
incremental bit who is always doing a
clean when the end build is executed
when the maven build is executed oh a
lot of brave people out here so who is
not doing who is usually not doing a
clean in MMA even if you don't do a
clean it doesn't give you that much
performance advantage so java dog is
still generated the
tests are still executed the the jars
are still created the only thing that
javac only recompiles the Java files
that have been touched but only those
not the ones this fire depends on so we
have a pretty unreliable compile so you
you take quite a bit of risk for not
getting much out of it so therefore most
therefore I got used to always do a
clean right I mean are you using it you
built the and checksum tasks to make
things faster yeah and has some some
stuff where you can where you can where
you can check whether output input has
changed or so okay let's do it so okay
let's see how grater behaves here so we
have another normal Java project now
let's do a clean build only once just to
start from scratch now let's do a normal
build and a non clean build boom
everything is up-to-date right very fast
so now let's change the production code
let's remove this field name - and let's
rebuild again AHA this was picked up by
Gradle
right so everything was recompiled the
buy code has changed so the job was
rebuilt so the class pass had changed
for the tests I need to be recompiled
and me we executed okay so this
up-to-date here means there are no
resources to process so did that
therefore this is always up to date but
the other stuff needed to be react
secured okay by the way compiled Java
and process resources are created by the
classes tab so this is an aggregator
task when you say hey I want all my
binaries this task depends on compiled
Java and process resources to do the two
steps that are necessary to create a
binaries ok now let's do something else
let's remove
right let's react Secutor built and ah
that's that's interesting
it was recompiled right but the bytecode
hasn't changed so the J's up-to-date
test only to be recompiled etc okay
let's do something else let's change the
source compatibility layer which is not
a file it's a property of the build
right
will this be detected yes and of course
the bytecode changes so everything needs
to be redone right ja needs to be
rebuilt etc let's change the version of
the j-unit dependency for compiling the
test will that be detected I hope so yes
tests are recompile the rest is up to
date but has a recompile and we executed
now let's now so far we only changed the
input now let's change the output of the
previous run right let's remove one of
the compiled production classes let's
reacts acute the build and Boon
recompile but the bytecode was
up-to-date so the rest is up to date
okay so okay so the interesting question
is now this is kind of - this is the
behavior of the default greater task how
can you use incremental build of cradle
for your own custom build logic right
can you use it so we have here a
mountains XML file and the requirement
is for each note of this XML file for
each mountain node we want to create a
text file where the name of the text
file is the name of the mountain and the
head of the the head weather and the
head of the mountain is the content of
the text file so let's just do some
groovy stuff we don't need to care about
here I create a task generate mountain
files with some groovy XML parsing that
generates those text files right so
let's execute this task
isn't that cool gmf you can use camel
case task execution on a command line
and greater will find the correct task
so the big question is now only now
first I want to show you that the task
did what it was supposed to do
yeah let's refresh the Eclipse workspace
you have a mountains directory okay to
text and Mount Everest text okay
requirement solved now let's go back and
we execute the task will it be up to
date what is your trust in Gradle come
all the way from Germany to show you
some crappy up-to-date shaking no of
course of course it's up to date it's
not up to date let's try it again okay
today check for custom build code is
part of the commercial cradle offerings
no no it's not let's revisit this guy
here is not my friend for various
reasons first of all I mean analyzing
what the what what the input and output
whoops I don't want it
analyzing what the input and output of
this of descripting implicit code is
would be very hard right the other thing
is I talked about declarative build
scripts right and in Gradle we always
try to separate the declarative from the
imperative right the build script the
normal build script should be spec like
so now we have this the scripting code
in there you can easily imagine if this
is getting out of hand you have you've
completely messy non-declarative how to
read build scripts so this is something
I don't like so what can we do to
improve that we can create a custom task
we call it convert Mountain XML and we
say hey the input file the mountains XML
file is a property of this task the
separator
feed : number and the output directory
where the text files are generated then
we have a task action the action that is
actually executed by this task right and
and now let's get rid of this guy here
and make it more declarative say this
task of type convert modern XML the
output der is built here mountains the
input file is source mountains XML and
the separator is a column hey this is
much nicer right now let's we execute
okay we generated now
let's react secure with other clean hey
everything is up-to-date free and open
source for you
so now let's let's see but if it's
really working here we go kay two texts
and one everest text okay so let's
change the mountains xml the numbers
anyhow crap but let's change them to
another curb number and you see no
longer up to date we generated if you
execute again up to date one more one
more thing to try out if we change the
separator which is a real property of
the task not a file to semicolon we
execute it's picked up this change and
you see yes please reload we now have a
semicolon
and what is really cool here i think you
didn't need to tell Crale anything about
incremental build we just created just
provides you a way to describe the input
and output of your tasks and this very
powerful functionality of an incremental
build you get for free and this is so
simple you can go home now you
understood all you need to do and you
know have incremental build but there is
more you get out of that let's let's
specify an XML file that doesn't exist
well we know it's an input and you now
get a nice error
you don't need your own checking if fire
doesn't exist
make a nice error message you get that
for free another thing that is pretty
cool is you can now say Cradle clean
generate Mountain Files so for every
task you have you get a clean task that
only deletes the output of that task
another sharp tool for the belt master
let's say something is corrupted but you
have a build build output that is pretty
expensive to create you can very sharply
say only create the output of the sky
and how can we do that well you told us
what are the output doors of that task
right so it's pretty easy and you see
it's really it's deleted and another
thing is you don't need to do a make do
well we-we-well automatically creates
all the out all the files that are
declared as output directory before the
task is executed little stuff a lot of
goodness we can derive because you you
are you can describe the input sample of
tasks so we started okay
so next topic expect the unexpected
expect clean is we're talking to empty
chairs that's what I
so the bill domain is a complex domain
there are many requirements I'm always
surprised to hear them right and so many
requirements are out there we I would
never anticipate as a build system so
somehow you have to write a build system
you can in any software for very complex
and unknown domain in a way that it
embraces the unknown not in a way or
unknown keep out of here right this is
the way to do things right and that's
another thing that it's at the heart of
Gradle so just we just look at an
example we have another another Java
project and this Java project has quite
a bit of spring related code right so
and we want to create separate jars for
our spring code that relates to the
springy B layer for a spring code that
relates to the core layer etcetera
the default choice added by the Java
plug-in by default it contains all the
binaries we tell it hey don't include
our spring related code right and then
we have a spring Leiby jar as set a
spring core jar and the spring message
in jar so one thing you can now easily
do with Gradle you can't a cradle hey
build use the assembly task which is a
dynamic task run it and it it builds all
the archives you have declared right
it's it checks what what what archives
are there and it builds them all okay so
and you see built by convention as lips
directory and here we go you see the
naming pattern in place the appendix is
spring dB so the name is the name of the
project rules spring DB - 1 0 - JA ok
that was the plenum preliminary now I
don't know if you've heard that spring
source has changed their license
agreement
the license of the new license equipment
says that every job that has the name
spring in its name must contain the
picture of Rod Johnson in the meta and
directory of the job can you believe
that
so here's the picture of rod it's a
goodbye present
to rot I think so here we go now and
build masters of the world how do you
solve that with end right you could say
okay we don't use the default jars event
anymore in this enterprise we have our
own macro death and every jar must use
this macro death which then does
something like that okay maven extent is
simply plug in okay how can you do it
with Gradle oops
damn sorry wrong button okay here we go
okay
incredibly can say hey Gradle for all
ties tasks of type jar which are
matching a certain pattern JA archive
name contains spring for all those jars
at the picture of rod to the meta F
directory so it's this blue code or is
it real to go to be true right so let's
execute Gradle assemble okay one cool
thing guys up to date haven't changed
but the other ideas have picked up all
the meta F probably has changed
hopefully let's see let's see what's in
the zip in the jar I mean you know fast
our video
you see rot JPEG and to be sure we look
at the standard jar no rot JPEG okay hey
problem solved right now QA ex extremely
concerned the fees are very high for
violating this new agreement and they
want to do you know checks now in ten
whether those jar really have the
picture on the other hand there are some
really big bills out there where the jar
takes 30 minutes to be built with all
the documentation generation so they're
saying hey guys give me a task that only
built the spring jars I'm not I I fed
out things to do than to wait 30 minutes
for a jar to be built that I don't need
right okay
how can you do that well just do a
little refectory
extract variable or spring jars you have
an object model right tasks is a soft
type tasks container with type jar
returns another filter jar container
matching returns another filter jar
container
hey you know this is a rich object model
so this guy here represents a filter
task container now let's apply the rule
or all tasks in this filter task
container should have this map should
should contain the picture and then use
this filter task container to create a
task spring jars that depends on the
filter task container a one-liner no you
just say hey cradle spring jars
camelcase execution
boon only the spring jars are built
okay now let's add a little bit because
it's fun the next requirement you need
to create you want to create some checks
on files for the jars to better track
them right so you can appear area to
those spring jars that you say hey for
every jar create a checksum task that's
great we'll ever check some tasks yes
because ant has a checksum task and
created ships with end and as part of
the greater distribution so everything
that is an end is your friend
so we execute in the spring jars and you
see built lips here we go
checksum is there okay now the next
thing is in a bit a little bit
the next requirement I mean this is now
only part of this project but you want
to apply this stuff to all your projects
in the enterprise right so oops sorry so
the first thing we need to do the first
thing we need to do is at the moment the
picture is it's part of the of the
source tree of this project so we want
to use a picture of rod that is in a
repository and can be retrieved from
every project so how do we do that well
we declare a repository a maven
repository somewhere repo at Gradle or
create a demo then we create a custom
dependency configuration and add the
image that isn't this repository come
Micom spring rot one Oh
JPEG as a dependency like you can
energize the dependency you can also add
a JPEG as a dependency that would work
with maven or with Gradle or with ivy
that you can do that right so and then
in the front section of the meta-inf we
just say from configuration spring boom
we now retrieve the image from from rot
from a remote repository and that's the
first step to be able to share this
logic across projects
you see rot one okay peg now the next
thing we want to do is to share this how
can we do that well let's cut this guy
out let's go to get up my github
repository I have a couple of plugins
there and there is a spring door cradle
file which are already put there it's
exactly the same code I just cut out of
my build script right exactly the same
code so I now take the raw URL see this
is this is just ul to this file copy it
and say apply from boom this is a remote
cradle script I create a plug-in and say
clean spring jars and unzip what's
picture is there now every project in
your enterprise can use that it gets
even more interesting later when we show
you how you can auto apply such plugins
that you developers don't even need to
apply them explicitly okay so before you
tweet SpringSource has changed the
license agreement
they haven't as you can imagine but the
set of requirements that's the typical
thing that happens to you when you when
you need to do automation this is not a
bizarre requirement I've seen more
bizarre requirements I've seen
requirements like this unit test this
one unit test only fails always when you
run at the first time when you run at
the second time and when it then fails
it fails when a dense soup when it
succeeds it succeeds and there's nothing
those guys could do about it because it
was a complex test the infrastructure
team was involved they didn't want to do
the changes to fix it so there are
always situations you have to deal with
and it doesn't help you if there is a
tool that says well it shouldn't be like
this well bloody hell I know that
I guess but it is like this and it is
not in my power to change that so should
i disable the test is that better of
course not
so you need and this is a when I came
across this requirement I mean I haven't
thought about this or we when we were
creating greater but in Gradle you can
hook into the into the test field into
the test runner you could you could deal
with this requirement and then the other
thing is if you have such a pathological
requirement even and you would ask us
could you please in the next release of
cradle at a method fail only after so on
so many runs we would say no no no our
API stays lean this this crap no we
don't if you are big framework the only
thing you can do to accommodate the
pathologies of the world is to bloat up
your API because people can't can't
extend it right so you have to wait for
the next release and then yeah either
way they they screw up the API to have
you or not so but I would say hey use
the create a toolkit to express that you
could even just as a side note extend a
greater test task easily to say hey test
tasks I add another property fail after
so many runs just for your enterprise
build infrastructure you can extend even
the API of the greater task but please
that will never be part of the public
API of the greater distribution but you
can model that so multi module builds
multi-project build I should decide on a
terminology so here we have root
directory it's called mighty project and
we have three components API shared web
service so three terms we have now
component module project yeah I always I
don't know at one day I have to decide
which one I should use but anyhow so how
can you and they have dependencies
between each other
how can you model this with Gradle well
the first thing you do is to say hey I
create a setting start Gradle file
and at a cradle those are the components
the sub components they take part of
this single built API shared and web
service okay so you can now ask Gradle
hey show me the projects and sorry and
you get such a report you got the
project structure can even be nested it
can have it can have multiple
hierarchies okay that was the first step
we need to do the next thing we created
build script in the root project in
mighty project and tell-tale cradle what
is common between all the components so
for all the components we say they are
Java project all the components should
get a repositories from maven central
and all the components should use a unit
for a to for compiling and running the
tests and all the components are version
1 0 ok good
now the shared component doesn't have a
build script on its own it just you it's
just happy with with the stuff that is
defined in the in the root project so we
go to shared and we can now say hey
Gradle build shared and shed is built ok
boom
so API is our next candidate ok shared
one oh ja API is different we needed a
build script for API because API has
dependencies that need to be defined
right so the first thing API depends on
shared it needs the output of shared for
compiling so in cradle we have a
specific notations for saying this is a
project dependency this is a dependency
to another component versus an external
dependency right and it also needs
comments Lang for compiling ok let's go
to API and let's run the build and what
is interesting now is that trade will
automatically build shared before it
build API right so which is yeah pretty
cool when you have a larger codebase and
your D
bagging your application you you often
don't know in which components you're
you're you're changing stuff is cetera
and then when you then run the bill to
figure out if everything is working you
don't want to manually rebuild the
components you have changed but you also
don't want to do a full build because it
takes too long right so okay
shared is not fully built it's not
tested right it's only only the joys
produced API is fully built okay now
let's deal with web service web service
also needs to have a built screw on its
own because it's a it's a war project
it's extense the Java project and it has
also dependencies Commons collection
Commons IO
and a dependency on API so let's build
web servers that's what we call a
partial build and you see first shared
is built an API is built and then web
service is fully built okay
so let's go to API so and the question
is if you did it change to API as a
developer and you you build API the
tests are running etc are you good
enough for committing the code
why not exactly so I would like to know
so I tell Gradle build API until TPP
build all the dependent components as
well and you see API is fully built and
tested and now web service is fully
built and tested web service consuming
API right now you're good to commit this
partial built that only builds a
subgraph of the components plus
incremental build is a traumatic time
saver to get the average bill turned on
you could even say hey build the
components of API that depend on API and
also built fully the components that is
needed by API so shared is now also
built and tested ok the last thing I
would like to show with mighty project
builds is you can of course go to the
root project and build everything and
that's what we're doing together with
the dash dash profile option cradle
creates a profile report that shows you
the performance characteristics of that
built write total build time startup
time how long it took to configure the
build how long dependency resolution
took for the for the different scopes
and along the tax execution took yes so
we take performance very seriously
so you could even do stuff like here we
said this is common for all sub projects
now we can do something what we call
filtered injection we can specify the
stuff that is only common for libraries
for example in this case for API and for
shared and then we defend these define
hey libraries are all the sub projects
that don't have the name web in its site
you can use whatever filter you want
that don't start with WEP and that way
you can be fine in your route build all
the stuff that is common for all the
components the stuff that is common for
the libraries that is common for the web
project that is common for the
documentation projects etcetera
so very fine-grain way of injecting
things not single inheritance based
model right you can do some other cool
stuff you see here all those built or
cradles then what build or cradle is
what built our cradle you have now
multiple components so you could easily
take cradle head cradle I want to have a
different naming pattern for all my sub
components the build file name should be
that it should be the project name dot
cradle even this is something you can
configure and then you just rename the
builder cradle of web service to web
service store cradle we should have made
this new default behavior of cradle but
now backwards compatibility wise we
can't change it but it's easy for you to
actually do this to do this right okay
oh and you can import easily such a
multi module built into Eclipse we go we
go to our multi see the mighty project
build we take Eclipse built a model we
tell now Eclipse import everything we
could even specify tasks that should be
it should be run before and after the
import and we say finish and everything
is now imported into Eclipse
select working set multi-project boom
here we go and there is now a creative
dependency container in Eclipse and the
source folders are correctly configured
etc okay now we coming to one up to the
hat to the highlight I have still a
little bit of time left
built masters delight what do we mean by
that the cradle wrapper is one of those
pieces we we really like let's demo this
to you so we have here a normal Java
project and we created the build master
would create a task called wrapper
nothing else just toss wrapper type
wrapper and if the build master then
execute this task the following is
happening if you look here this task
creates a crater W it created W be 80
and in a cradle directory it creates a
rapid directory with greater rapid jar
and create a wrapper properties and this
is the greater wrapper properties file
so those four files you would commit to
version control the next time one of you
developers updates from version control
to develop a can build with Gradle even
if grated is not installed on a machine
the developer would just say create a W
instead of cradle and then does all what
he wants to do with Gradle and then the
wrapper would go to this distribution
URL and download this specific version
of cradle and installs it to the machine
of the developer if you upgrade to a new
version of Gradle two weeks later you
just change to wrap a properties file
with a new with the new URL committed to
version control people next time people
do an update from version control
they're used in the new version of
Gradle
extremely convenient for developers one
aspect the other thing is historical
builds compliance you now have in
version control the build system that is
needed
to build this software right it's nailed
down so and no longer support issues
like it doesn't build with my version of
Gradle say well interesting used to wrap
up right so um okay
next power feature init scripts so a lot
last section so let's say in all your
projects you have the requirement that
the repository should be retrieved from
maven central so we have here normal
Java project we cut this out that the
dependencies are retrieved from maven
central and we just take some init
script and we say all projects
repositories maven central this is some
script somewhere on your machine right
so you now can go to this build testing
with Gradle right where we just removed
to the repository declaration and you
can say hey Gradle build the sky but
inject this init script into the build
and it works right the repositories are
retrieved from maven central everything
is fine although it was not specified in
the build of the testing with Gradle
project now let's do some cooler stuff
Grail has a very deep API you can hook
into every aspect of the build lifecycle
so for example what about a warning when
the tests are taking long when a test
method takes longer than 20 milliseconds
to run would be cool so the cradle'
object here is available in an init
script it represents the Creator runtime
and we now tell to create a built right
run time hey crater after all your build
build projects components are evaluated
right to the following give me a root
project and now access all projects
in this in this build and for all tasks
of type test right hook in a test
listener calculate the time it took to
run the test check whether it was too
long and then issue a warning with the
name of the test
okay now let's we execute testing with
Gradle with this init script and you see
you now have those warnings now you
don't always want to specify an init
script right so what can you do to make
it common behavior you take this code
you take you go to the Creator
distribution and every creator
distribution has an init or D directory
you create now a script in this init or
T directory my inner door cradle
whatever however you call it paste this
code go back to the command line now you
don't need to specify the inner script
anymore
run the tests and you see the warnings
are printed so and now the full story is
the following you take a greater
distribution is to build master at the
stuff you want to auto apply to all of
your projects in an in a dirty directory
and then you point to wrapper properties
to this distribution right in a wrapper
properties file you can point to your
enterprise credit distribution with the
energy directory with your enterprise
customizations does it make sense and
then all you developers will have this
behavior including the picture of ROM
Ross Johnson in a meta director II right
tell me exactly it's completely
transparent they don't have to read a
wiki how to set up my local build system
so and this is a really deep API I mean
it's one thing to define a repository
it's another thing to hook into the test
in the little cradle Java and then
running the test and get events back and
do something with them of course you can
also use init scripts and say hey this
init script is all only for CI so stuff
you only wanted to do in CI you can tell
the CI hey use this init script that
it's not happening on local builds for
example init script could check and now
we're back to the build language hey
create a build give me all your
repositories did you dare to declare
your own repositories in the project
build and not use the company repository
build fail right you want to allow that
on a local build because people want to
try out stuff but maybe not on the CI
build right so yeah you can go yeah it's
it's Gradle is deep you can go you can
go into the dark guts of cradle to to
model your requirements so the other
thing you can do is in in a project
directory in in one of your projects you
can
UK or in any of your projects you can
put it created or properties file right
and you can specify certain properties
let's not talk about a demon right now
you can specify the Java home that
should be used to run the build and you
can specify the JVM arcs that should be
used by the JVM that is executing the
build again no build wiki that is saying
please set your end ops or cradle ops to
that value which is anyhow then global
for all the projects you can lock this
down it's version control it says its
historical it might change over time
right so so that means when creator runs
it checks is the JVM arcs property set
if it is set it fires up another JVM
that then executes the book right and if
you use the demon then then things are
much more efficient because greater than
has a long-running JVM that is warmed up
and it's much more responsive so so so
then crater just checks do we have
already a demon JVM with those JVM are
setting well then we use it right ok so
I'm running out of time so yeah great
let's very good and integration you can
reuse any end tasks right with Gradle
you can even import end builds into
cradle and creator reps the end targets
at runtime you can inject properties
into androids from cradle so with end we
have a very deep integration with maven
we integrate very well on a repository
level so Gradle is able to generate
palms right to publish artifacts with
the palm to to maven repositories or
maven anis a cradle and a stent spawn
understands maven snapshots on a
dependency level maven is two things
maven is a build system and maven is
also a protocol for dependency
management on a protocol for dependency
management level we are fully compatible
with me right
so if different components different
teams interact in a company via a maven
repository they the other team won't
notice whether you're using Gradle or
main right we are working on also on a
way to import maven build
convert maven bills to cradle so in 1/3
and it which it should be Oz in in four
weeks or so you should see a first first
conversion plug-in that's my creation is
a very interesting topic with my
creation it's uh it's mission-critical
right I mean for many builds so you want
to you want to do this in a very safe
way and what we usually recommend is use
a build system that doesn't force you to
tear apart the existing input structure
if you have a build system that says
well what this end but is using I can't
reproduce you have to completely change
your source structure well this is an N
built hundred people are using every day
and this is this is this is code that is
constantly coated is constantly
developed so what do they say well and
you have to branch I suppose
well I suppose you have to branch then
correct so then every day have fun with
the sinking of the different
repositories have fun with comparing the
results never do build migration like
that and if you have to choice choose a
tool that doesn't force you to do it
like that but we usually recommend this
don't touch the existing input structure
until the end to it for example as long
as its as its life at a cradle built
that consumes the same infrastructure
and Gradle is extremely flexible so we
had companies they were using dirt class
pass files from Eclipse as their master
dependency metadata
well I wouldn't give them a book for
that but I told them don't change right
now you know we want to have come we
want to we want to be able to compare
results right so we wrote an adapter
that translated the dot class pass file
into the Creator dependency notation and
then we we we started to build up the
functionality of the end build with
Gradle and for every relevant output of
the build the archives the Java Doc's
the tests that are run we wrote Gradle
tasks that compared and the archives
exactly the same that are produced by
the Gradle build compared to the end
build and the same tests around is Java
doc to same I couldn't imagine to do any
significant build my Croatian without
such tests it's a nightmare and I've
seen people suffering heavily from doing
build my creations without such a safety
net I would never do that because what
is the same tomorrow might be not today
might be not the same tomorrow right
this this is this is code and the
development this is a moving target so
you want to have always the possibility
to say it's my greater bill doing the
same and it was not long any longer
doing the same you have to figure out
why at one point the Gradle build is a
it's capable of reproducing all the
functionality the tests are running and
then you can say ok I switch right now
the Gradle build is my production build
and then you can start to say ok maybe
finally it's time for the doc last pass
to be derived metadata and no longer
masta metadata etcetera etcetera but
test test-driven build my creation is
the way to go a little bit background
information so Gradle is a is a very
active project right we have a vibrant
community and very proud of our
community yeah I think we have very very
very nice team of developers so the the
founder of the mojito testing framework
is part of the Gradle team the author of
the Spock framework one of the founders
of selenium so yeah very they create a
core committers and and and part of
trail aware we release frequently with
the milestones people didn't realize
that we release frequently but now since
one all every six weeks there has been a
new created version 1 2 1 1 4 2 1 3 will
be out there in a couple of or in four
weeks so we practice what we preach with
continuous delivery and and we are able
to do this because we are highly
automated we have a one-click release
and with a pretty complex release
process right and we have 8000 unit
tests to guarantee the quality so that's
yeah so are many significant projects
have switched to cradle you know the
first one was hibernate
couple of years ago and SpringSource has
has completely switched and almost
completely and many enterprises are
using cradle in production or for quite
a while even before one all was out so
so and it's getting it's getting more
and more there's a there's a there's a
strong momentum going on and which is
important when you when you choose such
a such an infrastructure technology
right you want to be sure that that it
that it will be around also in five
years right so there's a company behind
cradle called cradle where which
provides support subscription now all
the professional service model training
on-site consulting remote consulting
prioritize open source development
custom development etc delivered by
created core developers so yeah that's
it for tonight thank you for your
attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
