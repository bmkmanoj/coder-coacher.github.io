thank you all so very much yet we're
from leap motion I am Mike otherwise
known excu and we've got here kai who is
one of the members of our developer
community that's most recently been
doing a lot of work with us especially
in d3 and our leap JavaScript API I've
got josh is a lead of our web team and
is also the creator of Luke JavaScript
API and I've got Isaac here who's just
recently joined us as well as doing some
really really cool stuff and 3gs and and
leave JavaScript so um I'll do a very
very very brief introduction about what
leap motion is just in case there's a
few people out there that don't really
know so this is the leap motion
controller it's a small device that
plugs into your laptop or computer via
USB and basically what it is is it's
creating an interactive space directly
above it so I can't really do it very
easily but if that was you know here you
can see what he's doing right so it's
basically it's tracking his hands and
fingers down to one hundredth of a
millimeter with all my cereal latency so
there's creating a space sort of around
this this area and he can directly
interact with that space so that's the
product it's a it's the vision about two
comic co-founders Mike Michael buckled
and David Holtz david hopes had a
basically a massive breakthrough in the
3d motion tracking technology and that's
really what's enable us to do this so
I'm going to pass you over to kind so
actually I just say that the products
not actually on sale yet we're actually
launching very shortly in May nineteen
so we're we've been rolling these out to
about 10,000 developers so we've got a
pretty good community at the moment
unfortunately still closed but we're
really looking forward to being up open
that up and the thing we're really been
excited about is the ability that we've
been able to actually open source this
JavaScript API so I'll hand you over to
climb out yeah so I'm gonna talk a
little bit about learning JavaScript I
think I'd let you guys already know
JavaScript if based on some of the
previous presentations but there a lot
of people don't know JavaScript and
gesture interface
going to be really important for them
people like dancers physical therapist
sculptors they want to be able to
interact with 3d environments they don't
know C++ they don't know JavaScript or
any of these Java Python these things
yet how did they learn JavaScript and
how is a leap motion community how we're
going to build a community around this
device to get just your face interface
to take off the first thing I would
recommend to anyone who is trying to
learn javascript is to find an excellent
community if you already know
programming you're going to pick up
JavaScript pretty easily but if you
don't we're taking a lot of lessons from
the d3 community d3 is a community I
participate a lot in you saw some
visualizations earlier I think she'll
should you somewhat eventsource those
those pie charts that we're animating
it's a data visualization library data
visualization is very similar to what's
happening up this device we're taking
some data and we're projecting it into
this visual space is this is taking a
visual space these these two cameras on
this device and projecting it into some
data so they're in these kind of twin
problems the great thing about the d3
community is there are hundreds of
examples so if you want to know how to
do one little thing there is probably an
example out there that shows you how to
do that one little thing and you could
compare to another example that's just a
little bit different and you learn by
comparing these differences their
in-depth tutorials that explain how to
do very specific things in this middle
here we see the wealth of nations if
you've seen this Hans Rosling talk of
these dis motion graphics explaining how
the world has become health or healthier
and and wealthier over time you know it
there's in-depth tutorials about how to
do this and is exactly what we need with
just your interface and what we're
trying to provide you should find a
community that has mathematicians why do
you need mathematicians mathematicians
they solve brutally hard problems that
if you haven't studied mathematics for
many years it's going to be very hard
for you to solve these problems problems
related to topology in this case
tracking of the hands getting the data
off this device in a very short amount
of time pretty much all great
communities have mathematically minded
people around them especially when it
deals with interaction
visualization i'm going to show you an
example all of these visualizations here
we're done by this mathematical
programmer Jason Davies from London and
I'm gonna show you an example of one of
these with the leap motion in a moment
you'll see how cool it is it's always
great to have a place to have
discussions and ask questions d 3 has a
google group with lee motion we have
these forums so these are places that
people can share ideas talk about trying
to integrate with Windows Linux OS X the
web we even have a github group by
another plumbing a github a lot it's a
it's open leap this is something that
has just totally come together from the
open source community this is what I
started kind of helping out with with
some open source examples before before
I was working with leap all kinds of
stuff for working with processing is
another community three Jas cinder
openframeworks all these things have
awesome communities with creative coders
and it's great to just embed yourself in
a community and just absorb all their
knowledge so with that I'm just going to
give a quick example of using a using
leap with d3 this is this is a a map
that was originally created by by Jason
Davies what I can do here with with the
leap motion is just kind of go in here
let me just reorient the world all right
so i have a spinning world here if i
took my hand left and right I just
accelerate this rotation I can also
rotate it in this other direction by
lifting my hand forward and back and I
could go anywhere I want I can go to
Australia I can zoom in here I'm gonna
show ya well should I go from here
belgium all right here we go here we go
is it if it this one is it this one this
one in the middle here I'm sorry it was
the device it anyway so this is just an
example of what you can do it's very
easy to integrate d3 and it really any
JavaScript library in fact this is
coming off a WebSocket we just heard
Mikael how do you chill michael
explained web sockets it's just sending
json messages over WebSocket so it's
very easy to program with this device in
JavaScript so I'm very excited I hope
that if you're interested in a gesture
interface you play around with it I'm
going to pass it off to Isaac he's going
to show some examples with three jas
which is 3d in the browser hello hey I'm
Isaac so he was talking about d3 and
that's one of the wonderful communities
surrounding html5 another really great
one is three J's so just like d3 there's
a ton of different examples there's
tutorials there's like different groups
that help you there's an IRC so
basically there's a bunch of different
ways that you can become part of the
community and the community really helps
you to grow not only as a programmer but
as part of the open source community so
like for example the first github open
source project that are contributed to
was actually that openly project and
there's definitely because of things
like three Jas so this is one thing
that's really interesting to me is
basically um the way that the leap can
do things that really haven't been done
before because you have a different
dimension of interaction it really
allows you to literally do things like
in this case you can see that little
pink object can move in 3d space which
is an interaction that we couldn't do
before so this is a little project that
I made for this demo
and basically what you do is it's like
leap snake so you kind of go and you
grab these different objects and as you
grab the different objects they're all
different loops so you start making a
song by literally interacting with the
objects you can see the tail kind of
grows longer and longer and then
basically what's really cool too is that
it's not just another dimension but it
allows you to do things that weren't
possible so in this case we can draw a
circle and speed up the music we can
also do the same thing and slow down
pretty much as slow as we want and then
we can also kind of tap the screen and
it will let us jump forward um if we're
going really fast we can also just stick
our hand in and slow it down completely
so so you can see that it kind of allows
you to make games that literally could
not exist before um and with that I one
thing that's also really fun about it is
that once you have one thing designed
you can sort of one second you can sort
of apply those same techniques two
different interfaces so this one is a
reddit browser and we can circle to kind
of zoom in in them when we decide we're
at a place where we want we can kind of
stick our hand in move in the Z
direction and then when you see a
picture you want like that dude you can
tap it in to place see what it looks
like get rid of it and it basically
means that there's not only just new new
games you can play but there's literally
new ways to interact with all sorts of
information he was doing data for me
it's cute puppies so with that I'll talk
give it to josh who really made
everything possible
I was gonna show like demos off my
laptop but I've decided not to i'll just
tell you about leave j s kind of like
where we are today and where we're going
so the honest truth is i did not start
leave jas it was handed to me when i
joined the company it was done by one of
our summer interns and it was like 50
lines of code that showed how to
interface with the leap using javascript
and i think his first demo was like a
Spotify player like playing and pausing
that and it's like great like this is
awesome that you can interface with
something like this on the web so then
like what I did after that was I took
that code i put it up on github i made
it available to the public and just
started cleaning it up and making it
easier and easier to use so today where
we're standing with a leap j/s is you
can go grab that software if you have a
leap and you can just say leaped loop
and start processing frames that are
coming off the device using javascript
and that's just the beginning of like
where we're going with this as well like
isaac demonstrated some different
gestures that are available with the
leap so like being able to do circles
being able to do taps and as well swipes
are supported now so you have like some
very basic things that you can do with
it as well to we have like an API this
is only available right now with native
apps or you can point on the screen and
it's as though like an invisible laser
line was coming out of your finger in
hitting the screen and pretty soon we're
going to have that available on the
JavaScript side but that's just the
beginning we haven't even shipped the
product yet but we're already starting
to think about what we really want to do
next with the leap so for us a big thing
that we're pushing for is making it
really easy for application writers to
get going with the leap and to start
writing like beautiful games and
applications using this hardware of
course a problem when you think about
like iphone development and you think
about just normal application
development it's really hard like doing
native apps especially if you're working
in compiled languages you know these
things take a long time to do it's kind
of slow it's a little bit tedious that
you know there's so many iphone
developers that i've talked with who are
like yes you know in order
get that button I had to spend 27 hours
tweaking and going nuts and like losing
my mind because you know like iOS is
like notoriously fickle and finicky for
doing this kind of thing so where we
really want to see the leap is we want
to make writing applications in html5 a
first-class citizen in our ecosystem you
know initially right now we're going to
be supporting just different types of
websites and having those available in
our App Store at launch but where we see
this going is a place where native apps
or html5 apps like from an end users
perspective who cares they're just all
applications and they have your data and
they do useful things for you so what we
really what we want to have happen is
that the same API is that are available
to you in native applications of storing
data finding your friends being able to
go online play a multiplayer game or
maybe you're both working on the same
document at the same time but we want to
make all those API is available both for
html5 applications and for native apps
so that really at the end of the day
it's up to the developer to house it go
sleep yeah so at the end of the day it's
up to the developer to pick whatever
technology they find best for for the
application at hand so that's what we're
thinking about for for the leap and what
we're thinking about for the JavaScript
interface I just have to ask are there
any questions about what we're doing and
is there stuff you want to see or any
other it is right there so there is a
native SDK so right now today we support
C C++ objective c c sharp python we have
kind of like finicky support for ruby we
support javascript we support nodejs
that's where we're at today sorry unit
will unity yep yep there's unity support
as well into your other question yeah
you know like WebGL is like varying
levels of implementation it's kind of
messy so my current thinking on this is
what we want to probably do and don't
hold me to this but this is where I'm
going with
that is we want to release a native
player if you will that's based on top
of probably chrome and that equalizes
all the platforms for everyone so that
if you're writing elite j/s app exactly
yeah and use that as the player that can
work in like a full screen mode and be
like a really great presenter so that
everyone has the same level playing
field for writing html5 abson anyone
else any any questions criticisms
critiques so far cool thank you so much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
