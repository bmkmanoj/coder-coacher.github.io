today my name is Jeannie Yang and I am
the vp of product alchemy as smule so
product alchemy first of all is really
just a simple way acknowledging that
product management really is all about
doing whatever it takes to make a
product come together from inception to
development to launch to the users and
recognizing that sometimes product
management or development is actually a
really messy process and especially at a
start-up and so it's really all about
learning from the lessons and it's
really all about adapting to the various
situations and the rapid changing
environment that comes up and so as soon
we call kind of product alchemy because
sometimes is a little bit of a black
magic and sometimes we're trying to a
hirak to practice and needing to adapt
to the various ways that happens and
certainly I think through my time and
Daris mill it's been almost two years
now I don't think a single product has
really been the same as a last one and
we always say we're going to learn from
this one we're going to go to the next
one but something else always comes up
so here today I mean I certainly don't
think I've learned all the lessons and I
probably never will and so but I've
really taken a few too hard I guess from
developing mobile social products s mule
and most of them are obvious but
hopefully I can share our perspectives
and maybe provide you with some insight
so please feel free to ask questions I'm
just going to go through some of I think
the most important lessons and some of
them really obvious but really how we've
tackled him or how we approach them and
its first of all a little bit of us mule
smells vision is to build social
music-making experiences through mobile
apps we've had over 17 million
our apps collectively each other apps we
build have explored the boundary and
mobile how people would use them our
goal is really to unlock people's
inherent creativity through audio by
helping them realize what's possible
which was previously they thought was
impossible that's really a mouthful a
long-winded way of saying that we think
everyone can make music and want to make
apps that help them realize that even
they didn't know about it and so here's
guy he's our co founder and creative
director s meal playing the ocarina one
the smells first instrument apps on the
iphone the ocarina is actually an
ancient like wind instrument lead to
date back over 12,000 years so small
decided that 12,000 years later there
was no reason that iphone can't be a
wind-like instrument as well so i just
want to play for you a little bit of
going to ocarina
this actually takes quite a lot of skill
to play I have tried to play with it you
kind of definitely get a little bit of
head dizzy sometimes you have to
remember to breathe it's just like any
other wind instrument even is on the
iphone and I think that's one of the
lessons that we turn we've really taken
to heart the key destiny will realize
from the beginning was that it wasn't
about the iphone it was all about what
the iphone can now enable people to do
and the best technologies are the ones
that you don't notice so we take this to
heart in product design and reimagining
what could be possible so I think well
in the first lessons and this is
probably the most obvious lessons to
experiment and iterate and I think we
all do a lot of experimentation
iteration I just want to show a few
examples of how smeal does that so early
on one of schools first apps is a small
created this app called attacked a
zombie bikini base from outer space
Missy to meet the winning formula at the
time the rasam bees there were babes
there were bays in bikinis there were
slingshots and aliens and it was sort of
like what can possibly go wrong in this
ad is height to average 496 in the app
store so I think this is lessons you
know in that dumpy afraid to experiment
have the courage to declare failure
learn and move on I think it's really
good that smell realized early that
zombies and bays were not in the cards
and to focus back more on the audio and
experience for the users and also from
this we learn to user test early and
often sometimes it's really hard to find
that time to iterate an experiment but
it's really important and critical to
even just pull a few users who have not
seen your haps who
not been there and just give it to them
and see what they think I think another
way that we iterate a lot we we actually
start out when we have initial concept
idea with a paper sketch here's an early
sketch of the idea from magic piano
which is an application on ipad unless
you play piano but we started out with
questions to challenge of obvious what
if you had to infinite keyboard and what
did the piano never ended and then we
actually iterated there and created a
higher fidelity concept mocks then it
was pretty much a bit of endless
iteration really rapid experimentation
on what was possible and what's
possibilities how many touch points did
the ipad app have this was really early
on when the ipad first came out and we
didn't actually know how many touch
points ipad had and the add to turn out
to have 11 at that point in time which
require two people to test that out
unless you have your ten fingers and
your nose and so it's sort of like a
really fun experimentation to find out
that there's actually 11 touch points
and then we just asked as a possible to
have a spiral key for it is this
playable is it fun and I think we found
that relaunch their magic piano on iPads
one of the first iPad apps when the iPad
launched and with its bigger screen
multi touch points it presented us an
opportunity to challenge it users on
what they thought of us is traditional
piano and where they thought if they
could play just want to take a step here
like with all their endless
experimentation in iteration there's a
lot of like because well heads down
buried it's pretty important to take
interludes in between so I kind of want
to just inject a little bit hero like
sometimes at the fun that we have when
we develop it this is us who after we
created magic fiddle which was a federal
app on the iPad that we launched as
Christmas we decided that we would go
out caroling on the streets we went to
Fisherman's Wharf was kicked out did not
realize you need an artist license in
order to play there so these photos are
gathered before we were kicked out and
then we moved on to done the cable
streetcars turns out a lot of places new
licenses
want to play on the streets didn't
realize that and the next one is we do a
lot of Nate late-night hacking and
sometimes you know it can't be all about
development we don't go to the gym very
often do have an exercise day and
sometimes you just got let out some
energy buttons inspiration this is good
and what developers late at night at
office very interesting this at you did
not stop Thorvald that mr. you know even
though some lights were I'm going to go
on that so that was just an interjection
that on you know when you're
experimenting iterating just know that
you should have fun should look to other
places for your inspiration and
sometimes you do have to let out some
some energy maybe get get away from it
to come back to it and now I think it
comes to the second point they said that
I've you've got a product what's the
business behind it for anyone that's
built an app here I think you probably
have gone through the initial reasoning
behind whether you should launch the app
is free or is your launch apps paid app
what are you going to do with in-app
purchase and how that would affect your
monetization strategy for us we decided
that earlier this year that we would
take magic piano to the iphone and we
were launched it as a free act it was
smells first free app we all our
previous apps before we're paid and we
actually want to just to test the
experiment and what just really a little
bit quickly of what magic piano does
so we were pretty excited when the
pianos were free if you can't tell and
not only that was we found out that we
found out that free users paid this was
something that we didn't really realize
before we didn't know if it's going to
work but for users pay users were paying
for virtual currency inside the app in
order to buy more magic candle songs to
play and and with free the number of
users that can grow and I can now get
into the app was much much higher than
what we would I see if the app was a
paid app and so in terms of monetary
monetization which is surprised at the
percentage of users who are willing to
pay and actually pay much more than if
the app was just 99 cent app because now
within the app we had different pricing
packs for the virtual currency that were
much higher than the initiative an
initial 99 cent app with a cost and so
going free brought us more users and we
may money and that was actually a really
big realization of experimentation on it
and we didn't actually do anything else
inside the app but just take the
original mechanic and add an in virtual
currency to it and I think the third
lesson then we went free is one of the
first lessons at you that we learned
when we went for you were really excited
but um within the first two to three
days we we got an insurmountable amount
of daily actually melted down our data
warehouse in our database so we were
like literally blind because we were
within two to three days we've had over
a hundred seventy million events and
these were so inside the app we ensured
many events I would be able to tell us
what the users were clicking on with
screens ever
going through and literally within the
first two or three days it brought our
whole database not only that our
database was connected to our other
carafes or brought down our other apps
this was a very unexpected I think we're
really excited our database melted we
had no idea where users were doing our
house were affected this was a big data
problem and so it was something we
weren't prepare for and then also
realized that before we were just we
weren't being very smart about what data
we were tracking we were literally
actually instrumented every button click
inside the application so anytime you
click it was it would record and logging
back and then send that up but what we
realized was that there were two button
clicks was just go to screen and back
from Spring which accounted for over
sixty percent I have all these events
and it was actually not in form of
informative at all I mean people were
going back and forth a lot but what we
really wanted to study was actually user
flows through funnels a key user flows
and we could have instrumented does much
more smarter than just blindly
instrument all the button clicks and
thinking oh yeah we'll look at the data
later so definitely what we learned here
is that we could if we had thought ahead
about the time about what the keys are
photos that we really wanted to study we
could focus on instrumenting dough
possibly not collected a ton of useless
data and be able to not meld our
database but I think then back to the
data point though is now that we have
all this data and then going free is not
just a simple pricing decision because
now before we could count on at least a
paid install and be sure that Elise when
the user bought the applet has some pre
just some inkling or predisposition to
be engaged with the app because they
know a little bit about what the app is
about they pay for it with free all that
goes out the window and just because a
user downloads the app now it doesn't
mean we're going to make a sale and so
it required us really changing the way
about thinking about how we deliver
measure and tune our engagement before
and after to app goes life and
especially after the appt goes life and
because most often will realize is what
you launch the app
it is not what your end up with
sometimes with even the first week and
so I just want to kind of show you how
in terms of tuning everything we really
had to kind of become rigorous about our
business data and analyze it on a daily
weekly basis so we quickly adapted how
we instrumented measured you can user
engagement and monetization and kind of
focus on a couple key metrics and
because now we can't just look at the
ranking charts and the pay sales we have
to dig deep monitor it on daily basis so
just some example like the daily active
user is a key metric that we ought to
track a lot and using that you can
actually start seeing that there are
cycles and trends to when users come
back to the app and with a free with a
magic piano we actually push new content
and new songs out regularly so now we
plan on content release strategy in a
way to maximize the new content either
to bring users back to the app when the
active users are Louis or to capitalize
on premium content when we know that the
users are highest and will push to them
that there's a new premium content in
the app and then looking at here's
another one we the repeat versus
first-time user visit is actually really
interesting metric we realized very
quickly that most of our daily active
users are actually from the repeat users
and this is actually interesting because
most users ask you make purchases within
the first few sessions of the absolute
that makes sense right if I bought got
bought some coins I'm going to come back
and spend more at it but the high values
is still from users coming back so you
know just this made us realize that
before we're at you're focusing on just
one experience getting people into decor
but this made us realize we actually
have to focus and realize that there's a
difference when people first come in
there's a first time user flow that we
really have to engage with and we push
people back we actually have to figure
out the magnets maximize the repeat
users how do you give them more
interesting things to do and possibly
even show them different storefront
different
songs different things in order to
engage in more so another thing that we
look at a lot is sort of the lifetime
value of the user and so no need a lot
of time that value of the user helps us
to plan understand the value of our
business so a high level the lifetime
value of user is the value of your users
spend a nap mine is your cost of
acquisition that's easier said than done
for free and because with paid at least
we know that every user had an initial
value with free many more variables are
playing into the calculation so we don't
have a simple formula and what we do is
a bit of guesswork intuition and logic
throwing right now but I kind of want to
show you like some of the key
monetization metrics that we track the
dollars per active user so this is
across all boards across all the active
users dollars for active users is
actually a measure that we we monitor
constantly and on weekly level again you
can see the cyclic values under dollars
per active users if our active users
increase but our dollar value drop then
this could indicate that we're not i
crying these are sort of right channels
they're not coming in with an intention
to play maybe it's coming where
acquaintance from another channel where
they're just launching to happen leaving
or maybe there's something else and
we're not doing another value that we
look as if dollars the average value per
purchase of the people that perches what
is the average driver that's going on so
monitoring this trend kind of lets us
know whether we're pricing our in-app
purchases optimally and turning
accordingly just want to show a case
study this is one thing this is our
store inside to app inside magic piano
these are the virtual currency packs
that people buy you can pay different
prices to get more virtual currency
packs we actually did several iterations
based on Jimmy and data Alice analysis
to see what order do place the packs in
what is a price value as a similar paths
when we initially launched we actually
had a 99-cent value as 99-cent pack
immediately so you can see that we tried
a 99-cent followed by a 299 for try 99
followed by 199 and we did of our 99
entry and we continue to iterate on this
this is one of our first iterations so
you can see that
there's a 99 cents we had 276 foreign
transaction when we have 199 entry we
actually had a higher value per average
value per transaction overall and so it
was actually a surprising to learn that
having a higher price point for entry
actually did not lower our monetization
and actually increase it it was kind of
counterintuitive because we felt like
you know we must have a 99-cent pack for
all the people who didn't want to spend
more 99 cents and so if you notice that
now when I started that last moonshot we
now actually ended up at 299 or is our
first entry point pricing it just took a
lot of iteration and testing we spent
several weeks of looking at the data and
definitely nurse their policy flaws but
this is like one of the things that
realized we need to play with I think
the Bitcoin and here's another hard
lesson we learn registration really
sucks we went free and we're like we're
going to get all these three users
really neat their data because and we
need really need a way to contact them
and so we got to put in register we
gotta put your registration barriers and
so this is this is a hard struggle and a
design philosophy for us most of our
apps are you could get in right into it
you can start playing immediately
registration is really an optional thing
and registration on mobile is paying for
registration is painful everywhere it's
especially more painful on mobile and so
we really but the other aspect of is it
registration is so good for the user
they just don't know it if they register
they keep all their songs they keep all
their performances they vote losses they
delete the app I mean so they just don't
know it so we felt like okay well we're
going free we need to at least or over
registration barriers so what we did and
this is a very bad thing that we learned
so register his sucks it was a hard
lesson that we learned we put in a
registration barrier right before they
could exchange their small efforts
there's a very logical reasoning at the
time we let them by their similar paths
without registering of course you spend
your money go spend your money but if
you're going to use it you gotta
register but a part you're going to
register at this point you've already
had two intent to buy so don't you want
to use it and to use your to use your
smooth oh you have to register not
really people were on getting into the
login and so sorry about all the numbers
but the natural drop of is we were
getting twenty percent of users
successfully registering this really
sucked i mean we love that they gave us
money but really want them to be engaged
and play with it app and really use up
more of it and so this was an incredibly
painful thing did something we're
definitely still trying to learn and
figure out better and trying to figure
out like what is the right balance of
registration when is the right time to
throw it up did we just do it you know
blatantly from the beginning do we sneak
it in on them and we haven't to be
honest founder found the right answer
and it's a hard one because we really
want to talk to our users this kind of
brings me to our to my six point which
is and last point at the end of the day
it's all about the users whatever we do
design-build is really nothing if the
user lock delighted by it and so as
spill our philosophies are our chief
marketing officers are our users so this
shows this is a kind of a video wall of
users who are using our appt down the
left side user who are using a key
paying the IMT ping app which is a the
elder changer voice people created
videos in themselves uploaded it to
their underwrite initially is just a ton
of people playing the ocarina and we've
done a lot of studies on this and really
it's fairly obvious but i do on the date
the most powerful recommendation is
words for your word amount from friends
and so if someone would just show or
friend their app or even just like hey
you go check it out
is the most powerful recommendation and
when people come in they're the most
engaged so obviously users are very
important and I think that's the last
point here I want to make a set without
with our apps our system is all about
enabling to social connections and maybe
it's a little bit hard to imagine so I
want to kind of show the case study
through our glee karaoke app so just
really quickly this is a Greek karaoke
app it was built in conjunction with Fox
which has a GUI television show about
people singing in glee clubs and so for
us this is really aligned with our
vision about people singing together so
it's basically a singing app which pitch
a pitch it cried sooo and harmonizes
your voice and visualizes there lyrics
but also what we did is that allows you
to sing with your friends it allows you
to join any song from anyone in the
world just really because you could
record us on invite your friend to join
it or you could go to the globe you can
go to go find someone's performance and
just click join and add your voice on
top of it so you could instantly create
duets massive group songs etc so when we
were first building Glee what we really
initially wanted to focus on what we
thought was would be the most compelling
thing is friends people inviting their
friends to sing with them going hey you
know join me on a song and sing happy
birthday and that's really the use case
that resolved would be the most
compelling and the most interesting that
was really the social that we really
focused on but I think as Glee has grown
what we seen learn from to add there are
actually three levels of sorts of
connections that naturally happen and so
recognizing these levels of social
connections i needa products being able
them each level is something that that
we have learned from Glee so when show
you the three levels connection there
first is very obvious is just first
users should be able to use that connect
with their own family and friends so
here's an example of performance of a
three-year-old seeing with her uncle who
there's a great
so hot diamond star how I wonder what
you are so you can see the uncle is in
bahria and the nice list cross country
so this is an example where honestly for
Denise she's three years old it wasn't
about the application on iphone she's
just seeing with her uncle and for her
uncle this is a song as she sent her
knees and you know it really wasn't
about the timing she was quite off
because you know but it's really about
the scene together and now they have
this experience that they wouldn't
normally have and it's on the world so
that's the first level social connection
if the second level of socialization is
that users should be able to make
serendipitous connections that were not
possible before here's the performance
of four strangers in four different
locations who met on the app and then
decided to get together to create an
acapella quartet performance a mr.
salmon and as just one point out that
one's in UK ones in Australia and into
our in the u.s. somewhere bring me a
dream making the cutest gives you
this
so this is actually really surprised
what I mean we hope for it but we didn't
think this would happen these people
found each other sudha app made
connections somehow by leaving comments
on their performances connected and
decided to get together and create a
song and in this song and actually we
didn't make this easy for them at all
within the app the first person has laid
down the track send it to the next
person who lays down their tracks and in
the next person lay down the track and
it's all through just listening to buy
year and timing it correctly this is an
acapella performance that there's
nothing helping them on the screens and
it was talking people were making
friends here we were making social
connections that that we didn't think
was possible and we didn't make easy for
them and they were doing it despite of
us and that was amazing and that was
something that that we knew that we
actually should have tried to help and
that's actually in the future designs of
our product is something that we
consider a lot another thing I just want
to note here is that when we launched we
we actually realized this was another
surprising thing that people were
actually much more willing to share
their performances with strangers than
with their friends so our initial
assumption totally went out the window
as well people were so so so shy about
their singing and there were like no I'm
not going to share with my friends which
doesn't it make fun of me but they were
perfectly happy to go onto the globe
share with other people and find other
connections and do that way so and I
think lastly I think the last point is
that we want to be able to create social
system where users who participate
together as a community without barriers
so here's example the day after the
earthquake happened in Japan one of our
users from glee karaoke posted this post
on our facebook wall she's basically she
has sang a song lean on me she has
started that song Naomi and glee karaoke
and was
came for people to join her song from
anywhere strangers from all over the
world resale dispos we just put in apps
as easy for users to find and we
honestly did not know what would happen
he saw has now over 3000 singers and let
me just
this is incredibly amazing I expected
for us when we first ugly we were like
oh my gosh it's been sound terrible if
anything went over 10 people join it I'm
he's going to be all the audio
recordings going to be off it's just
going to be terrible but but we were
like okay well but maybe that's probably
something I won't happen it's going to
take a lot for people to join it and and
then you can see from here this is like
over 3000 seniors at once everyone's
voice is joined together actually didn't
matter like if your timing was off there
were comments on the song people saying
you know what I didn't ever think I was
seeing a sign but it didn't really
matter which is being part of the song
really just wanted to join to be a part
of this on and have my know my voice as
part of it even though it's not the one
that stands out and so this really
taught us that you know creating a
system that allow that allows these
people to participate together is really
incredibly important for people to come
together in unexpected ways and so I
think I just want to leave on the last
quote is that hormone wiser the most
profound technologies that are ones that
disappear and that's sort of how we
approach product design development
