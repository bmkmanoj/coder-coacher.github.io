dart tips we talk about exceptions
you know those errors that bubble up
from deep within the bowels of your
program and tell you where something
went wrong watch this episode so you
won't be caught off guard the next time
you run into a problem let's get started
darn uses exceptions when an error or
other exceptional event occurs inside
your program when a situation arises
that cannot be handled by the program or
runtime for example when the system runs
on a memory or invalid input was
provided normal program execution stops
and an exception is created this
exception object is then thrown down the
call stack looking for someone to catch
it if no code handles the exception that
program exits common error cases include
out of memory invalid input incorrect
state transitions meaningless arguments
and more the dart SDK classifieds most
problems as errors and thus most of the
exception class names in the SDK end
with error the name error is shorter
than exception and generally it's
nothing exceptional about many of the
problems they're flat-out errors is in
don't do it for this video we'll use the
named exception to mean errors or
exceptions thrown by the program or
runtime normally you know an exception
or errors occurred when you encounter a
stack trace they look something like
this this report is useful information
to help you determine what happened and
where it happened for example we know
there was an unhandled exception the
exception was bad state door already
closed the problem occurred inside the
open door method at line 14 in episode
0-9 dark I feel like as a game of Clue
in the parlor with the candlestick on
line 14 we can also trace the execution
of the program from the main function to
the open door method this is very useful
information when diagnosing and
debugging exceptions okay with that
introduction let's look at some code
there are four specific concepts to
explore throw try catch and finally each
shows up as syntax that you can use in
your program in general exceptions in
dart aren't that invasive for example
you can throw any non null object dart
methods and functions do not declare the
exceptions they can throw and you aren't
required to catch four exceptions a
method might throw the signal an error
or exception has occurred use throw this
is also known as raising exception
here's an example if the door is locked
you can't open it
so the program signals this problem by
throwing an instance of state
remember you can throw any non null
object as an exception the darkness DK
shifts classes for many common
exceptions and you can extend the
exception class to create your own more
specific exceptions for example you may
want to create a specific door locked
error class here's an example we'll
cover classes in a future episode but
for now it's enough to understand the
door lock there is a specific type of
state error when an object is thrown the
current function or method does not
continue and the exception object
travels through the stack looking for
someone to handle it normally you should
handle exceptions gracefully and provide
some sort of mitigation or feedback to
the user use the catch Clause to capture
exceptions here's an example wrap any
code that might throw an exception
inside of a try block exceptions thrown
from within the try block are handled by
the catch block the exception variable
is the exception object itself the stack
trace object is no surprise here at the
stack trace it's important to note that
if open door throws an exception then
enter is never called controlled the
program jumps to the catch block on
exception if an exception is caught you
will see the following output the first
line is the exception object and the
following lines are from the stack trace
object here's a short example you can't
of course name these variables Harvie
like you can even omit the stack trace
some methods can throw different
exceptions based on different conditions
for example the enter method can throw a
state error if the door is not open or
it can throw an argument error if the
expected argument is no here's how you
catch different types of exceptions you
can use on to specify what kinds of
exceptions you want to catch you can
specify multiple on clauses and you can
specify catch-all as the last catch
Clause you can use on or catch or both
if you don't care about the actual
exception object you can omit catch
sometimes you need to ensure code runs
no matter what whether or not an
exception is thrown use the finally
Clause to make sure code is always run
here's an example if no exception is
thrown finally runs if an exception is
thrown from within the try Clause catch
runs and then finally runs in this
example the room is always reset to
recap dart as familiar try catch finally
clauses you can throw any non all object
as an exception and many common error
cases are found in the dart SDK you
could have many catch clauses for a try
each for specific exception type the
finally Clause runs whether or not an
exception was thrown client code is not
forced to catch for exceptions so it's
up to you to determine when and how to
handle potential errors thanks for
