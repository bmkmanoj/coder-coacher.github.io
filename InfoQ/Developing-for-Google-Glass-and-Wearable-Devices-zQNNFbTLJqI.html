call me max that's okay i'm from
argentina right i have been doing web
development of mobile development since
1995 right so a long time ago i'm also a
training i'm doing training for new
silico they have a booth there so you
can go there and see what cool trainings
they have I am the author of these two
books from o'reilly media from in the
mobile web and jquery mobile um we will
talk about glass right and wearable
technologies so first shots a big idea a
quick guide on the ceiling what is the
glass worries something called the
timeline and the browser okay that's the
thing we are going to cover in 30-35
minutes so we can try to keep some space
for questions so please questions at the
end or after right I will be here so if
you have any question on black glass or
other wearable technologies I will be
glad to answer some quick disclaimer I'm
not from google right I'm part of a
program called explorers so I have an
independent vision of this device in
particular and kind of apps that we can
create and i'm pretty sure that some of
you right known as some kind of smart
people wearing glasses right so we are
going to talk about vulnerable devices
right on the sometimes right the first
thing that you like imagine when i'm
saying something like this is day to
remember get smart right I'm kind of a
phone shoe but when we're talking about
wearable devices we are talking about
right now smart glasses smartwatches
mark closest maybe and probably smart
shoes right sending information from the
floor right to our devices or something
like that and so that's basically
wearable devices and before talking
about the glass let me show you for
example here I have a SmartWatch right
just to give an idea of the this first
release of Mark was that are there this
is the sony smartwatch right so it has
some apps inside right so of course you
have facebook right Twitter I'm not
saying you are going to post updates
from here
for now right but at least you have like
notifications in this case the calendar
is saying to me that I should be here
right making this talk I can install
apps in fact there is even a browser
right a web browser for the SmartWatch I
can load pages right so i can even load
that reinforce website so this is a kind
of the first release of smart phones out
there right so it's low in the whole
page right of course I mean it's not
really optimized for smartwatch but it's
there and it's working ok this is the
kind of experiences that we will start
to see in the next few months or even a
year or two years ok so it's not just
the glass right we can create apps or
services or websites to different kind
of devices including classes but now
let's talk about the glass experience
right because let's say is the first big
device out there that is for for these
wearable technologies category so first
let me show you this video there is no
audio so don't worry so this is a book
signed either a few months ago here in
San Francisco influent conference and
these were the first time I could
basically record the whole book signing
from my perspective right so this is the
kind of things that you can do with
these devices that are not interfering
with my hands for example right so I
don't need a camera man behind me so I
can do some kind of stuff like this of
course that recording on taking pictures
it's not the only thing that you can do
with these devices right sometimes it
feels like all the people are talking
just about taking pictures and recorded
videos this is another example so before
san Francisco has been last week in
Europe 10 days ago basically and that's
basically taline in Estonia so I was
there right looking that nice view and
basically the glass was suggesting
Nissan attractions by the way this is a
screenshot so this is not Photoshop
right this is a real screenshot
and when i was there i would say okay i
want to go back to a hotel so I asked
the class to get me back to the hotel
and get automatic directions right to
get there in UCD that I don't know and I
don't know the language rights tonian so
first let's talk about some myths on the
on the glass experience first some
people think that this is some kind of
sci-fi virtual reality glass that
immerse me in a new reality the thing is
that Dan's are true if you look at me we
are we are going to have eye contact
right so it's not basically in front of
my of my view it's in one part at the
top the next myth says that it seems
like the class is the evolution of the
mobile phones right and it's not exactly
that this at this point at this first
point it's more than a companion right
the same for the watch so it's more than
a companion that will help me doing some
tasks without using my phone so some
just quick ideas this is not it's not a
screen basically that is in front of my
eye it's a projection that I'm trying to
see a projection there right so if I
turn it on now I'm seeing something
around that writes not I don't need to
change photos some people think that
it's uncomfortable because you need to
change focus that's not the idea so now
I will plug myself to give you a Chester
really really quick introduction to the
experience right again I'm not here to
to to demo that the product itself here
about talking about how you can develop
services but it's important to
understand how the system works to
understand idea right so of course this
is exactly what I'm seeing the main
difference is that for my point of view
it's transparent right but I can
basically sham between content here like
like something about hangovers so that's
you right eight minutes ago so
information that I have from different
like apps that i have installed here of
course I'm pictures there is some
interest information here that the
detent out there is the North America
largest tenth right i have received that
information because i'm here and i can
click here and go to a cell force
website right from here can i browse the
web yes I can and I will show you that
later so of course we have this why I
have more information here for example
if I want you to go to Google right
because there is an event in Google
right now or two twin peaks I have the
information here to go directly and I
can use the ok glass take a picture I'm
pretty sure you have heard this a lot
right and I can share this directly with
Twitter Facebook Google+ or any other up
in just one second from so for from
yesterday we also have now some native
apps here ok there are some cool apps
for example I can say ok glass translate
this and now I can look for some free
well I should change maybe languages for
example i can english spanish or english
french and i can try to look something
in English this is not comfortable right
you know that the thing is that I should
have something near me in English and it
will give me the translation directly so
which alive up right as offline up so
this is the one on one experience on the
glass now let's go back to to the
presentation to talk about development
right so but it's important to
understand experience as you can see
it's not just a mobile phone UI on my
eye I know in my eye so it's a different
device it's not just transparent apps
the same apps that we have a mobile
devices but with a transparent
background is more than that right and
it's a limited augmented reality so it's
not like right now showing me your faces
and your facebook account right because
it's adding the information there now
let's talk about the classwork class
where is the name for the software that
we can develop for the class ok
and we have again this eternal question
right native versus well but now is the
glass version of the native versus web
that at this point its native versus
cloud right so for the class now i can
create native apps with the shitty k
since this week right there is a preview
version of the shitty k glass
development kit available it's based on
java it's based on the android sdk so if
you if you're an Android developer you
can start doing android glass apps using
the Android SDK or you can use a mirror
API the mirror API is cloud-based that
means that that application will run on
your server it can be a shava shava
php.net wherever several sign language
you are using right and you're going to
use just or even some self or services
you just going to use some HTTP calls
right to the to the Google Cloud to send
and receive information so i already did
them i will skip this part so how can
you stall at right now on the glass
there is a website called my glass this
is at least now because we are still in
the prototype stage right i go to a
website how many of you have installed
candy crush on facebook no one i have a
couple of ESS some chai faces but
basically it's the same thing to install
apps on the glass today i need to give
permission to that app from a website or
from my mobile phone to get access to my
class right that's the way to install
app today and that that it is in the
case of glassware that works on the
server so the server will use https to
communicate with a google cloud and it
will say ok go on and say this guy that
is right now in San Francisco that they
have the the largest and in North
America and Google will will send that
content to me right so this is how it
works if I click if I do something if I
action on that particular content that
action will go back to Google
and Google will communicate with you
using HTTP or HTTPS so it will basically
have like a web service that will listen
in from Google's cause that's the idea
right so that's the mirror API you can
you can like set up your app from from
the website or from from the mobile
phone and even you can get information
from the users behavior right and and to
adapt the Europe to the use of behavior
but for example CNN app allows me to
like set up different kind of alerts
that I would like to receive on my glass
so the glass work for class where we
have two options now the mirror API
server side or the offline GDK the she
DK permission to access my camera for
example that translation app in terms of
has permission to work offline and it
can like listen for some services I can
also for example start a time or
something like that offline I don't need
connection for the mirror API I need
connection right and usually you will
need to create a new architecture from
your point of view server side or
clients is not like okay let's take the
same code base we have for Android and
create the GDK application or let's take
the mobile website we have and convert
that to to a glass you need to sit down
have a great brainstorming to see what
kind of apps and what kind of services
you can provide you a user right that's
that should be the idea now let's talk
about the timeline for a minute a
timeline is basically passed now on
future and is the basic UI of the glass
so I will plug myself in again
no this is not the one I want this one
okay oh I need to plug both sides of the
USB cable okay here we are so this is
the timeline right so when I turn on the
glass I'm on my person that's why you're
seeing right the time there I'm
basically I have a timeline that is
crossing here my body right basically my
past is on my back and my future is on
my front so basically you are my future
right now so I'm sorry sorry of me so
for example if I want to see something
from my past like a picture I took I
need to bring it from my back right so I
I do this Chester from my back right I'm
doing this from my back so there is a
lag in the animation that's basically
the USB cable here it works really well
right and I'm from my future I mean for
example I can try to see things that if
i want to go to twin peaks you take some
great pictures it's in my future the
same have the same for things i need to
do for example that's the weather my
agenda my schedule places nearby so
think that i might want to see you later
i can also check here my flight on my
future so that's the timeline ok so it's
important to understand the timeline
because it's basically the UI of the
class so there is no applications menu
right or home screen is just the
timeline and we are going to do great
time line items right that are known as
cards that's where we are going to do
cards ok so that's a car every rectangle
you saw there it's a car that's the main
unit of a glass work we have different
kind of cards like for example if I take
a picture that card is a sip think our
it goes to my past I have a standard
cast the type i have received from CNN
or any class where they go to the past
and i also have pink art important
things that i will need later that go to
my future and they are pinned there they
are stuck there
again I send cards locally with a GD k
app or through HTTP from my server
that's how I send cards to the user and
it's probable that the user will never
see our cal because all the cards are in
my past and it's an infinite paths okay
so and that's okay the user will use the
glass when the user wants so that the
idea here is to send information to be
there when the user needs it okay so we
can send texts cards we can send image
and video cards or HTML cards we can
design cards in HTML HTML 5 and we can
have a card actions so every kargin has
a menu inside how can I listen to these
actions if it's if it's a native app
from Java locally if it's a cloud based
app I will get the response on a web
service ok Google is going to call me
and you will say hey that user has just
clicked that action on that car and you
need to have all the data base to
support that on your on your side how to
reply using the same technique you can
update the car you can send a new car
and now with with gtk with a shitty k
with native apps we have like cards so
car that are live so I can have like a
clock or a stopwatch or an app that is
counting my steps while I'm walking
something like this it's a live card ok
and now we have also immersion mode for
 for the shitty k the immersion mode
means that I will trigger an app like ok
class translate this and basically I
will get the full screen experience for
that up it can be a game also okay
that's that's called immersive mode we
have contextual events like co-location
your app can read user's location all
the time so you can know all the time
where the user is if you if the user is
granting permission for that right and
you can do something about that like
sending or update the information that
will
useful for that user we can also
subscribe to the share so if i take a
picture right now and then I click Share
I can share that picture to all the
glassware that are listen to that action
okay and I can also attach my glass word
to do clay glass menu so that's why I
can say ok glass play a game for example
and it will open a game so the car is
the King on the on the timeline right
that's the main unit we have menu items
the dark actions over cards contextual
events such as geolocation and we can
keep we can weaken like choose between
cloud-based apps or native apps at least
today now the browser can i browse the
web here yes there are two way to to
trigger the browser right now using
google all through a guard action so i
can have an action that will trigger a
website okay so last quick demo so you
can see how the browser works because i
think it it's interesting let me plug in
I hope Google can make a wireless
screencast later that will work great so
i can i can google something i can say
ok glass Google dreamforce for example
or I can if you look here it was
somewhere with more so these are all
actions right I can go to the this 10
car and I can save you website and you
will open the browser now writes loading
the website the big question is usually
how can i browse the web using my glass
right let's hope the Wi-Fi is working
properly yeah it's loading so basically
we have two ways to to browse the it's
downloading images i think so i can use
my finger to scroll right and even if
you think can you read that yeah I can
read that grocery faster with the
world's number one sensor I can
basically read what I'm seeing here if
it's a mobile-optimized okay here we
have yeah we have the website and the
next question is how can you click let's
say I want to click on free trial so
doing this right no so that the idea
right it's an experimental browser so
I'm not sure if it's going to be the
final version and a quick warning it
looks really weird from your point of
view right from my point of view it's
okay so i will use two fingers i will
put your fingers here and if you look
there there is a pointer right so i move
my head now and I point where once you
click so they're right free trial then I
can say okay once you click there okay
I'm not saying the base experience but
it's really nice I mean if you try it
was a clever way to basically do the
pointing thing so for the browser let me
okay for the browser we can scroll or
point and click and if you if you know
what responsive web design is is they're
willing to adapt website to different
screen sizes you can use these values
right to to query on the glass so you
can create like a specific version for
class of course we are not so many guys
out there
right now because they still in in a
preview mode in the Developer Preview
move and explorers mode but you will be
able to do something especially for the
glass in the future even if you are an
html5 developer you can use video audio
in html5 device motion the device motion
API is the API that allows me to read
have movement because i'm reading
accelerometer and gyroscope so i can use
javascript to real my health movement
not my thoughts yet and i can also use
the scroll and touch events okay
unfortunately no she location a speech
or camera API from the child script
point of view yet so the browser is
better than bad and it looks like right
from your point of view it's a silly
experimental I pretty sure a new ideas
will come on how to browse the web or
browse content and I'm excited about the
idea of the car plus html5 so for
example from your server you can send
the user the user can be your user your
customers your employees you can send a
car saying something that I mean there
is no more stock on that product or
wherever and the user can see the car
and you can trigger a website from there
and a website can be an html5 app right
or game or wherever you want so I've
excited about you and integrate native
apps you can use html5 and a car to
trigger that html5 up so I don't have a
glass how many of you have glasses I'm
seeing wonder right so you can go and
grab this guy so if you don't have a
glass right first don't steal one why
what we can disable remotely the glasses
and you're going to help so try to note
still one there is a official simulator
call a playground from google it's just
to see how the cards would look like
there is also glass simcom where you can
upload leave in a picture and see how
your your car will look like on their
own the real
work right it's just a simulation of how
offered from a design point of view
right just that if you want some
hardcore experiences you can search for
this to get hub project shinola share
and mirror API emulator general sure is
basically some kind of the same Android
because it is an Android device so the
same UI that i have here running on a
phone right so at least you can try to
see how it looks like and the mirror API
emulator is to observe the mirror API
emulator is a way to you to install your
own private cloud right to emulate the
cloud that the Google's cloud to see if
your web services are working or
something like that at the end you will
need a glass right to understand
experience because again it's not the
same thing as a phone it's something
different so you need to understand him
so at the end you will need one okay so
you can go to that website you'll see
where when can you get one and so what's
next for you you can go to the glass
developers website and see all the
documentation you can download source
code and samples so you can start trying
with it a nice ash edge did you go to
the Google Developers YouTube channel
because there are a couple of hours of
video with more information technical
information for developers on how to
develop for the glass for the wearable
technology well there are some
competitors that are coming of the glass
and maybe we are going to see more more
smart watches right so we have the rumor
of a possible i watch from Apple we
don't know right but it's something that
it's it's possible right so the next
year and the next two or three years
will be really important for wearable
technologies and it will be there the
test for this technology on the society
on the community to see if they're going
to work or not so I mean we have the
next er to to see if this is going to be
the future or not I'm not really sure
yet it's a possible future for sure but
it depends on the society right so
wrapping up for the glass you need to
understand experience
right now you can develop apps class
were using the mirror API using the
shitty k the native SDK or html5 app for
the browser okay and remember this is
just the beginning this is just starting
okay and if you don't like this you can
showing these guys right stop the
cyborgs they have even there's those
nice sneaker stickers that you can put
your house or on your office so thank
you now we have some questions we have
time for questions thanks any question
we have a microphone okay so the
question is about connectivity right so
what kind of connectivity do I have here
on the glass so the glass today this
particular product I remember this is a
prototype has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so in
this case it can use your phone right
and use the connection you're on your
phone can be 3g 4g Wi-Fi wherever you
want but it has Wi-Fi by itself so i
don't need my phone basically right so
under the second part of the question is
do you think that we will have like a 3g
the future 3g glass I don't know right
i'm not from google so but remember this
is the first prototype so i'm pretty
sure that maybe next year when the
device is will be in the market we will
have device it from different vendors
right cheap device is expensive devices
of different levels of devices so we
would have divisive with 4g with Richie
without that only Wi-Fi so it will be
like a smart phones right it will be a
message ok thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
