today we're breaking open the
cyanogenmod project with Chris Sawyer's
who is responsible for their
infrastructure okay so um you obviously
are now a recent resident of San
Francisco yeah so we're lucky to have
you this is one of our first episodes
and we're hoping to do a lot more of
these so how do you like San Francisco
star with that loving it so far yeah yep
and so do you find a lot of folks in the
Sanhedrin kind of community in the area
as well like as your users or other
folks that could you be the project I'm
sure there's a ton most people that I've
talked to once i mention it they've
heard of the project which is pretty
cool and I've never been anywhere else
or you can be walking down the street
and just hear a conversation that you
can kind of relate to so it's been
pretty fun so far nice to love it as
well so before we get into that gives
the details let's start with what is
cyanogen to you and I guess you know to
your team so we are we consider
ourselves a fork of Android or at least
I do at this point we basically take the
open-source version of Android and we
try to get it to run on as many devices
as we can usually carriers want you to
buy the next latest and greatest phone
once the older ones have kind of you
know stop selling so we try to keep the
phones and devices up to date with the
latest version of Android even if the
carrier doesn't really care about that
phone anymore don't want to say care
about but they've dropped support for it
I think a good example is the t-mobile
g1 which we kept alive probably through
Eclair I believe maybe even a little bit
further and that never really got an
update past donut from t-mobile
everybody goes oh yeah and so it's okay
so the guy who brings me to my next
question so what are the goals obviously
keeping the old card we're live is a
noble goal and it makes a lot of
other words were just you know creating
a bunch of junk all the time right as a
society so what other bowls you guys
have obviously there's the feature the
overclocking there's better kind of apps
there's a lot of customization custom
permissions so can you tell them to tell
us a little bit about what what how do
you you know first of all come up with
these goals and then what are those so I
think the goals are kind of driven by
just whoever's involved in the project
one of our biggest goals is to have
cyanogenmod running on as many devices
as possible and that's just always kind
of been a goal ever since we started
getting more people involved and more
devices on the list of supported devices
it's actually one of our biggest
challenges to keeping the code bases all
clean and separate but besides that we
do care quite a bit about just having a
large feature set most of our users or
power users so they require a little bit
of knowledge to actually get signage
Ahmad running on their phone so we want
to give them as many bells and whistles
and knobs that they can tweak as
possible but also maintaining a good
user experience ok with that and so
these bells and whistles I mean you do
expose things just because you can or
you expose things because you feel like
there's an itch to scratch like you know
someone in Santa giraud wants to be able
to overclock their their device and
that's how do you know the overclocking
feature gets added so like where how you
come up with these it's usually how it
starts if somebody has an idea I want to
overclock okay well let's make it happen
another big feature that we had was
quiet hours where you can kind of set
your phone to not make any sound or just
more tweaks around how the notification
system works time-based and I believe
that was somebody's idea that just got
implemented and usually as long as the
feature doesn't interfere with anything
too low level we'll we'll take it as you
know as long as it's stable and well
thought out and developed well and how
do you integrate the features so
speaking of you know kind of well
thought out so right so obviously you
know you can just
provide a dump of all the features like
a bunch of you know check boxes list
selectors smallness on like our Sun
features more and more important than
others are some hidden behind kind of
advanced settings is so not to overwhelm
you know your average user or all are
your users essentially as you said power
users and they want essentially see
that's what they feed on right as much
control as possible yes I think there's
some debate around that right now how we
present these settings to the user
historically they've been all in a
cyanogenmod settings area within the
settings application prior to that I
think it was a separate app that
actually was on the phone that control
all of these things moving forward you
know we've talked about just trying to
put more constraints around what
features can make it into that settings
category to provide a better user
experience and which ones you know kind
of get buried a little bit deeper so I
think moving forward there's probably
going to be a better balance of you know
here's the very easy to understand
features and kind of on and off switches
and then a little bit deeper into the
settings of the phone you'll find you
know the the very fine grain knobs that
you can tweak mm-hmm does that mean that
you're kind of expanding the reach of of
the of the user base like all of a
sudden cyanogenmod becomes more
accessible to the average user who may
not or may feel threatened by all these
knobs that one of the goals I mean that
sounds like a nice goal I'm sure that
it's a goal in somebody's mind we just
kind of you know and do things as we go
okay so it's tough course well fair
enough so I mean and this is you know
this is actually one of the things we'd
like to get to obviously you know I you
know a lot of people do open source for
various reasons right and everyone it's
kind of it's a community effort there's
usually no money changing hands so it's
a little more ad hoc so which is that
we're actually all something I would
like to get to kind of the structure
routine but how do you personally
balance out the individuals gold like so
like you may have I don't know you
you're responsible for the
infrastructure
basically you know one of your goals is
to make sure it's available in red you
know the builds are there but as far as
the features you know especially if
their features conflict with one another
how do you go about making that
selection is there some voting process
is there some sort of a community sort
of outreach or other you how do you
incorporate that feedback from the
community and as well as internal wishes
into the into what actually gets built
right I feel like there is a voting
process it's mostly kind of behind the
scenes internally that everybody gets to
express their opinion and ultimately we
just go with whatever the general
consensus of our group of developers is
so if everyone says no we don't want
that feature than we generally will say
okay well that's the decision we've made
so and does do all do all of you have
kind of equal say or some more equal
than others I'm a Shiva yeah I mean
Steve it's his baby it's his project so
you know he gets the final say but we're
trying to be very fair about hearing out
everybody's opinion because it's
important to us I mean we have a lot of
users so we can't just base our
decisions off of what we want so
speaking of users how do you bring the
community into this into the decision
making today's the day support proposed
the features they ask for things is
there some sort of an official channel
through which they communicate back to
you guys um the project's gotten so
large and I've kind of lost touch with
that side of it we do have numerous
people that you know are kind of have a
foot in the door internally to the
development team and they you know let
us know what what the community is
saying and and I'm sure they're i'm sure
the feedback makes its way in properly
and we evaluate it okay but it's pretty
much all you know there's no as far as i
know there's no official channel for
submitting you know major features we do
have a an issue tracker where you can
submit enhancements and things like that
and generally will go through and just
kind of see what's there okay and so
where is the community then like you
know it is it is the community you know
the little does the list of issue
tracker tracking requests there's the
community you know
hangs out on your I don't know G+ page
or on the XDA forums page I mean where
where is your community actually gave
them it's everywhere we have some of
them you know so we have our we have our
website and there's a there's a form
there there's previously most of our
interaction was on xda-developers we
outgrew that very quickly so now we have
our own website or on form our own blog
we had a huge presence on Twitter and
that slowly has are not slowly but very
quickly migrated over to Google Plus
mm-hmm which is I feel like we're the
community mostly kind of hangs out now
okay okay so because when I want a
google things or search for things they
oftentimes come across the XDA website
you know a on topics related to Santa
George project so I'm kind of breaking
you know where should I be asking these
questions we're wish you're being eating
people if I'm looking for help so is it
obvious to people that they kind of the
Google+ and your website is the place to
be I feel like it is XDA has so many
users and so much traffic that one
thread might end up getting way off
topic very quickly yeah I noticed that
the cyanogenmod website is specific to
our rom so we're going to get a better
experience there I think okay so let's
uh go back to features and a couple more
questions then actually had some
questions more more in the community so
when do you when you know you're done
like when do for example I noticed just
recently you said that the senator mod
nine is kind of close to feature
complete or code phrase and you're not
you know starting the the more serious
testing phases to get it to stable
builds but so when how do you decide
when something's done I don't think it's
ever done um we've done enough for
stable right so when it's done is to the
point where we've all been running
cyanogenmod 9 internally on our phones
in a production environment meaning we
don't have to flash your phone back to
stock before we go to work we're going
to have a rough day okay I know Stevie's
is a term might not be a term but like
if his mom can use the phone that's
already the best feature complete at
that point or stable enough so it's
generally
we get to the point where all of the
hardware works all the features that we
want in the release are in place and
working and tested and then we call it
complete but it's you know there's no
real schedule behind it just when it
gets there it gets there I know it's
done when it's done yeah I'm used to the
constant open source but so do you
speaking of you know when your mom can
use it they use all dog food senator mod
it kind of not just yourselves but also
within friends and family like do go out
and get everyone to be using the latest
and greatest and kind of give you their
own honest feedback yeah absolutely I
mean for a while there I was putting
signage and mod builds on my parents for
us and saying you know if it crashes let
me know or you know just trying to get
feedback from them would you tell them
to stay away from those advanced
settings um but it's not that I have to
tell them it just kind of do there
they're buried in there pretty far but
fair enough yeah imagine like cooking
themselves and then an overclocked CPU
everyone okay that's that's interesting
so cyanogenmod 9 what are your
expectations I mean we're going to have
jelly bean announced in two days when do
you think well I mean yeah you're right
maybe so when do you think we're going
to be starting to see you know real
builds like you know go complete builds
on on actual hardware like you know
galaxy tab 10.1 is you know close to
being fully supported so when are we
going to see that soon I hope I mean
that's basically the only timeline i can
give you not because i know something
and I don't want to say it but I just
truly I've been out of the loop for a
while with moving here so basically i'll
expect a text message you know gtalk
message or a phone call at some point
saying hey we're launching or releasing
cm9 tonight make sure everything's going
to be good and that's what notes it's
being released so speaking of that lets
kind of jump to you so you can manage
the infrastructure it's obviously when
this happens and CNC cm9 is out of the
door they're going to be a ton of people
downloading it yeah so what do you do
like what's your what's your day-to-day
job like with respect to the this CM the
community right so I make sure all the
servers are running
and the sites online so my day-to-day
job involves just kind of you know I
don't really do every do something every
day but usually just respond to issues
websites slow websites down take a look
at it when we're in release mode it's
definitely keeping an eye on things
making sure we have enough bandwidth to
cover the number of users that we're
trying to serve files to right off the
bat no we don't have enough bandwidth we
never do it's always kind of a
last-minute scramble to try to find some
mirrors other companies wanting to
donate band with our way to help you
know that initial push of a couple days
of extremely high traffic okay and so do
you guys actually have your own hardware
or do you do cloud like Amazon or
something well if we did amazon we'd all
be broke we enter the project it's open
source so i think the last numbers that
i ran it would cost us six seven
thousand dollars a month to run on i
really really do we have we do have our
own hardware that is all for our build
servers and then all of the web stuff is
it's all least hardware and just data
centers in various places and so so you
managed oh i'm assuming the entire
infrastructure so everything so let's
actually jump to who supports you guys
like who wears the funding for this come
from so it's actually not very expensive
to run the website so that just kind of
runs on its own okay we do have a couple
companies that have donated hardware to
us bite mark is one of them even believe
they're an ISP somewhere in the UK
should know more about them than I do
and just every once in a while we'll
have another isp donate bandwidth to us
there's one called reflected net that's
been great mm-hmm they do other mirrors
or mirror for other open source projects
as well so it's just making contacts in
the community people that use it
cyanogenmod will say hey I work in an
ISP and we have tons of bandwidth do you
need some and that's generally the the
type of you know interaction that we get
so you also then help engage the
folks it you know do the set of the
mirrors right yeah I mean usually will
make a post on Google+ if we're hurting
really bad and say we need some
bandwidth and somebody you know will get
thousands of people saying oh I have you
know this unlimited web host account
over here that you guys are no use and
those we can't because they'll violate
their terms of service almost
immediately but every once in a while
we'll get somebody that can actually
provide us with the amount of bandwidth
we need okay and so obviously two
million users you know that you have
today or two per million plus you know
when CSV when cm9 comes down that's
going to probably explode I hope why why
not look at potentially some kind of
waves of monetizing it to help offset
some of these costs maybe even help pay
for some of your time you know obviously
phones are hot there's a lot of vested
interest in reaching out to the to the
power phone users because it had to be
influencers of others right so you know
why not do something to kind of help
support a community to them I think it
tends to over complicate things and
generally you know we've always had the
thought in the back of her head oh we
could potentially monetize this somehow
but we can ever agree on how and and win
in and you know giving up the time from
our personal lives you know a little
time that we already do have to actually
make that push but even if you kind of
you as the site owner gonna put a little
few google ads but we do and I mean
that's it pays pays the bills that okay
so okay cool so let's kind of jump jump
to to you know the future past cm9 what
are your expectations kind of where do
you see the the project going is it kind
of more of the same is it on the you
know do you have any specific things
your specific goals they would like to
to reach how do you measure success
around those goals like are you trying
to make it more accessible more powerful
a better experience differentiate it
from other roms but what are some of
them you know what the drives your
future development right so I know
Steve's biggest goal and it's probably
mine too is to see a phone ship with
cyanogenmod on it okay so ship from the
manufacturer or the carrier with signage
running on it already okay that's
actually pretty cool and so so are there
any you know if there's anything works I
mean you may not be able to talk about
it but are there any OEMs have expressed
interest in doing that um there's always
a company here and there that you know
stumbles across us and tries to start
that conversation but it's usually a
very small manufacturer in the
conversation doesn't make it too far I
don't know if there's any talks going on
right now I'm sure there are but it's
one of those things that when we get
there we'll get well no head you know I
see so so with I mean with androids
obviously being the the OS for for
tablets as well and tablets not always
ship with these you know modems we are a
lot of kind of complexity comes from I'm
assuming that that that goal could be
more easily reach than then you know in
the previous generation realm android
devices yeah i could i haven't been
following the android tablet seen
actually gave up on android tablets and
bought an ipad a couple weeks ago you
might own excellent it Nexus 7 is coming
up a couple of days rumored and in so I
hear but even then I don't think it's
not an Android problem well it is an
Android problem but it's not specific to
the OS ok there's just not many good
tablet-optimized apps out there that's
the last time that I tried that's true
that's true so okay so so food so that
will be the ultimate goal having someone
reach out or release a device exactly
yeah not just reach out I mean we've had
that happen but actually have the goal
footage doors vital for mammals exactly
okay so speaking of that how do you how
do you what do you think of vendors like
it's essentially these these you know
HTC's motorola samsung's and whatnot how
supportive our day of this HTC recently
kind of provided a way of unlocking
their boot loaders release the Colonel's
whatnot so where you see the space you
know is it more receptive to these
third-party roms or less i think more
recently it's moving in that direction
of being more receptive like you said
HTC you can unlock the bootloader now
the last time I tried to
it wasn't actually fully unlocked it's
kind of half unlocked if you will but
for the most part you know their they
try to help where they can they're
actually legally required to release the
source code to the colonel because it's
right linux and judo some of them are
really great about releasing the code
very quickly others or not everywhere i
know i personally have filed a complaint
there's a mediator and forget the name
of it where you can say so-and-so is not
following the GPL and they kind of get
involved and try to start conversations
with them saying you need to release
your code and this is why so it's it's
kind of a it's a very fine line they
don't want to release any code that's
going to compromise what they believe
it's their intellectual property so
their level drivers and things like that
and that's where we need the most help
right so I mean Android with this car
trips traction layer in the user space
that they have you know tries to provide
that easy easy porting of the upper
layers right different hardware so what
are the main challenges that you guys
have when it comes to porting your
devices assuming that they are
equivalent like you know not stop but
close to start builds of the OEM itself
provides right so the whole software
interacting with hardware thing is just
way above my head okay but my
understanding of it is that yes there is
a hardware abstraction layer but
oftentimes and manufacturers just don't
really use it or they make changes to
the way it's supposed to work and that's
I think the biggest challenge that we
have there when porting new devices so
but you get any support like if you were
to kind of call up someone from HTC or
Samsung would they be receptive to
helping explain how things work or
helping you guys out I'm sure if you got
the right person they would but that's
I've never actually tried I know of some
vendors or you know OEMs have worked
closely with us samsung I believe I'm
not sure if that's public knowledge has
sent us devices in the past others you
know the most they'll do is point
in the direction of the kernel source
code if we try to ask them about
anything mm-hmm but they wouldn't answer
questions necessarily on how something
works but they might I'm not sure I said
I just personally hit don't have any
experience Irina fair enough so what
other challenges you guys face you know
for example from carriers or anything in
general like you know what what you know
if you could do one thing or a couple
things today you know to to you know get
closer to the goal of running an android
OS antigen mod on a you know a vendor
supported device and you know explode
the number of other devices that
supported what will be those things like
what would you wish for so I think
that's a tough one I mean more open
hardware I guess would make it easier
for us to get bit of the software Alta
more people so just more cooperation
from hardware manufacturers and it
doesn't actually have to be like HTC or
motorola there might be you know some
chip in the phone that's actually we
need drivers for and they might not
actually come from HTC or motorola or
one of those guys carriers are pretty
neutral too and i would i would guess
with phones yeah i mean they they're
just getting the phone from manufacturer
and selling it but the fighter you
enabled things like feathering for
example that kind of cuts into their
revenue well yeah but we've haven't had
any you know i haven't heard of any you
know carriers making statements about
custom roms or anything like that you
know if tethering is something that's
enabled by using cyanogenmod and that's
cutting into you know the revenue for
the carrier that's more in my thing in
the users responsibility to not use that
feature that's violating the carrier's
terms of service but Dooku users ever
complained that say their phone starts
from is behaving and they bring it to a
store for support and let's say they fly
their arm will they be kind of turn turn
the way right up just on the fact of the
running a bit different rom or will they
get any help from the carrier it's a
good question i don't really know the
answer to that i mean i've never tried
to take my phone into a store and say
well this isn't working because I've
either know they're going to say you
know well you're not running the stock
software so
that's why or I just you know it's just
not really I've actually never had an
issue where I've had to bring my phone
into the store um like for hardware
problem right like your screen is blank
ER or something or yeah I'm lucky I've
never had any phones with hardware
issues but I'm sure it's happened I
don't know of any stories personally
okay okay interesting so speaking of
issues and I guess support Google
obviously is the is the main you know
the big you know that 800-pound gorilla
in the room and they obviously called a
lot of cards here you know they are
trying to to make Android more kind of
less fragmented by controlling it better
i guess in the future releases and I
know in the past there were some issues
with respect to distribution of their
apps that you guys and the panic to kind
of work around so where you see them
today and in the future in terms of
supporting not just cyanogenmod but
potentially other open source projects
that kind of build on this in open
source android software right I feel
like their goal is you know it's to have
an open source operating system and they
do and I think the fact that custom roms
have been so successful is exactly what
they were looking for I know a lot of
developers on the Android team at Google
love the project and wish us all the
best but as far as working with Google
you know I don't know I would hope that
down the road we can come to some type
of agreement where we can ship the
google apps with cyanogenmod there would
probably be a lengthy code review and
testing process involved there they're
trying to maintain the you know they
want to make sure that if you have a
phone with google play on it it's going
to work as expected and we introduced so
many features and we run you know
versions of android on phones that are
not meant to support that providing that
there are just too many variables right
now so let me actually ask you do you
guys ever do CTS like you're actually
test your divide your roms for
comfortability yeah we do and you are
you green I'm not sure if we are right
now but I know by the time we get stable
I believe that's one of the mat
please oh gosh we're passing cts and do
you do you ever have folks that they
provide drm you know protect content
kind of refuse to play nice with your
arms like I've never tried netflix for
example on my different devices does it
work probably not I thought so yeah they
check for root so they're not checking
right signage and mott specifically
they're checking to see if you have
superuser and as you or what yeah so so
I know actually that's one of the things
in in cm9 that you guys are getting away
from right you're essentially provide
you're going to be providing a non
rooted version is that correct yes so
and that's something that I was very
glad that we move towards in my opinion
there's no reason for root on your phone
alright if you want to take that back I
mean if you're developing android apps
it's very nice to be able to just you
know open up a DB on your computer and
get a shell and go and look at a sequel
light database phone or something yeah
but for the day-to-day user there I'm
sure there are some features that people
need root for but me personally I've
never needed it so I don't like the fact
that it's there because it it's just one
more layer of security that's you know
missing right and I know you have a
feature to manage their permissions
which you can potentially break apps if
there they assume they're installed with
with particular permission but your mom
enables in computing moved yep so it's a
one hand it's kind of adds a little
extra control over security but yeah
withdraw with routing enabled you can
kind of bite some people really if they
can yeah exactly or if you just kind of
what's that allow okay you know there
are malicious apps out there so in terms
of just to kind of wrap things up your
other interests or your team's other
interests like what else you guys do I
mean you obviously have day-to-day jobs
are you all kind of passionate about
Android and do things related to Android
or is this completely separate from from
where you typically I think it's a
pretty good mix we have numerous people
I'm a pretty much all of us all the
developers are software developers in
our day-to-day job and some people are
you know working on android apps Steve
you know works with Android at Samsung
it's a pretty good blend of people that
