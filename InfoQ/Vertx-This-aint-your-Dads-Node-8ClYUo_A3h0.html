vertex and we've already heard several
times that it is roughly the equivalent
of node for the JVM and I just realized
that I haven't started my slides so
there they are so here are my details
I'll also have those at the end I
uploaded this deck to SlideShare this
morning but it's been still processing
for the last four hours so eventually it
will be out there so before we get into
vertex and and and node I always like to
start with you know what problem is that
that we're trying to solve and actually
I want to to look at two so everyone
familiar with the CIE 10k problem yes no
maybe how do we deal with 10000
concurrent connections without the
server falling down and going boom of
course this has become especially
pertinent in the last five years or so
with the birth of our smart mobile
devices and so very recently we actually
passed the point where there are now
more mobile devices connected to the
Internet then there are PCs and this
problem isn't going away so we have to
start building application architectures
that can handle that kind of concurrent
load and the other problem you know most
of us are familiar with this as well you
know how do we build advanced server
push features into apps how do we get
data into the browser without having to
constantly pull so we can build you know
these quote-unquote you know rich
internet applications to turn this bin
you know do you beaten to death
can't considerably and so these were the
types of questions that Ryan dollars are
took me to deal with in 2008 2008
doesn't seem that long ago well let's go
back in 2008 our existing frameworks
platforms Frank very tightly coupled to
this idea that you know servers
something that receives a request and it
spins up a thread to deal with it and
then it sends back a response and all
this of course happens sequentially well
of course this was not web-scale now to
be able to push
vents to the browser the platform needs
to be able to handle a lot of open
connections that are mostly idle now
Ryan's background in systems programming
led him to create you know a small test
environment that could handle thousands
of idle connections and he did this
using non blocking UNIX sockets and C
but Ryan didn't want to work in C he
wanted a higher-level language he wanted
a higher level of abstraction in fact he
wanted a dynamic language and I tend to
agree with him I don't want to work at
that low of a level either as it turns
out life is entirely too short for
malloc so about that same time would we
get Doug Crockford published JavaScript
the good parts and we started taking
JavaScript more seriously you know it's
not going anywhere it's the most you
know really the only ubiquitous
programming platform that we have for
the web and Crockford showed us you know
we can leverage the good parts of
javascript while avoiding the ugly parts
that get us into trouble then add
further fuel to that fire was Google
releasing Chrome in the v8 JavaScript
engine and so the first time not only
did we have you know a real technology
competition going on a JavaScript space
we had JavaScript going blazingly fast
and now we start the arms race of
browsers all over again
and we have more players in the field
you know we have Google and Apple and
Mozilla and Microsoft all trying to
outperform one another when it comes to
JavaScript engine so you could bring
these three things together and you know
Ryan has this epiphany why don't we do
non-blocking sockets in JavaScript and a
few months later out pops node now as
you say you've covered node none of you
came to the node meeting it looks like
so who's familiar with node doesn't he
who's written serious code and node at
all so so a couple of us so you can
probably talk about node a lot better
than I can
I I can't go in-depth with node because
I only learned enough node to make a
reasonable useful comparison with vertex
now from what I've learned I like it
it's a solid
piece of technology you use it
intelligently you can build some very
solid app architectures with it but no
does have some shortcomings so we talked
about JavaScript and a positive light a
second ago let's talk about it in a
negative light javascript has its
problems we'll talk about some of those
no does not really have a good story
around vertical scaling horizontal
scaling great vertical scaling hard
inter-process communication also
something that we can do but it requires
a lot of low-level programming a lot of
glue code a lot of bolting on of add-ons
and then there's this event loop thing
the event looks great unless you need to
do work that doesn't fit on an event
loop and that's a problem that we can't
really solve so all these solutions that
we have on the node they require a lot
of legwork on our part and what vertex
does is to take the same event-driven
non-blocking i/o programming model that
we got from node all the good stuff and
then directly address all of those
shortcomings so that you can spend your
time working on your app and push all
these concerns down into the framework
so what I want to do is I want to walk
through each of the problems and I want
to show how vertex addresses those now
you said you wanted me to ask questions
for the giveaway so I've already decided
how I'm going to do that so pay
attention to the slides I'm not going to
say probably any of the answers to the
questions but they will be there so
JavaScript you're going to write node
programs you have to use JavaScript now
yes we can write CoffeeScript and we can
write closure script but the burden is
on the developer of the language to get
his or her code compiled down the
JavaScript and then and only then does
node pick up with it now javascript has
some problems who's seen wet
okay you guys have homework should go
watch this if we had time I'd play it so
javascript does a lot of weird implicit
conversions we have still not a
reasonably consistent way to do
namespacing and organize large code
bases in JavaScript now the Google
closure tools have gone a long way to
help us with that but at the end of the
day there's still very little agreement
on how do we structure really large
JavaScript code bases of course we have
this weird class like syntax coupled
with decidedly not class-based
inheritance its prototype abased and of
course we it's just easy to do really
bad things of course these aren't the
only problems they have a Java Script
but there's some of them so vertexes
approach is polyglot programming use the
right tool for the job now I've been
talking about polyglot programming for a
long time
most of you are polyglot programmers you
just don't consider yourself to be even
if you use one core language if you're
doing web development you're using
several languages you know if you
consider HTML CSS languages you throw
JavaScript in there you throw in SQL or
a query language for your check or
persistence layer you're doing polyglot
programming so vertex takes the approach
of bringing in polyglot programming for
the core language programming whatever
language you want in fact feel free to
mix and match multiple languages and
vertex will take care of the
communication between those so several
languages have first-class support today
let's do a hello world tour of the
languages that are out there so here's
how we do HelloWorld in Java so what
we're doing is extending a vertical
class I'm going to talk about what a
vertical is a little bit later but
suffice to say this is the unit of
programming in vertex and we're going to
be compelled to implement the start
method so in the start method what are
we doing we're doing the stereotypical
nodejs hello world example we're
spinning up an HTTP server we're
providing it with a request Handler and
all that request handler is going to do
is write out hello world to the response
and we're listening on port 8080 so this
is what it looks like in Java now the
code gets a lot smaller and all the
other languages in
movie this is what we have doing exactly
the same thing now notice that we're
moving between languages but the AAPI is
consistent between them if you can
expect a method in Java you can expect
it in groovy you can expect it in Ruby
now Ruby is leveraging JRuby under the
hood to run on top of the vertex in the
JVM but again essentially we have the
same programming model with Ruby syntax
and Ruby constructs we can also do this
in Python again same constructs and of
course if you're a node programmer
wanting to jump on to the JVM you can
write JavaScript and the JavaScript code
that you start to write in vertex looks
very familiar very comfortable in terms
of what you're used to writing when
you're doing no code and of course we
also have first-class CoffeeScript
support that's been added fairly
recently CoffeeScript and Python or the
newest kids on the block now in the
future we have some fledgling Scala
support that's that's become available
it's not really first class yet a couple
of us are starting to have conversations
about adding closure support to vertex
theoretically any language that'll run
on the JVM or any language that will
compile down to a supported language so
maybe we could take the closure script
to JavaScript to vertex route as well
these are different things that we can
do so now that we've examined the
language issue let's take a look at
second problem vertical scaling so
nodejs instances are inherently single
threaded why because v8 itself is
inherently single threaded from the
perspective the program now there are
ways around that but they involve
low-level hacking and as I was telling
some folks earlier if order for me to
solve my problems I don't want to go
lower down the stack I want to go
further up the stack I want to work at
higher level abstractions not lower
level extractions and so anything that
the platform can give me to allow me to
stay up here thinking about my
application and not be down in the weeds
this is something that I'm interested in
and so the implication here is if I'm
writing node programs my code is going
to use at most one core on my server of
course the node.js folks recognized this
and added the capability to fork child
processes and to support load balancing
across those processes they created the
cluster module now the cluster module
depending on who you talk to is a good
thing or a bad thing
if you look at the official
documentation it's still considered
experimental but there are no shortage
of Stack Overflow questions saying yeah
yeah just use cluster just use cluster
everything will be okay well let's go
that route so there's a book actually a
few books now on node and one of the
earliest books is called node up and
running it with a shortcut style books
from O'Reilly and get into Chapter three
they start showing this example of how
to use cluster to distribute the work of
hello world across several nodejs
processes and so this is kind of the
Minimum Viable code that you would need
to write in order to vertically scale
hello world on nodejs using cluster now
who's doing the work here you are
there's an API there that you can
leverage but the end of the day using
that API correctly the burden is upon
you to make this code work properly and
to get all the glue in the right places
to make things happen now obviously this
is hello world it gets a lot more
complicated than this and if you
continue to read the next four pages of
the book the code gets much more complex
very quickly as they add additional
monitoring and management features to a
again hello world app so what we end up
with if we're not extremely careful is a
ton of glue code intermingled where our
application functionality now who like
that no I like to have my application
functionality I like to be able to look
at my domain concepts see them clearly
expressed and then all of the ancillary
concerns the cross-cutting concerns
I want those push down into the
framework of the platform that I'm
programming with so vertex leverages the
built-in mature threading capabilities
of the JVM to make vertical scaling
trivial so again meet the vertical
what did vertical come from think atomic
particle except for vertex that's where
the name came from we have some
interesting ways of naming things not to
be confused with vertical as in vertical
scaling up and so we've got some terms
that aren't confusing here for a little
bit so vertical unit of deployment so
any vertex instance any virtue I'm sorry
any vertex application is going to be
composed of one or more of these
verticals verticals nothing more than
the Java classes that we looked at or
scripts that we looked at in the hello
world section so if you write these
you're gonna be writing verticals so a
vertex instance is a JVM process that is
running the vertex engine if you will
vertex engine consists of several
threads so we're concerned here
primarily with a group of threads that
provide us with event loops so again
we're starting to see one of the first
differences node one event loop vertex
many event loops how many well it checks
to see how many processor cores you have
available using runtime about available
processors and it's going to create an
event loop thread for each one of those
and then verticals are assigned to an
event loop thread if I run vertex with
the command line argument instances and
I give it a value equal to the number of
cores you're gonna see the vertical
automatically scaled out to one instance
per quart of course we can run more
instances than we have course because
each instance is typically not going to
be able to keep the core busy all by
itself now
what does this bring up
we don't like to talk about this word
yeah concurrency
we've got multiple threads in place so
how does vertex deal with concurrency we
don't to think about concurrency when
we're in the JavaScript world because we
just have a single thread so now all of
a sudden all these problems get dumped
in our lap well hold on so as we said
each vertical instance is assigned a
thread slash event loop you can kind of
think of them the same way that vertical
instance is guaranteed to always execute
on its assign thread it will never
execute on any other threat so once it
gets that thread assignment it's always
running there never anywhere else now a
thread may execute multiple verticals
but the same vertical instance will
never have its work done by another
threat furthermore the class loaders for
the verticals are isolated and that
prevents them from sharing global state
with static members global variables and
other things so all of these constraints
give us the ability to write all of our
code and I should have been going
through points here to write all of our
code assuming single thread II you know
there's no need to worry about
synchronization there's no need to worry
about locking of course now that we've
you know guaranteed that our verticals
are isolated we have a problem we've got
a bunch of processes out there running
that are isolated they can't talk to
each other we can't get any useful work
done so nodes faced with the same
problem so now we actually have two
problems to consider how do we get
nodejs processes to communicate with
each other as we know we can fork them
we know we can cluster them how do we
get them to talk how do we get vertex
verticals to communicate with each other
because it looks like we've created this
walled garden where every single
vertical is unable to communicate with
another well in the nodejs world you
spend some time googling about searching
and you run into a lot of solutions a
lot of solutions some of which make me
scratch my
had some of which seemed okay but maybe
not so much so we're the first things
that comes up is we you just need to
learn socket programming you know you
need to start learning teasing you know
using TCP UDP UNIX sockets and this is
how you get your processes to
communicate now what do we just get done
talking about we don't want to be down
there we want to be up here at a higher
level of abstraction so that we can
focus on our app and not focus on this
low-level stuff also Redis pub/sub okay
that makes a little bit more sense so I
need to figure out how to you know
there's of course there's options out
there that make it easy to talk to Redis
but I need to learn that maybe I don't
know Redis we need to bring that into my
app and get that done 0 mq this helps a
little bit we're still dealing with
sockets but we're dealing with a higher
level of abstraction over plain sockets
so that's getting better some other
solutions just say oh well you know
there's some built-in messaging in
cluster that you can use not very
full-featured you can use process
signaling again down in the weeds and
there are also various eventing
frameworks out there that transcend
processes that we can work with the one
that seems to be the most popular is
called hook IO I it's dead and from what
I could tell there was some interesting
political play that went on there but
you know if you try to go to any pages
other than the legacy mailing list for
it you can't find anything and there's
others like Jay s signals and beam and
these look ok you can do shared memory
with memcache that's also an option what
do all of these things have in common
well they all require me to hook into
some third party technology that you may
or may not want to add to your stack or
and/or they require a great deal of
low-level programming something that
I've also said I don't want to do so two
solutions that vertex provides us the
first is the event bus the event bus is
what we like to call the nervous system
of vertex it is a cross-cutting
abstraction that's built on the platform
so it's built-in you don't have to
go get anything to install it it's not
an add-on it's part of the core it
allows us to sin and receive transient
messages through the out throughout the
application not persistent messages if
you want them to be persistent you need
to hook into more of a persistent work
queue work queue manager that we do have
some add-ons that are starting to grow
up within the add-on module community
but this is not available so transient
messages if your app dies your messages
are gone let's assume it's up this
allows the verticals to communicate with
each other irrespective of what language
they're written in whether or not
they're in the same vertex instance
maybe they're in different instances and
it even allows client-side JavaScript
running in the browser to communicate on
the same bus more on that later
so messages are sent on the event bus to
an address vertex doesn't bother with
any fancy schemes for addresses simply a
stream any strings valid it is why is to
use some kind of a name spacing scheme
to keep things organized so you know
something like messages dot inbound a
something that makes sense to you to
kind of keep things making sense as the
application grows so a handler is what a
thing that receives messages from the
bus now we have handlers in vertex for
just standard programming such you know
we have HTTP request handlers we have
TCP request handlers but we also have
handlers that are specifically involved
in working with the event bus so you
register a handler at an address this
handler can be in any vertical or any
instance of a vertical so we could be
running multiple vertex instances on the
same box more likely we would run
multiple vertex instances on multiple
boxes and then we can use hazel cast to
work with these
I'm sorry can you say the last part one
more time
so the question is how do we coordinate
the communication across vertex
instances on different machines how do
we get them on the same event bus I'm
actually going to bring that up a little
bit later but I'll go ahead and say it
now the there is a cluster mode that is
built into vertex it's actually
leveraging hazel cast to cluster the JVM
instances and that right now that's
restricted to the event bus but we'll
see some more features coming out around
that as vertexes continues to move
forward other things about handlers we
can have multiple handlers registered in
a single address so I can have multiple
pieces of code that are interested in
receiving messages that are directed to
a particular address I can also have a
single handler registered at multiple
addresses and so I can have one address
that I can have a single handler that
knows how to deal with different types
of messages that are coming to different
locations how do I register a handler so
we're gonna do most of the examples in
Java code so here basically we're going
to get the event bus object from the
vertex object vertex object is available
to you whenever you extend and vertical
and then we have a handler interface
we're going to implement an anonymous
handler here and basically all it's
going to do is print out a message based
on the message body and then we register
that handler at the address it's as
simple as that
now we support multiple styles of
messaging in vertex so of course we have
pub/sub deliver a single message to all
handlers registered at an address that
makes sense how do we do that well it
makes sense we have a published method
that takes an address and takes a
message and sends that to that address
and then all of the handlers that are
registered there will receive it we also
have point-to-point messaging with
point-to-point it's going to deliver to
at most one handler that's registered at
an address it uses non-strict
round-robin load-balancing and
optionally you can specify a reply a
reply handler you have a reply handler
that reply handler can have it its own
reply handler and you can have sort of a
two-way communication process going on
between message handlers so when we do
p2p we're going to do it with the send
method yes
he
so you just did something very naughty
so you guys so that so the question was
how do you you know if you're dealing
with round-robin you've got one
processor over here that's involved in a
long-running job and so we want to
notice that load and not send the
requests that direction
well again you think load a long-running
job you think blocking work when you
think blocking work you think no this
can't run on the event bus or the event
again but you don't want to do that on
an event loop that's one of the problems
with node is you and it's been a
discussion that we've had for a very
long time and the community as I've
observed is that when we're doing things
on an event loop what happens when you
block for a long period of time
processing something on the event loop
the app stops nobody else can get
request now vertex deals with this I'm
not gonna deal with it in this section
but if you hold on a few minutes we'll
actually get to that specific solution
because this is a big problem that
vertex attempts to to address okay so
we're doing point-to-point messaging we
can just do a sindh we can do a
fire-and-forget but we can also do a
reply request reply model so the way we
do that I've got the sender and the
receiver code here so the sender and get
my slide here is very small so I'm gonna
look up here to read it to you
so our send method we haven't address we
have a message and we're going to
address add to the last argument here a
handler that handler is specifically
there for a reply handler so we have
some methods do not do not take a
handler they just send they give the
message and it's gone here we're going
to expect a reply the receiver is going
to handle the message and then on the
message object itself it has a reply
method where it can send a reply that
reply will go back to the original
sender
and will be handled by that reply
handler that we see in the top section
of code now that one could also reply
and we could have two-way communication
going back and forth as much as we
desired now this is one part of the API
that differs a little bit from language
to language and we'll see an example of
that when we get into some JavaScript
code towards the end but for the most
part even if the API in terms of the
mechanics of using it if they differ a
little bit the concepts are for the most
part all present so message types what
kind of stuff can we send around well we
can send around strings primitives box
primitives buoy ins we can also send
around JSON objects in fact JSON is one
of the preferred communication
mechanisms for vertex reason why almost
all of the languages that we work in
with the exception of Java have very
nice very easy semantics for dealing
with json data with java we actually
have this JSON object that we work with
specifically for vertex question in the
back
ok and then we also have buffers and
I'll touch on buffers a little bit later
on so again we said we can distribute
vertex so here we have again three
instances of vertex all running several
verticals and we have a single event bus
that spans all of them and we deal with
that
using hazel casts so I'm not going to go
through the API for that right now it's
really not an API there's just some
command line argument so we're gonna
pass and also some configuration files
that we could edit and basically set up
our clustering where one node becomes
the kind of the orchestrator of the
cluster and the other nodes for the most
part become slaves but all of that is
configuration runs under the hood when
you're in your code writing your code
you don't have to think about whether my
vertical is running on this node versus
this node versus this node all of that
stuff essentially just works I think
yeah
in the back what are we using for JSON
support in in the Java code specifically
so so vertex so Tim when he implemented
vertex he implemented his own set of
JSON object support and then the the
other languages for the most part we're
just using the built-in support for JSON
yes yes yes so the question is
ultimately you know what are we using is
the underlying communication mechanism
almost all the communications being done
through nioh - which of course means
that we require Java 7 for vertex so
you're not running Java 7
you're not running vertex do I have to
have a configuration file for vertex in
general or for the clustering yes there
is a cluster config file and if we had
some if we have some time at the end I
can pull it up it's not very fancy or
exciting it's just configuration for
hazel caste so something that's somewhat
unique to vertex is that we can also
using the same programming model we can
go into the browser
and so using Sauk Jas vertex implements
what's called an event bus bridge that
allows you to have code running on the
server interacting with code running
within the browser using the same event
bus programming model so what might this
look like so on the server side here
where again we're creating an HTTP
server and we're setting up a basic
request handler that's just going to
serve up two files on index dot HTML
file and then the very important vertex
bus J s so if in your app you want
you write code that uses the eventbus in
the browser you will have to include
this you also have to include Sauk Jas
in your application and then we're gonna
create a sock Jas server so vertex has a
full implementation of the sock jeaious
API
I'm going to create that server and then
we're going to create a bridge and we're
configuring the bridge here and what
we've done is we've told it three things
what prefix do I want you to send a
request to and so when I go try to
communicate with the event bus I'm going
to be making HTTP request to slash event
bus and then I'm also dealing with
another problem I've got this sock j/s
bridge out there now so theoretically
any browser that can hit my URL can send
messages and in my system that's bad and
this is still bad because what we've
done we've got two arguments here one
says what types of incoming connections
am I going to allow what types of
outgoing connections am I going to allow
and here I've given it a blank array
with a single blank object and it says
allow everything this is a demo
listening on 8080 so client code what
does that look like so in the client
side we've got our sock genus we've got
our vertex bus we're going to get a
handle to the vertex of it bus again
through the vertex object look it looks
exactly like the server-side code and
then we're going to say on open so we
have some events that we can listen for
on open means okay the event bus is
initialized and ready I want you to
register a handler and basically what I
want you to do is echo back any message
that I receive so now let's talk about
another way of communicating or sharing
information between processes and that's
share an immutable state now why do I
have Ricky up here because we're
chickies all about immutability and
values and so I thought he was a good
person to carry this forward so what if
we wanted to manage and in-memory web
cash could we do that with
message-passing in the event bus well we
want the app to scale across all
available cores modeling this using
message passing is problematic at one
end of the scale you could have a single
vertical that manages the cache but that
means that all requests to the cache are
going to have to be serialized through a
single threaded instance and we've lost
our vertical scalability that we wanted
now we can improve that by having
multiple instances of the vertical
managing different parts of the cache
but that starts to get very ugly and
complicated really quickly so we really
don't want to do this with message
passing it's not a good fit for the
problem now we said shared state is
dangerous and we prevent a lot of shared
state in vertex out of the box to make
it easy to assume a single threaded
programming model but as it turns out
shared state is only dangerous if it's
mutable in fact go back to effective
Java that you know the book that's been
around since we've been doing Java
programming for the most part it tells
us that if a muted data is immutable it
can be shared freely and in fact such
sharing is encouraged and we want to
make that easy to do and so vertex
actually has a shared data object that
is part of the platform that allows us
to work with a couple of different
shared data stores first of all we have
a collection of Java util concurrent
concurrent Maps and so I can create a
map out there it's a concurrent map
supports atomic updates and I can put
immutable data into that map and that
map will be visible to all of my vertex
instances I'm sorry all of my verticals
I need to speak correctly we also manage
a set a collection of Java util sets as
it turns out these sets are also backed
by a concurrent map so the same
underlying infrastructure going on there
elements need to be immutable values so
we'll get into that and currently this
is only available within a vertex
instance so a single JVM process right
now if I have a cluster I cannot share
data across multiple clusters I mean I
cross multiple instances within a
cluster this is planned
hazal cast supports this type of stuff
and so it's just a matter of it actually
being implemented and tested and put
into a release question
yeah so so the question I think the
question is if I've got objects out
there that are immutable that I've
created
but then I've got isolated class loading
how does that work so basically what
we're gonna have to do to make this
happen is cheat so what are out what can
we put in here actually if you drill
down into the source code both of these
data structures employ a type checker
and they look at what's being pushed
into the map or the set to ensure that
it's a type that the concurrency model
would actually support so we can put
strings in there obviously they're
immutable box primitives we can put byte
arrays buffers again not going to talk
about buffers tonight in short they are
kind of a smart byte array so it's a
sequence of 0 more bytes you can write
to it you can read from it and it
expands automatically as necessary to
accommodate any additional bytes so it
feels kind of like a vector or array
list of bytes if you will if you
actually use this it's going to be
copied as it's shared between verticals
so you never actually see the same
instance and then we have this last
caveat here any implementers of
shareable this is how vertex JSON
objects are able to be placed into the
map what is shareable do nothing it's a
marker it's a marker that carries the
Javadoc that says if you slap this on a
class it must be thread safe so danger
if you're going to use this put it now
what about the class loader isolation
problem well as it turns out if I
implement a class and I put
on the system classpath then yes it is
available across all of the verticals so
if I have a custom class of my own that
I want to implement I need to do a
couple of a couple of things first of
all I need to make sure it's thread safe
second of all I need to make sure it
implements shareable and third I need to
get it on the system class path so again
this is the you know the - CP arguments
that I'm pushing to the Java process on
startup so you do those three things you
can share your own custom classes
between the verticals so shared map so
I've got two verticals here imagine that
and one vertical I'm getting a map app
cache if it doesn't exist it's gonna
create that map and give me back the
instance and then I'm putting in the
user ID 42 and another vertical I get
the map back out and I get the value out
of the cache shared set work similarly
here we've got a set called app dot
sessions we're gonna put a session UUID
in there and then in the other vertical
I'm going to get the sessions out loop
through them and do something useful
with them so this is kind of the extent
of the shared data capabilities that we
have today so again so between processes
we've got a couple of good stories now I
can do message passing on the one hand
where that makes sense I can do shared
data on the other hand where that makes
sense so both of these available to you
out of the box in the framework allowing
you to do coordination between multiple
processes very easily much more easily
than you would be able to do using using
node which brings us to the last problem
the event loop this is the one I said
that we couldn't solve at least we can't
solve it in node easily so what is no no
does the implementation of the reactor
pattern
what's the reactor pattern well
reactor patterns
got three main things there's a paper
out there that you can read that goes
into a great level of detail but at the
end of the day it's what you've got an
event loop you have an application
registering handlers would the event
loop in some way and then you've got
events that happen that trigger those
handlers and this is how all of the
programming takes place something
happens I listen to it I do something
with it something else happens I listen
to it you know it's swinging it's any
kind of UI programming all different
implementations of the reactor patterns
so this is what we carried into nodejs
so what do we know about the reactor
pattern well we've got in node we have a
single thread we have a single event
loop can't really do anything about this
now we can go hack v8 and there are
actually projects out there that are
hacking v8 to give you multiple threads
in v8 if you want to do that knock
yourself out I'd much rather go with a
platform like the JVM that's kind of
been working on this problem for several
years and has you know gone to great
lengths to get it right and again you
want to go hack on v8 again you're going
at an even lower level of abstraction
than you were before what else do we
know everything runs on it you run code
and nodejs it's running on the event
loop you must not block the event loop
if you go out and calculate you know
Fibonacci 1000 you go out and start
doing prime number identification you go
out and work with some legacy blocking
API do image processing whatever it is
while that's going on all those other
requests that are coming into your
process they're waiting because there's
only one thread only one thing doing
work at a time so what are the problems
with that kind of a programming model
well some work is just naturally
blocking you know anytime you want to do
intensive data
if you want to process genome sequence
data you want to process large graph
networks you want to process big data
all of these things they take time they
take processor power and so these things
are gonna block the event loop we're not
going to be able to deal with threads
also third party blocking API is you
want to talk to a database over JDBC for
example which you can't do that in node
but similarly it's a blocking API JDP
assume JDBC assumes I'm going to send a
sequel query I'm gonna get back a
response I'm gonna do something with it
I'm gonna send another query I'm gonna
get something back I'm gonna wait so
anytime I've got IO going on any kind of
got network traffic going on my
processors just sitting there and doing
nothing and it's also not doing anything
you know with the other requests that
are sitting there waiting so a pure
reactor is just not a good fit for this
kind of work so if the type of
application you're building is very
amenable to the asynchronous
non-blocking i/o problem the node is an
awesome fit for you you're in the sweet
spot if you have a lot of this type of
work node is not a good fit for you and
people have gone crazy trying to make
node work for that kind of scenario
because everybody said that they had to
use node and you know they ended up
hurting themselves so solution here
let's be pragmatic let's acknowledge
that there are some types of work that
it want to execute on event loops there
are other types of work that don't and
so vertex provides us with worker
verticals so worker verticals they're
not assigned a vertex event loop thread
we're not going to put them on the event
loop at all instead we're going to
manage a background pool of threads that
we call background threads and so I can
flag any one of my verticals as a worker
and instead of it going into one of the
event loop threads that equals my number
of processors it's going to go into that
background thread pool just as with our
regular
verticals workers never execute
concurrently on multiple threats so this
gives us the same single threaded
programming model in the workers that we
get with the normal verticals however
not allowed to use the TCP or HTTP
non-blocking api s-- so we communicate
with verticals just like we do any other
vertical using the event bus you want to
keep worker verticals to a minimum
anytime you're using verticals worker
verticals you're using them because
you're doing something that's blocking
well if your entire application is
worker verticals and then you've got one
non worker vertical that just normal
vertical that services requests and then
passes them off to the blocking API what
have you done you've just reinvented the
old programming model with a new toy so
we want to keep these down so now we've
got this complete picture of vertexes
model of the reactor this is what the
vertex team calls the multi reactor so
we've got our event loop thread pool
we've got our background thread pool
we've got verticals assigned to the
right positions and then all the
communication is accomplished with the
event bus so what does this look like so
I said something about Fibonacci earlier
so I've got this kind of toy example of
a Fibonacci worker what does the
Fibonacci worker do well it's going to
get a hold of the event bus register a
handler at the fib request address and
when I get a message there I'm going to
calculate that Fibonacci number and then
I'm going to place the number that was
requested in the result in a message and
send that to the Fibonacci response
address now in my what's called worker
example this is my normal vertical again
I'm getting the event bus I've got a
result handler here that is going to
handle responses from the fibonacci
worker and I'm going to register that
handler at the Fibonacci response
address and then I have container a
container is another variable object
that's available to you when you extend
Verta
collé container has a deploy worker
vertical method so when I do this it's
going to take that and place it off of
the event loop and put it in that
background thread pool my arguments here
the address I've got a configuration
object that I can pass in different
parameters I can specify the number of
instances of the vertical here so if I
put in 10 there I would have 10 of these
guys and then I've got my handler that
is just sending off the messages to the
FIB request ok so let's go over the 4
again quickly and then we'll we'll do
the fun little case study so nodejs
compels us to use javascript or
something that we can compile down to
javascript vertex polyglot good you can
use whatever language I want nodejs
inherently single-threaded I can make
this better but I have to bolt a bunch
of things on I have to do a bunch of
low-level glue code vertex leverages the
JVM already multi-threaded makes it very
easy for me to scale a single vertical
across multiple threads nodejs doesn't
help us at all out of the box with inter
process communication there are
different options out there that we can
leverage you got to go bolt something in
again from a third party maybe you do
want to add that to your stack maybe you
don't or again you can do some low-level
programming vertex gives us this event
bus out of the box it recognizes this is
something that we want to do this is
something that we're going to need to do
and allows us to communicate across
those verticals on multiple threads
across verticals on multiple instances
of the JVM maybe distributed to cost
mini machines and then also all the way
down into the browser so I've got a
single communication model that is
available to me everywhere my code is
running and then nodejs requires all the
codes are on the event loop if you've
got blocking work you're going to run
into problems vertex gives us the
background workers that allow that
blocking work
to be done off of the event loop now
there's a lot of other goodies in there
stuff that you know you can compose your
applications with we have a growing
module repository multiple modules you
can pull in to your own apps and then
communicate with those over the eventbus
so we've got a you don't have to
necessary sources we've got a web server
module we have a Mongo persister that
has been around for a while JDBC is
fairly new we have the work queue that
I've mentioned very simple
authentication manager probably not good
enough for most of you works well for
demos but we need something better
session manager has just come out we've
got a socket IO implementation also very
nice detailed feature set I didn't want
to go spend my time walking through
api's with you I know you guys can all
go read so I didn't want to read api's
back to you but there's a whole list of
things out there several things that we
didn't cover of course we've got full
WebSocket support we've got the ability
to do timers and do timed work with a
scheduler of course we've mentioned
buffers we also get a very good support
for streaming and pumping of data
between verticals we can do routing of
requests of course they have a
full-featured non blocking asynchronous
file IO API these are all very well
documented one of the great things about
vertex is that for the most part it's
very well documented and if you do have
problems you know enough to go jump off
into the source code and see how things
are working and figure out what's going
on this is how I figured out most of the
shared memory stuff okay
so I promised a case study what is the
case study the case study is a Twitter
clone called twit X it's using of course
vertex bootstrap and then knockout Jas
to do the event handling and binding in
the browser the code for this I pushed
up this morning to github so you can
pull it down to play with it it's not
quite ready for
just out-of-the-box consumption there's
some manual legwork that has to be done
in MongoDB over the next few days I'm
gonna get that documented and also try
to build the features into the app to
make it network go away but I just
wanted to give you a heads up on that
but all the code that we're gonna look
at is in fact available yes the appeal
to participation vertex is young vertex
needs help there's one guy working full
time on this the rest of it is people
like us spending our spare time doing
stuff so there is a google group it is
fairly active I probably get anywhere
between 5 and 15 messages a day a lot of
its where's the framework going how are
we going to implement this a lot of it's
also how do I do this so it's kind of a
merger of developers and users asking
for help
codes on github there's an IRC chat I
haven't done that before but I know it
exists so what do we need well we said
you can program in any language that you
want if your language isn't there we
need you to implement a language handler
for it
so those opportunities are there
particularly we're looking for folks who
are interested in working on closure
modules we need more persistence modules
right now we can do Mongo we can use
JDBC there was a Redis one that we had
for a while and then it died and now
we're trying to resurrect that but you
know what if you want to do couch you
want to do des Tomic some other store
but I'm thinking about doing the de
Tomic one myself but at any rate we need
that security is a big need you want to
do any kind of modern security we just
don't have that yet and of course we
need people to talk about it so we need
examples we need blogs we need help with
the documentation all of these
opportunities are there you say can I
help with this the answer is yes every
time so need you guys to get involved
and that's all I have one last thing
that I ask of you
I have this talk up on speaker rate I
will be giving this talk several times
I appreciate your feedback so if you
take the time to go visit that URL and
fill out an evaluation tell me what you
like about the talk tell me what sucks
about the talk so that I can make it
better for the next group of folks who
get to sit through it all the images
were Creative Commons with the exception
of a couple others that I had permission
for so I need to show you that okay
thank you guys for coming I appreciate
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
