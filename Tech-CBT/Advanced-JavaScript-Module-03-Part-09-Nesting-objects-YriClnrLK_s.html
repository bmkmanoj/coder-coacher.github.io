we can nest objects as part of
JavaScript
so we already knew that we can have
JavaScript objects to be created either
using the simplest syntax which is
nothing but providing our own object
members along with the values or we can
also use constructor functions so in
either way whenever we have a particular
object which has been instantiated we
can still have some other objects to be
made as members to existing objects so
which means an object can have another
member which could also be its own
object so in simple words we can say
objects can be nested so if we see this
example you can see I have an object
called EMP and that particular object or
EMP has got three members the employee
number having a value employee name
having a value and another member which
is essentially another object so this
member is internally having its own
members so these members are at a
different level when compared with these
members so these three are the members
which are going to be made available as
part of a EMP however these two are the
members which are available as part of
this DAPT so we can say that dep t is a
particular object which is a member
inside ye so again as I mentioned we are
we can still have the objects in the
form of key value pair or you can also
have these particular objects to be
instantiated using any constructor
function so in this case we are having a
sample which essentially has a
particular object which is directly
defined using the little objects index
and accessible using the dot notation so
in order to access any kind of
inside a particular object the easiest
way we always go with OMP or say object
dot member notation so in order to
access employee name all I would use all
EMP dotty name but imagine I would like
to access something available inside
another object which is also a nested
object of the parent object such is the
case we are going to still start with
the parent which is voi MP dot the ABS
the member which is nothing but the EPT
dot another member which is available
inside the de PT so in that way we can
have object dot nested object dot member
this is the syntax and these can be
nested to any number of levels so I can
have third level of fourth level of such
level and to any number of levels so
whenever we would like to have any kind
of object with the nested objects the
easiest way to access any kind of member
is directly we start with the parent
member I mean parent object then the
child object and any number of child
nested objects dot finally the member
you would like to access so we can also
have those particular what is in nested
objects to be made available as part of
constructor function so in this case you
can see EMP is a constructor function
which is nothing but a class which is
accepting four parameters during
instantiation so whenever we provide all
the four values two values will be
directly going to a name on cell which
are direct members of EMP however the
rest of the two values like the
department number and B name are going
to be made available as part of a
different member object or a nested
object called DEP T so DEP T is going to
be the member of the instantiated object
of type EMP and inside that object EMP
we are going to have a property or a
member called EEP T and inside that I am
going to have other members which are
going to be the child members of that
particular object EEP T so let us have a
quick demonstration
using nested objects and we are also
going to see nested objects in
constructor functions so let me start my
JetBrains so let us start with a simple
example so I go and create a new file
for our demonstration so I call this one
as 11 so in this case I'm going to have
a script tag which will essentially have
a very simple direct object literal in
this case I'm just having an object
directly no constructor function noting
its direct object so I'm going to have
the members along with the values in the
form of key value pairs and now I can
have another member which is going to be
an object on its own and this particular
object is going to have its own members
like Department number and department
name so I can provide members to a
particular object where that particular
object could itself be a member of
another object so which means this is
the parent object and this is the child
object so which means this is going to
be the nested object of OMP so in order
to access those particular properties
and the members so let's have a quick
alert which essentially says you name
class works have some comment here works
in Department and now I need to have
this particular department name to be
accessed so this is available as part of
de PT and e PT is available as part of
MP so we start with OMP dot d EP two dot
and you can see I have D named right
there so in that way I can have the
member in the nested object to be
accessible from the parent object or the
containing object so let us say this is
working fine
okay so look like it looks like we have
an error somewhere
okay jag is not defined so what is that
so if this needs to be in quotations as
because that is string so that was my
mistake
so let us refresh this and now you can
say it works fine with no problems okay
so now that we know on how to have
nested objects using the direct objects
let us see another example where I will
be working with constructor functions so
let me start with the new file and I am
going to call this an s12 in this case
so let me start with the script and now
I'm going to say wearable EMP which is
going to be constructor function and
which accepts four parameters during
instantiation and I'm going to have the
same members as I mentioned earlier I am
going to have my name to be initializer
with V name whatever I am going to
provide as part of parameter and
probably salary and this is going to be
part of the cell and now I can have
department and this is going to be an
object on its own and I can say this
needs to be initialized with whatever
the values I provided from the
constructor parameter so I can say VMs
Wow so now that I have everything in
place let me create an instance of this
particular class EMP so I'm going to say
a variable boy MP equal to new MP so
that is nothing but my class name and
now it is accepting four parameters so I
provided a drag with a salary of five
thousand four hundred and department ten
and working in IT so now that we have
everything in place now let us see if
our
working by accessing the members
available in the object or emps so now I
would like to say Wow MP dot imply name
which is supposed to be a tunnel jag
works with the comment and provided the
department name so in this case
Department name is available as part of
the EPT which is going to be available
as part of the instance of om instance
of EMP which is nothing but or EMP so I
can say Oh MP dot the EPT and dot the
name so let us say this is what we find
and now you can see I got that working
so in this case I actually have this
particular object to be directly
instantiated for example I can even have
this objective instantiated from and the
constructor function instead of directly
using an object literal so for that
purpose imagine I am going to have a
particular constructor function
something like this and now this is
going to accept two kilometres something
like this and now I can say this is
going to be a class on its own which is
going to have two members which they
will be instantiated
I mean initialize it with whatever the
values I am going to sand through
parameters rename so I have a typo here
let me copy and paste so I have a
constructor function as such so now I
can say so instead of confusing
ourselves let us make this one
full-fledged member so that department
is the member however now I can say this
is going to be instantiated based on the
constructor function available here so
which means I am creating an instance of
this DAPT and assigning that to the
member called department so now I can
say new DAPT
and now I can say Department number
department name so which means what I'm
saying is that whatever the values I'm
going to send in here are going to be
sent to this particular constructor
function and the same values are going
to be sent here which essentially
creates an instance and that instance is
going to have these two members
initialized with the respective
variables here and once that is in place
now I can access this department
directly from our particular example
here also which means from the parent
most object I go to the nested object
and finally get to the member so even
this should work with no problems and
there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
