about angular JS watchers are watching
scope variables we will also see on
various types of Watchers we can
accomplish using angularjs first of all
what exactly is angularjs watch it is
nothing but you are keeping track of
scope variables so whenever I say
keeping track of which means you are
actually monitoring the changes of the
values available inside the scope
variables imagine I have an controller
related markup defined in this fashion
so which means I have a deal associated
with controller X which is having two
elements one is a textbox another one is
a div so the textbox is having two way
binding to a and the div is having one
way binding to B so you can see the
controller X defined with three
variables or say three scope variables
so the scope is having three members a B
and C which are assigned with one two
and three respectively let us see how
watch works first of all a watch keeps
track of a variable and its value you
can see here I have a variable called a
which is a scope variable obviously and
this particular variable a is being
bound to this textbox using ng model so
which means there is a two-way binding
accomplished dividable so whenever we
have a data binding to a scope variable
then a watch will be created
automatically for us and that will be
handled by angularjs framework
automatically whenever you have some
data binding to scope variables all
those variables will have their
respective Watchers automatically
created by angularjs so in this case I
have two elements having some data
binding to two different scope variables
and does I have two different Watchers
created in the memory so angularjs
automatically creates the Watchers for
each of those particular scope variables
which are being used as part of data
binding
as I mentioned the above watches are
automatically created by angularjs and
those will be used by digest cycle loop
which we are going to cover in my
upcoming videos for now let us just
consider it is being used by some other
feature of angularjs some variables may
not be watched
so you can see scope see currently there
is no watch available so which means
that particular scope see as not being
used in the form of data binding in this
case that will not be watched by
angularjs so angularjs framework takes
its own decisions on what scope
variables to watch and what not based on
the concepts of data binding and so on
so in this case a and B are having
watches to be created for themselves
however for the variable C there is no
watch available so which means angularjs
will not have any kind of monitoring to
be applied for the variable C however
the monitoring gets applied to a and B
and if any of the values of a and B gets
modified the Dom gets automatically
rebound and all the values available a
and B will be propagated to the dumb
automatically and that is what I am
saying here so if the value gets changed
for any of the scope variables angular
performs necessary updates propagations
to Dom UI update and so on
next angularjs can execute our custom
functions whenever a value changed which
means if a value changes I would like to
have my own function to be executed if
the value of B gets changed I would like
to have some other function to be
executed so if such is the case you can
define your own custom functions and
usually those custom functions
associated with Watchers are usually
called as watch listeners next watches
are used heavily in data binding even
now you can see we are actually using
Watchers or angularjs uses Watchers
exclusively for the data binding
purposes weather or node you use watcher
angularjs framework still works with
watch us behind the scenes so even you
are not familiar with Watchers if you
are working with data-binding behind the
scenes the angular JS still works with
all kinds of Watchers and it knows how
to blow up all the Watchers for the
Scopes to the respective Dom okay how
many number of watch a second you or is
there any proper way I can count the
watch is available in my application yes
there is a limitation based on the
angular JS recommendations so angularjs
guys have recommended that it is better
to use any number of watches as long as
they fall into the count less than 2000
so which means you are application if it
crosses beyond 2000 watches it may or
may not work properly when I say
properly it might have some performance
problems but it is always recommended to
keep the number of watches as low as
possible in order to maintain very good
performance and term you are rendering
without really having too many problems
at the UI or freezing of the browser's
next how to count the watch shows there
are several ways to count the watches
including you can develop your own
scripts and actually count the number of
watches with respect to the current
scope or child scope or root scope or
even to the template or director levels
but if you are a beginner I recommend
actually using a couple of Chrome
extensions called angular Watchers
better and directly from angularjs guys
so you can use either of these two if
you are a beginner in order to have some
understanding on how the watches are
going to be created and how to get the
count of currently working watches are
currently created by angularjs or by the
users or both okay let us quickly have a
look at angularjs Watchers along with
those plugins so let me jump to my
editor here so right now you can see I
have an HTML file essentially it has got
jQuery boots
strap and angularjs which is currently
linked to a zero one dot GS so you can
say I have a zero one dot J s here and I
also have ng app defined at the body
level and controller EMP so I am using
EMP controller at it available and you
can also see I have the controller with
the name EMP in this case and currently
I do not have any scope definitions here
so currently I would like to have a
couple of scope variables to be defined
here in this fashion so I would like to
have scope EA and score B and scope C so
let me define B with a value two and let
me define another scope variable C with
a value three so in that way I have
scope with three variables so the next
thing is that I would like to have the
HTML to be modified in order to have
those three variables to be displayed so
let us limit how's us to two variables
first so in this case I would like to
display something like input and I would
like to have two-way data-binding
with the scope variable a in this case
okay and next I would like to have
another Deo and in this case I would
like to have a to be displayed similarly
I would like to have B as well so in
this case I have B so I have Y a okay so
I have a to be displayed in the form of
a textbox so which means I will have a
text box which will be having a two-way
binding to a another deal which is going
to have a one-way binding to a and the
day one-way binding to B and now you can
say have ABC already defined so let us
open this in the browser and see what is
going on
so now you can see I have a which is
currently having a value one and which
is automatically displaying here and
even the B value as well so if I modify
a value to 10 you can see the value of
year 10 is being automatically modified
in the other read-only bindings so if I
modify to 100 you can see how this is
going to be modified automatically okay
so let me refresh this again and I have
angularjs Chrome extension already
installed angular JS watch or so if you
are not familiar with extensions here it
consists always go to more tools and
extensions and at the very bottom you
are going to see get more extensions and
you can just type in angularjs Watchers
and the moment you do that you are going
to see angularjs Watchers with this
Turkish blue symbol here so you can just
add to Chrome right now I already added
it so it doesn't display at to Chrome
here so you will be having this kind of
button to be displayed here where the
moment you click on it you are going to
say this one at the very top so let me
close all of this and now I open my
angular watchos so let's just press f12
and once you press after all you are
going to see watch I set the very right
and right now you can see it has
actually figured out that there exist
three Watchers in our application so as
I mentioned previously I have only two
variables and I am actually binding to
only like a and B here but how come it
has actually watching three at the same
time and as I mentioned I have scoped C
so let me create scope B as well and in
this case that may put some values for
and let me refresh this and even now you
can see it did not change the value of
three so what is happening is that it is
not really working with these guys so if
you actually comment these and refresh
this you are going to
still see the value of three so it is
not going after the scope variables it
is really going after the bindings so in
this case I have three bindings one is
the two-way data-binding the other two
are one-way data-binding so based on the
number of bindings it is actually
creating the number of Watchers so let
me consider I just wanted to comment
this line and let me refresh this now
you can see it has reduced three to two
which means I have only two Watchers
because my data bindings have only two
in the markup so similarly okay let me
commit this whole thing and then you are
going to see only one watch role you can
see that so in that way you can see
currently the number of Watchers are
actually calculated based on the number
of bindings you might be having as part
of your dumb ok so right now let us kind
let us write some comments here so that
we can have a better understanding so
something like watcher 1 and similarly
watch a 2 and watch it 3 so just for our
understanding I have 3 Watchers sitting
in my application ok so this is pretty
much about the basics of watcher so you
have seen on how many number of watches
are being automatically created behind
the scenes by angularjs framework so I
did not create these Watchers those are
created automatically based on the
bindings you define in the down okay so
let me delete this guy and let me open
this one so let us switch back to the
presentation and now let us go to my own
watch and listener so what exactly are
these first of all we can also add our
own watch using watch function so if you
clearly remember in my previous one I
have said like for example scope
variable see this one doesn't have any
kind of watcher created by angularjs
because
the scope variable C is not being used
in the markup
there is no binding so when there is no
binding in this case angularjs doesn't
through that it is necessary to be
watched and does it skip the scope
variable C so this is not being watched
at all but for some reason let us
consider I would like to have the scope
variable C to be watched and considered
by angularjs so as angularjs
do not consider the scope C
automatically it is our job to actually
ask the angularjs to consider or to
watch that particular scope variable C
and that can be easily accomplished
using dollar watch and that's exactly
was talking about so you can watch so
dollar watch is a method which is
available to scope and you can use
dollar watch in order to have any kind
of variable to be provided here in this
case I am saying a but you can say C so
which means if there exists a member
variable called scope dot C you can
define just C here and that C is going
to be watched and as I mentioned dollar
watch function is always available for
dollar scope and not just dollar scope
is available even for dollar route scope
as well if you are not familiar with
dollar route scope or dollar scope or
controller whatever just refer to my
previous videos and as I mentioned
dollar watch is always going to be used
if and only if angularjs
does not consider your scope variable
for watching for example scope variables
not being used in data binding as we
have already seen and watch listener you
can see that so this is the function or
you can say simply a callback function
so this particular function is usually
called as a watch listener because this
is the function which gets executed
automatically by angular JS framework
whenever it sees that the variable or
the value of that variable a gets
modified so for some reason if the
variable of sorry if the value of
variable a is being modified by some
kind of data binding or by some other
method within the scope then watch will
be automatically knowing that the value
has been changed for the scope variable
yay and he tries to check if there
exists any listeners for that watching
of that variable a and if there exists
any listeners those will be executors so
in this case this function is going to
be executed if the value of a gets
changed and will be automatically
executed by the watcher and it has got
two values like new value and world
value
so whenever the watcher sees that the
value of a has been changed it actually
provides both its previous value and
also the latest value for your
functional what is a method so you can
provide or make use of those two
variables in your own business way where
you can calculate the difference between
those two values or you can also check
whether you have those two values to be
compared or to be placed inside some
other variable or calculated with some
other variable and so on so in simple
words you still have access to its
previous value and the latest value
inside this function okay so now that we
have some understanding about dollar
watch there are various types of
Watchers available as part of angularjs
we have already seen dollar watch you
can see in my previous example I am
using dollar watch in order to watch the
variable C however you are going to call
dollar wet as always a reference watch
why it is called as a reference watch so
which means if if this particular scope
variable is a primitive variable which
means the data type of integer or string
or whatever it knows how to watch but
imagine if you are using dollar watch
which an object then it is going to be
different story so in this case you can
see the scope has got an object whoa and
it has got three properties inside ABC
with values 1 2 4 respectively
so o is not a simple variable in this
case it is not a primitive data type
Oh is an object which internally has got
three different properties if such is
the case even though you use dollar with
dollar wats with the war in this case it
actually tries to figure out the change
of this object from the reference
perspective but not really the
property's perspectives so which means
even it happens like oh da ta has been
modified or B has been modified or C has
modified this watch is not going to be
working if the or itself is modified
like for example oh is being assigned to
some other object then this gets fired
so this watch is going to work if and
only if the o is actually referring to
some other object but not the same
object anymore so even if you happen to
modify any of the properties inside the
object this is not going to be fired now
this is just in depth watch so which
means a deep watch so you are using
dollar watts but with a true value here
so you can see this code this script and
this script is all almost same except
that you are actually providing true at
the very end when you provide this it
says that it is called as an equality
watch rather than reference watch
whenever I see quality watch it actually
goes through each and every member of
that particular object to war whether it
has been changed or not to any much
depth so if this object has got an
another object inside another object and
natural object and so on it actually
goes through each and every property and
each and every nested object inside
whatever you have specified the scope
available and if there exists any change
in any of those properties or and the
entire hierarchy of that oh this gets
fired so that is called as an equality
watch next one is watch group so what
group is something like a convenient
method whenever you would like to have
same functionality to be applied again
as to multiple variables related watch
so instead of write a scope dot watch
for both the a and B separately for the
same guy
of business functionality you might want
to use watch group where you can provide
all the scope variables at once in the
form of an array and apply this watch
listener to be always executed whenever
any of those scope variables get
modified as part of that particular
watch group so if you define ten watch
variables here if the value of any of
those ten Val variables are modified
then this scope watch will be
automatically executed I mean the watch
listener gets automatically executed so
this is just a convenient method which
still works around dollar watch and just
wanted to be careful here the watch
group does not support equality watch so
you can't provide through here at the
moment next collection watch so this is
bit different so if you see really there
are three types of watches the reference
watch equality watch and collection
watch and as I mentioned watch group is
just a convenient method or wrapper
around dollar watch for having multiple
variables to be defined but coming to
watch collection it is mainly used to
watch errors so in this case let us
consider I am having a collection of
employees to be defined in this fashion
so which means I have an array with four
objects and each object having its own
properties and values and I can actually
watch this entire collection just to
using dollar watch collection and
providing that collection variable emps
and if you happen to modify the
collection related array which means if
I add a new object or if I remove an
existing object from the array like you
know employs dot push in this case I'm
actually adding a new object of the
array this gets automatically fired it
is very important to understand that it
works at the collection level so dollar
watch collection actual works at the
collection level so which means if you
modify sorry whenever you add or remove
the objects inside the collection then
only this gets fired for example if you
are modifying a value inside
property of a particular object
available in an array this is not going
to be fire order so this statement
whenever you do as part of your
controller you cannot expect watts
collection to be working as because
watch collection doesn't go at the
property level and it goes only at the
collection modifications level so object
modifications directly at the collection
level not really the properties of the
object but still you can achieve both so
which means I would like to have the
watch collection and also each and every
particular book the name and value
whenever they get modified I would like
to be knowing so if such is the case you
can still use the watch with equality
watch so you can still provide EMPs but
as you provide it true it knows that it
actually has to go to the content and
nested content also nested objects and
add as nested objects and all the
properties and all the values so if you
really want to have all the
modifications of an array to be known as
a catalyst of at the whether it is
collection level or at the property
level you can just use your deep watch
or say equality watch so there are
online tutorials which actually say that
equality watch can also be called as a
deep watch so you can use either of
those towards okay so now that we have
some understanding about types of
watches let's have demo so let me switch
back to my application here and in this
case I would like to have a couple of
modifications to my scope
so see in this case let me put some
value for and now I would like to have a
function to be defined so this is a
method called update C value so I am
going to modify the value of C and based
on the value of a star for so which
means I'm multiplying the value of a by
four and keeping it into C and at the
same time I would like to have the scope
C also to be watched so which means
yes there is no see available in my HTML
there is no data binding when there is
no data mining skies see is not going to
be scoped or says C is not going to be
watched
so in this case I would like to have my
own watch to be provided for scope C so
I'm going to say dollar scope third
dollar watch and I am going to say
please watch C however I am going to
provide the watch listener here which
actually provides both would value a new
value and now in this case I just wanted
to say that if new value is not equal to
old value so I am going to say a console
dot log I updated the value of C to some
new value so in this case new value so
as you can see I'm not doing any data
binding here but I'm just writing the
value of C to the console log so if the
value of C gets changed we are going to
have some kind of notification of the
console level okay however I need to
make some modifications to a 0 1 as well
so in this case you can see ngmodel
a is getting changed but I need to call
this function update C in order to he'll
see to be modified and I would like to
call this update see if the value of a
gets modified so for that purpose I am
going to say ng change so this is a new
attribute which we did not cover earlier
so this is the attribute which actually
evaluates whatever the expression you
type in here whenever the value of ay
gets modified so in this case I am going
to say please execute the function
update C so you can see this is the
update C function which is actually
assigned to scope so both should be same
ok so this is the same one I am using
here
so whenever the value of a gets changed
I am saying that we execute update C
method from the same scope and that
actually in turn updates the value of C
elaborate scope level if the value of C
gets changed as we are watching it is
supposed to display the message so let
me go back to my browser let me refresh
this and you can see now I have four
Watchers why I did get four Watchers so
let me go back so well we already know
that we have watched one two three so we
have three watches from the previous
example and this is the fourth watch so
let me comment this a bit and now let me
refresh this now you can see it is down
to three so which means whenever you
have provided your own watch using the
older watch you are actually increasing
the watch count obviously as because you
are asking angularjs to actually add a
new watch exclusively for the scope
variable C okay being said that you can
see that ng change does not count as
part of watch oh so whether or not you
right ng change the water will be still
there as because ng change works with ng
model behind the scenes okay so let me
go back here let me refresh this now you
have four watches the last one for C and
let me modify the value of a to 10 and
now you can see I have the value of C
updated to 40 and as there is no data
binding here we're actually writing to
console.log so if I modify further this
one to something like 20 so you can see
the moment I type 2 2 into 4 becomes 8
then again I type 0 then 20 becomes 80
for C so in that way you can have
Watchers to be actually defined
exclusively on the variables for which
angularjs may or may not consider while
it is a completion something different
okay you can also have multiple Watchers
like for example in this case imagine I
do not want ng change at all so you can
actually remove this but you can still
have your own watch to be performed
exclusively by a so which means I can
say something like watch a
and when our egg gets changed I'm going
to say something like okay modify be as
something like scope that a splat oh and
let me remove this one so which means
when our a gets modified I would like to
have B to be updated and B is actually
having a data binding here and it should
automatically reflect there
similarly when our B gets changed I
would like to have C to be modified so
which means a is not controlling C but
instead I would like to hell
B to be controlling C so in that way I
am going to have something like this so
which means a updates B or say it
doubles B so the double value of a
becomes B and again the double value of
B becomes C and when C gets updated we
are going to login so let me save this
and let us make sure that we have the
same model here and in this case we
already have one two three watches and
on top of that four five six watches so
let us make sure we have six watches
here and you can see I have six Watchers
in my application and now I moment the
moment I type 10 you can see a value is
10 into 2 becomes 20 into 2 becomes 40
so even if I type in 0 you can see
hundred becomes 200 for B and 200 to 400
for C so in that way you can still have
multiple what I say Watchers to be
actually propagating those values based
on whatever the new values are the word
values you might be having ok so now let
us switch back to what I say the watch
group so let me remove all of this and
just have only one
okay in this case instead of watch I
would like to use watch group so
whenever I have a watch group it will be
exciting an array here so whenever it is
an array in this case I would like to
have two variables to be watching so
which means if the value of a or if the
value of B gets changed please execute
this function so in this function all
I'm going to say is dollar scope dot C
equal to dollar scope got a into dollar
scope got be so actually I'm trying to
multiply the values of a and B here and
let us not worry about the number of
watches here so I am going to remove all
of this stuff so I would like to display
C so instead of this I would like to
help B to be displayed so that I can
also provide the value of B just like I
was providing a so in that way you can
say I have a and B to be having text
boxes to be two-way data-binding
and C being calculated based on the
group here so if the value of a or b
gets changed based on the text boxes C
gets updated when C gets updated you can
see it has to be updated right here so
let us save everything and refresh this
and I am NOT going to worry about
watches in this case so let me push that
a bit so now you can see I have 1 &amp;amp; 2 so
if I modify this one to 5 you can see 5
into 2 becomes 10 and if I modify this 1
to 5 you can see 25 and if I say 1 5
into 5 1 5 into 1 is 5 so okay 5 into 10
becomes 50 here so in that way you can
see whether you modify a or B you are
going to have C to be automatically
calculator so that is how watch group
works in general okay now we have not
seen on how the objects really work so
let me take all of this out
and let me define a fresh coke object
war and in this case I'm going to say
something like a as one and B as two and
cs4 so you can see those are not
variables anymore simple variables
anymore but instead all of these are
available in the form of an object oh so
now let us consider that I am going to
sales for that watch and I'm saying
please watch war and if it is going to
be modified I'm going to have this
function to be executed so as part of
this function I am going to say if new
value is not equal to world value please
execute my stuff here and again o dot C
equal to scope dot a into the other
scope that oh that be so you can see I'm
actually accessing a and B from
objective oh and multiplying them
together and placing into C of O so let
us see if this is working at all and let
me switch back to my a zero one I need
to do some tiny modifications here as
because a is not available straight
forward it is available in the form of
object I mean available inside the
object war so I had to do all these
modifications so you are accessing
ordered C ordered V order dia here okay
so let me go back here
so looks like everything is ready so let
me to flush this okay now I am not
worried about scope watches here or the
number of watches so let me try to
modify this so you can see whether even
though I'm modifying a and B values here
the C is not being calculated at all
because it doesn't enter into this one
at all this is not working at all but
the moment I say true which means
a deep watch or say equality watch is
supposed to be performed at the moment I
say true so let me go back here and
press f5 okay now I modified 10 and now
you can see 10 into 2 becomes 20 and 10
into 20 becomes 200 and similarly so
whenever you would like to have the
entire object along with all of its
properties and nested objects and so on
to be automatically taken into the
consideration during the watch you have
to just press I mean you have to just
supply true at the very last so in that
way you can have actually the Equality
vats to be performed and of course you
can still have the watch groups to be
mentioned like you know I can have a
watch group with just ordered EI and
would be even that is possible but I do
not want to take that in this case or
let me give you that so I can just say
let me comment this so in this case I
can still use watch group or u P okay so
I can just say like I would like to go
after Oda and I would also like to go
after o dot B even this is valid so this
is going to work however as I mentioned
it doesn't work with the deep so I save
this and i refresh this and it should
work as it is supposed to be and now you
can see it is still working with no
issues okay so you can have the watch
group however you have to independently
specify each of those property values or
you can have the entire watch to be
performed in this version okay so this
is pretty much about what is the
reference watch or equality watch or
watch group the last one is supposed to
be the collection so in order to save
some typing for us so I have already
developed some script so let me copy
that
so let me go back to a zero one now you
can see I am having a MP controller and
I have an NG repeat which actually
displays all the employees collection in
the form of booze so I'm going to have
employee number and employee name to be
displayed for each of the objects
available inside a NPS what is the MPS
if you go back to a zero one so you can
see EMPs so each of these objects are
actually place it inside a wall and we
are extracting employee number and
employee name properties from war and
displaying in the form of bill so let me
save this and let me refresh this and
now you can see I have employee number
and name to be displayed in this fashion
and we also have a couple of buttons
like add and modify the third employee
related value so such is the case you
can see what a DMP is being developed so
if you go back here add EMP is actually
creating a new employee with these two
automated values and adding using push
to that array EMP s and similarly modify
third employee which means you're
directly accessing the third employee
the index starts from 0 so 0 1 to the
third employee here which is nothing but
this guy related employee more to be
changed from when to test so let us see
what's going on I just refresh this and
if you click Add now you can see all of
these are automatically clear and also
keep a watch on this watches count so
the more number of employees you add you
can see you are having more number of
who watches so just imagine you are
actually pulling hundred records using
ng-repeat you are actually having
hundred watches defined internally and
finally I have modified third employee
so just let us watch this one zero zero
three wins so the moment I click on that
you can see the wind has become test ok
we are player so far so let me refresh
this and get back so initially I have
already nine Watchers so you have to be
always be mindful about the number of
Watchers being added as part of your
system ok so now that we have the
employees list
adding a new employee or modifying an
existing employee let us do this simple
one so I am expecting emps to be
actually displaying number of employees
here and I am just using dollar watch so
let me save this and I go back here and
do this now you can see it has displayed
number of employees s for obviously s
and now I click on this and I'm adding
as many number of employees as possible
but I am not getting number of employees
here updated so which means this this
watch listener is not getting executed
for any of the modifications available
directly to the employees collection and
as you can understand watch is not for
that watch is for the reference so if
the employees collection is being
modified with some other collection then
this is going to be fired okay now let
us go to watch collection so here we're
writing number of employees so I go back
here so I flush this and now by default
it is four and now you can see the more
I add in you can see that watch listener
automatically gets fired so for every
new modification for every new element
you add or for any element you delete
from the existing array watch collection
gets fired okay now let us try to modify
something like one zero zero three
something so it has modified test but it
is not really appearing here as because
this is not fired whenever you are
trying to modify any object inside the
collection okay now the last one this is
our deep watch or the Equality watch so
it is not collection watch anymore so it
is true at the very last so which means
everything which happens for emps need
to be reported and in this case whether
you modify or not it just displays
number of employees if any modification
occurs so this may not be appropriate in
this example but you can see that it
actually goes through this statement for
any modification of the employees
collection
so just save this and let's just refresh
this and by default it is displaying
number of objects as four and you can
see all of the objects are actually
being displayed here and even if I
modify third employee you can still see
that it is firing whenever the value of
the particular object inside a
collection has been modified and that is
how the deep watch works so if you want
everything to be watched just pass
through at the very end for dollar watch
and if not you can use a the dollar
watch group or door watcher collection
so in my upcoming video we are going to
discuss about digest cycle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
