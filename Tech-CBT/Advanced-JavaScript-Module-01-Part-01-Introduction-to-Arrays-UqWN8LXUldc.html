introduce what exactly our arrays in
JavaScript so first of all an array is a
very simple variable which can hold
multiple values so whenever I say
multiple values you can literally have
more than one value to be stored in a
single variable and whenever you would
like to store multiple values each of
those particular values whatever you are
going to store will be assigned into
their respective positions by default
all those positions are named with
respect to their numeric indexes so for
example you can also have multiple types
of values to be assigned so this is bit
different from C or C++ or C sharp like
in other languages you can always have
an array of a particular datatype in
general but here in JavaScript things
had been different I can have the string
you can have an integer
you can have a boolean or floating type
variable sorry value all of those
particular values can go into the same
area so air it doesn't really need to be
confirmed with respect to the datatype
so all the data types could be any type
so those values whatever you would like
to assign can be of various different
types but again each of those particular
values will be assigned to the
respective positions and there is one
particular property called length so
which essentially gives the number of
elements or number of items available in
a particular average so in this case I
can say a r1 dot length so which is
essentially nothing but you can get the
count or number of elements available in
that particular array to be returned and
once that particular value is getting
returned from the property you can
assign to a variable or you can alert it
or you can reuse it further so length is
a particular property for an array which
essentially
gives us the number of items available
in an attic okay so how do we access
each and every item in an area once it
has been declared and initialized the
easiest way you can always have a full
loop which goes from index 0 so which is
nothing but the first position the first
index the position of an array till to
the length so length is whatever we have
been calculating earlier using air one
dot length so you can essentially
provide a or one dot length right in
here and I can say 0 to the length and
while the loop gets iterated you can
always get a particular array item by
referring to the air I mean in this case
it is ary but it could be here one two
so array of that particular index
whatever you are going to use so if I
will use 0 you are essentially getting
arrow F 0 which is nothing but the first
element for the next iteration I value
could be one if such is the case you are
getting error one in this case it is
going to be 2500 which gets assigned to
array item so in that way you can have a
for loop which can essentially give us
all those particular items or you can
parse those items from the array
directly so we can have a demo now so as
part of this demo I will be looking into
how to declare an array how to
initialize an array with multiple values
and how to parse an array so in this
case whenever I say parsing how to
display all the values in an array
okay so let us start by creating a new
HTML file so in this case I would like
to say something like 0 1 okay first of
all I would like to have a button and I
would like to have a caption something
like show I le or something and on
clicking of that one I would like to say
display add a function needs to be
executed so this is the function which I
need to write right now so I would like
to start with script and here I would
like to create an area so this is the
variable AR 1 and I would like to say
something like it can hold 4 values by
default so whenever I mention as 4 which
means the index starts from 0 and ends
at 3 so now I can say AR 1 of 0 which is
nothing but the first position can have
a value of something like Z 1 and
similarly I can have 4 values but the
indexes are going to be different in one
way or another and for a change I would
like to have some other value to be
displayed there something like this so
this is how I can have a particular
array to be declared and then I can have
those particular values to be
initialized accordingly so once I have
all of those now I can have a particular
function which is essentially anything
by display array I would like to declare
that particular function so this is the
function which gets executed whenever I
click on this particular button so as
part of this one first of all I would
like to get the length of the array
which means number of element
so in this case they are one dot length
so I get the land and before even
displaying I would like to have
particular HR which is writing but a
line and on top of that I would like to
have a do tag something like itself
still so I would like to have all the
elements to be displayed inside this div
tag so in order to achieve that first of
all I should get a handle of this one
which means should be able to refer this
div directly in my JavaScript so that
purpose I would like to have same kind
of variable called results due and
however in order to get the reference
out of that one I will be using document
dot get element by ID and then I am
going to give the same element so this
actually searches for the div element
which has got that particular ID it's a
once it finds it that perturbative will
be available in the form of reference in
this variable so once I get that now I
need to parse through the area so for
that purpose I will be writing integer
so wearable I equal to starting from 0
till to the end I plus plus so this is
the verr loop which is essentially used
to parse through each and every element
available in the array so index starts
from 0 which means right from 0 n which
is nothing but 4 in this case so even
though it is 4 I said less than so it
will be 4 minus 1 always so it is going
to 3 so 0 to 3 is essentially nothing
but 4 so I would like to create a new
deal for each and every particular
element I get inside the array so that
new D will be added as a child due to
this results do so I will say
we have a noodle equal to document dog
create element and I would like to
create a new development in this case
and now this new deal will be having the
content as something like item plus I
dot to string off and dokdo string is AR
one of I so this is important so this is
exactly where I am trying to access the
array and I am getting the value from
zero so if the value is zero I am
getting air of zero which is nothing but
jag one for the next iteration I am
going to get a value as 1 so this will
be automatically air of 1 so this is
just some kind of understanding and how
it is really wanting to show so as the
index is going to start from zero I
would like to have +1 to be provided so
that it will be making much more
readability sense so I can say item 1 of
4 is going to be the first item next
again item 2 and so on so once I have
the new div created I need to have this
new due to be added to the results do so
for that purpose I will be writing
something like results do dot append
shade and it can say no to so what I'm
doing here is that to this results do
and adding a child which is nothing but
in YouTube so this deal is stored in you
do and I am having the content as such
so once I have everything in place I can
just save it it's already saved so now I
can just open my Chrome browser and see
how it is going to look like
so I have a button and the moment I
click on that Wow a turn into an arrow
so let me quickly check what is the
error oh here one at length is not a
function okay so there is a mistake I
actually put brackets I don't need those
blankets so that is the error it is a
property but not a method so that was
the error so let me again rerun it and I
close this now I click show add it and
now you can see all of those elements
have been added successfully</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
