bit about JavaScript task runners vs.
JavaScript bandless so after that we are
also going to discuss more about a
bundling tool or JavaScript bundling
tool called web pack and finally we are
going to have a demonstration on how to
use web pack for setting up development
environment for Akmal script 6 or atma
script 2015 so first of all what exactly
is the difference between a task runner
was a task bundler or so not a task
mental JavaScript bandwidth so in
general a task runner means basically it
executes a series of JavaScript tasks so
that as are usually the development
tasks at the client-side so what are all
the various tasks so in general we can
say like minifying of javascript files
or minifying CSS files and at the same
time concatenating all the JavaScript
files or CSS files into one or
transpiling sass files into CSS and so
on so all of those need to be
accomplished by the developer at the
client-side using certain kind of tools
and in order to do or execute those
tasks on a regular basis we usually use
it as cleaner so all of the above tasks
like minifying or concatenating or
transportation or compilation or build
whatever we are going to talk with
respect to tasks all of those tasks are
usually performed through various
plugins supported by the respect to task
runner and we literally have plenty of
plugins like more in thousands so we can
use any of those plugins as necessary
for the respective task and respect
development environment for the
respective application
these two are the topmost tasks or nests
available in the market currently those
are grant and gulp so if you are not
familiar with grant or gulp please refer
to my previous videos on how to use any
of those to nest what exactly is a
JavaScript bundler so we have already
got some understanding about task corner
so let us think about bundler in general
so first of all a bundler means it
compiles JavaScript written using some
kind of module system so whenever you
develop your JavaScript serve the
JavaScript scripts using some kind of
modular system like AMD which is called
as a synchronous modules definition or
common J's or ECMO script six or atma
script 2015 whatever you are going to
call s or even 2016 or 2017 for that
matter any of those particular scripts
developed using the those respective
JavaScript patterns need to be compiled
into plain JavaScript because the
browser's may or may not understand each
of those particular features are
patterns whatever you are going to
develop as part of your application so
in order to maintain the browser's what
is a independent development or in order
to achieve browsers independent
development with respect to jaws cat
whatever you are going to develop again
to leverage all the advanced features of
the JavaScript alone using those
particular modular systems we need some
kind of compilation to be happening and
those compilations can be easily
achieved using the bundles and
compilation is not just the only thing
what the bundler will be doing a bundle
means essentially a compilation together
with concatenation of all the files into
one and finally minifying those files as
well so whenever we say JavaScript
bundle which means all of your scripts
will be bundled into one which means you
are going to add or say concatenate all
of the files into one single file and at
the same time minify that for your
production usage
in case so javascript bundle means
essentially you are going to compile
your JavaScript files or your Java
scripts written using any kind of module
system like AMD common Z Azure Akmal
script or typescript or any kind of
technology or any kind of framework or
any kind of pattern you might be using
for developing scripts can be compiled
concatenated and minified together
called as a bundle and in order to
achieve this we have the bundler
so the bundler essentially does all of
these three in a very plain or a very
simple way and a bundler not necessarily
be a task runner so a bundler is not at
all designed to be a task runner even
though they can do some kind of task
with respect to test Runner like for
example minifying javascript so you can
see you can also have the minification
here and you also have the minification
here concatenation of files you can also
do that here and you're also doing that
here
compilation you are doing here you can
also do it here so however as I
mentioned bundlers are not really
designed to be task runners and at the
same time task runners are not designed
exclusively for the bundlers or bundling
so that is the main difference there are
certain tasks which can be accomplished
only by the task runner and there are
certain tasks which can be accomplished
only by the bundler but still there are
some kind of overlapping scenarios where
we can just use the bundler for
performing few tasks of the task runner
also and at the same time we can use
only task runner to perform certain
operations of bundler as well so there
is some kind of overlapping however if
your particular concentration or
development is mainly about bundling
then we would go with bundler and if the
development really needs complicated
tasks or too many tasks to be performed
after one after another one after
another then probably we might be
switching to task runner which also
includes bundling in-between and if any
kind of bundler you
visually will have a module bundler
designed as its core which means the
core development of the bundler is
really focusing on the bundle but not
really on the task execution but a task
executor or a task runner doesn't know
what is a bundle it knows only about the
tasks executions or whatever the tasks
you provide to that to be performed
however you are going to have the
bundles also to be performed using the
task runner using various plugins okay
next sometimes you can have the
boundless to be replacing task runners
as I mentioned if your particular
development of your application mainly
uses only but the bundles and the
bundling of your Java scripts then we
might be just good with boundless but
not necessarily be using it ask whether
but again as I mentioned it is only once
in a couple of scenarios or few
scenarios if your particular development
focuses on more number of tasks
including the bundler then you might be
working with tasks run up and as
mentioned a bundler can never be a
replacement of a task runner and at the
same time task runner can never be a
replacement of bundle altogether bundler
is not limited just only for bundler it
can still integrate with the task runner
so if you have if you are using some
kind of bundler and if you would like to
use that bundler to be used as a task
inside a task runner that is still
possible so which means you can have the
bundles to be integrated as part of your
task tunnels and these two are the
popular bundler is currently available
browserify and web pack so these four
are the most important what is a
framework as of today so grant and gulp
mainly used as task governors and
browserify and web pack mainly used as
bundlers and as i mentioned if you would
like to use webpack or browserify with
grant or gulp it is still possible next
what exactly is a web pack as I
mentioned first of all web pack is a
module bundling system it is essentially
nothing but a bundler
next it is open source and platform
independent which means whatever the
code you write whatever the script you
write as part of your web pack or
whatever the configuration you do as
part of your web pack development is
platform independent so your script or
your configuration essentially will be
working in the same fashion either in
the Mac or in Windows or in Linux or
whatever the platform you are going to
use and web pack is open source
it works with node and node package
manager behind the scenes so you need to
have node or NPM to be installed on your
machine before even working with the web
pack so if you are not familiar with
node or NPM please refer my previous
videos next web pack as I mentioned
mainly works with module bundling system
so whenever is a motif binding system
essentially should support
transportation or say compilation of
JavaScript modules so whenever I
mentioned JavaScript module compilation
essentially we are talking about various
loaders webpack doesn't know how to
compile all the various kinds of
JavaScript modules available in the
market or coming in future so web pack
defines a framework on how to have the
compilation of JavaScript modules to be
happening however it will be using
various loaders and those loaders
perform the translation using the web
pack framework so in order to have your
particular transformation to be
accomplished you might be using the
respective loaders for example if you
are using react.js
you might be working with Babel as you
will load and that Babel is essential in
order to have the transpiration from
ACMA script or react.js to plain
JavaScript so all of those loaders are
necessary to be installed as part of
your application before even working
with the web pack so web pack is the
core and loaders will be working on top
of web pack so that is pretty important
and as I mentioned the whole goal of the
pack is to make sure that whatever the
JavaScript you might be writing
is always safe to be used in any of the
browsers so which means regardless of
any kind of JavaScript versions or the
feature supported by the browser your
JavaScript should be still working
regardless next it can be configured
through web part contact details so in
general whenever you are working with
the web back page development you might
need to have the pegged at configure Jas
but again this is not essential but
usually this is the way how the the
development starts so it is not
essential to have this file however the
configuration can be done using webpack
conflict urges based on the necessity
and again the next one the pack can be
easily customizable and extensible with
the loaders and plugins so which means
you have plenty of loaders and you have
plenty of plugins in order to have your
particular configuration or scripting of
web pack to be customized or extended it
supports command line interface as well
so which means once you installed that
pack as part of your application you can
go to the command prompt and use the web
pack command to have certain operations
to be accomplished like compilation or
execution of your conflicts script or
watching or whatever and web pack is not
just alone it can be still integrated
with task runners grunt or gulp and
again it is not needed but it can be
used so if it is not needed to integrate
it with a grant or gal for your
application you better not use grunt or
gulp but if you think there are other
steps or other tasks which need to be
performed on top of what web pack can be
performing then you might need to
integrate your web pack or your Bandler
with grunt and gulp last but not the
least you have built-in watcher so which
means if you are not familiar with watch
you might want to check my previous
videos on grunt watch and gulp watch so
essentially a watch means it it will be
monitoring for all the modifications
of your files as part of your operating
system so which means whenever you
modify any of your JavaScript files or
CSS files or sass files then the web
pack can automatically understand that
you modified those and it needs an
immediate attention to that and compiles
that on the spot so that is pretty
important so that is mainly used for the
development scenarios and on top of that
you can use the grant watch or gulp
watch based on the necessary so watch is
a file monitoring tool so it essentially
monitors for file modifications and if
any modifications happen it just
compiles on the spot and gives the
latest version or latest compiled
version of the JavaScript file
immediately and you can just go to the
browser and refresh it without even
worrying about the compliation anymore
as because watcher takes care about the
file modifications along with
compilations ok so the next one is demo
so I do not want to concentrate much on
the ik masks root development here but
it is going to be a good idea to have a
kind of development environment to be
set up using webpack so in this case I
took ACMA script 6 or atma script 2015
as my development environment to be used
using webpack so in order to have web
pack to be used as a bundler for my ACMA
script 6 development or atma script 2015
development I am using babble so babble
is just another framework which mainly
is used to have all the features affect
my script 6 and netmask rip 2015 to be
made available to the respective browser
if the browser doesn't support those
features so I'm going to use babel along
with the web pack so babel is going to
be the loader which will be working on
top of the web pack and just for our
understanding i am going to use jquery
also to be used as part of my
application while this is not necessary
i just wanted to make sure that you can
use any of your
vendor or other related scripts like jay
korea underscore or whatever the other
kind of javascript ramos you might have
employees okay so let me jump to my see
let me create a new folder called my app
so this is going to be my application so
which means my JavaScript application is
going to be maintained here so I'm going
to create everything from the scratch
here so as of now I do not have anything
here the first thing is that I need to
have the packaged adjacent to be
maintained and in order to have package
dot Jason I need to have NPM in it to be
executed as part of this folder so I am
going to say open command prompt here
and I am going to execute NPM in it so
essentially it asks for all the details
for my particular package or my
application so the first thing it is
asking the name of my NPM package
so in this case the default is my app so
I do not want to provide any special
things here I just keep on pressing
enter so that it takes all the defaults
such as price centers here and you can
see it actually goes with all the
default values and it is ask me is that
okay press ENTER and now you should be
able to see package.json automatically
created for my application so let me
open this inside my sub line so now you
can see how the package that jason has
been created so you have all the
defaults and now the next thing is that
I am going to have my index dot HTML
file to be created here so let me create
right in here so I am going to create a
new file and I am going to call this
nice index.html so the first thing is
that I would like to have one script
file to be always included and I'm going
to call this script file as something
like app dot out that Jess and I would
like to throw this file inside the belt
and I am going to have a simple button
here and I'm going to provide an ID for
this butter
called something like show button and in
this case I just wanted to push show
okay so I can simply execute this by
going to your my application and run
your own favorite web server whatever
you might be having in place so in my
case I have is X plus here so I just try
to execute that and go to my browser and
I am going to say localhost 8080 and now
you can see I have the show button
readily available so let me go to my
what is a developer tools and you can
see build app but all that jazz is not
available why because of course I did
not really create that and that was my
intention so which means using webpack I
would like to have all of my scripts
available in various folders to be
combined together into one bundle called
app ljs one file and push that file
directly inside the build folder and in
that way I'm going to have my particular
application to be just downloading one
to one javascript file which contains
all the scripts related information
right inside that so let us work through
this one okay so I go back to my sublime
here the next thing is that I would like
to have a new source folder to be
created so I go in here and I am going
to create something like source and
inside the source folder I am going to
create a new file and I am going to call
this one as message dot J s so in this
case this is an ECMO script file so
which means all the object-oriented
features of a math script six or atma
script 2015 can be actually developed
here so in this case I do not want to
really go in depth of ACMA script as
because that is going to be out of the
scope of this video so I just wanted to
have a very simple class to be
maintained and developed so I start with
export default class
so that is the name of the class is
going to be message and this class
message is going to have a simple method
called show and inside the show I am
going to have something like hello world
to be displayed in the form of an alert
so this is a simple JavaScript class and
it is currently using Atma script 2015
syntax so I just save this one so I'm
done with messages so it is just nothing
but a class but in order to use this
class I need to create an instance of it
which means I need to create an object
of this message class somewhere and then
access this method which is exactly what
I'm going to do as part of my app dot G
is where I'm going to create a new file
called app dot J's so as part of this
one the first thing is that I would like
to import my class called message and
currently I maintained the class name
and the JavaScript file name is the same
thing so I can use the same file name
right here so I am saying that please
import this file so I can just say
something like this so which means it is
going to go into the message dot j s so
which is nothing but this file and that
whole definition will be stored inside
this variable called msg so in this case
msg is a nothing but message so this
whole definition is going to be made
available in the form of MSG
MSG is the class here indirectly and
similarly let us consider I would like
to have another one called jQuery so
currently you can see I do not have
jQuery in my application why because if
you go back to my index.html I do not
how jQuery so I need to help jQuery to
be installed as part of my application
so for that I am going to use NPM
install and I'm going to say save jQuery
so the moment I say that it is going to
pull out jQuery which is available as
part of the node package manager and
once I install jQuery I am saying that
please save that as part of my package
purchase on ok and now you should be
able to say node underscore modules and
you have jQuery right in place and if
you open package dot J's and you're
going to see jQuery which is the latest
version 3.1 currently installed on my
machine and only for this application ok
so once you have jQuery then my app
knows that it has to import jQuery
straight from the node modules and I'm
going to say this jQuery to be made
available in this variable called dollar
you can provide any variable here for
that matter a is also available but it
is a traditional thing like for every
kind of jQuery thing we always use
dollar so let us go with dollar here so
the next thing is that I am going to use
the jQuery documental load so as part of
this function I am going to get the
button whatever I have in place like I
have the show button so I am going to
use that button here so please get me
that button and on clicking of that
button I would like to say simple like
this create a new instance of the class
message so you can see I am using the
same variable whatever we have in place
also here so which means I have MSG here
and the same variable I am using it here
so this variable contains the definition
of message Rogers
so in that way whenever I say new
message I'm essentially creating the
instance of that class and the instance
is going to be made available as what of
woe and woe is going to have those
methods like a
show in this case so the message class
is having only one method show and I am
going to use that as part of my approach
as so which means whenever I click on
this show button I would like to have a
new instance of this class to be created
and immediately after that I am going to
execute the method available in that
class which is nothing but show and it
has to just alert it so in that way I
have completed my app dot yes so I
managed to complete the most important
stuff like that my index dot HTML
message and AB dot J's everything is
fine but there are a couple of other
things which need to be accomplished the
first thing is that we need to have the
respective Babel or the loaders to be
maintained webpack doesn't know what is
ECMO script in this case webpack simply
doesn't know what is ACMA script it
doesn't even know what is the react.js
it doesn't know what is typescript so we
need to have that respect to loaders in
place in this case I would like to use
babel as the loader or the tool in order
to have the compilation of my ACMA
script classes developed the browsers
will not be able to understand this code
and the browser cannot even understand
this kind of code so in order to have
this code to be translated or transpiled
into plain JavaScript we will be using
webpack and on top of that we'll be
using the respect to loaders which can
understand these kind of syntaxes ok so
in order to accomplish this we need to
have several dependencies to be
installed and for that the first thing
is that obviously we need to have the
pack to be installed so I am going to
say install and I am going to say please
install as part of dev dependencies so
see you and I am going to say the first
one to be installed as web pack
okay so now that we have webpack so if
you can see you have the node modules
and inside the node modules you have the
web pack and make a note that you have
the dot bin folder so if you open that
you still have a pack dot CMD which is
nothing but the command-line tool which
can be executed right from your comp or
command prompt okay so now that we have
a pack
we still need to load the respect to
loaders as I mentioned web pack alone
cannot understand what is ACMA script
what is type skit what is react.js we
need to have the respect to loaders to
be installed or the presets to be
installed so in this case i would like
to have babel to be installed as my
loader which can understand all the
Atmos crypt or react.js or anything
whatever you really want to have for
your advanced JavaScript development so
the first thing I would like to have is
NPM install and Babel core so you need
to have Babel core and on top of that
you need to have the babel loader and on
top of that you need to have Babel but
is set egg mustard 2015 so all of these
three packages are essential in order to
have your ACMA script 2015 based
development to be maintained or to be
developed as part of your application so
just plus Center
okay so now that we have everything
installed let us go back to our
package.json and you should be able to
see all of these in line so we have
Babel core installed loader installed
and even the preset for ik musket 2015
also installed and you can see we have
the jQuery as something like the main
dependency which is always necessary as
part of my application that's what I
mentioned but however these are only for
the development
so once the development is done we are
not going to have this one as part of
the production so now that we have all
the necessary libraries installed the
next thing is that we need to work with
the web pack configuration so for that I
am going to create a new file and I am
going to call this one as web pack dot
config dot J's as I mentioned in my
presentation we need to have this
particular file to be created in order
to have our web pack related
configuration to be done so the first
thing is that I need to have the path to
be used for my application and similarly
if you would like to have the web pack
related methods or other things to be
accessed you can also have your web pack
instance to be declared in this fashion
so in my in my part I am going to use
the path variable in order to get the
current module path and resolution of
the current path and so on but if you
would like to have F make a related
functionality you can use this statement
otherwise you can just neglect it so the
next one is exports so we need to have
one particular object to be provided as
part of web pack configuration so all
the configuration will be made available
through this main object and this object
needs to be exported in the formatter
module so the first thing is that what
is the entry point of our application as
you can see our index.html is our entry
obviously but we need to think from our
application
script ringside so from the scripts
perspective we have two files that is AB
DOJ's and message da je s so message GS
is being used inside after Jason C I am
importing message dot J's right inside
approaches so in my case after GS is my
entry point for all the scripting which
needs to be imported and executed so I
can say my application starts at AB dot
J's so that statement whenever I said at
my application or my scripts actually
start with AB dot J's we can call that
one as an entry point and that
particular entry point can be specified
using a member called entry and you can
have as many entries as possible to be
provided here in the form of collection
and in this case I have only one object
that is go to the source folder and get
after Jas so I am saying that my entry
point for my application is AB dot J's
which is available in source folder
right here ok so the next one is output
folder so in my case my output folder
needs to be at certain location because
if you go back to my index dot HTML I am
expecting a file called app dot all that
jazz to be created so I go back here and
I am going to say a file named this one
needs to be created so that is the file
name which is expected however that file
needs to be made available at a
different path called build so I would
like to have that one also to be
specified here so I can say something
like path build so I need to have a
slash here so in that way I am saying
that the once the bundling happens
and once the bundling completes the
entire bundle or all the JavaScript
needs to be concatenated together into
one file called AB dot all dirges and
that needs to be placed inside this path
so if you are not going to use
this tap you can also use something like
this so you can use any of these two so
either this or this so in this case I
just wanted to provide more options so I
just wanted to go through this reproach
okay so I specified the entry point of
my application I specified the output so
which means once the bundle completes
where it has to be okay so the one the
output needs to be in this case I am
just using one object so I just go with
an object here okay even the entry can
just go with the one object here but I
am just going to leave it as use now the
next definition is the module every
particular bundle whatever you are going
to make as part of your web pack
configuration is always defined in the
forms module so whether you are
compressing or so whenever you minify
the JavaScript file or CSS file or
whenever you would like to have the
images or even fonts to be distributed
or made available in line everything is
considered as a module so in this case
again I am going to have a new module
specification to be maintained and I'm
going to use loaders as because I
already installed my loaders which is
the babel loader in my case so I am
going to have the Babel loader to be
used so this is the loader which is
mainly used for transportation and as I
mentioned Babel contains several
transportation mechanisms so which means
it has got ECMO script I script react.js
and so on but in my case if you go back
to packaged a Jason I installed only one
preset called ECMO script 2015 so if you
have react.js you are going to have
babel playset react and so on so in this
case i just wanted to go back to my web
pack configuration and i have to specify
which preset it needs to use so the
sorry Emma
I am already inside Cori so which resets
it needs to use so I am going to say it
needs to have atmosphere 2000
fifteen to be used so which means babel
order to be used and it has to use ahmed
2015 so if you go back to package
digestion you can see babel loader is
being used and this loader
behind-the-scenes user score anyway so
you do not need to actually include that
so this will be obvious whenever you are
using the babel loader so on top of the
Babel loader you have to specify which
preset in this case it is es2015 and if
you go back here you are going to see s
2015 here too okay so the next thing is
that what are all the files which needs
to be transpired so in this case I am
going to say please go through all the
JavaScript files check all the
JavaScript files and try to transpile
them so you have the word called test so
which means test whether the file name
is actually a JavaScript file in this
case so I am going to say please make
sure that that particular file is always
having the extension JavaScript so that
is dot J s so test means it tests
whether the file name ends with the dot
J sub mod that is what it is made I
don't know why they have provided this
name but we need to follow that
regardless okay so what I'm saying is
that please go through all the
JavaScript files and transplant them
using Babel loader with this preset
called Atma script 2015 okay but when we
say dot J's files it includes every
JavaScript file including everything
inside the node modules and so on
so I would like to be more specific
saying that please go through only this
folder called source so for that I am
going to say please include only one
path or one a folder called source so
this is the easiest way to write it so I
am using this path variable you can see
I am using the same path variable here
and I am going to say please resolve
source directory from the current
directory so this is automatically
provided as part of the web tax
framework
itself so I am saying that please
resolve SRC folder which is available
right from the current module folder so
it knows that how it knows on how to
figure out this source folder directly
just by using this statement so this is
pretty much about our mod sorry web pack
configuration so you have the path in
this case I am NOT using webpack you can
just forget it and you have specified
your entry that is entry part point of
your application so web pack whenever it
is cat trying to transplant it actually
goes through AB dot GS and figures out
ok it has to download this guy ok it has
to download this guy and so on so all of
that information it starts from AB dot
J's so that is the reason we need to
provide entry entry point and output
obviously once all the transformation is
being done
once all the compilation is being done I
mean completed then it has to
concatenate everything and put into one
JavaScript file called this one into
this path and how the transformation
should happen is usually configured as
part of your loader so in this case I am
using babel loader with respect to es
2015 preset so this is pretty much about
web pack configuration for our scenario
and this can go from very simple to
quite complicated based on our
particular application and our scenario
so you can literally have all the
plugins also to be included and even
several loaders to be also maintained
along with several other tasks if you
really wanted to integrate with task
runner and so on so this is something
like a very basic step we are going for
today ok so looks like we are almost
there so we have AB dot J's message dot
J's and we have index dot HTML which is
expecting app dot elder J s to be made
available as part of build so let me go
back to my command prompt ok and now you
can see how node modules ok let me open
this guy so inside the node modules I
have the bin and inside the bin I have
web pack if you install the web pack
globally you can say web
hack itself so but I do not have attack
installed globally on my system but I
installed a backpack locally for my
application so that is the reason I have
left pack made available as part of
package dot JSON so which means I have
web pack locally and that is the reason
I have node modules and web pack in this
case so in order to execute web pack or
in order to consider our web pack config
dot J's and execute our loaders and
transporation and everything all you
have to do is execute this guy web pack
dot CMD and it is available in node
module so I am going to say go to the
node modules folder and in that go to
the bin folder and in that execute web
pack commander so you don't need to
provide out CMD it knows that it cannot
it needs to automatically execute any
file which has got the extension CMD so
I just press enter here node underscore
modules oh I need to use the opposite
one so that is the backslash so if you
are using Mac or if you are using Linux
you will be using the front slash so as
this is Windows I need to use the
backslash and okay I have a typo
somewhere so which is test so let me see
what is the test here okay actually this
is supposed to be an object so I need to
have this one to be provided in the form
with an object okay so that is the
mistake so I saved it so let me go back
here clear and let me try executing it
once again okay so now you can see I
have a build folder and it has
automatically created app dot L dot j s
also AB dot all that jazz so it has
created it and it took almost something
like a minute to actually transpire this
whole thing so if you open the build
here you are going to see one file
called app dot all dot J's and this
whole file has been created by web pack
so you are going to see our particular
message class which has been transformed
into this way so which means you can see
I have show and I have my alert you can
see it has converted my message Dargis
which used it to be something like this
simple in order to make this particular
class to be made available throughout
all the browsers with the browsers can
understand it has actually transformed
that class into this one and not only
that even if you go to our app dot J's
for example show button right so let me
search for show button somewhere and now
you can see it has even transformed that
code into something like this so it is
beyond our what is a scope to actually
go through why it has created and how it
has created all this stuff but it is
just a quick heads up on how your
particular application related scripts
are being transpired into a JavaScript
once our script file which can be
understood by almost all the browsers so
I do not want to go much into the depth
here I just wanted to close it for now
and as you have AB dot all degeus let me
go back to my browser and let me refresh
it and now we should not be able to see
that error anymore and you are going to
see inside the build I have AB dot all
degeus so which is currently having
10,000 lines because it includes our
jQuery stuff as well so if you go back
to or what I say let me go back so if
you go back to my app dot J's you can
see I am including jQuery as well so if
you remove jQuery from here you are not
going to see that huge and all the code
of your jQuery will also be included
here as because it is bundling all of
the scripts into one file called AB dot
all de Geus so this guy includes a
message to Jess Abdul just jQuery DOJ's
and whatever you have specified here
everything will be included and that is
the reason it has got 10,000 lines there
ok but if you remove JavaScript I mean
jQuery stuffs it is going to be quite
lesser here okay that is
click on show and now you can see I have
hello world executed successfully okay
so that is pretty much about what I say
the pack in general and we might it
would be better if I actually explained
about what's also a bit so let me go
back to web.config here and imagine I
would like to have watching also to be
included as part of my configuration so
which means if I modify if I modify
message or Jace or AB dot J's it has to
automatically compile so in this case
let us consider I am NOT actually doing
this guy then for every modification so
which means if I say if I go back to
message digest and if I say something
like one in this case I had to go back
to my command prompt and execute this
webpack wait for one minute or two in
order to have that whole thing to be
compiled and once that is done then I
had to go back to my browser click on
show sorry you can refresh and then
click on show in order to get that one
but imagine I do not want to have that
step so which means I do not want to
execute this a command every time I
modify my particular JavaScript files
that is where the watch can be helpful
so I go back to some my configuration
here and I am going to say please have
watch to true so once I have this I can
go back to my command prompt execute
this command and now you can see it has
compiled or transpired into AB dot Elder
Jas and still it is waiting here for any
of the modifications to be taken into
the consideration so let me resize this
a bit so that you can see how it is
actually trying to do the watch so I
open message dot J's here and imagine
I'm modifying one to two and at the
moment I say file save you can see it
can automatically mod if I mean detect
that a file has been modified
it immediately transpired that in almost
like 80 milliseconds all you have to do
is go back to your browser refresh it
and click on show and it has to show to
now so let us do it once again let me
open this
so I'm modifying this 1 2 3 that's the
type of here and I go to file save and
now you can see it as completed it and
now I go to browser refresh this click
on show you are going to see 3 so in
that way you can have the watch to be
also made available in the form of
concert
I mean configuration so let me press
control C here to cancel this job and
there is another easier way so if you
are not quite happy with this watch
configuration right here you can remove
that however you can still accomplish
the same using the command web pack with
Watts right here so this is nothing but
you are saying that please execute this
whole content of the file with watch
consideration so just press ENTER here
and it is going to transpile anyway for
the first time and it will be waiting
there now I am going to modify so let me
resize this again so I go back to AB dot
j s sorry message digests and in this
case instead of 3 if I am going to say 4
and I say file save you can see it has
automatically detected the modifications
and it has created a new build out of it
and now let me go back to my browser and
click refresh and you are going to show
and you have got 4 ok so this is pretty
much about how you can have a pack to be
used as part of your JavaScript bundle
or I mean yes JavaScript bundler for
bundling or transpiling all of your Atma
script files and typescript files or
rare J's files into plain JavaScript
files using the watch or without watch
just by using client sites commands so
if you really wanted to include web pack
to be made available as part of task
runner you can still do it so and
is going to be covered in my upcoming
sessions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
