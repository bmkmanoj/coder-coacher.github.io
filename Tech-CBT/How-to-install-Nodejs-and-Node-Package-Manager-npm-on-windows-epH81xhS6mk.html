how to install node.js and node package
manager simply NPM on Windows machine so
first of all I open any browser
I search for node.js and the first thing
is node.js dot R that is the website we
are going to open and once inside that
you are going to see install so just
click on that which will essentially try
to download a particular file so just
click on save so that is nothing but the
set of file size open it and click on
that so this is the setup wizard to
install node.js so I click Next X of the
terms and this is the folder it is going
to create and at the same time install
node.js so this is very much essential
and at the same time the same particular
path will also be getting added to the
path variable of environment variables
list so you need to ensure that this
path is always added to environment
variables so this during the
installation process it is automatically
going to be done by the setup itself but
just in case if you miss you will need
to have it done manually if not the
setup does automatically next and these
are all the things currently it is
trying to install you can see right now
all of those are selected so if you
don't want anything to be not available
on your machine you can just remove that
so for example in this case I would like
to have everything
be selected and installed so nodejs a
runtime this is the most important piece
is because that is the core so without
this node will never execute so you can
say it installs essentially note that
exe so using no dot exe we can have any
kind of node.js based application
development to be developed executed and
tested the next one is NPM package
manager
so NPM stands for north package manager
and this particular package manager is
very much essential whenever we would
like to have any kind of external node
packages to be imported into your
application so during the development of
any kind of node application you might
be really in requirement of multiple
other packages which could be outsourced
or on the web to be imported and then
include those particular components as
part of your application development so
for those purposes NPM is a must so
whenever you are installing node it is
essential to have NPM as because
eventually you will be having more and
more node packages to be installed and
imported as part of your application and
the last piece is add to path so as I
mentioned earlier this makes your
environment path variable to have your
directory see Program Files nodes yes to
be automatically added to the path if it
does not do that automatically or for
some reason if you miss that here you
will have to do that manually so I think
next now and I click install so while it
is installing it will be asking you for
the permissions and just plus yes for
now
so once it's a it has completed its
installation we are going to see this
message so just first finish up to this
and we have nord successfully installed
so let us test how node has been
installed on how to execute any kind of
JavaScript so you just go to the start
and type for node and you should be able
to see node E is automatically made
available after the installation so if
you need it
just right-click that and say pin to
start so that you can always start right
from here so just click on this guy in
order to get to the node so this is the
environment or the command prompt or
repl where you can have any kind of node
based commands to be executed so for
example I can have a JavaScript
statement something like variable X
equal to 20 to be executed and now I can
say please display the value of X and
you can see I got the value of x
displayed automatically which is nothing
but 20 in my previous statement so you
can always exit the environment with
that command dot exit so this is the
command where you can always exit from
the node command prompt
so just press pass and we are going to
be out of it so you can also test how
the path has been added to your machine
by right-clicking all your machine going
to the properties and then you are going
to see advanced of system settings and
inside that you are going to see
environment variables and there you are
going to see path so let us edit that
and you are going to see the exact path
we have seen earlier as part of your
installation so this has been
automatically added by the node.js
installation so for some reason if this
is missing ensure that it is always made
available or make it manually possible
so as now the node has been installed
successfully we can also execute it
right from the command prompt by just
pressing window R go to the command
prompt and now you can just say nota
so essentially you can see your once I
type in node you can see that I always
have that node prompt to be made
available there and now I can say X
variable y equal to something like 30
and now I can always display the value
of y which essentially is nothing but 30
and in order to get out of the node mark
up the node command prompt just say dot
exit so in that way we have simply
checked leather node is working properly
or not we can also test a couple of
JavaScript statements by going to
something like you know I can just start
my own notepad plus plus and type in
some JavaScript something like variable
X equal to 10 and readable y equal to 20
and then I can say a console dot log so
I can say sum equals x plus y so this is
the JavaScript to have in place so let
me save it somewhere I go to save and in
this case I would like to go to desktop
and then sorry and let me let me go to C
directly and let me go to users and
personal and just type in something like
sample dot J's so you can see that I'm
actually putting sample that yes which
is nothing but the file name inside
double quotations just to ensure that it
will not be a adding dot txt
automatically so if you put in double
quotations that is the exact file name
it is going to name it without adding
any other extension automatically so I
just
save for now and you can see it as their
sample of GS sci-fi type in dar you
should be able to see sample that GS
which is there and now I can execute
that by just typing node sample that Jas
and you should be able to see some equal
to 30 which is nothing by 10 plus 20
equal to 30 so in that way we can have
node to be installed and tested within
the environment of Windows 8</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
