dollar state service which is available
as part of you a router if you are
already familiar to end it out then
dollar state service is very similar to
dollar to out surveys in n0 out okay
let's jump into your router state
service what exactly state service in
you a router
whenever I would like to have more
control on how you edit or can be used
as part of our application then I can
make use of dollar states always so
whenever I say more control which means
you are trying to access more features
available as part of your router to make
your application more powerful so what
are all the various features I can
really access or make use of your router
imagine I am currently on a particular
state or on a particular route how do i
refresh it or how do I reload it so if
you would like to reload or refresh any
particular route we can make use of
dollar states always again imagine I
would like to fetch some information
related to a particular state or
particular route then we can make use of
state service and imagine I would like
to really fetch the details of the
current state and then play with those
parameters and so on related to the
current state then we can still make use
of dollar states away so which means you
can literally work with any state access
any of those parameters reload those
states or modify those particular
parameters as I flush the route and all
of those things can be easily
accomplished using dollar state service
and not just those imagine I would like
to navigate from one state to another or
from one row to another without really
using URLs or you is just what we have
been seeing earlier then we can still
make use of dollar state service so
which means imagine inside a click event
I would like to really switch to some
other route how would I do that without
really using URL are you is Ray then
dollar states are which is the way to go
okay what are all various members
available as part of state service so
first of all state is a service which
can be injected into any of your
controllers and the moment you inject
dollar straight into the controller then
you have access to dollar state object
which essentially contains all of these
properties so which means you literally
have current and params so I can simply
access dollar state dot current and the
current is literally having parameters
data and several other UI state related
information and you can access all of
those so in order to access the current
parameters of course you can always use
dollar state parameters as covered in my
previous video but apart from that it
can still make use of dollar states
service in order to access current state
related parameters but just simply
saying dollar state dot current dot
params and if what from current or
parameter property called params which
is in one way or another very similar to
how you are trying to access the other
way using current dot params so you can
also access the same parameters using
dollar stated parents this is just an
alternative way and imagine the
properties you have these four main
methods so which means in order to
reload or refresh the current state or
current route you can always use dollar
state to reload you can also make use of
go and use the reload feature by sending
the reload options so which means state
that go essentially can be used to
navigate from one state to another or
from one route to another and whenever
you are rerouting to some other state
you can also provide the options to
reload the state or refresh that state
with new parameters you can also make
use of the same go member or same go
method in order to refresh the current
route also by providing the railroad
options and on top of that you also have
get so get is mainly used to get more
information or fetch more information
about the current route or any other
state whatever you mentioned so in order
to get some information about a
particular state you can always use get
if you don't provide any state name it
just simply returns all the currently
available
State and you can make use of those
particular members by just simply saying
dot so I can say dollar state dot get
and you will have all the array or
collection of those particular states
and you can access first one second one
third one dot and still you can access
params and other related members you can
also test whether our particular state
is currently the state you would like to
have in the conditional status so which
means I can use this ease method in
order to simply dynamically test whether
your particular current state is
matching with whatever the state you are
trying to provide so this is mainly used
for if conditions or conditional
validation of the current state and
apart from that you can use this to get
more information about the state you can
use go to navigate from one state to
another you can also use go to reload
the current state with more options or
particularly reload to just reload or
refresh the current state apart from the
above you also have all these particular
events those are state change that state
change success and so on these are the
events which are mainly used to actually
keep track of those particular
navigations you are actually doing
across your particular application so
which means whenever you switch from one
state to another these are the state
related events which are going to be
fired so this is going to be fired
immediately whenever you are going to
switch from one state to another and by
actually handling this event you have
access to previous state and even the
next state what you are going to switch
to similarly this is the event which is
going to be filed once you are switching
has been successful if it is not
successful and if it is actually
throwing an error the third event is the
one which is going to be firing and if
you would like to handle any kind of
state which is running into no state so
which means you are trying to access a
state which is not available then this
is the event which is going to be fired
so these are the mainly you will members
which are available as part of state
surveys and of course there are several
other where you can simply get through
the documentation so let us jump into
some code
okay so this is a simple HTML file where
I'm having some kind of SPI based layout
where I'm going to have a header and
home and just the left panel and the
right panel and the left panel is just
simply showing a particular link to this
state called calculator and from here
whenever that particular state is going
to be loaded it is going to load
actually in this UI view so the moment I
click on this calculator it essentially
goes to this calc which is defined in
this manner so this calc essentially go
to goes to our calculates DML which is
defined in this way which is going to
show us just two input boxes a and B and
those are automatically bound to a and B
of the members of scope and on top of
that you can see it actually works with
calculator controller which is defined
in this fashion so right now a and B are
defaulted to zero and those particular
values will be automatically reflected
as part of the template you have
mentioned right here and whenever this
state gets loaded this template gets
loaded and gets bound to this controller
so let us see how this is going to be
shown and let me refresh this and
currently there is no doubt here so I
just click on this and now you can see a
and B related members are actually
defined with zeros and they have been
automatically made available to our UI
view and you can see calculator hTML is
the one which is exactly downloaded as
because that is the template you have
mentioned okay so now let us actually
add a new state so the main meaning of
this particular state in this case is
actually whenever I have a button here
which says do some or some kind of
operation here the moment I click on
this button it has to navigate to some
other state and that particular state
has to show me the result so I need to
have a and B values to be summed up and
the result needs to be shown in some
other state and that particular state is
the one what we are going to develop now
so I'm going to say something like a new
State and I would like to call the name
of the state as ad with the necessary
options I am going to provide here okay
so this particular state currently has
to go to some URL so which means I need
to specify the routing URL so in this
case I am going to say add and it is
going to exit two parameters which are
going to be stored in a and B
respectively and then I can specify
template a URL which is actually
supposed to show our result in the form
of HTML so which means the result of a
and B that is a plus B needs to be shown
as part of this template and in order to
work with all of these I will need a
controller and I would like to call this
controller as ad controller in this case
so this is pretty simple state
configuration so I have the routing URL
with the parameter set template URL of
course any a still need to defend as
well dot HTML and I need to create add
controller Lancel so let me create add
controller right here so I just go I
just would like to copy whatever I have
in here so that I can just get rid of
whatever I already have in place and the
name of this controller is going to be
add controller so I just copy that here
so I would like to make use of the scope
anyway so I am going to still make use
of it and at the same time I would like
to calculate the value that is the sum
of those two parameters a and B so I am
going to get those two values into these
two parameters this could be P and Q or
R or M and L any of those particular
parameter names will be working for us
but in this case I chose a and B so I
need to have those two variables or
those two parameters to be made
accessible as part of my controller so
for that purpose I'm going to use dollar
Street parameters because I wanted to
access those two parameters a and B so I
am going to use dollar state parameters
right here
so which means I need to inject into the
function as well so in that way I have
access to state parameters so I'm going
to define something like if dollar state
parameters has a already defined
which means if I get those two values
there then I would like to define scope
that a equal to dollar params there is
state parameters that a so similarly I
am going to say 4b also so if the user
provides the value of B then this should
also take two the values of B but
imagine a or B are not provided then you
would like to have some kind of
initialization process to be done before
even you assign to it so I would like to
assign some kind of default values to a
and B for this controller so if those
values are not provided like a and B are
not provided those will be actually
defaulted to zero okay and now I would
like to have the result of the
calculator which is nothing but sum so
I'm going to say scope dot result equal
to in this case I just would like to
convert my value of scope that a to
integer and then similarly convert
another that is scope dot B so I'm
summing up a and B and the result is
going to be stored in the result so this
is just another member in the scope
which is going to be defined as part of
our result dot HTML so I'm going to make
use of that in result dot HTML so let me
create a new file called result as tml
and inside this resistance all I am
going to do is create a couple of days
so that I can actually retrieve the
member result and just display that
right here so I am going to say show
this the if and only if a member result
is actually present as part of the scope
so I am going to say calculated results
this is just a literal that is part of
your markup and I am going to use the
results as part of our binding so you
are trying to actually access this
result member right here and in this
case this is not necessary but as
mentioned if you are trying to add any
kind of progress
or something like that then we can make
use of it so currently let me culture
that I just wanted you to move that okay
so now I need to go to calculator HTML
and add a new button here so that it
actually comes up right here
so I need to have a new button here
which actually takes these two values
and send to the new state so for that
purpose I am going to say something like
a new button needs to be added and that
needs to be actually assigned to a
particular click event so in this case I
would like to call this that one has do
add and the caption of the button is
going to be add so whenever I click on
this button it is going to execute do
add which is expected in the current
scope so the current scope of calculate
dot HTML in this case is actually our
calculator controller that is Cal
controller you can see our capital
controller is the one which is working
with calculator HTML so there is no add
click event currently present here so I
need to define that as part of my scope
and I am going to say scope dot do add
function ok so this is a function which
is going to be executed at the moment I
click on that button so if I click this
it is going to be here so what do I need
to do here I need to switch to this
particular state ad so I am currently in
calculator 4 which means you are
currently in this route calculator so
you are trying to switch from this
calculator to add so for that purpose I
need to work with the dollar state
service so in order to work with the
dollar state service the first thing is
that I need to inject it so I need to
say something like dollar state so which
means I'm saying that I would like to
use my dollar state service as well at
this controller and also I am going to
use dollar straight there and now here I
am going to say dollar state go so go is
the method which gives us the
flexibility to switch from one state to
another so in this case I am saying that
please switch to state ad so what is the
state ad that is nothing but this guy so
I am giving the same name of that one
right here and while I'm giving that I
can also provide
any kind of parameters if that state is
expecting in the form of a JSON object
so in this case you can see our ad is
actually expecting a and B values so in
order to provide those two values in the
form of an object I'm going to get the
current values of a and current value of
B as well so from the current controller
it actually takes a and B offense to
this object sense to the state aid and
that particular ad is going to receive
those two values into two new variables
called a and B which are still going to
be made used as part of your ad
controller so you are going to access
those two new variables a and B as part
of state parameters in aid controller
and you are assigning those two so
there's a typo so you're going to assign
those two right inside your scope here
and score be respectful to your ad
controller so this scope is different
from this scope and this V and B are
different from this a and B so this
could be M and n as well so those could
be anything and finally once you are
actually doing the sum it is going to
put into the result which is going to be
shown as part of your result dot HTML
right here so let us see if everything
is working fine with no issues so I go
in here
go home refresh this and click on the
controller and now you can see I have
ADD so now I go to one - so which miss
10 and 20 the moment I click on add you
can see it has actually downloaded
result HTML and that result at HTML by
default has got whatever we had defined
in our template but it could understand
that it has to do the sum of 10 and 20 s
because we switched it to the route ad
by actually sending the values 10 and 20
so this 10 and 20 s are actually
reflected into a and B which are being
retrieved using state parameters and
finally being added put into result and
that particular result is actually
applied right here so in that way I have
a simple way of accessing the state
service by actually injecting dollar
states away
and at the same time using the go method
to actually navigate from one state to
another loop so imagine I would like to
have the back button right because you
can see right here I can't go back until
and unless I click calculator again so
what I would like to see is once I am in
the new state and once I click add I
would like to have a simple back button
here which can actually simply go back
to the previous state or say in this
case calculate state so for that I would
like to have a new addition to our
result because the result is the one
which is supposed to show that so I'm
going to add an anchor tag and in this
case I just would like to use our famous
UIs roof which is covered in my previous
video and I would like to say please go
to calculate so that is the state name
and this is separator so there is no H
stuff needed so just need to remove this
guy okay so that was the mistake I need
to provide something like back button
here now I go back and now just go to
the fresh go to calculator and I am
going to say something like 10 and 20
and click add and now you can see I have
a back button here at the moment I click
on back you can see it has simply
switched it to the previous state and
imagine I would like to perform the same
kind of calculator related back button
using programming rather than you is Rev
so for that purpose so in this case I
just wanted to provide something like
this so that it shows in a better
fashion and now I would like to create
an button instead of you is rough or the
anchor tag so in this case I would like
to have a button which actually says
something like back so this particular
back is going to actually access go back
method which is supposed to be expected
as part of our current
scope so you can do this result related
controller so the Zulte related
controller is actually add controller so
our add controller is expected to have
that go back method so I need to define
a new go back method as part of our
controller so for that purpose I'm going
to say something like go back right here
you can define at any location but I
just would like to make sure that it is
actually defined at any location in this
fashion that is dollar state dot go and
in this case I am going to say please go
back to calculator but are we using
dollar straight here there is no dollar
state which has been injected so I
really need that to be injected here so
I am going to say dollar state and I am
going to use the dollar state in the
function and finally I have that dollar
state being used and they accessing the
go method which actually expects the
calculator state with no parameters so
let me see this and I go home refresh
this go to calculator I go to 10 and 20
and click add and now you are going to
see the back button and also the our UI
is rough of course you can use either of
these two in this case and the moment I
click on back you can see it is
automatically switching to calculator so
now we can understand like how we can
use the dollar state service in order to
switch from one state to another using
the go method I would like to have more
to be understood on what are all the
features available as part of develop
States so which means I would like to
know what are all the methods and what
are all the properties a state service
may have so for that I just would like
to check but just simply saying console
dot log dollar state so that is the
easiest way on exploring the dollar
state object so this is going to be
showing if and only if we are in the ad
controller or probably I can also
make that to be made available here so
that once I click on go back I just
would like to show the entire object
information here you can put anywhere so
I go back here I go home click
calculator and I'm going to say 10 and
20 here so let me clear everything
whatever I have in place click Add and
now I click back now you can see this is
the dollar states always and you always
have the current property which actually
gives us the current controller the name
of the state and at the same time the
template it is currently assigned to and
routing URL and on top of that you also
have the params object so this parents
currently dollar params
I mean dollar state couldn't give you
parameters here as because the
calculator is the route which doesn't
have any kind of parameters so if I move
this one to top and let us see how this
is going to show now so I go home
refresh this clip calculator 10 and 20
and click add and now let us see how the
states are which is showing us now I
open the parameters and now you can see
it is actually showing a and B as the
parameters which are having 10 and 20 so
instead of actually using dollar state
parameters here other ways actually
using dollar state dot params dot a that
is just another way so similarly if I
use current here you can also use
current parameters so let us modify our
code a bit so instead of using dollar
state-backed parameters i just wanted to
comment this so instead of writing
dollar scope dot a equal to instead of
using dollar state parameters i am going
to use dollar state that the ions that a
and similarly i can also make use of B
right here so if you are using the low
state everywhere then you don't need to
inject all the state parameters at all
so you can just remove these two so I
just wanted to leave it like that for
now so I go back here
so it'll flash this and now I'm going to
say ten and twenty and still it should
work with no issues now you can see I
still got the same thing okay and on top
of that we can also make use of dollar
state get so which means it can actually
show all the information related to all
the states by just writing this so this
actually gives us the list of all the
states configured so in this case I have
four states and in general it not only
gives all these four states information
but also any kind of built in states
what it has calculated based on your
configuration of the states but you are
if you really would like to have more
information about a particular state
then I can just specify please get all
the information the letter particular
state called add and that isiliye gives
us the information only related to add
but not everything else so again so let
me go home refresh this I go to
calculator and ten and twenty and click
add and now if you open this you can see
it actually shows us the information
related to only the state add by just
displaying its controller its name and
the templated information and URL how it
is supposed to be configured so that is
how you can use dollar get sorry dollar
state that get okay so this is pretty
much about dollar state but let us do
something more that is imagine I would
like to have some defaults or some
custom information to be provided for
this state you can always provide some
external data using an attribute called
data so literally you can provide any
kind of information in the form of JSON
here even though the documentation says
only data you can also provide any other
information I can say employee and I can
just provide whatever the information
you would like to provide here similarly
customer and provide whatever the
information you would like to have here
so you don't necessarily be working only
with the data but the documentation says
anything that resembles the data is some
external
so we better be with this until and
unless there is a very good reason to
use something else other than data so
let me remove this and imagine I would
like to provide some variable something
like multiplier 10 so which means I'm
saying that this member is always
available through this data object to be
used by this ad controller
whenever I am using the state ad so this
state ad has got this information to be
automatically accessible using dollar
state service so how do you use it let's
go down all the way and make use of it
so in this case I would like to have
that particular we are able to be
accessible by using dollar states so I
can say dollar state go to the current
state and get the object data which is
nothing but the above one so this is the
data object so this is the data object
so data dot multiplier so I can just use
data dot multiplier right here so let me
actually do the bracket here so that it
will have a better calculation so first
of all it does the sum of these two and
then multiplies with the value 10
whatever it is supposed to receive from
so let me see if everything is working
fine so i refresh this so there is some
type of somewhere so let us fix that
okay we may sit this so I don't need a
semicolon right here so just need to
remove that so I go back here let me
refresh this calculate it 10 20 click
add and now you can see I actually got
300 because 10 plus 20 is 30 and 13 to
10 which is actually retrieved from the
multiplier member and 13 to 10 becomes
300 so in that way you can always access
some custom information available in the
dollar state using dollar states always
okay so the next one is using Ajax as
part of your routing so till now we have
been working everything
the client said now I would like to
actually fetch the information from the
server side and then get the results
from the server side and eject into our
car interview so how do I accomplish
that so for that purpose I am already
having a node.js application currently
running here so you can see I have node
app running at localhost 8,000
which is actually performing some kind
of add operation based on whatever the
values you provide so we can quickly
check from using postman and how it is
trying to add so I have that in the form
of expose calculate so you can see these
two are currently the endpoints made
available as part of my server-side
application that is load yes in this
case so you can use this kind of URL
like API add provides those two values
and it knows how to get the values out
of those two similarly multiplied and it
knows how to get the values of those two
as well so if I click on this and open
in builder we can quickly test on how it
is going to work so it is a get
operation on this particular URL which
is 8,000 s because we are listening at
8,000 here so the moment I click on send
you can see the values of 10 and 20 are
going to be summed up and returned in
the form of 30 so I have an intentional
delay here like 3 to 5 seconds I think
in this case 4 seconds not sure what it
is but whatever the value you provide
here and click send it is going to have
some kind of delay so that we can make
use of that delay in our application in
a proper way and now you can see it has
got the result as well so I would like
to access this URL and those two values
need to be sent to the server and the
server responds the result in the form
of some kind of value and I would like
to get that value and get it injected
into our UI view so in order to
communicate with that Ajax
I currently wrote a simple data service
so I just wanted to make use of that in
my application so I go to C and this is
my test I just would like to make use of
this and if you open data service you
are going to see this
so currently again we already configured
to 8,000 API and ad is a method which is
exposed out of my service and multiplies
another method so during the ad I'm
actually doing a hedge to tip it equals
to ad with those two values provided in
the function using the get method and it
actually results the promise out of it
so I just would like to make use of this
service in my application so for that
purpose the first thing is that I really
need to use that in my script tag right
here so I just would like to use data
service to be used as part of my
application so that is the data service
right here and I need to inject that
into my controller as because currently
ad is the controller which does this
operation so instead of doing this
operation in this way I would like to
have our calculation to be done at the
server so the server access is always
available through data service so I need
to inject that right here and similarly
right here
and I'm going to access the service
using this variable here and in order to
access that all I have to do is dot ad
so that is the method which has been
exposed and it takes two parameters so
currently those parameters are nothing
but our scope dot a and scope dot B so
those two are the values we are going to
send and once I get the result out it is
going to be made available as part of
result and in using this result I will
be actually placing the value into this
result so this is a result whatever we
receive from the server it could be our
or whatever so let me put R so that it's
not going to be confused so the server
results in the form of added data which
contains whatever the value it is going
to return 30 or 40 or whatever the value
it has calculated and of course I need
to help my multiplier also to be used as
because I would like to take advantage
of that value as the multiplier is also
multiplier with whatever the value very
few from the server is going to be
placed in the result so once it is in
the reserve
it knows how to display right inside
here so let us see if everything is
working fine I just didn't touch it
again clean everything so you can see it
right now I am on calculator HTML 1 2 so
that is 10 and 20 let me clear all the
requests click on add and now you can
see the result that hTML is already
there and now I have the calculation
from the server so how does it calculate
from the server so if you see here you
can see it is actually going through
localhost 8080 I at 10 and 20 if you
click this you can see the result is 30
so that 30 is actually returned back and
multiply this out multiplier and finally
we are getting the result back so let me
clear again and of course I don't need
that so let me actually comment this one
so that will be focusing on what we
really need okay let me refresh this so
I give 20 and 30 now click click add you
can see it is displaying the view but it
is still delayed because it is actually
getting the information from the server
so that delay is artificial in this case
so let me actually do once again and
observe how it is doing so I click again
add the view is already displayed
however the result is still delayed and
finally we have this so that exist a
small delay as because we are actually
getting that information from the server
and server is taking bit more time in
order to calculate something okay so
when it is when the server is doing some
manipulation I would like to show
something like you know some kind of
progress message here and I would like
to show this entire text if and only if
I retrieve the results so then the user
can easily understand oh it is doing
some kind of process at the server and
once the server is completed has its
action I should be expecting some result
so that kind of message is always good
for the user to really show so let me
modify our application a bit so that it
actually shows some kind of progress so
for that I am going to add a new member
called is loading
so by default I would like to proceed
through so which means I'm saying that
it is currently loading and I'm going to
use this variable right inside my result
so similarly I go back here and I'm
going to say is loading equal to file so
which means once the server has
completed then means it is successfully
completed and once it has completed I
would like to put in to result and I
would like to immediately switch is
loading to false from true so which
means it is not loading anymore so I
just save this and now let us go back
here so that is our result and I'm going
to say something like another day so in
this case that du has to show if and
only if is loading equal to true so in
this case I am going to say some span
style equals color red and I am going to
say loading please wait or something
whatever the message you would like to
show and I do not want this do to be
shown whenever it is actually loading so
I am going to just give the opposite of
this guy so I am going to say something
like ng-hide so let us see if this is
working fine so I go back here click
home refresh this I go to calculator
heck probably 10 + 20 + click add and
now you can see it is actually showing
that loading please wait and once it is
done you can see we got the result
everything along with whatever the
message you have provided and also from
the server whatever it has returned so
let us just once again I provide 20 and
30 and click add now you can see it is
working as the way we are expecting it
to be ok so that is pretty much on how
you can actually show progress messages
while we are switching from one state to
another and doing some kind of Ajax
operations clear now let us jump into
events so this is a bit different
concept that
those events whatever we discussed so
far does our change start chain success
change error and so on so how do I work
with these events and keep track of how
we are actually switching from one state
to another of course you can also
accomplish that easily by actually
adding even handlers to those events
using the root scope so for that I can
just make use of run whatever we have in
place and using the run the first thing
is that we will be working with root
scope so I need to inject that and root
scope whatever I have provided here so
which means those events can only be
handled right from the root scope some
using the root scope I'm going to say on
the event of that is dollar state change
stat I would like to have my own
function to be executed so that is the
simplest way of actually adding your he
went handler so which means this
function is going to be executed every
time a particular state is actually
emitting this event so if this event is
raised your function is going to be
executed and who is going to raise this
event UI router itself so ui-router has
got this event and UI writer framework
knows when to raise this event which
actually gives us more information from
what state you are switching to another
state so all that information can be
easily accessible through various
parameters what every wire router is
going to be giving us whenever you would
like to handle that you and that is ute
information is always available in e and
to which state you are currently
switching to that is in the form of flow
State this is just available you can
provide T also any variable is good and
any parameters and from which state you
are actually trying to switch from so
that is some state
and farm States parameters if they have
any and if there are any options on top
of it so all of that information is
readily available for you and you can
always make use of that and try to
console or probably you can use it in
one way or another by just getting those
variables related information so all I
can say in this case is I'm currently in
start change event of course I'm not yet
using any of these particular variables
so that is just for your information and
similarly I would like to use success
and I would like to use success here and
of course success has got something
different that is it doesn't have
options so there are no options provided
by the UL order for that so you still
have access to to state 2 parameters
from state and from parameters okay I
need to provide this and this right here
ok so I go back there and go home to
flash this and now you can see it as
actually provided state change stat and
state change success so it was trying to
start this to change the state and once
it is done immediately it is going to
fight this guy so let me clear and
everything and click on calculator now I
am switching to a new state and you can
see how the events are being fired and
similarly let me clear this I go to 1 2
and click add now you can see still it
is showing us start and success of the
next route so if I would like to have
more information yes
so the easiest way to know what is going
on I would actually simply log the
object first and then get whatever I
need from that object so that is the
easiest way on how I can get more
information so let me clear everything
and click refresh ok now you can see in
the change stat this is the first one is
to state and the second one is from
state so if I go back here
this is the two states I am saying that
we are actually switching to this
particular state and what is the from
state so right now there is no from
state in general so that is a pretty
route or the master of our application
so let us clear everything and now I
jump to calculator so which means you
are switching from the root to the
calculator state so once I do this so
you can see you are actually switching
toothpaste as calculator and the from
state as the root so let me clear
everything here and I can also say 10
and 20 and click Add now you are going
to jump from calculator to add so the
moment I do that you can see I have
access to add and at the same time the
from is actually calculated so how do I
just get the name the simplest way you
are already working with the same object
all you have to do is just get beta I
mean the property name that is named
some similarly if you wanted to access
any kind of data you can just provide
data here so how do I get that this name
gives the name of that particular state
if you would like to have the data just
do this and so on so that is the easiest
way on how to pull more information
related to that particular event by
accessing those variables so this is
pretty much about what you have in
dollar state and in the coming up videos
we are going to look into multiple
nested views and nested States and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
