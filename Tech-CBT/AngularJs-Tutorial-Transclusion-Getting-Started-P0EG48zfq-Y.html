confusing concepts in angularjs even the
word transclusion itself in this video
we are going to learn about what exactly
is transclusion in angularjs and how can
we achieve it using a couple of samples
this video is just an introduction to
transclusion in our coming up videos we
are going to see transclusion in much
more detail including transclusion scope
and so on but for now we'll be just
having some understanding about
transclusion for the first time as part
of your angular JS tutorial itself
Before we jump onto transclusion we need
to have some understanding and the
directive and the template and how they
are really related to each other so this
is not really about transclusion but it
is about directive and template in
general imagine I have my markup in this
manner so this is my view which is
associated with the controller called
sample and this is a message from the
controller and now I have another do
with message so what exactly is this
message that's nothing but our directive
so in this case I am defining a
directive called message and I'm using
the same message right here so which
means for this element do we are going
to have our directive to be applied so
what is it going to apply in fact it is
going to apply this template so you can
see I can have my own MST dot HTML which
can have this markup and at runtime
this particular markup will be
automatically injected into this
template because we are using this
directive so we are saying that this do
works with this directive and this
directive actually gets the markup from
this template and injects that as part
of this do and finally the output will
be something like this so you are going
to see the controller some message from
the controller and this particular do
being transformed in this fashion so
which means you are specifying just the
div in your markup but as this is being
decorated with the directive
the content of the day will also have
this particular template and that
template will be carried further down
here so in that way we are having our
directive to be including the content
from some other template so that
particular template is being associated
with the directive and the directives
being applied to our element and finally
our element is going to get that
template directly as part of the content
of that element so this is how usually
the directives and the templates work
but let us go to another case now we are
talking about not just directive and
template but also a bit about content so
when I say content the content relative
to directive so very similarly now you
can see I have another controller B I
mean the same controller sample being
applied for this particular markup and
we have all the rest of the scenarios
and you can also see I still have the
same directly called message which is
being applied and you can see I also
have my own template which is pretty
similar to what we have seen in the
previous slide and that is also is
supposed to be injected and you can see
we have the output as this one so what
is the difference between this versus
the previous one when you see this you
can see we are actually having this
particular content to be replaced with
this content whenever it is rendered so
from the mark-up perspective you are
going to say this but once it has been
executed and transformed by angularjs
framework you are going to see the
output as this one and where is our
template so you can see this template is
actually injected here but there is one
point missing in this entire diagram
that is this part we do not see this one
anywhere whenever you go in this fashion
so what happened to this one so if you
really consider this this is considered
as the content of this directive related
markup so which means I have an element
called Deo which is applying a directory
called message and whenever we are
applying the message it knows that it
actually picks
it needs to pick up this particular
template and inject that template right
here and that is what it did and what it
really did was it replaced the content
of our particular element with this
template and thus we are over writing
whatever the content it has with this
template so in fact we are actually
missing this entire content whatever you
put in here will be automatically lost
will be replaced with this template but
that is not what we really want in
general so in my opinion in my case I
really want this particular day to be
having the message to be applied there
is the director to be applied that
actually brings down this guy and inside
this one I would like to have this is
inner message to be placed somewhere in
this fashion so that I am going to say
do message and the template and this
content to be somewhere injected right
in here within the template that is
nothing but transclusion so which means
you would like to have the content from
some other template to be injected into
another template and finally to be
rendered that is anathan but the
transclusion so we are going to see that
in the next slide so let us just try to
understand what exactly's transclusion
here again the same story we have the
controller sample with some message from
the controller and we have the deal
which is having our message as the
directive being applied and that
particular detective is having the
template in this fashion and now this
particular template is going to be
injected right in here however as part
of the output now you can see I have the
template this is from message template
this is the message I have in place and
you can also see that this is inner
message is also going to be finally made
available as part of the output so the
only difference is that we are not
replacing this content but instead we
are actually extracting this content out
of this and placing right inside the
template at once
particularly ocean and that is what is
client
illusion so how did I achieve it so you
can see this is our normal markup that
is our element which is being
transformed in this fashion and we have
also our template which is also
transformed in this fashion but the only
difference is that we have the content
and that particular content is also made
available here because we have
transclude equal to true that is the
first attribute which we need to be
taking care of so whenever we would like
to have the content to be included in
the output the first thing is that we
need to have our directive to be
decorated with transclude option with
true so that's the first thing the next
thing is that whenever we say transclude
the meaning of transclude is please
extract the content and fix somewhere or
inject somewhere so whenever you find
the word transclude just try to
understand it is going to be just
extract the content of an existing
markup element and inject that somewhere
else so where do we inject it that is
where this ng transclude is meant for so
I am saying that whenever it is trying
to extract the content that extractor
content should be actually massaged by
angular JS framework
get the markup out of it I mean the term
out of it and inject that wherever this
ng transclude attribute is actually
applied so in this case angularjs what
it does is it actually brings this this
is inner message so that is the message
which will be extracted and finally
injected right here and that is exactly
what you are saying here so this deal is
nothing but this div and this message is
injected right in this div which
actually gets in this format so even
though you are working with the same
template this template is actually
getting the information or content from
some other template that is anathema
transclusion so now you can see we have
all of these three working together to
actually get our transclusion to be
working so you have transclude equal to
true you have to use ng include I mean
ng transclude that is your specific
where the extracted content needs to be
injected so that is what is this
specification for so transclude equal to
true ng transclude specifies where the
content needs to be injected and finally
during the rendering process this
content is going to be injected right at
the same location where ng transclude is
supposed to be mentioned and all of this
process will be taking care if and only
if you specify transclude equal to true
and this whole process together is
nothing but transclusion so in general
transclusion means include content of a
template into another so we are actually
getting the content of a particular
template here this is another viewer
template we are getting or extracting
that particular content out of it and
injecting it and to another template so
that is nothing but transclusion so we
are going to see how we can achieve this
as part of examples not just ng
transclude we are going to go through a
couple more examples as well so let me
open my HTML here and also my java
script so this is just a simple
controller called sample and you can see
i have the sample right here with no
content literally so let me modify my
controller sorry my particular a ng app
with a directive so which means i am
including a new directory called message
1 so I need to have a function to define
my directive and in this case all I am
going to say is my directive needs to
have the content or the template to be
used from message 1 dot HTML so I do not
have message 1 dot HTML so let me create
it so I am going to call this one as
message 1 dot HTML so that I this is
actually the template we are talking
about so in this case all I am going to
say is I am going to say something like
this is from message 1 template so this
is a straightforward message which needs
to be injected right here so I need to
modify my controller
related markup so first of all I just
would like to provide a simple static
message that this is from the controller
so nothing much special here and once
done with the controller message I would
like to have the message one related
directive so this is message one
director here I just wanted to mention
that so this is also static message you
can put whatever the message you want
this is just a plain text and I would
like to say instance one for now and
this is our markup and I am saying that
please apply my template called message
one so this message one is nothing but
the one related to this one so this deal
gets applied or this directive message
one gets applied on this day oh and this
directive message one in turn works with
this template to get all the content and
finally inject or right inside this div
so let us see if this is working fine so
I go back here and I'm going to say
localhost is zero one and now you can
see this is controller this is what we
have in place from the controller
message and you can see message one
instance one is a static text however
this information is injected by actually
extracting that one from the template
and finally making it available right
inside the markup of the main
application so once you open your
developer tools and if we go in here and
just select this guy you are going to
see inside the do message you actually
have your template automatically
injected so this is what I was talking
about so inside the do you have this
template injector so which is fine no
transclusion happened here it is just
the normal way on how the directive on
the template will be working together so
the next thing is that let me take this
one to the next level so I would like to
say instance two just for our
understanding and probably I would need
a break tag here so that we will see
some difference and separation from the
previous one so this is also message one
and I would like to say this is
in our message so my expectation is that
I would like to have this is inner
message also to be shown as part of the
rendering so let me go back here and
press f5 and you can see there is no
difference so I don't see this
particular content at all so that is
completely out of the story even though
I specified that inside the message one
related to at runtime if you see the
output you can see that whole message
that is the inner message has been
replaced with just the template so that
is gone and now I need to have that one
to be brought in and injected inside
another template so that is what we are
going to work with so in order to get
that one to work I would like to
introduce another template so another
direct one another template for so let
me create another directory called
message two and I would like to have
this one to be working with message to
HTML and let me duplicate this file and
I call this one as message 2 and this is
message two and I just would like to
have this one to be modified to message
to template and I would like to have a
bit more like and following is inner
content and I am going to say something
like do as mentioned in my presentation
all I had to do is just transclude
that's it so whenever you specify this
and whenever you specify this message to
in our JavaScript to be actually having
to include equals true this is important
as mentioned in my presentation so you
need to specifically include equal to
true which essentially tries to get the
content from our message too so this is
the content so this whole content is
going to be actually injected right
inside this one so let us see if
everything is working fine so I'll just
press f5 and now you can see I have the
third one that is nothing but our new
directive which is having the message
from the template and on top of that it
is also including the message or the
content from some other template so this
is exactly what is called as a
transclusion so if you go in here and if
you select this guy you are going to see
the do message two which is nothing but
our main markup so if you switch back
you can say do message to is our main
markup inside this I am going to see the
template inside this you are going to
see further content so you can see the
do message - I have the du which is a
template inside the template I have ng
transclude which as which actually gets
this is inner message and of course if
you really want to you can still style
it as really something like style equal
to color blue or something so that it
actually really stands out from what it
has really fits from so this is one way
of actually implementing transclusion as
part of your application but there are
several other ways in order to implement
that we are also going to see a couple
of other ways so let us go back to my
angularjs here so let me create another
detector and in this case I would like
to call this one as message three and
even this message three I would like to
have this one to be working with some
other template called message HTML and
transclude true obviously and in this
case I would like to have the
transclusion to be happening using the
link function so this this transclusion
is actually happening through ng-include
so which we already demonstrated sorry
not in the include ng transclude
so in this case we would like to use a
linking function so if you are not
familiar with linking function please
actually go through my previous video on
compile link and so on so you have a
couple of videos on there so that is
pretty much important before you
understand this link function so now I
go to link I can specify my own function
for the link and as you know the link
will be having the scope instance
element instant instance attributes and
controller and the new one this is
important the clients code so there
exists a transclude option available for
the linking function which usually will
be having a function definition at
runtime so you can use this particular
function in order to have the content to
be extracted I or say trans cluded so
this part this whole part can be
extracted and massaged by angular JS
framework just by using transclude
function which has been sent to this one
so you can use any variable here but it
is a tradition that we use transclude so
now we need to inject the transclude
content so for example if I say this
wearable content equal to transclude so
which means I am saying that please get
the extracted content from my main
markup something like this so this whole
part will be actually retrieved by this
function and placed into the variable
called content and now we need to inject
it somewhere so how do I inject it so
that is where I am going to work with
message three dot HTML so let me
actually duplicate this guy and call it
as message three and let me remove one
and two from our editor and I'm slowly
working on my stage three so in this
case as you know I do not really want to
work with ng-include
anymore so I just delete it but instead
I am going to say some identification
for this panel called inner panel you
can specify whatever the panel you would
like to say here
this panel or say this entire template
is actually available right from il
iment so this is a jQuery object which
actually gets hold of this entire one so
I can use the jQuery later what I say
find in order to work with sorry this is
I element so this is the jQuery object I
can say I element dot find and I'm going
to say please find this particular
element within the markup so this is is
nothing but this whole Dom and in this
Dom I am actually finding this element
and I would like to inject as part of
this element so I found this element
using find so once I found it all I have
to say is append my content so this
content is nothing but this particular
variable
so whatever the extracted content we
have as part of this transcloud will be
assigned to this variable and the same
variable related content is being
appended or injected as part of this day
available in that particular markup
template so let us see if this is
working fine and of course I am working
with message three so let me modify my
markup with message three related stuff
so I am going to say message three
instance one and I need to apply message
three for this guy and I go back and
just say F file and now you can see it
is still working here and if you
actually go with this you have to see in
our panel right here that is the inner
panel which we have specified as part of
the template and inside the template we
are trying to inject it so that is
another way and there is one more way
not just one more way there are several
ways and we actually see in a couple of
ways we have seen transclude that is ng
transclude option using linking function
and of course there is one more way card
using the directive controller itself so
again if you are not familiar with
directive controller you
to watch my compiler and the link
related video so let me create another
director and I'm going to call this one
as message 4 and this is also going to
be a function obviously in order to
create method active and as part of this
one I am going to return template URL I
can specify in this case I would like to
reuse my template so that I can work
with the same template and the same
Deveaux called inner panel so I can just
use the same template here so if not you
can create your own new template but in
this case I think this will be good
enough for me
so I am going to use this transclude
equal to 2 obviously so this is
essential and instead of providing a
linking function I can actually specify
the directive controller right here so
that is going to be another function and
this function can have the defaults like
dollar scope dollar Element dollar
attributes and obviously direct
transclude so just like all these
particular values being passed by
angularjs even here all of these will be
automatically filled by angularjs just
like this transclude being a function
this transclude is also a function so
the same content whatever I have written
earlier will also be working here so now
you can see except that here i am using
dollar transclude variable instead of
transGlobe variable so in this case this
has to work with no issues and you can
see I have to use dollar element but not
eye element here so because that is the
one I am using so that is available so
this is just the variable you don't need
dollars here so this is just another way
of using your transclusion the only
difference is that you are actually
trans cluding it that level of
controller instead of at the level of
linking so this is just another way so
let me create another instance out of
the same message and I call this one as
something like message for and it has to
apply my message for here
so probably just some difference and
probably some difference and probably
some difference here also so just for
our understanding so this should work
fine with no issues or let me play safe
five this one having some problem so let
me refresh this again and now you should
be able to see everything working fine
so I have message to working in its own
way three and even four working in its
own way so these are just various ways
on how we can really have our particular
transclusion to be working but i also
would like to make a note that we can
create our own ng transclude kind of a
function sorry
attribute and in fact whenever I say
attribute a directive so if you go back
to my previous one that is message one
sorry message too you can see ng
transclude is a particular directive
provided by angularjs in order to have
the transclude content to be injected as
part of our existing element called the
previously this ng transclude was not
available we had to write our own ng
transclude kind of a directive on our
own and that is still possible even now
so i would like to take advantage of
this one by creating our own ng
transclude kind of a director and i
would like to call that one as my
transclude
in my case so let me go with another one
so we have the message for let me create
something like a new directive so I
would like to call something like using
my own transcloud director
okay so first of all I would like to
have my own directory to be created that
is message 5 in this case and I would
like to have this one to be a function
obviously and as part of this message
file I would like to return something
like template URL I would like to create
a message file dot HTML and obviously
and to have transclude equal to true ok
so I defined a new director altogether
so there is no controller no linking
function anything else we are going to
just work with only my own directive
called a transclude kind of interactive
so if you do not want this you can just
go without previous one which is out ng
transclude
so i just wanted to show on how this ng
transclude was implemented as part of
angular JS framework by creating our own
directive called my ng transclude
director whatever you call it as so this
is my new directive and it is going to
work with message 5 dot HTML which I
don't think I have it I need to create
that but prior to that I need to create
my own ng transclude director called my
plans closer so this is going to be the
new director which I am going to create
and which is supposed to work as simple
as this ng transclude
so I am going to say ng directive and as
we know we need to create my transclude
so I am going to save my plans load
function so you can say I can just use
dash t here as because I have a capital
letter here now I am going to say a
return just the linking function which
actually will get the scope element
attribute the controller
and class code obviously that's the last
one so this is exactly the same as this
guy so if you if you really want to you
can just use the same thing right here
so it is the same thing as we Australia
and now all I'm going to say is I
element dot append just the content
directly from the plans cloth function
so I can just use plans flowed here so
earlier I used it to have this function
to be executed and put into a variable
now I am just using the same content
here and I just wanted to skip the
variable there so this is my simplest my
transclude directive which can be
applied as simply as ng transclude so
let me have message two I just wanted to
duplicate this and I call this one as
message 5 so in this case the message 5
so let me open this saw okay I would
like to call this one as message file so
this is from message file and this is
the following inner content but instead
of ng transclude I would like to call
this one as my transclude because my
transclude itself says that it is a
directive on its own and it knows that
by linking it has to really transcribe
the content from some of the template
and inject right into the current
template so this is just another way of
doing things and of course I need to
have my particular what is HTML to be
having the latest one so I am going to
call this one as message file because
that is my new directive and I'm going
to call this one as message 5 here and
let me refresh this and if everything
works fine we are supposed to have a
message 5 also to be working here and
the moment you select this and click on
this you are going to see that you are
using my transclude as similar to as ng
transclude so you can say have ng
transclude here in the same fashion you
are using my transcloud so this is
pretty much about the transclusion
however we have not seen on how to pass
data from the parent controller or from
the parent directive or from the parent
to the transclude and how the really
scope works in the plans fluid and so on
so we are going to cover all of those in
the coming up video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
