to actually find the nested functions or
the inner functions to their parent or
to their out of so let us start with an
example first so I have a script and
imagine I have parent function called to
process which is going to have two
arguments to be sent to that and inside
that function I will be having display
son so we said essentially we will be
giving me the sum of a plus B so that is
going to be my function here so I have a
small typo I need to have concatenation
so I have a function display sum which
is essentially nested function of do
classes and now I can execute this
particular function by just calling it
in that way within the parent function
and now this is important after the
entire execution I would like to say do
classes equal to function a
so this is going to be an anonymous
function which is going to accept two
variables a and B and essentially what
it does is it is going to give me the
difference of those two so the point
here what I'm making here is that this
is not a return statement in my previous
video we have seen how to return in
anonymous function but in this case I'm
not returning it but instead I am
getting this particular definition which
is an anonymous function so if within
that anonymous function I have this
particular difference which L which is
supposed to be alerted so this entire
definition I am assigning to to process
so what is due process that is nothing
but this function so I am saying that
whatever you have in this definition so
which means this variable currently
contains this entire definition now what
I am saying from this statement is
forget about what you have but instead
you assign due process directly to this
particular definition so from then
onwards this parent does not hold
anything else except this definition
once the statement is executed so let us
check that so now I am going to say 10
comma 20 so now it goes to this assigns
a comma B so which means 10 comma 20 and
now I am going to get the sum as because
this sum is going to be executed so let
us test that
so some is there and we got it
so there we go so we just have some but
we did not execute this guy but after
the Sun what I did was I am assigning
the definition of this anonymous
function to do Passos so now due process
is going to have this entire function so
let me
reiax acute the same statement and let
us see what's going on so the first
statement is going to be executing this
entire thing so which is essentially
you're going to get some and due process
is going to be replaced with this
definition now this definition is
available inside do passes the next time
you call do process this definition gets
executed as because that is the latest
definition you have as part of this
variable to process which is nothing but
the one you are executing so the first
call will give you the sum but the
second call will actually give you the
difference as because you replace it the
definition of duquan sauce here with the
anonymous function so let us check so
now I have some and now I have
difference so let me add one more
statement 30 and 40 so let me say 40 and
60 so this is going to give me sum this
is going to be giving the difference so
which is nothing but this is getting
executed and I am NOT replacing this
function anymore after this statement so
again the due process which essentially
contains the same definition will be
executed as part of this statement which
means I should see minus 20 after this
minus 10 softer son I am going to see
minus 10 and then I can see minus 20 so
from then onwards any number you execute
it is always going to be I mean any
statement he executes it is always going
to be this function as because that is
the first thing you are replaced as part
of this state
Edmund and again I play this and now
some minus 10 minus 20 and minus 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
