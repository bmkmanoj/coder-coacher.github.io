new concept in JavaScript arrays called
associative arrays so what exactly are
associated arrays in JavaScript so the
first thing is that whenever you declare
any kind of an array in JavaScript all
of the indexes are usually are going to
be numeric indexes so which means or
whenever you assign any kind of element
to a particular location inside the
array by default you are going to use
numeric indexes so which means that
elements are going to be placed in their
respective numeric indexes so whenever
you are working with an array but there
exists a particular beauty with respect
to associative arrays in JavaScript so
before even considering associated
errors here the most important thing you
will have to understand here is that a
JavaScript array can have string based
indexes so earlier in my previous step
we have seen like all these indexes are
really numeric indexes but JavaScript
can have string based indexes so we
don't really need to have 0 based or say
numeric based indexes to be provided we
also have the luxury of having string
based indexes so I can also write EMP
dot employee number equal to 1 0 0 1 so
essentially that means I would like to
place this value in this location being
identified by the name employee number
so the location names or the positions
can be named in the form of strings and
those particular areas which have string
base indexes are nothing but associative
errors
so any kind of an area as long as they
have string based indexes you can
consider them as associate arrays and
how do we parse those particular errors
so each of those particular string based
indexes you provide we can consider them
as peas so keys so similarly we can say
that you know I can always get any kind
of value by using the key using that
particular area so array of key results
in the value for that particular key
so essentially you are storing key value
based values so elements or say objects
so key value pairs you are storing
inside the array so in order to parse
through all of these keys there exists
the construct for within so in is the
one we are going to use here so whenever
you say for key in EMP it essentially
goes through each and every particular
string index here and finally for each
and every iteration it is going to have
those particular keys to be stored
inside this variable so it doesn't
necessarily be a key you can also put a
variable called I or a or P or whatever
so just for our understanding sake I
mentioned it as key so for each and
every iteration each of those particular
keys will be valuable in these variables
and using those particular variables as
keys you can get the value out of it
using EMP dot K so for example I have
employee nimble so that particular
employee number will be used as a key
for the first iteration and the same
employee number will be placed in here
and immediately I have one zero zero one
which will be essentially taken back
into item so I use e MP dot my number
which will be getting item here so let
us have a quick demonstration
so let me create a new file here so I
call this one as zero for for now okay
so I start with script tag here and in
this case I would like to have an empty
area to be declared first and as I am
working with the associative array the
indexes could be string type so in this
case the first index is going to be
employee number and I would like to
place some value kind of one zero zero
one so similarly I can have name so
which would be jag in this case
similarly I can have one more called a
salary equal to say 5400 something so
similarly I can have Department number
as well so I can play something like or
I can provide a string like accounting
so finally in order to display all the
values I can say display empty so which
means I would like to go through each of
those particular indexes get all those
values and finally display inside a
particular do so I would like to have
all of those to be done whenever I click
a button so I would like to have input
type equal to button and the caption is
going to be something like show EMP and
on clicking of that I would like to
execute display EMP and I would like to
have a horizontal rule and after that I
would like to have a deal
and I would like to call this one else
results do for now
and now inside the display EMP
so this is the function which gets
executed at the moment I click on the
button so inside this first of all I
need to get the difference of this
particular table so for that purpose I
will be using the same variable however
with the document dot get element by ID
and I can provide the do here so after
that now I'm going to use the further
with in syntax so I can use key or K or
whatever anything is fine here so I can
say for key in EMP so which means go
through this particular area NP get all
the string based indexes and for each
and every iteration get each of those
particular strings into K and now I can
create a new do for each and every
iteration and I am going to use document
dot create element and inside that I am
going to use do so which means I would
like to create a new development and I
would like to say the content of this
particular div element is going to be
the key whatever I am going to have as
part of the iteration and then the value
of it so in order to get the value all I
have to use is Harry and the key so once
I have the new do created I need to add
that particular T to results do so I say
results do that append chained and now I
can say sorry new do so let us test this
and now you can see I can click on show
EMP and now you are able to see all of
those particular string base indexes and
their respective values which nothing
but we are going to call it as
associative array so any array which is
having string based indexes can be
called as an associate of Ali</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
