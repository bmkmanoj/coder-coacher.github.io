how to nest associative arrays in order
to form collections so first of all a
collection means nothing but an area
which contains other areas as items
which means I can have an area and
inside that array I can have each of the
elements to be arrays themselves so
whenever you have an array and the two
other arrays inside the array we call
them as nested arrays and that to
whenever we have those nested arrays in
the form of associative arrays then we
together can form a particular
connection so this is one sort of an
example here so imagine I'm having three
arrays and currently those are empty but
instead let us consider each of those
arrays are associative arrays and
whenever I actually create another new
array with all of those elements as
Danzer errors so which means each of
these arrays are treated as array
elements inside another new array and
that another new area is being assigned
to EMPs and that is what we'll be
calling the selection so which means a
collection can have a particular array
with itself containing a set of multiple
arrays and each of those arrays are
nothing but the associative arrays so if
we have something of that structure we
can say that we can form a collection
using existing erase whatever being
supported as part of JavaScript so let
us have a quick demo on the collection
itself
so let me add a new example here so I
would like to call this one a zero file
and inside this I would like to say
script and then I would like to have a
couple of areas to be added so in this
case I would like to have an era called
emp1
and again i would like to mention this
one as an associate to area so that is
the reason I would like to have Wow
an Associated heritable declare
something of this sort so which means I
have an Associated array with four of
these properties and each of those
properties having those particular
values so which means this array is
having string based indexes and that is
the reason we call it as associative
array and based on those string based
indexing positions we have the
respective values to be stored on so now
that we have employee one let us have a
couple more so I have EMP to now and
similarly I can have two so just to make
some difference I would like to have
some changes in my data here so instead
I would like to have something like
production and similarly I would like to
create another array and I would like to
call this honors EMP 3 3 3 3 &amp;amp; 4 some
difference I would like to have some
different data here and in this is
something like this and I would like to
have something like sales so let me
clear another area and I call this array
as a mp4 for now and the game for 404
and a different data for this one so I
would like to have something like grain
for now and you know
and I would like to say IT department so
now that we have four employee related
information I would like to have all of
these four arrays to be stored inside
another array and the array name is
called employees so you can see EMPs is
an aries basically and inside this array
i would like to mention that all the
elements inside this new array are going
to be the arrays whatever I already
defined at the top so you can see all of
these arrays I am defining as elements
to this particular collection so which
means this new area becomes a collection
of all of these associative arrays
together forming in another area and now
in order to display this I would like to
write a function called
display employees and let us have some
body here so I would like to have an
input tag and button and the caption of
this button is going to be something
like show twice and aren't like I would
like to call display employees okay so
now that we have that so I would like to
have a horizontal rule just for the
separator and that I would like to have
another do ID and I would like to call
this one as results do so whenever I
click on this button I would like to
visit this function so essentially this
is going to be the same so I would like
to execute this function and this
function is supposed to show all the
employees whatever I have written here
in this day so let me get hold of the
number of elements available in the
collection so I get the number of
employees and then I get hold of this
results do
so have results to hear and I can say
document dot get element by ID and then
I can say results they also in that way
I get access to this for the blood do
whatever I wrote here and then I can
have a furlough which can essentially go
from the 0th position in the collection
of this employees array to and so which
is nothing but the length of their right
here and then I can say I plus plus
which means essentially we are parsing
through or traversing through each and
every particular element available in
these collections which means for every
iteration I'm going through each of
those areas so let us get hold of the
element so in this case from the
employees collection I would like to get
the ith element so imagine I'm having a
value 0 so which means employees of 0 so
whenever I say employer sub 0 which
means nothing but I am getting employee
one so that employee one is going to be
stored in EMP so employee one is
essentially this one so I need to parse
or traverse through all of these
elements and then push all those
elements to results do so for that
purpose I am going to have another low
exclusive these two go through all the
keys available inside that Associated
array which means all of the string
based indexes so all the strings are
going to be stored in the key for each
of those particular elements available
in the array EMP which itself is a
single most element whatever we are
fetching through this loop from the emps
collection so now that we have that let
us create a new document element
like I said you know there enough HTML
because I would like to mention like I
would like to have the both key and the
value so that is the MP so which means I
am going to get the string index name
and the value to be displayed in this
fashion so once I have the new do
already created with the content I need
to add the new do to this result still
so how does also do dot child
and I'm going to add you do directly as
a child so to make some difference so
which means for every employee I would
like to add a brave tag so that you know
it gives us much more better readable
format now I am going to create another
element called PR tag so after that I
would like to have a results to you dot
have been child and I am going to have
the BR tag to be added so this is
essentially going to be the new PR so
now that we have the results do so it
looks like we have completed everything
and that is try exhibiting this for a
second
and the moment I click on this now you
can see all of the hair is are the
employees which are actually stored in
the form of SOC I to erase together in
the form of collection have been
displayed here and this is the break tag
I was mentioning earlier so without
having the break tag you will not see
this space and if you don't see the
space all of these will be actually next
to each other and it will be finding
some hard time actually to differentiate
between each of those elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
