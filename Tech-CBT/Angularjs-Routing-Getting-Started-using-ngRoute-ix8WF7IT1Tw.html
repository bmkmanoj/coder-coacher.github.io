tutorial on angularjs routing while
there are several ways our options to
work with routing we are going to
specifically concentrate on url-based
angular JS routing using ng route which
is available from Google so first of all
we need to understand what exactly is
routing routing is just another way to
fit some content dynamically as part of
your application and in general what
does it do it does three things the
first thing is that you need to specify
your location where it can fit some
content usually this location is
specified in the form of some hash tag
or hash URL once you specify location it
is going to fit some content from that
location and this content usually will
be in the form of a view
I mean angular view which contains some
HTML so this is important from the
location once you fetch the content this
is going to be the new view or new
content so this content needs to be
injected into your existing application
so your existing application will be
already having some hedge tml and just
imagine you got new content from server
or somewhere which needs to be injected
or placed in some of the existing deals
of your existing application and that is
where we'll be calling it as injecting
into your current HTML or Dom so you
have three things and all of these three
things will be made available as part of
routing which means whenever you go to
the route that is to a particular
location you fit some content and after
fetching some content you are going to
inject that content here into your
existing HTML at a particular location
and where is this routing used so this
routing is mainly used whenever you
would like to develop some single page
applications so in simple they call it
as SPS so whenever I call SP a nothing
but you are going to have something like
decent-sized application where you are
going to have header with all the links
and left side panel which
several menu items and the more you
click on those particular items the more
content you are going to load
dynamically in this body so whenever you
are having these kind of huge websites
or very huge enterprise application to
be developed using angularjs there are
quite a few number of chances that you
will be working with routing and
whenever I say mainly used with SPS you
are saying that you are going to divide
your application into several logical
parts nothing but views so each of those
particular logical views will be loaded
the moment you click on those particular
links from your menu items or probably
based on the navigations you might be
really doing as part of your workflows
so all of the content or the views
whatever you are going to load
dynamically are loaded individually and
at the same time independently so one
view might not be really knowing about
the other view what you are going to
load but all of those views will be
loaded dynamically as part of your
workflows or based on your selection
criteria which is going to happen as
part of your web application and this is
pretty important to understand whenever
I call it as routing you should
understand that routing is not only
variable for angularjs it is available
at both server-side and also to the
client-side so whenever I mentioned
server-side it is really
whenever you implement server-side
technologies like asp.net MVC or PHP or
any other platform like node.js or
Express J's so routing can be applied at
the server level or at the client level
but our focus in this video will be at
the client side as because we are going
to work only with angularjs and
obviously angularjs will be sitting at
the client side next how do we implement
routing as what if you'll angularjs and
as previously mentioned routing in
angularjs means you are using
client-side routing so it has got
nothing to do of any kind of
implementations which might be happening
at the server side and there are several
ways to HT
routing in angularjs and two of the
famous ways or mostly user ways are
using ng route directly from Google and
UI router which is just another what is
a famous library which is going to be
used by several developers so we can use
either of these two or you have several
other routing packages or routing
frameworks which can be used directly as
part of your application by downloading
from the respective open source er you
are also our websites but just wanted to
make sure that you really have several
ways to HT routing in angularjs and how
do we work with ng route so this video
really focuses only on NZ route so I do
not want to really concentrate much
anything other than NZ route at the
moment and what are all the steps to
really have NZ route to be implemented
as part of our application the first
thing is that we need to include or
download and refer to the NZ route
module which is usually available
through angular route dot J's and this
angular route urges is a separate
JavaScript file which is made available
from Google API soar Google websites and
that needs to be included and whenever
you are including that it is important
to make sure that it is always after
angularjs so which means you will be
already including angularjs in your HTML
file and this statement that is this
particular script tag needs to be always
be made available after your angular JS
framework which will be loaded in the
previous script next you have to use ng
route as part of your module dependency
so which means you have to include that
in your module specification so in this
case I am specifying that I am going to
have a new module called app however my
module app is going to be depending on
another module called n0 out so that
dependency needs to be made as part of
your application before your before even
you try to use n 0 out and the next
thing is that we
need to configure your routes so
whenever I say configure your routes
especially you are saying that what
location not what URLs what views are
made available and those views really
are supposed to be linked with what
controllers so all of these
specifications of those particular
routes are nothing but configuration and
you can configure all of those routes
using the service provider which is
available as part of NG route module
which you are going to include using
angularjs that is route provider so this
is an angularjs service which will be
made available automatically to your
application the moment you specify ng
route and at the same time you include
your angular route J's so you can see I
am actually using route provider here
and using the route provider you are
specifying the location that is the URL
so at this URL which means if the client
really asks for this URL I am saying
that it has to go to this particular
HTML in order to fetch the content and
and once it fetches that content it has
to link up with a particular controller
called message one so you can specify
whatever the controller you need so this
is a template which needs to work with
this controller and once it actually
renders from both of these templates and
controllers you are going to give the
view out of it and that view will be
made available through ng view so this
is going to be the place where you are
going to inject your content whatever
you are going to receive from this
location
so using this location you fetch the
content and that content is going to be
massaged with all the scope and
everything whatever you mention as part
of your controller and once that HTML is
ready the rendering happens right inside
whatever the HTML element you specify
using ng view and this will be made
available as part of your main
application which specifies the body of
your content and that content is going
to be dynamic based on your route
whatever you are going to specify so you
can have tons of
outs here this could be first message
second message or third message but
every time you go to the respect to
route we are going to fit some content
out of that new route and that content
is always going to be replacing the
existing content whatever you have in
here and that says that you can always
have only one ng-view in your
application you cannot have more than
one and gbo so this ng-view related
element can always hold the dynamic
content which is going to be loaded
through any of the existing routes you
specify as part of your route provider
configuration so let us jump into some
code okay I have a plain HTML here so
this is just nothing but ng-app
and I have some bootstrap and you know I
also have angularjs mentioned here and I
am loading a 0 1j s which is right here
so right now I do not have anything
other than just the module definition
called
app so this is going to be new module
with no dependencies at the moment and
now you are saying that that particular
ng app is made available here and I am
just specifying an app and once I press
f5 you can see I should be able to get
this and of course no routing nothing is
happening at the moment so the first
step to already have your particular
routing is to actually include angular
route jeaious and typically it is going
to be made available with the same
version whatever you have in place so in
this case I am going to say angular out
dot J s so you can specify even min dot
J's or whatever or if you are familiar
with NPM packages you can download in
that way or even Bower or whatever in
this case I just wanted to make it
simple all I'm doing is just after
angularjs I am including angular route
so in that way I can make sure that our
particular angular routing related
information not information the
functionality is made available to our
application so that's the first step and
the second step as I mentioned you
should always have that one to be made
available as a dependency to your module
so in this case I had to specify ng
route as a dependency to
application and next you need to specify
all the routing related configuration
using route provider and that you can
specify using AB config and as part of
this config
I would like to use routing provider so
that is I had to say route provider so
this is the function which is going to
be executed whenever you would like to
have any kind of configuration to be
happening and that is with respect to
route provider in this case so as part
of this the first thing is that
obviously I will be using this variable
that is route provider dot when you go
to this location so in this case I am
going to say message so what I'm
specifying here is that whenever we go
to this location call the first message
and of course this actually this
location accepts an object with all the
configuration necessary so in this case
what I am saying at that whenever the
user goes to this location called the
first message I would like to have a
particular message to be shown to the
user also in this case I can just say
template and load this template so all I
am going to say is strong and you can
specify whatever the hits table you
would like to have so in this case I am
going to say this is first message so
that is the simplest a template I have
in place so this template is going to be
automatically compiled by angularjs and
given with the result which is going to
be pure HTML and gets rendered as part
of the ng view what we are going to
define so in general this location gives
this content so that is the end of it
and once this is configured the next
thing is that we need to go back here
and make sure that we have an NG view
specified here as because this content
whatever we are going to get Dana
Emily needs to be always injected at
some location so in this case I would
like to use a deal with a special
special specification called ng-view
so that is pretty important so if you do
not have that it is not going to work
so this dynamic content whenever you go
to this first message that location
related information that is this content
is going to be injected right here so
let us see if this is working fine so I
go back here and I go in here and press
f5 and of course I did not really go to
that location so in order to go to that
location that is whatever the location I
specify here that is first message I
need to go to that location so how do I
go there so I specify hash and you can
just specify first message so this is
exactly going to be the same route
whatever you are specifying there so
whatever the route you specify here that
has to match whatever you are writing
here so can you you can also use a hash
here doesn't matter whatever you put in
place so the moment you press Enter now
you can see I got the template out of it
so this is as simple as that
so this message this is first message is
actually the template so again let me
remove everything and i refresh this and
let me go to inspect I go to body and
now you can see I have just an app and I
have ngv with no content literally but
the moment I specify hash and go to that
location you can see I got some content
so how did I get this content you can
see it actually went through our ng-view
and inside the ng view you have your
template whatever you have specified as
part of your route configuration and it
has already fetch that information and
injected right here can we have other
routes yes of course
so let me configure another route and in
this case I would like to call this one
a second message
and let me make this on a second message
here and I just Pacific second message
so I go in here let me remove everything
from here so this is my a zero one and
you can see there is no content
available for the ng view at the moment
but the moment I say hash first message
you are going to see only one ng view
with that content of first message and
the moment I say second message now you
should be able to see again you are
working with the same interview but the
content of that ng view has been
replaced with the new message called the
second message the previous message is
gone so the previous content of this ng
view is already gone and you can have
only one ng view as part of your
application and of course this is a very
simplest application for the routing so
let us make it bit more complicated so
which means I would like to have a new
template URL to be specified and have
some controllers to be bound to that
template so I'm going to create a new
file called a message one dot HTML and
as part of this HTML all I am going to
say is I am going to have it do and I am
going to say this is from message one
template and I would like to have some
binding to be happening here so that is
some value of a and some value of B to
be displayed here and similarly I would
like to have another okay let me
complete this message one first so I go
back here and now I would like to have
this first message to be actually
getting the information from this
template called MSG one HTML so in order
to accomplish that you shouldn't use
direct template but instead you can just
use template URL so which means you are
specifying that your template is
available in some other page at this URL
called message one dot HTML so these two
should match so once you specify that
essentially what you are saying is that
this content is actually available in
this message one and that is what you
are specifying here
and this has got some binding to be made
so which means it needs to have some
content dynamically to be deduced from
scope variables and for that I need a
controller so I need to specify the
controller specification also here and
I'm going to say that template needs to
be working with this controller called
message one for which I do not have it
yet so let me create a new controller
and I'm going to call this controller
with the same name as of message one so
I go to app dot controller so I'm just
specifying a new controller called
message 1 and Here I am going to specify
the scope to which I need to work with
and at the same time I will be using the
scope variable as part of this function
and as part of this message 1 I'm using
a and B so it is expecting a and B from
the scope variable so I am going to say
scope a is going to be 10 and scope B is
going to be 20 so again you are loading
this and it is linking with this message
1 that is nothing but the controller and
the controller specifies the scope with
these two members which will be bound to
this one so let us see this is working
fine so I go back here and let me go to
the first thing there you go and now I
go to hash with first message and now
you can see how a and B which have been
automatically retrieved from the scope
and has been bound automatically as well
so instead of always going through this
URL and making it you know clicking on
that one probably we should have some
kind of decent way of doing it so which
means I will be having an anchor tag
here the moment I click on it it has to
go and display this message so for that
purpose I am going to actually have a
simple anchor tag which actually goes to
that route so just to go in that way all
I am going to say just let me give a
break tag here and let me create an
anchor tag
so this anchor tag is going to just say
first so which means that the first
message I would like to display and
whenever I click on this anchor tag it
has to go to this route that is first
message so this is the route
specification I am specifying here so
similarly you can also specify another
so let me put another break here and I
would like to have the second message to
be displayed and I am going to call this
one as second so let me see if it is
working so I go back here plus f5 and
now you can say have first and second so
let me go to network let me clear
everything so I go to refresh you can
see it has retrieved a zero one okay let
me let me clear this one also so I just
wanted to go to a zero one dot HTML so
this is the homepage so once I go in
there you can see I have a zero one with
all the jQuery bootstrap angular routing
and angular everything and a zero one
dot J s so it is important to note that
it did not load our message one dot HTML
yet so if we go back to browser message
one dot HTML is not available so let me
clear everything so the moment I click
on first you can see it has loaded msg
one dot HTML using Ajax
so you can see the type is XH R which
means xmlhttprequest object which is
nothing but n Ajax requests and that
particular Ajax request if you see the
response is this content and it has
retrieved this content dynamically
whenever you go to this location so this
is the location it fits this content and
that content is going to be injected as
part of your ng view whatever you
specified and while it is trying to
inject prior to the injection this
content is actually bound to or
controller or the scope it knows how to
have all the bindings to be made
available it gets compiled translated
and finally gets rendered as part of
your ng view and if you go back to your
body you are going to see your ng view
with the content called a 10 and B 20 so
this is how we have achieved along with
routing along with controller and even
the template URL so let me take this one
to the next level so I go I clear
everything and I click on second so
nothing has been actually retrieved
again I click on first and now you can
see it is not really having any kind of
network requests so again let me do both
of these two so it doesn't do any kind
of requests anymore because once you we
have loaded the template the template
gets cast at the angularjs level so if
that particular template is not
available in the cache then only it is
going to have an H a circus to be made
to fit that content of the template and
that is going to happen if and only if
you are fetching it for the first time
so again I remove this I press central
you can see I have all the what is
requests for those particular files
except M is the one dot HTML so I clear
this I go to second nothing here because
it is not really loading anything from
the external file so no requests here
but the moment I go to first you can see
it has gone through a network request to
load message one dot HTML fine I click
on second no request I click on first no
request anymore so the more you click on
first here you are not going to have the
same request again so let me clear it so
I go to second first second first second
first no request being made because it
has been already cached ok so that is
the simplest way on how we can achieve
the routing that through using a
template a template you are on the
controller so let me make another
criteria here so which means I would
like to specify a route the route means
the default view or default template
what it has to show so I can also
specify something like this is default
message so I go back here I just open
this
and you can see it has shown default
message why because if you go to the
elements you if you open it you are
going to see the NZ view with default
message because you can see it has go it
has gone to the default route that is
slash slash miss route so if you do not
specify any router location then it is
actually nothing but you are going to
the route route so this is the route
route which is going to be the default
and this is going to hit if you are not
specifying any of the existing routes so
what I'm saying is that if no existing
routes really meet your criteria and if
you are at the root level then always
use this template so this is just
another way of doing things and let us
make our what is a our HTML much
interesting so that is I would really
would like to have some kind of SPI
basic template so in order to achieve
that I will be using a couple of
bootstrap classes so that we can have
the header left side panel and the
content on how we are trying to load so
let me clear whatever the stuff I have
in place here so let me remove
everything so the first thing I would
like to have some head or suffer that I
am going to have the deal class equal to
row so which means I would like to have
one row at the top and another row at
the bottom so I'm dividing screen into
two rows and the first row is going to
have just head on so I am going to take
away all the space and I would like to
use Val so which actually gives me some
kind of background that is the default
gray background and I would like to
specify head out so let us see if this
is working so I go in here so let me
remove everything and I specify here so
header is not really displaying properly
here let me go in see and let me go to
another day
let me also specify other things before
you when I fix it so I'm going to have
column a some three and I would like to
use another well here so this is
supposed to be displaying in the same
fashion I don't know why what I'm
missing so let me do it again here so I
use this yeah there you go so I have
something crap going on there so I have
column isn't well well so ended the same
thing column isn't three well and I'm
going to have some links so this is
going to be the left panel so I'm going
to have a couple of Link's here using ul
so Li so I'm going to have three links
essentially for first message second
message and third message so I'm going
to have a so that is the anchor tag
which actually says H ref equals hash
first message and I'm going to say the
caption at first so I'm going to use the
same thing here the same thing here
except that this one actually goes to
second and this one should go to third
and this is second and this is third
these are just the captions so this is
the left side panel so I'm going to have
the right side panel in the bottom so
that is the main content which is going
to be displayed here so in this case I
am going to say call sm9 and I would
like to have another vowel style equals
probably I would like to have both
panels at the bottom to be actually
taking the entire height so I would like
to specify both panels at the bottom
should be taking the entire height and
now this is where I am going to have the
dynamic content which is ng-view okay so
let me go in here press f5 and now you
can see I have the header at the top I
have left panel on the right panel and
the right panel is actually showing the
default message for us way because I am
already
root so if you don't specify the root
here for example I just specify this so
which means there is no root available
so it will be just blank so if you don't
specify anything it will be just blank
but if you would like to have something
there as I mentioned just give even for
the route route as well so for the route
now you can say how default message now
the moment I click on first you can see
I am actually getting the information
from this URL and that new content is
always plays right inside this content
similarly I go to second message do you
have second message I don't have second
message so that is the reason it has
just provided nothing so let me create
another message so I am going to
duplicate this file and I am going to
call this one as message two dot HTML
and I am going to say this is message to
template and I am going to say get me
from C and get me from D so this is
message tool so it works with a
different scope and different controller
in my case so I would like to say a new
route needs to be added so that is going
to be my second message and I am going
to call this one as second message I
would not need this so I go to second
message here and it has to work with
second controller that is message to
controller which I am going to duplicate
and I call this one as message to
controller with variable C and D with
respect to values 30 and 40 so in that
way I have second route which actually
goes through this template and this
controller and see if this is working
fine so I go back here press okay let me
go to the route again so that is to the
home page and I have the default message
and also let me go to the network you
can see I do not have any of my
templates loaded no message one dot HTML
no message two dot HTML so let me clear
everything the moment I click on first
you can see it has loaded this template
message 1 dot HTML which contains a and
B and the moment I click on second
and you can see there is one more
request through the network which
actually is responding with C and D with
message to template and the third
currently there is nothing so there is
no request it is empty and again let me
clear this Network I click on first you
can see there are no more Network
requests because the templates have been
already cast so the more number of times
you use it here the more cash it is
going to be using so it is going to be
the same cache essentially okay so if
you really want to you know clear all
these what I say this white spaces and
so on of course we can really do that as
because that is currently available as
part of well I'm using well from
bootstrap so I can click quickly add a
new style to the well called well and I
can just say please remove bottom margin
send that way it is going to remove this
bottom margin which is essentially
nothing but the part of valve so in that
way you can see I have a simple SPL
looking website where I'm going to have
header left side panel and the right set
content and the right side content is
always going to load using views let me
add bit more that is imagine you are
specifying something like a fourth and
we know that it doesn't have it so which
means we did not specify any route
configuration for the jiwa row and thus
it is showing no view essentially
there's no view to be loaded and the
content is blank so what I would like to
do now is whenever you go to a
particular route which is not configured
as part of your system it has to always
provide some kind of message to the user
saying that you know please click
something from the Left panel or
something and similarly even for the
default so if I am here I do not want
something like default message I would
like to have better message saying that
please click something from the left
side so for this one I can say
click one of the links from the left
panel so this is the default message
what we are going to see once you are
the route route so click one of the
panels so now you can see it actually
jumps all the way and but once you are
at the home you are still going to see
that message but my intention is that if
you are going to specify some route
which is not available in your
configuration it has to give me a better
message here or in simple template which
says that this route is not available or
you are going to some page which is not
available please click on these links so
for that you have other option called
otherwise so otherwise is just another
method in route provider which actually
gets executed if none of these routes
really meet the criteria of what the
client is asking for so which means if
no route matches any of these then it
goes to otherwise so in here I will be
just using the same simple template but
with a different message saying that
something like no content available
click one of the links from the left
panel something like this and let me
refresh this I go to first message so ok
let me hit refresh this complete so that
it loads from the beginning I'm here so
you can see it is here I have first
second and everything is working so let
me go to some route which is not
available and not specified and you can
see it is actually displaying no content
available click one of the links so that
is how you can configure your otherwise
now let us go to the template third
message so if you see I have third
message so if I go in here currently
there is no trout specified for the
third message as well and that's the
reason we are having this message so let
me specify something for the third
message as well okay and now I have this
one as third message and I would like to
have some default template to be
specified for this one just like the
others
so I am going to say this on a third
message so no template to be loaded from
the URL it is just plain message so I go
in here I go to first press refresh and
now I go to second and third and now you
can see I have third message which is
automatically displayed and I would like
to have something different to be done
for this one so which means whenever I
am in the third message I would like to
redirect to something else so which
means imagine you are defining the route
but it has not been implemented or for
some reason you would like to reroute to
an existing route if that is the
criteria you would like to accomplish
then you can specify a redirect to and I
can say something like second message or
something so that says that whenever you
go to this route just go to this route
you are redirecting this route to this
rate to this new location so that is
still possible so I go to first let me
refresh this now I go to third but even
though I clicked on third it actually
goes to the second and again so I go to
first I click on second it still works
I go to first works with no issues the
moment I click on third it again
automatically gets redirected to second
so that is just another way on how you
can redirect from existing routes to new
routes or new routes to existing routes
and you can also have the redirect with
a function so I need to specify the
direct - okay so as part of this
function I can specify like okay based
on certain condition you can really
route to a particular second message or
first message or whatever so in this
case I do not have any conditions but I
would like to say something like alert
sorry
not implemented yet will take you to
first message now so this is just a
plain alert and now I can say
please go to this route called first
message so this is just another way of
accomplishing things weather which means
you can redirect to a particular route
based on some conditions you might be
specifying here so I do not have
conditions at the moment but we are
going to see that later but for now you
can see that once I go to the third
message it is going to display alert and
then it is going to jump back to first
message so let us open here go to the
route route and now I click on third you
can say I have the message sorry not
implemented the moment I click on OK you
can see it has redirected to the first
message whenever we have this first
message imagine I am specifying
case-sensitive criteria like for example
first so now F is capital I press ENTER
now it says no content available because
it did not recognize what is this so the
routes whatever you specify here are
always case sensitive by default but if
you would like to have case
insensitivity to be included then I can
say case insensitive match just for that
route case insensitive match true at the
moment I specify that so let me refresh
this I go to first obviously it should
work and I go with first character as EF
so you can specify whatever your case
you mention here it still works with no
issues so that is just another way of
specifying case insensitivity as part of
your routing configuration in your url
so those are all the minimum things
which we need to really start with a
routing in general so in my upcoming
videos we are going to go much in depth
about how to pass parameters and working
with route service and so on
