router configuration of its States UI
views etc one of the main benefits of
using you a router is that we can take
advantage of multiple views feature we
can have multiple states as part of your
application and each of those states can
have daily UI to be actually rendered in
multiple views if really necessary so
let us see on how we can achieve it so
before even jumping into multiple views
just let us quickly understand what
exactly's UI view so an UI view is
nothing but a simple markup element
which will be available as part of your
application and that markup element will
have an attribute called a UI view so
you can just say this is the container
of all the UI which is supposed to be
rendered as part of the new state to
which you are going to switch to so
which means if you are switching from
one state to another the new state
related UI is what is going to be
injected as part of this particular UI
view next there can be multiple elements
of UI view in the markup so till now in
all of my previous examples or in my
previous videos we have been just
working with one UI view but in fact UI
router allows us to have multiple UI
view elements as part of your
application and that too is necessary
quick note multiple views is not a
feature supported as part of NZ route so
if you are using NZ route or angular
router but not your router make sure
that it doesn't work with multiple views
so UI view and multiple views are
available only through a wire outer ok
every view can be named so which means
just imagine you are having too many
number of UI views as part of your
markup and there is no easy way to
identify each of them so if you would
like to have your particularly you i've
used to be named or identified you have
to provide that particular name as part
of your attribute name and value
specification for the respective UI view
so by providing the names for those UI
views you can easily target or identify
those views
and assign our associate those views
with your states and have your templates
to be actually rendered in the respect
to UI views in the way you really want
it for okay so let us see about the
state and how we can associate multiple
views with this state every state
configuration will have a view section
so till now we have not been working
with the view section at all so we have
been working just with simple state
configuration like URL template URL
controller resolution and so on but a
state can also have a separate view
section if necessary so this is pretty
important if you do not specify any kind
of view section it will be automatically
defaulted to an unnamed view so which
means if you have your UI view specified
as part of your markup with no name
associated with that then that will be
treated as the default view for your
particular state configuration and the
template gets automatically rendered as
part of that UI view which has not been
named at all so whether you write your
code in this way or in this way mean the
same so in this case you are saying
these are all the lists of views I have
in place of course you have only one
view in this case and you are saying
that please display this template and
associate that template with this
controller and get the UI out of it and
get that UI directly inside this name so
that is the UI view name so right now I
did not specify any UI name and that is
the reason it actually tries to figure
out if there exists any UI view which
has got no name in our markup and if it
finds one then this template gets
rendered as part of that UI view okay
every view in view section can have its
own template and controller associated
exclusively for that UI view so this is
pretty important in this case I have
only one view definition but as I
mentioned the view section can have
multiple views to be defined in here and
each of those views can have their own
template or template URLs and their own
control of
so every view can have their own
controllers and templates and of course
those templates will be always displayed
as part of those UI view names whatever
you specify right here a state can show
multiple views so this is what I was
saying from the beginning a state can
have a view section and that view
section can define multiple views so in
this case I am saying that this is the
template which needs to be displayed as
part of the UI view which is named as
EMP header and this is another template
that is EMP list which should get all
the information from the controller and
once it receives the data from the
controller figure out and render the UI
directly into another UI view which is
named as the MP list so which means in
this case I will be having two UI views
with the names EMP header and the
embolus respective as part of my markup
and those templates will be
automatically displayed or rendered into
those UI views with respect to names and
as mentioned defined in view section so
that is very important a state can show
multiple views and of course every
particular view has to be defined as
part of the view section and the next
thing is that every view is associated
to single UI view so this whole part so
which means whatever you configure as
part of this view will be automatically
thrown into only one UI view you cannot
have multiple UI views with the same
name to the specified here it doesn't
make sense multiple states can reuse UI
views so this is one of the most
powerful features that is you can see I
have one state which is configured as
employees and I have another state which
is configured as employee details but if
you see I have two views with the same
name so but those views are not
configured as part of the same state
though those are different in the form
of state so if I switch to this state
that is the employ state I am saying
that please show two views and each of
those views have their respective
content displayed from their own
template and from here I can switch to
another state called employee details
and this is going to show two different
views again replacing everything else
whatever it has shown earlier
and these two views now contain two
different templates or the UI related to
those particular template again in this
case I'm actually using the same
template for the UI view but it doesn't
need to be the same case in all
scenarios so each of those views even
though you are trying to reuse can help
different templates if really necessary
so you need not have the same template
to be associated with the UI vo even in
the other states so let us quickly
demonstrate the multiple views okay so
this is my simple application here where
I have a 0 1 dot HTML which is currently
trying to display this kind of layout
which is very similar to spla out that
is I have a header I have a left panel
and I have a right panel which is
currently having only one UI view and
that particular UI view is currently
going to hold any kind of state related
templates so you can see I have
specified only templates everywhere so
which means I did not specify any UI
view name and as there is no UI view
name all those templates are going to be
directly injected as part of one UI view
whatever we have in place here and you
can see I have a very simple state at
the very top which is called a sample
zero one and this state is currently
trying to render the content available
in MSG one dot HTML which is defined as
a simple do tag with some message and
two values which are supposed to be
bound from a and B and those two values
are directly fetched from the current
scope using the controller name message
one and the same message one is
currently associated with that view or
State so let us quickly test this
application so I just open my chrome
here so I'm going to specify a 0 1 dot
HTML so let's put samples every one and
now you can see I have the values 10 and
20 automatically displayed as because
those are the values which have been
assigned to the scope but our focus is
not real able to control ourselves cope
here but instead about the views so in
this case I did not specify any views
but as I mentioned if you really would
like to specify the views you have the
view section which can be used
for your state so in this case I would
like to define a new state called sample
zero tool and that particular sample
zero two is going to have a new URL in
this case so I'm going to say that
sample state so let me remove this for
clarity so this is going to be a new URL
that is the routing URL so if I go to
this routing URL what should they do so
in this case I am saying that please
show all the views or whatever I
mentioned in here and what are all the
views I would like to show in this case
are just one to one view so I do not
have multiple views here just wanted to
show only one miu so in this case I am
going to say please display my view
content in a UI view which is not named
so in this case we can see I have a UI
view and this UI view doesn't have a
name and as you are not providing a name
also here so if we do not specify a name
it it knows that it has to search for
the UI view related tag or related
element which has got low name so once
it found it then it is going to go
through my configuration which is
similar to whatever we have in place
earlier so I just wanted to take care
about the same kind of configuration
here also so in this case I am going to
specify please display the template
content available in message one and
associate with the same controller so I
am trying to reuse the same existing
state sample 0 1 into a new state called
sample 0 2 however I would like to
specify the views exclusively using the
view section so once I have everything
in place I have to modify my markup in
the main page so that I can include and
go to the sample 0 to page so that a
sample 0 to route in general that's the
state so I go back here click home at
refresh and now if I click sample 0 1 it
works go home if I click sample 0 2 this
also works with no issues so in that way
you can see I can have the views to be
specified in the state so there exists a
views section where you can specify all
the list of views in whatever the way
you want it for example if I would like
to have another view to be defined
just wanted to show something like that
so I would like to have a new view to be
defined as part of the loan applications
in this case I would like to say
something like test so this is a new UI
view so this is nothing more multiple
view I have new UI view named test and I
would like to make use of that as part
of the same state sample too so such is
the case I can do something like test
and again I can specify my own template
so in this case I do not really want to
have a huge template but I just would
like to have an inline template to be
specified something like strong and I
can say something like testing info and
something like strong to be close right
here so I'm saying that I am going to
have Nui view which is going to have
this content and another UI view test
which is specified right here and saying
that this UI view test should have the
template space whereas something like
this so just for our understanding let
me have an HR tag here and let me go
back here let me clear the browser cache
go home refresh it and now if I click on
h2 you can see I have the UI view which
is unnamed is working and at the same
time the UI view with the test is also
working simultaneously along with either
of you so I can have multiple views to
be actually displayed one after another
okay so let us make this one much more
efficient with respect to Ajax calls and
see how we can have multiple views to be
displayed and so on so let us take this
to the next level by actually adding
something like employees so I would like
to have a new links to be added here so
I would like to fit the implies list
right here so I would like to have
employees and I am going to say
employees right here ok and now I would
like to have other views to be displayed
here so for that purpose I would like to
say something like in do and I would
like to specify
classical Touro so in this case I would
like to have another do project actually
works as something like the entire space
so it should be taking the entire space
and similarly I would like to have
another column also which I actually
take the entire space so in this case I
would like to help you with a view UI
view called
EMP header and similarly I would like to
have another view to be specified here
called EMP list so now I have for you I
views 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
I would like to have the content to be
displayed as part of this one so which
means a new state called employees would
actually be displaying the entire
information into employ header and imply
this so let us see how we can achieve
that so now I need to switch to a zero
one dot jf and now I would like to have
a new state to be added and this state I
am going to call as something like
employees and this implies should be
always we are ready
once I am switching to this routing URL
so if I go to this URL it has to switch
to that state so as part of these views
I would like to have EMP header and EMP
list those two are the views I would
like to use them so EMP header and the
in Phyllis so I go back here and I am
going to use something like EMP header
and as part of the EMP header I would
like to simply use another template
exclusively for the EMP header as
something like EMP header dot HTML so
similarly I would like to help the
specification of EMP header so I don't
have MP header that HTML for which I
need to bring in so for that I already
have my EMP headers specified in this
fashion so I just wanted to bring that
file right in here so that is supposed
to be pretty simple so if I open the EMP
header you can see all I have is just
some kind of header tag that is employee
data nothing much special so if I go
back here
and if I actually clear this browser
cache go home the freshness I'm going to
see implies and now you can see I have
employee data automatically displayed
here and of course I do not have the
data for other two because I did not
specify what to be displayed as part of
those two views and in my case you can
see I am NOT specifying this or this as
cut off my implies so thus those are not
at all available to be displayed as part
of my views so similarly I also need to
display something as part of EMP list
where I would like to fit some data from
the database using my web service and I
would like to fit all that information
into my EMP list so for that the first
thing is that I need to configure my
view so I'm going to say to use my UI
view called EMP lit so that is the UI
view I am going to specify and I am
going to say use template URL and as
part of this template URL I am going to
say please use the in finish dot HTML so
I do not have EMP HTML in this case so I
need to bring in that so in order to
bring in that as I mentioned I already
have that somewhere listed down here so
I just wanted to make use of this right
here so that is the easiest way and how
I can quickly get my information so if
we go open EMP list all it has is you
know some kind of panels and everything
so that it might look beautiful and it
has got a separate deal which actually
gets shown if and only if it is actually
trying to load something so if the scope
has got a member called
is loading and if it is the set to true
it is going to display something like
loading and if that member is not
available or if it is set to false then
it is going to display this one so in
fact in here all we are doing is
displaying a table with a header and all
the body with the table row actually
going through all the results using the
ng-repeat and trying to display all the
information of the form of a row site
here so I go back here into is 0-1 ojf
now I have EMP header and the impel list
that's fair correctly but I still need
to work with the controller and the data
service and so on so the first thing is
that I need to specify the controller
that is the MPLS controller and in order
to work with the data service or my web
services I need to have one more
JavaScript which essentially
communicates with my web service and for
that purpose I already wrote data
service I just wanted to make use of
that right in my application so if you
can see my data service you can see it
is trying to reach another URL called
localhost 8080 I and it has got three
methods which actually tries to get the
information of all the employees or a
particular employee or all the employees
by the department so all of these
actually go through localhost 8080 I and
I have my web server is running here
through node so you can see it is
currently listening at localhost 8080 to
my sequel server and gets all the
information in the form of JSON which is
going to be directly receive as part of
the controller so I need to specify and
work with the controller now so before
you when working with the controller as
I include a data service das it has to
be included in my markup as well so in
this case I am going to say include data
service so that is essential so once I
have that I need to specify a new
controller
I just wanted to copy and paste the
syntax here of course I do not need any
of these two and I need this to be
always the same here because I am
working with the controller and this
controller needs to have the data
service to be injected so go in here and
then I specify data service here also
okay so as part of this function the
first thing is that I would like to
specify is loading equals to schools so
which means I'm saying that it is trying
to load something as part of the web
service so I just would like to specify
a member or define a member which can be
used as part of my markup which
soli tries to display some kind of
progress message so this is the member
which is going to be used as part of my
EMP list so you can see that is a member
we are using right here and here okay
now using the data service I'm going to
execute my call for my web service by
actually calling it employee and I am
going to get the result in the form of
variable called result and as part of
this result I am going to simply assign
that result whatever I review from the
web service directly to a member of the
scope called result and the same result
is going to be used right here so I am
just using the same result member right
there so once I have that which means it
has completed working with the data
service the monitor takes the give to
this function so I don't need it this is
loading anymore so I'm going to specify
this one to false so which means this
part is going to be executed once the
server call has been successfully
completed so this is pretty much what I
have in place and see how it gets
executed if everything works well as
part of my application so I go back here
go home refresh this and I have
employees and there you go so I have all
the list of employees directly being
fetched from my sequence of a database
using load application that is my
Express application so I have an
intentional delay here for about a
couple of seconds so that we can
understand like how it is trying to show
progress message so I go back home and
if I click on here you can see it is
showing the progress message so in order
to make sure that that progress is
really working I have an intentional
delay as part of my application so that
is my web service ok
so till now we have seen on how to work
with multiple views here and you can see
even though I have four views and
working with only two views the rest of
the two views are actually stored up but
we do not want to work with those and
those two are automatically gone as
because you can see I am not working or
I am not specifying these two views in
my employ state and
the reason those have empty content okay
so the next thing is that imagine I
would like to have another view called
as EMP detailer so which means I want
that employee detail to be displayed
here the moment I select one of these
rows which means if imagine I click on
this employee ID then it has to remove
this whole grid and show the details of
this employee in a different format
probably no details of that employee
there edgers so which means I have to
switch from this view to another view
exclusively for an employee rather than
the list of employees so for that
purpose I need to create a new view
which actually shows an employee detail
view and I need to modify my list as
well so that it actually displays an
anchor tag here which actually takes to
a different route or the employees
one-zero-zero-one or whatever and that
has to work with the new observers which
actually brings down only the employee
related data and finally gets in as part
of the new view so for that purpose I'm
going to actually add in your view and I
would like to call this one as EMP
detail now you can see I have something
like 1 2 3 4 5 views as part of my same
application ok so now I go back here and
I would like to specify another state
and this state is going to be called as
employee details and I would like to
have a parameter to be specified for the
route so which means if there is no
parameter it actually goes with the list
of employees if you specify a parameter
then it actually comes to the employee
details so this is a new route so as
part of this I still wanted to show the
same header so I do not want this header
to be gone so I still want this header
to be made available for both of the
views so the same header I am going to
use in both of the scenarios but I do
not want this view here but instead in
new view so you do not need employee
lists but instead I am going to work
with the employee detail which is
exactly what I specified right here so
now it has to work with a different
of template and different controller
okay so I do not have employee details
so I am just going to bring that from my
previous example so I just get right
here so if I open that you are going to
see it has got some tons of code but end
of the day it actually displays only the
employee related information in this
fashion that is employee number which is
bound to imply here
so all those employee related
information will be brought in and apart
from that I am also going to have a back
button which actually takes back to
employees you can see this is just a
button which takes back to a new route
called employees and on top of that it
is also displaying is loading so which
means in order to show some kind of
progress while it is communicating with
the server we are just going to displace
loading and for some reason if we are
going to the new route that is employed
detailed route with some wrong employee
number I need to display something like
employee not found or whatever and that
is where this is going to be taken care
so if that employee is not available I
am going to add a new member to my scope
called a she is not found and once the
scope member is set to true we are going
to display this information along with
the button which actually takes back to
employees list so this is as simple as
that so now let us go back here and work
with the employee details controller so
I need to create this so let me copy
this whole thing and I need to rename
this one to employ detail controller of
course like we get rid of this front is
not going to be of much use for me so I
have dollar scope there is always and I
am going to work with parameters here as
because my state actually has employed
members I need to work with state
parameters so for that purpose I am
going to specify state forums which is
covered in one of my previous videos so
I am going to use state parameters here
also and before even jumping further I
also would like to specify II's employee
not found to be set to false by default
so this is the member what I was stuck
about as part of my markup so in this
case you can see I'm using is not found
so that is mainly used if and only if
your specification of employ number in
your routing is actually not found as
part of the database so next the next
thing is that I need to simply fetch the
data using data Sharif and I have
exposed get employee method which
actually takes an employee number as
parameter so frequency get employee
takes employee number as parameter
whereas gate employee does not funny to
provide the employee number and this
employee number is available through
state parameters so I'm going to say
state parameters dot whatever the name
of the parameter you specify there so
I'm going to use the same but I'm going
to right here and then I'm going to
specify which function to be executed
once it has completed its call
successfully with the servers so that is
a function which gets executed once it
has completed fetching from the database
so in this case I need to specify
whether it has received any data or not
for that I am going to check whether
result or data
duct length is greater than 0 or not
which means if it has got at least one
object so if it has got an object then I
am going to get the first object into
employee so this result can have more
than one record of employees I even
though technically speaking in this case
I should not get more than one employee
but my web service returns collection of
records so those collection of records
that it could be one record or multiple
records is always a collection so I need
to go through the first item only in the
collection so I specify that by
specifying beta of 0 which is nothing
but array of 0 or the zeroth element of
the first element of array will be
retrieved and pushed into a member
called employee and this employee is
going to be used throughout my employee
details so that is a member I am going
to use everywhere and this employee
should have all the respect mmm
like employee number names and read
apartment number and so on so now I have
the implies set and imagine if it has
got no objects at all which means no
employees are found then I am going to
specify Donal scope dot is not found set
to true so which means I specifying that
the employees not further so earlier we
started with false and now we are saying
that it is true because no employees
were found and after that as the loading
process has been successfully completed
I had to specify this one to false so
that actually completes my controller
specification and everything else but
however there is one thing which we are
missing that is in the Employee List
this needs to be down to an anchor tag
as mentioned earlier I need to have an
anchor tag here so that once I click on
this it I can actually bring in more
information of that employee only so for
that purpose I will be modifying this
one with a new router that is using an
anchor tag and I'm going to display the
content of the anchor tag as just the ID
that is employ number however the H ref
can be something like this of course you
can also use you is ref so in this case
I just wanted to use H ref here and so I
have this so which means whatever I have
in here I'm just copying and pasting
right here so which means and specifying
go to this new route called employees
slash the employ nimble so that imply
number what is going to be displayed
here will also be part of the URL and
once the user clicks on that it actually
switches to this new state with this
employee number so I save everything go
back here clear all the bottles of cache
go home
refresh this ok now I click on implies
now it is fetching the list of employees
and once then you can see it has turned
everything into an anchor tag which is
supposed to be automatically throw into
a different state by actually specifying
something like this employee / 1 0 0 3
and now you can see I have those
employees automatically displayed right
here and if I click on go back all I'm
just doing is switch to the router
employees nothing much difference there
again if I click on the last record it
actually switches to employee / one zero
zero six and once I am there it actually
displays the information of that
particular employee and again if I click
back it will be switching back to the
previous state called employees and for
some reason if you are specifying like
two zero zero one which is not available
in my list of employees and press ENTER
and it tries to fetch the employee
information from the database and does
it couldn't provide any of that
information at all and it says imply not
found and gives it back but on odd say
gaudium price list and if I click back
it is going to switch back to our
employees list saying that way you can
have multiple states to be configured
and not just the state you can also
configure multiple views for each of
