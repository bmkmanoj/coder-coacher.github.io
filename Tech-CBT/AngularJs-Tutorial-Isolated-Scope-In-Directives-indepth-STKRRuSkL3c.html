discussed about shared scope and
inherited scope available as part of
angularjs now it's time to learn about
isolated scope in angularjs and the two
as part of directives first of all what
exactly is isolated scope let us imagine
I have some markup and a template
associated with the controller called
sample and as you know once we have any
kind of controller set up in a
particular template we are going to have
that one to be automatically creating a
scope on its own and imagine in this
case the parent scope or the controller
scope itself is having two members
called a and B with values 10 and 20
respectively and we can understand like
these two values will be automatically
be rendered here as part of one-way
binding so this is a very typical
scenario and we do not have any kind of
isolated scope 0 so let us imagine I am
actually creating a new directive called
message and you can see I am creating a
message and imagine that message is
being applied to this element do and
there is something new here that is this
cope whenever you specify scope with an
empty object or any kind of object in
general here you are essentially
creating an isolated scope so when I
mention isolated scope it is the scope
which is completely independent of the
controller or parent scope this scope
will have no relation with the preparin
scope so which means these two are
independent of each other and neither of
the two will know about the other so you
can say direct to create their own scope
whenever you specify scope as object
they will be completely separated of
that out of the parent scope and they
can have their own members and there is
no relation and there is no inheritance
which actually comes from the parent
scope at all and modifications to any of
the isolated scope members so if you
happen to modify new members or modify
the existing members available as part
of the isolated scope those will
not have any kind of effect on the
parent scope and even if you modify
anything on the parent it will not apply
anything to the isolator so those two
are independent and none of the
modifications to any of the two will be
having any effect on the other next we
know that we have the parent scope and
we also have the isolated scope which is
mainly available whenever you mention
the directive a scope of an object but
there could be chances or you will be
running into a particular scenario where
you would like to access these two
members of the parent right inside the
isolated scope so you cannot really run
away from the peer risk of most of the
times even though your particular
directive may be completely isolated but
there are chances that you might still
be using or may need to use any of those
particular members available in the
parent scope if such is the case there
should be a way to access or communicate
with outside world other than just
isolated scope so in fact this isolated
scope may need to access any of the
parent scope or probably some other
scope so for that we have various ways
and one of the ways is using the scope
parameters ways even the scope
parameters themselves have various ways
so scope parameters is something like a
concept available to isolated scope
whenever you would like to access or
provide some kind of integration to
outside world from within your isolated
scope which means imagine I would like
to access the parent scope from the
isolated scope you can use scope
parameters
similarly imagine I would like to
execute something or some function in
the parent right from isolated you can
do that similarly imagine I would like
to send some values from the isolators
go back to the parent scope you can
still achieve that so all of that you
can achieve through scope parameters and
you can see I mentioned at the rate
symbol equal to symbol and even
ampersand symbol these three are three
different types of scope parameters
which can be provided whenever you are
defining an isolated scope so let us
check each of them
so scope parameters as scope members
this is very important so I'm going to
come back to a scope members later but
just imagine scope parameters how they
are really different from each other
whenever you are providing it the rate
or equal to RM percent first of all what
do you mean by ampersand here so
ampersand means it is just a string
value whatever you would like to pass
from the parent or outside world to the
isolated scope so whenever you would
like to provide a value I pass a value
from outside world or a parent scope
into the isolated scope it the rate is
the simplest way to do and again I say
one-way so which means it always goes
from the parent or outside into the
isolated but it will not go back and
this particular string whatever you
provide for the at the rate symbol could
also be an interpolated string which
means it could be an angular expression
like something like this kind of an
expression which will be evaluated by
angular JS framework before even sending
that value directly inside isolated
scope so the next one is equal to symbol
so whenever I specify equal to symbol as
part of the scope parameters you are
saying that you are likely to provide an
object but not a string so which means
you will be defining your own JSON
object which will be sent from the
parent back to the isolated scope or say
into the isolated scope and I mentioned
this is two-way binding so which means
whenever you send that object into the
isolated scope it is actually sent in
the form of reference so whenever you
modify the values in that object right
inside the isolated scope those will
also be affected on the parent scope our
outside world so it is a two-way bound
so whenever you use equal to symbol as
part of the scope parameter you are
essentially saying that please get the
values from the outside world into the
isolated scope not only that but
whenever you modify anything inside the
isolated scope those values also need to
be reflected back to the outside world
and the next one is ampersand symbol so
whenever you specify ampersand symbol as
part of your scope parameters you are
essentially saying the
okay I have a function in this scope you
can access that function right inside
this isolator scope so which means
whenever I would like to have this
isolated scope to be executing a
function available in some other scope
then you will be using ampersand symbol
and there is no binding here as because
you are not really working with values
but instead you are working with
function so you can send a function from
here all the way to isolated scope so
that isolated scope can call back that
particular function available somewhere
else and that can be achieved using
ampersand symbol so directive can
execute a function pass to it using
ampersand symbol so these are all the
pretty much standard ways on how you can
really communicate between the parent
scope and the isolated scope not just
those but there is one another way to
really accomplish few of the other tasks
that is using the dollar parent so
whenever you specify dollar parent which
means you are literally accessing this
cove right inside your isolated scope so
you can say like within this isolated
scope I can say scope dot parent dot a
the parent at B which can actually give
the values from the parent scope right
inside your isolated scope while that is
possible technically try to avoid it as
because your particular isolated scope
literally will be depending and very
much tightly integrated with the parent
scope and this might not be able to be
reused elsewhere until and unless the
parent really has those particular
parameters so until analyst there is no
way you can really do something using
parameters probably you can go with
dollar parent so this is just available
as a very last convenient method but
right let us try it ourselves
keeping away from using dollar parent
okay let us jump into a couple examples
so that we can really understand how
this isolated scope can be programmed
and how to use all the scope base
parameters so I have a simple JavaScript
file here which essentially says that
I have a controller called sample and it
has got four members a B and P and Q so
we have 10 and 20 for a and B and 11 and
12 for P and Q and I'm trying to have
all of these members just to be
displayed directly as part of the
mark-up so here I'm going to say
controller a equal to value a similarly
B P and Q so how all the values
displayed here and let me do this so I
would like to have a new director to be
created here so instead of creating it
first let us make sure that this is
working so I just wanted to place a 5
here so let me open even my developer
tools so you can see I have all the
values a B P and Q displayed and now I
would like to have a new director to be
created so in that case I would like to
say something like info message is going
to be my template for the directive and
in this case I would like to have a new
do with values a and even B to be
displayed so all I am trying to
accomplish here is that I would like to
have a and B values to be displayed
right from the directive itself so I
need to define a directive here so that
it actually points to that template so I
am going to say directive message and in
this case I would like to have a new
function to be defined so inside this
function I am just returning my template
so the template URL is going to be
whatever the template I have created
which is info message dot so info
message dot HTM is my template so I just
would like to have this one to be
displayed and as I mentioned if you
would like to work with the shared scope
you don't need to provide any scope
attribute here or you can just provide
scope equal to files so imagine I am not
really doing any of this and I just
press f5 here and of course I need to
actually add that particular directive
right into the mark-up so
that is forgotten so let me have an HR
here and let me give something like
detective one instance one and do with
message is my detective and I would like
to have that detector to be displayed
nothing much special here so all I'm
doing is I'm using this detective right
inside my template and just would like
to have that particular markup to
actually display this template which can
bring these two values from either its
own scope or from the parent scope if if
available
so press f5 and now you can see I have
10 and 20 which are currently being
retrieved from the parent s because
currently it is working with shared
scope and it is working with shared
scope as because I did not specify
anything with respect to the scope
attribute but the moment I specify scope
with an object as presented earlier I am
saying that I really want to have a
complete independent scope for this
directive which has got no connection or
no relation with the parent so the
moment I say that and press fi here now
you can see I have a and B completely
out of sync because this has got its own
scope so let me go here and try to
access this guy and get the scoreboard
of it so once I open the scope you can
see I have ID as 3 so which means this
is not going to be the same ID as for
this controller so let me open the
controller here and if I open the
controller related scope you can see I
have ideas too and it has got a B P and
Q so all the four members for the parent
scope but the moment I have gone through
the directive scope you are not going to
see the same ID and also the ID is
different and at the same time you do
not have access to a B and C and if you
see the prototype also you are not going
to see any kind of inheritance from the
parent as you must have seen in
inherited scope in my previous video so
this is not even inherited this is not
shared and this is completely
independent on its own
but as I mentioned I would like to have
some values to be actually sent from
some other where they say controller or
parent scope or some other world to my
particular directive so if such is the
case I need to say that my scope
whatever is available here should be
expecting a couple of parameters from
somewhere else so I am going to say okay
expect a value for a and expect a value
for B in the form of strings why I am
using a and B because I am using the
same variables here a and B so the most
important thing is that whenever you
define in this fashion you are saying
that please create two members called a
and B inside the isolated scope so our
particular scope for this directive is
going to help two members a and B
however the values of those two members
are actually coming from some external
parameters that is in this case at the
red symbol so whenever it is external it
knows that based on the respect to
symbol you use here it has to fetch the
values based on the definition of that
particular symbol so if you specify at
the rate you are saying that please give
me the string if you specify equal to it
works with objects if you specify
ampersand it works with functions so let
us start one by one so let us start with
ampersand which is quite sorry
at the rate symbol which is quite simple
it just needs strings so let me go back
here and inside this mark up I'm going
to say like I'm providing values a as
something like hi and I'm saying B equal
to something like Jack so I'm saying hi
jack
so the value hi will be actually sent to
this a so which means that value hi will
be assigned to this member variable here
directly
and similarly we are going to see jag to
be actually assigned to this number
variable B and these two are members
inside the isolated scope and that scope
related members are not at all
accessible anywhere else so this a and B
has got no relation with this a and B at
all and you are using this a and B right
inside your template so that is
important so if your template says x and
y here you are essentially saying that
please use x and y from the current
scope so which means i have to say i am
specifying x and i am specifying y here
that actually says that you would like
to use x and y here so this directive
expects two values x and y is parameters
and those two values will be assigned
automatically to those two members of
the isolated scope which will be
automatically rendered as part of your
template whatever you have defined so
let me press fi and you should be able
to see x and y with values H sorry hi
and Jack so if now I go to this cope and
try to access the scope object of that
particular current one you can see the
ID is still three but you have two new
members called x and y which have the
value is high and jag so those two are
the two different values you have in
place okay so let us take this one
further a bit so that is I would like to
have something like a new markup so let
us go with the instance two in this case
so as part of the second instance I am I
really want to have X value but not in
the form of plain constant drinks
strings but instead I would like to have
the values to be actually retrieved from
the parent scope so that is you can see
P is what you are trying to access here
so you are trying to display the
from the parent scope right inside here
the same value needs to be sent as
parameter to X so which means the scope
related member variable X is going to
have the value of P and similarly Q so
you can interpolate it that's what I'm
saying so if you're not familiar with
interpolation or parsing or evaluation
as part of angular JS please refer to my
previous videos so you can say I'm
specifying please get the value of P
from the parent scope is send that to X
so that indeed will actually go to this
X and similarly this Q will be going to
Y to Y and finally to this Y so let us
see if I have the same values of P and Q
to x and y respectively as part of my
application and now you can see the
second directive is having two different
values 11 12 which are essentially
nothing but P and Q from the parent so
you can specify any constant values or
you can my director can also access the
values from the parent or from any other
outside world just by sending in some
values just like the way you are really
doing some kind of data binding so again
this is one way because at the rate
symbol in angularjs as part of this Co
parameter is always one way binding so
which means directive tries to get the
values from outside world but it cannot
send the values outside of the director
to something somewhere okay so it is not
just only this you can also have some
kind of interpolation to be done so it
doesn't mean just only P but instead you
can provide some angular expression here
something like P start N and similarly I
can also say Q start n so that is also
valid so let's say this and I go back
here and press f5 and now you should be
able to see like x and y are actually
getting the values from P and Q by
multiplying the values by 10 so 11 into
10 becomes 110 and 22 into 10 becomes
220 so you achieve that using string
interpolation interpolation which is
going to be evaluate
whenever that particular value is
supposed to be passed to the scope
member of the isolator scope
okay the next thing is that imagine I
would like to have different parameter
names to be provided however those are
still assigned to same X &amp;amp; Y in our
isolator scope so that can be achieved
actually by modifying our directive so
let's not really worried about this
directive I am going to create another
director here and I would like to call
this one as message two and still it
goes with template URL in for HTML so
which means I still wanted to use same
X&amp;amp;Y being actually displaying the values
of x and y respectively however I am
saying that this particular X will be
getting a value from something different
that is in this case let us consider I
am specifying m and I am specifying n so
this is still violate so what I am
saying here is that I am expecting the
value of x and y from the mark-up with m
and n attributes respectively so now I
can go back to my markup so let me say
something like another blank tag there
and in this case I can specify something
like m and n so now the scope members
are different from whatever the
attributes you are specifying here so
you can also provide something like 8
which needs to be retrieved from our
parent so in this case I'm using this a
and this B to be sent as M and n however
those M and n will be assigned to x and
y respectively which will be displayed
as part of x and y in the template so if
you do not specify any M or n here which
means anything other than 8 the rate is
not available here the scope will be
expecting exactly the same as the member
names like x and y but if you provide
something other than whatever you have
in place x and y like m and a an outtie
a and B or D F
or whatever those attributes are what
going to be considered in order to have
the values to be passed to respective
scope members so let us see if this is
working and now you can see ok I'm
missing something I do not have x and y
values here so let us go back and see
what's going on so I'm using message two
so yes I actually missed this message
two right here
so this is directed to actually and this
is instance one so that was the typo and
let me press f5 and now you should be
able to see x and y are having values
from the parent a and B even though you
are specifying M and the N in between
okay so that is pretty much about how
you can pass at the rate variables at
the rate based scope parameters what I
mean to say is now imagine I would like
to have the same isolated scope to be
accessible from the directive related
controller so you can still achieve that
so right now I do not have that so let
me create a new controller as part of
the directive itself so in this case I
would like to say something like
controller function and this particular
function can have three parameters the
first one is always going to be scope
second one is element and attributes so
this is the directive related controller
so now I am trying to access the scope
so whenever you are trying to access the
scope here it is nothing but the local
scope so when I say local scope it is
nothing but the isolated scope in this
case so you are essentially accessing
this scope right inside this and you can
still add members as many as possible
like something like I can say scope dot
Z equal to 40 even this is valid so you
can add as many in them as many members
as possible and modify the scope object
right here so the scope whatever you
have in place is already accessible here
and still you can modify that so now I
am going to add a new
something like due process and I just
would like to have that one as a
function and I would like to have some
result to be calculated here where I
would like to have the scope that X to
be converted to integer and again scope
dot Y to be also converted to integer
and finally just alert the sum itself so
I would like to have something like this
so I'm accessing X&amp;amp;Y of the current
scope and I would like to have those two
to be added and put placed in R and
finally display the value of sum I need
to access this one somewhere this due
process is a function which needs to be
executed from some levels so in this
case I would like to have that one to be
made available as part of my template so
this button I would like to call
something like show and upon clicking
that I would like to execute due process
so I go back here press f5 and we are
going to see all the what is say buttons
for each of those directives so in this
case it doesn't make sense and you can
see it is giving some not a number
because we are trying to convert that
one to integer so in this case highjack
is not a number so it is not going to
calculate anything there but in this
case it should give me some value as 33
and 330 and this is not going to work
because this is a different directive
which has got no definition of the due
process so you can see this one doesn't
have the controller so I can still have
the same controller in this one as well
which is trying to access X&amp;amp;Y
respectively and tries to display the
sum so I can still work with that one in
the same way as the other so in that way
we can still access the scope related I
mean isolated scope related members as
part of your controller that two in your
directive controller okay so now that we
are done with at the rate symbol now is
the time to work with equal to symbol so
let me remove everything I have in place
so I do not want to use at the rate
symbols anymore so I just wanted to
of everything whatever our place so let
me comment this whole thing and I would
like to comment this whole thing toe and
also I would like to comment this guy
and let me comment this whole thing as
well so how I'm going to have new markup
new controller and new template so let
me start with the controller so in this
case I would like to have a new scope
object we created sorry
the new scope member called EMP which is
going to be an object so in this case I
would like to have employee number to be
specified as something like 1 0 0 1 and
employ name to be something like jack so
this is just an object assigned to the
scope number and the object has got two
properties the employee number and
employee name which are assigned with
1001 and Jack respectively and imagine I
would like to access that as part of my
template and I mean the directive base
template so I have to modify my template
so in this case I would like to have
employee name is going to be something
different so as part of that I actually
wanted to have a new director to be
created so let me create a directive
right here so as part of this directive
I would like to say something like AB
dot directive and I am going to say
message and as part of this one I am
going to serve I turn my template
and for message dot html' so this is my
template here and I would like to
specify the scope so this is my isolator
scope and Here I am saying that I am
expecting a member called employee to be
actually provided in the form of an
object so earlier we were using at the
red symbol which is just a string from
the markup so in this case this is not
going to be string from external world
it is going to be an object which needs
to be sent into the directive and this
is two-way which means if you happen to
modify anything inside your local scope
here that will also affect the outer
scope so that is what I am going to
modify here and now we need to go back
to a zero one dot HTML and I am going to
say first of all control or employee
number equals the name of the object so
that is EMP dot a employee number and
I'm going to say employee name equals
that is a MP dot name so let us not
create the detective instances yet and
let us ensure that everything is working
fine so just press fi so you can say got
one zero one and Jack so I am NOT
working with the directives yet so let
me have the directive instances to be
created right here so I'm going to say
directive one instance one and I am
going to say do and as part of this I am
going to say the name of the director
what I am going to use is message so
that is the director I am going to use
and it is expecting employee so I need
that right here so I am going to say it
is exciting an employee member and that
is going to be an object and that
particular object right now from the
parent is available in the form of EMP
so the same object I am going to send to
my particular parameter so which means
the parent has EMP the same EMP is going
to be assigned to this attribute and in
turn that gets assigned to this object
employee and the same employee I need to
use it in my info message so in this
case I am going to say employee dot my
number and at the same time I am going
to say employee name equals employee dot
compliant name so pretty important is
that you are trying to access the object
available in the current scope that is
the isolated scope so this is what you
are referring in your template and this
isolated scope is going to receive the
object from some other external world
and in that case in this case we have
the parent which is actually having the
object in the form of EMP which is going
to be sent to this employee so let us
see if everything is working fine I go
in here and now you can see the director
has got an object called one zero zero
one and an employee name itself so if
necessary I can just go in here I open
this and let us see what it has in the
scope you can see scope ID 3 and it has
got an employee's an object and it has
got two members employee number and
employ name which are nothing but the
ones which have been assigned to this
guy so in that way now our particular
directive is capable of displaying any
object as long as they have those have
employee number and employee name so in
this case I have only employee one so
imagine if I am creating something like
employ two so I can say employ two as
one zero zero two and this is going to
be something like Scot so I can still
have this employed to to be displayed by
some other directive so I'm going to say
instance two is supposed to have
employed two so you can see the same
directive is being consumed but with a
different object but the same different
object is still adhere to the same
structure as of the previous one so I go
back here and press f5 and now you
should be able to see one zero zero two
with Scott and the players who are still
working with drag so that is another way
of actually sending the equals and you
can still work with just like you are
renaming your what is the scope
parameters you can still rename in the
same fashion here also so let us
consider I would like to rename my
parameters so in this case I would like
to have message too but this one imagine
it is supposed to be retrieving from OMP
something like that so the markup should
have an attribute called OMP and it
should have an object that object is
going to be sent to employee so let me
go back to mark up here and inside the
mark up I am going to say ok this is
going to be new directive so let me have
a new PR tag here and another BR tag
here and ok I need to have this one to
be closed and this is going to be
another detective and this is instance
one of director two however I am going
to use message to Asma directive and at
the same time I need to specify OMP so
in this case I can just use the
convention of angularjs like Oh - EMP so
- e can be automatically considered as
uppercase e as part of this one so let
me see if everything is still working
fine and now you can see even though I
specified with a different attribute you
are still having the same thing so let
us say I am directly specifying just Oh
EMP without any hyphens or dashes so let
me read through this you can see it is
not working at the moment because the
convention is that it really needs to
have - so whenever you are having it so
that is essential okay so in that way I
have the equal to symbol working with
objects and that too in the two-way
binding of course we did not see the
two-way binding so let us see even the
two-way binding as well so now in my
controller I would like to have employee
name to be actually modified using the
input so okay let me remove everything
here so which means I would like to have
a two-way binding to
employee name so in this case I'm going
to say employee name needs to be
modified by the user if at all possible
using a text box so I'm saying that
employee name is going to be bound to
this text box so if I modify this it has
to modify wherever this EMP is currently
available so let me see if that to be
binding is really doing the way it is
supposed to so let me press f5 and now
you can see I have one zero zero one jag
one zero zero one jag and I have a jag
here so the moment I modify here you can
see the value is automatically being
modified to other places because it is
having a watcher to be created on this
one and for every modification you can
see the digest cycle really kicks in and
it updates all of the respective
variables including the isolated scopes
so this is just another way and let us
consider I am trying to modify that
right inside my directive so I go back
here and I would like to have the same
thing the input tag bound to employee
dot II name so this is inside the
directive so let me go back and press f5
and now you should be able to see the
text box here but let me give in a break
so that it actually comes to the next
line so now you can see I have jag here
and imagine I'm modifying here which
also modifies the parent s because it is
two-way bound so the parent will also be
modified as because you are working with
the objects and similarly if I modify
here it works from the parent to the
directive and this is from the directive
to the parent so you have to be binding
to be accomplished using equal to symbol
and the scope parameters of a custom
directive using the isolated scope okay
so till now we have seen on how we can
accomplish certain communication to
behave
between the isolator scope and the
parent scope there is one last thing
which we need to cover that is ampersand
symbol so let me clear everything so let
me okay so this could be a bit different
so let me clear everything here and let
me remove all the detectives and
probably everything from here except the
end B so I just wanted to have a and B
to be made available here and even in
here I do not want anything other than
just a and B so I would like to have a
and B to be just there and the respect
to things to be removed okay yes okay so
let us ensure everything is working fine
so just specify and now you can say I
have plane controller a and 10 I sorry a
and B values and no directives present
okay now I would like to have the
ampersand symbol to be working as part
of our scope parameters in isolator
scope so but we still need to have what
I say the directives to be specified so
in this case I would like to have
something like P and Q to be defined as
part of my template so inside my
template I would like to say something
like do P equals P and Q equals Q
and let me put a breakpoint sorry not a
big point it is big tag so let's move
with a big break tag there and the next
thing is that I would like to have the
sum to be calculated inside the parent
controller so the parent controller is
going to have the logic of calculation
of sum so I am going to say scope dot do
some equals function X comma Y you can
destroyed any values there I mean any
variables there and like to have some to
be calculated by actually parsing let me
put a variable parts end of X plus our
end of Y so I have the sum to be
calculated which needs to be displayed
right here
okay so I have alerts which are
displaying I mean I have alert which is
displaying the sum of x and y so
currently this x and y are not really
having value so you are going to provide
the values for this one whenever you
call the function do some okay so right
now I am not calling it yet so let me
call that directly from the controller
and check if it is functioning so we are
not having anything to be working on
this one yet so this is nothing so I can
just comment this one for now so in the
controller I would like to have
something like the button and I would
like to have some to be calculated and I
would like to execute my do some with a
and B coming from the scope so this a
and B whatever you are whatever we have
in place there so those two values will
be automatically retrieved and pass to
do some here and we are going to have
the sum to be calculated still I do not
have any directives no isolated scope
nothing so just press f5 here at the
moment I click on some yes we do have
the sum okay let me put a click here
okay so now let us work with the
director so I go back here I just would
like to define a new detective message
function so as part of this function I
would like to have the template a URL to
be my info message that is information
HTML and now I need to specify the
isolated scope so in this case I would
like to define the isolated scope with
empty however my intention is I would
like to execute this function from my
isolated scope so this directive has got
no connection with this one and at the
same time still this isolated scope
which is completely independent of the
parent needs to access this dusim so it
doesn't matter how it finds do some but
what I'm going to say here is that it
needs some external some function to be
provided that's it it just needs the
definition of the function to be
provided and that definition is going to
be assigned to a new function name
called ext some inside this isolated
scope so just like do some and
specifying a method or a function called
ext some inside the isolated scope and I
am expecting this function to be
supplied from some external source and
as you are working with functions you
have to specify ampersand so if you
specify equals it is object if you
specify at the rate symbol it is string
or interpolated string but if you are
specifying functions or if you are
sending the definition of the functions
it is going to be the ampersand symbol
where it will be accepting any function
definition which will be assigned to
this member called ext sum okay so now
that I have the definition to be signed
this one doesn't have any values so
imagine I would like to have some values
to be provided as part of this info
message so I'm going to say something
like P and Q to be actually provided in
the form of what is a input so that is
text boxes equals P and similarly Q
value also to be provided in the form of
text box so this is important to
understand like this P and Q are inside
the isolated scope we are not getting
these values from anywhere else so those
are inside the isolated scope and
accessible and modified inside the
isolated scope these are not dependent
on any other external sources so now
that I have those two values all I am
going to say is please execute using a
pattern so I'm going to say please
execute the sum button and whenever I
would like to have the sum button to be
executed I need to specify some ng-click
okay so this is important so as part of
this how do I do and what do I do
so let us not really do any ng click at
the moment so this is dummy sum button
at the moment which does not do anything
let's just wanted to make sure we have
everything in place and everything is
working and of course I still need to
have my directive instance to be
actually created here so I'm going to
say an HR here and I am going to say
directive one instance one and it do and
inside the do I just would like to have
my directive message that's all for now
and of course this is expecting ext sum
so which is nothing but the function so
I am going to say exe - sum because s is
the capital one here and would like to
have a
preceding value of - here so let me
bring this on the first one okay
ext Sam is actually going to have the
definition of do some that's it so what
I'm specifying here is that ext Sam is a
attribute is an attribute which will be
corresponding to the definition of a do
some of the parent so the parent is
already having the definition this one
so you are just sending this whole
function you are not executing the
function you are sending this definition
of this function this whole function
will be sent to ext some and in turn
that gets assigned to this ext son so
which means you are saying that this
whole part is being assigned right here
so you're not executing it you are just
getting this whole function on getting
assigned to this member called ext son
which can be executed later on as part
of the same detective so that is how you
are sending it and now let us see how to
execute it so in order to execute it
obviously we need we already have the
ext sum which can be executed right
using our button so I'm going to say
what is the name of the function here
ext sum so this is the one which has the
definition of the function so go in here
and I would like to have the ext sum
function to be executed so now you can
say you are calling the function by
providing two values of P and Q so I can
just specify why I would like to have P
and Q to be called I mean sent as
parameters to that particular function
so you have local P and local Q
available as part of isolated scope
which will be provided by the user in
the form of text boxes and they will be
assigned to P and the Q member variables
of the local scope and those two values
are going to be sent to ext sum which is
nothing but this one and this is nothing
but this do sum and this do some
is nothing bad this do some so this
function is going to receive P and Q
here which in turn executes this whole
part so let us make sure that all of the
things are saved and let us see if this
is working fine I go in here and now you
can see I do not have any values so let
me try to provide some value 5 &amp;amp; 6 so
let us see what we have in here as part
of the scope itself so let us open the
scope now you can see I have ID is 3 and
you have P values 5 and Q value is 6 you
can also see ext sum which has got the
definition of the function so that is
going to be executed at the moment you
click on some so let me clear everything
I'll click on sum and you are going to
see some value 11 being displayed and
you can still modify this and you will
be able to get some value to be
displayed so you are able to execute a
function external to the isolated scope
and available somewhere else by just
sending that whole function definition
as a parameter to your isolated scope
member so that is how you can use
ampersand symbol and there are a couple
of these on trying to achieve the same
and most of the time you will be seeing
different kinds of syntaxes whenever you
are trying to execute this so one of the
frequently used syntax is sending the
parameters in the form of an object
would not like this way but in the form
of an object so let us see that example
as well and in this case I would like to
say do some so let me comment this guy
I'll probably let me put directive one
instance two so that we know that we are
working on instance two so we are still
going to have EXT some you are going to
send those some but here some kind of
understanding like it has two parameters
m and n you can just provide something
like that so which will be very much
similar to x and y you can also use x
and y I just wanted to differentiate
that these two doesn't need to be the
same as these two but the ordering is
important so when you are trying to
execute that as part of your info HTML
I need to comment this why because I am
going to change the definition of info
so I need to comment there so let me
execute this one in a different way so
now I am going to have a button and I am
going to say some to be executed and of
course I need to provide ng click ok so
instead of calling this way I'm going to
call a ext sum again but in a bit
different way that is by sending an
object so I'm going to send an object
which will have two values and two which
means two properties and I'm going to
say the value of M will be nothing but P
the value of n will be nothing but Q so
which means P and Q are assigned to M
and n respectively and sending this
whole object so this M and n will be
automatically made available to this
function in the same order and the same
m and n will be further sent to x and y
which will be doing the dusim
respectively so this is somewhat very
confusing way I myself report to go this
way but most of the time online you will
be seeing these kind of examples so
which are essentially nothing but you
are be sending the parameters in the
form of a function and that particular
sorry sending parameters in the form of
an object and that particular object is
going to have all the parameters layout
in a particular order and all those
parameters should match the same order
here so it doesn't matter what value you
provide here M or n but the first value
P is going to be assigned to X the first
value Q is going to be assigned to Y so
that is pretty much it so that is a kind
of a syntax whatever one is usually
doing and you can say still I have some
to be working so that is just another
way of accomplishing things and on top
of that I can still have my own what I
say controller related functions also to
be achieved so for example I can have a
controller to be defined as part of this
one
so I can say controller so that is added
activates controller I can say dollar
scope dollar element and I let address
that is attributes so inside this
controller I can still execute this
external some so as you know everything
is accessible through scope so this
scope is local scope that is our
isolated scope which is already having
this member so I'm going to say please
execute this song and just like you did
earlier you know I have M and N which
needs to be sent so I will be sending
the same thing here so I am going to say
this is the object and that particular
object needs to be sending the value of
P from the current scope and the second
parameter is going to be Q from the
current scope and this is a function and
I'm saying that this sorry inside the
controller I had to define a method so
that is I would like to say due process
equal to function so I'm actually going
to add a method which needs to be
executed by some other button so this is
the way on how I would like to
accomplish things so inside the
controller I am going to have a new
function to be added to the scope and
that particular function is going to
execute some other external function by
getting the values from the current
scope and sending them in the same order
as they have been defined in the
attributes so now I go back to an info
message and now I can define another
button so let me comment this guy and
this is also some however in the ng
click I am going to specify just to
process so I saying that please execute
my function currently valuable in the
current scope of this directive so when
I raise a due process this actually goes
to here and this one is going to execute
this external
by getting the values from the current
scope that is P and Q respectively which
will be spots two x and y respectively
so let us see if this is working fine
and okay let me see this is detective
instance two and this should work with
no issues let me go back here and let me
assign it ten and twenty and click on
here and now you can see I still have
thirty so let me make sure that it is
really having the values from the
current one so that is just another way
of having the do some to be executed
that is some external functions to be
executed and you can also modify that
with some other way that is imagine I
would like to have a different
specification of my attributes something
like just some just like my previous
equal symbol or a dredge symbol you can
provide something different here so that
in facts is that I can specify just some
right here instead of ext some so I can
just say j ust which means this just sum
is going to be assigned to this ext so
just like you are renaming the scope
parameter at the time of the markup so
this should still work fine with noise
shells so eight and nine and click sum
and still you are going to have the sum
to be displayed so that is just another
way of doing things and finally as I
mentioned you still have access to the
scope related parent so that is one
thing we need to understand like if I go
back here and if I go to the scope so
let us go to the scope here probably
this guy so let me get access to the
scope so right now you can see it has
got P and Q and even the ext sum and
even the due process but now you can see
it has also got the parent so every time
an isolated scope is created it has a
reference to dollar parent so if you
open dohr word parent you are going to
see dollar ID - which
with a and B and also do some you can
see all these three members are actually
available right here so you have a and B
and some so this parent is currently
accessible directly through dollar
parent so that is also accessible
directly from your isolated scope so now
I can say dollar parent da or dollar
parent dot B right from my scope so in
fact I can say something like the Q
value for example I would like to have
the Q value to be multiplied with scope
dot parent dot a so this is the value
I'm going to send so what I'm saying is
that I would like to have the current
value of Q to be retrieved on the
current scope multiply that value with a
from the parent scope and get that value
and send that value as Y and finally X&amp;amp;Y
need to be summed up so let us see if
this is working so I go in here I'll
specify a file and I specifies six so
six needs to be multiplied with a so
which is 10 so 6 into 10 becomes 60 60
plus 5 the bitch's value of P becomes 65
and you can see I have 65 to be
automatically rightly order so if I have
seven or eight you can see I have 85</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
