objects that is JavaScript objects so
let us drill into an array of objects so
which means essentially we would like to
have an array to be created which can
contain JavaScript objects we already
knew that an array means it can contain
multiple elements so in this case we are
going to have the error elements as
JavaScript objects themselves so first
of all just as I already explained
earlier we can have multiple objects to
be stored in the form of an array or
inside an array so in order to have that
first of all we can declare a particular
array s something like this array EMP
currently it has got no elements so just
making sure that it is an array with no
elements at the moment now you can
assign more and more elements
progressively to the respective
locations so here what I am saying is
the first array element is 0 so which
means the location 0 inside the array
array EMP is going to be a new object
called EMP so which means I might be
already having a constructor function
called EMP which will be accepting two
parameters so I am essentially creating
an instance of that particular
constructor function and the result is
going to be an instance or say object
which is going to have two particular
members or sir values so those two
values are going to be assigned to the
respective object members and the entire
object is going to be stored in the
zeroth location or the first location as
part of array similarly I can have more
other objects to be instantiated and
assigned to the respective locations
called 1 2 3 and we can always access
each of those particular array elements
using a loop so anyone familiar with
array certainly knows that we can use a
loop in order to parse through or
traverse through
each of the elements available in the
array so similarly even here we can use
a for loop which essentially starts with
location 0 and goes through the length
of that particular array and we can use
I plus plus means we are literally going
through from the first location till to
the last location incremented by 1 so
while we are going through each of those
particular error locations we wanted to
have those at respect to error locations
to be accessed by using array of I so
which means if I value 0 and you are
accessing 0 location but in zeroth
location we are actually having EMP
which is not met an instance of an
object so that object might have a
member called employee name which
essentially might have a value called
jack
so we are essentially saying like an
employee of that particular location is
nothing but an object please get that
object and retrieve the value available
in this member together with
concatenation of this particular message
further concatenated with some kind of
value whatever it is going to return by
executing this particular method which
is going to be available in the object
stored at the same location so that EMP
object is not only having employee name
and salary properties but it is also
having a method called get annual salary
which is essentially nothing but it is
going to multiply the value of salary by
12 and that particular salary might be
actually concatenated with the whole
message together and final will be
displayed to the user so in that way we
can access either them fields or
properties of a particular object all
the methods available in an object where
that particular object could be part of
an array so we can essentially have all
of those elements available in the array
to be retrieved using a loop and the
members of those particular objects
stored in the array also to be accessed
in the
same fashion using object dot member
notation so let us quickly have a
demonstration of air F and objects
so let me start with a new thing called
0-8 for now okay so in this case I would
like to start with script so in this
script first of all I would like to have
a constructor function to be declared
something like the name and we said it
so those two are going to be the
constructor parameters and this
particular constructor function is going
to have two properties or safe fields or
members so in this case I am
initializing those two members with the
respective values whatever I am going to
stand as part of the constructor
function and now I would like to have
get annual salary to be declared which
is going to be a function sorry so this
is a function anonymous function so I
just do this in this fashion so get
annual salary is a function and in this
case it is going to retrieve the value
of the salary which is nothing but
whatever the value we have in here to be
multiplied by 12 and return that
particular value back whenever I access
to get annual salary so now that we have
the constructor function in place let us
declare an array so in this case I would
like to declare an array in this fashion
so right now it is empty which means the
error has got no values or say no
elements so whenever I would like to
have a new element in this case I would
like to push the element to the zeroth
location of the array so for that
purpose I can just say I would like to
create a new instance of employee or say
new object based on employee constructor
function and it is expecting two values
right now so in this case I would like
to have two values to be provided in
this fashion so what I mean to say is
this particular value will be assigned
to be named and further be named will be
assigned to a name property so whenever
I say
la EMP 0 dot a name we are going to get
zag and similarly dot salary I am going
to get five thousand four hundred
similarly I would like to add a couple
more and this one is going to be one two
three yes I have three instances so I
would like to have some difference in
values here and something like this and
you can also have something else so once
I have all the array elements and the
air in place now I can access each of
those particular elements directly using
a loop so in this case I would like to
declare I as the loop index oh and it
has to go through the entire array by
just counting that particular length so
we 20 it has to go through each and
every element inside the array so I'm
saying that as long as I is less than
the number of elements available and I
had a MP I am good so I plus plus which
means I would like to each of those
elements and now in order to access a
particular object I can say object oh
the equal to void the MP of I so which
means I am going to get that particular
object directly into the variable war so
which means if I value is 0 I am going
to get array EMP of 0 which is nothing
but this object so that object I am
going to get in oh if I value is 1 I am
going to get this object into object war
so now I can say alert oh sorry I
already have the objects of oh that a
name so essentially anything but I am
getting that particular member or say
that particular value inside the member
the employee name of that particular
object whatever has been retrieved using
the statement so let us see if this is
working fine right now I am just getting
only the employee name
so let me execute this footer and see
how it is working and now you can see
that's the first thing the second one
third one and fourth water so we have
all the values to be displayed so now I
can further concatenate this and say
something like earns annual salary as
they can say Oh get so in this case it
has to give me the employee name along
with the concatenated message together
with the annual salary in this format so
similarly I should have each of those
particular employee details to be shown
to the user
similarly instead of using the Oh to
create a variable I can directly use
array EMP I are all right here instead
of war so that I can get rid of this
statement altogether so this particular
statement is not necessary anymore as
because I am replacing that particular
war with this area directly so now I go
and open this and now you can see we are
getting the same value as expected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
