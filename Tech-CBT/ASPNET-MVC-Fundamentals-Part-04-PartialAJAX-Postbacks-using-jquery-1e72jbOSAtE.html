ajax-based post bags or partial post
bags in asp.net MVC so let us quickly
take a look at my previous solution
which I have covered as part of my
previous video which is a full page post
back so let us take a look at the
example so I open this particular sample
and let me open the developer tools here
and I provided with two values 12 and 23
and click on show and now you can see I
actually got 35 so which means 12 plus
23 whatever the value I might have
provided earlier I am having the sum to
be returned the moment I click on show
so this is how the network traffic looks
like so the whenever I open this let us
take headers first of all you can see
that I am really doing post which is
HTTP POST and you can see the form data
at the very bottom where I am sending
those two values to the server and from
the server you can see the response on
how I am getting so I am getting the
whole document so which means the
response once I click on this show
button whatever I receive the response
from the server is exactly this so which
means the server is going to return you
the entire HTML for your new page so
once you hit show actually you are
receiving a new page all together and
that whole new page is going to look
something like this
and there you are going to see the span
with 35 which is nothing but this
particular 35 so this is what I have
explained earlier about a full page post
by akka in asp.net MVC in my previous
video but now we are going to switch our
gears to partial post bacc or Ajax based
repose back so let me minimize this
solution and let me open another visual
studio here and let me start creating a
new project from the scratch
so in this case again c-sharp a web and
let me give a different name here so I
would like to say a sample - and I click
OK and I would like to select empty
template make sure MVC references are
automatically in place and let me start
with the controller so in this case I
would like to have the MT controller and
I would like to call this on a sample 0
1 controller and by default I already
have the get so which is nothing but the
default view whatever it is going to
retrieve for the action index so right
now I do not have any views so let me
add a view directly from the action
method so I do not want to use any
layout page in this case I just click
add and I have the view right here so in
order to have ajax-based goes back so
which means a partial post back we need
to have jQuery related libraries to be
included as part of your webpage we can
do it in two different ways one is
directly configuring or including the
node packages I would say we can say all
the jQuery packages using your new kit
manager not node sorry it is new get
manager so the easiest way you can
always go to this and manage nougat
packages and then here you can type in
something like jQuery okay so make sure
you are online and let us click on all
and then type in jQuery
and there you go you have all the jQuery
related libraries here you can select
whatever you would like to have and
click install so right now I am NOT
going to follow that myth follow that
method so however you can still use and
go through the same methodology if you
are not familiar with nougat packages I
have another video in the same series or
another series just go through that
video in order to get a complete
understanding of what you get and how to
install NuGet packages globally using
command line using UI and everything so
for now I'm just closing it so I just
wanted to take another quick simple
route that is directly importing
whatever are necessary from the content
dead content delivery network which you
are going to call it that one as CDN CDN
stands for content delivery network so
if you would like to use jQuery version
1.9 or below so which may say one point
eight point nine let us consider so as
long as the jQuery version is less than
one point nine you should be able to
have these particular libraries to be
imported as part of your HTML if you are
using one point nine or above you should
be able to get these particular
libraries the difference is that from
one point nine and above there are
particular scripts for which Microsoft
is actually asking us to include which
are mainly for migrate so which means
there are a couple of things which have
been deprecated in one point nine and
for that purpose we need to have other
jQuery related
libraries to be included as well so if
you are using one point eight point
three or something you're good to go and
even now you can see I have five point
two point two MVC version on my
particular PC or four as part of this
solution so that is the reason I am
going with this version so if you would
like to have more information about the
compatibilities on all the libraries and
their versions and so on the easiest way
to check is go to double w asp.net Ajax
CDN
so the moment you are there it is going
to give you the list of all those
particular libraries which are available
for download or to include as part of
your solution so here you are going to
see how to get the Ajax from CDN using
various ways so you can use in this way
or whatever the ways they have been
suggesting and on top of that it is also
going to give you all the jQuery
versions for which you can include in
your project and on top of jQuery you
also have the jQuery UI based libraries
and the validation libraries mobile
libraries and other necessary libraries
so it is always good to check what
versions are really supporting and what
versions are compatible with the other
libraries so not every library is going
to be compatible with other libraries so
in this case right now I'm using five
point two point two with jQuery two
point one point four so such is the case
I have to go with validation library
version 1.1 three so if any of these
libraries are having a mismatch then
your particular Ajax call may not work
properly or you may get undesirable
results so for now I just wanted to make
things simpler I just wanted to use the
latest and the greatest as of now so
just copy and paste whatever I have in
here into my new solution so as these
are scripts I would like to have them as
part of my head tag so once I have this
the next thing is I need to have a
couple of text boxes the same thing
whatever I have seen here so let me go
in here I would like to use the same
example whatever I used earlier to teach
full full page post back so I would like
to have enter first number two text
boxes and a show button so the moment I
click on show it has to give me the sum
of those two values into a label or span
or whatever so
let me copy some code whatever I have in
here so just copy whatever is available
here and then put it here okay so now I
have one text box called txt first
number another text box called txt
second number and for now I do not want
to use this pan so I would like to have
a new spine to be created and I would
like to have the ID of that spine to be
something like label result so right now
it has got no information so this is my
simplest uy so which means all I have is
two text boxes with names first number
and second number one label and I am
calling that one as lvl result and one
button which essentially does a submit
so as if you execute this and click on
submit at this moment it actually does a
full page post back but that is not our
goal I would like to have an AJAX base
post back or partial post back to the
server so for that purpose you can start
using a JX dot begin form so this is the
first thing we'll have to start with a
JX dot begin form if you have switched
back to my previous solution which is
for full page post back you can see we
are actually using HTML dot begin form
so instead of using HTML dot begin form
now I am actually using a JX dot begin
form so that is the first thing so once
I have this Ajax dot begin form will be
having various parameters to be accepted
so for that purpose I will start
providing each of those one by one so
the first parameter to the begin form of
HX is the action method so in this case
I am going to say that I am going to
have an action method called index which
is attributed with HTTP POST and then
which controller to be I mean that
action is available as part of what
controller so that needs to be provided
so if not provided he takes the default
controller under which this particular
mu is getting rendered so it is not
essential but you know let us be more
specific so we are going to have the
action to be specified and the
controller under which the action is
currently available and then if there
exists any route values so currently we
are not covering route so let us go with
a null so I will cover this option bit
later on top of that I need to provide
Ajax options so what are all the Ajax
options I'm at have so that is the next
thing so I will cover the Ajax options
bit more later so let me give an empty
string I mean empty braces for now and
next I need to provide the form name so
in this case I would like to have the
form ID to be something like a sample
form okay so let me clear some stuff I
don't need this actually so this is the
simplest way I would like to have and on
top of that I can have the brackets to
be opened so let us see one by one so
the first one is action to which our
phone gets posted the next one is the
controller under which the action is
currently available some route values
currently and specifying now and now I
have new Ajax options so which means all
the Ajax options which are necessary in
order to have ajax-based post break or
Ajax basic communication or I shall post
back so whatever you'd like to call it
as so I haven't specified the options
yet but we are going to do that in a
second
and on top of that I am saying that this
particular forum should have an IDs
sample form so let me quickly check if I
have an ID for sample here I did not
provide the form ID but in this case I
am actually providing for my ID which is
not compulsory but I just wanted to go
with that as long as it is available so
once we have Ajax form opened so this is
the form tag opening and this is the
form tag closing you can just think
something like that so this is
the form tag opening and this is the
form that closing something similar to
that so now I need to have all of these
to be brought in to this one so which
means all of this whatever I am going to
do now here any kind of post back will
be automatically happening in the form
of a checks okay so now I need to
provide Ajax options the first thing is
that Ajax means we are actually asking
or we are posting or we are requesting
some information from the server the
server does its own process and returns
some information back and that
information whatever we are going to
receive may or may not be a full page
HTML document so as I mentioned earlier
in this case if I open my previous
example and if I execute this and if I
provide a couple of values here and if I
click show so this is a request to the
server while providing the request I'm
saying that is it it is a post based
method and I am providing some values
the server does its own passes and in
return it is giving me a response which
is a new web page completely so the
response of this request which means the
moment I click on show I am actually
getting a new web page all together but
that is going to be different in our
partial post back so which means we are
not going to get a new or whole new web
page we are going to get only certain
parts of the page are only the
information necessary for us in this
case only the value so which means
whenever I click on this button all I
really need is just the sum of those two
values which could be hundred or two
hundred something like that so if I
provide ten and twenty ten and ten all I
am going to receive is just twenty but
not the full-blown HTM
including body scripta expand i don't
need all of that stuff as because all
that stuff is already in place all I
really need is just a value of 20 here
right here in this place so if I provide
10 in 10 here that particular 20 has to
be sitting here so which means the
server is going to return only one value
in this case it could be HTML it could
be JSON and in this case it is just a
string so if I get that particular value
or the result directly from the server
it has to be placed right in here so I
need to specify in my Ajax options what
document element needs to be refreshed
whenever that particular Ajax operation
has completed so that is what I am going
to call as update target ID so which
means in this case I am going to specify
the update target ID as label result so
the point behind it is once this Ajax
operation completes I am going to get a
result which could be just a value like
20 or 30 or 40 depending on the values
you provide here and that value whenever
I receive it I am saying that please
update this particular tag or element
with that particular value so which
means it tries to find this particular
element in the whole document and the
moment it finds this it actually gets
that particular value out of the Ajax
which is going to be 20 or 30 and places
right here so that is what is about
update target ID so the next thing is
that we are saying insertion mode equal
to insertion mode Daughtery place so we
have a couple of couple more options
here other than replace so I can say
insert after insert before and so on so
which means if I say replace whatever
the value I have in
here will be replaced with whatever the
value I received after the response so
if it is insert after or insert before
it is going to do that before this or
after this so for now I just wanted to
go with the replace and what kind of
HTTP operation you are going to do here
so in this case I am going to say the
operation I am going to do is post so
these are all the Ajax options I have so
now that we have completed our view let
us switch to controller so before even
switching to controller let us have a
complete understanding of view once
again so I am saying that I need to have
Ajax base reports back whenever I click
on this submit and it has to submit
these two values and in return I will be
expecting only one value as response
which needs to be updated or replaced as
the content inside this particular
element which is nothing but this one so
whatever the value it has will be thrown
out and will be replaced with new value
whatever I am going to receive from the
server and all of this operation has to
go with HTTP POST ok so now that we have
all the necessary things in place we
still need to have our index to be made
as part of the controller why because we
are saying that the action index is
available and it is supporting post so
right now in my controller I do not have
any action method which supports post so
I need to add that so I will be adding
something like index method and it is
going to accept two values as because I
am sending txt first number and txt
second number so for that purpose I will
be having two parameters dxd first
number and txt second number so this is
going to be my new action method however
this action method has to support HTTP
POST so I need to have that particular
attribute to be set so once I have that
now I can just calculate the result
I can say result equal to I would like
to pass whatever the value I have in txt
first number class integer that pass
whatever the value I have in txt second
number and once I have the result
calculated I would like to return a
result of two string so this is very
important so I am returning a view here
so an action in this case actually
returns a view but here an action in
this case is returning a string this is
pretty important so if you switch back
to my previous sample on full page post
back if you open the controller you are
going to see my full page post back here
which is also an index I means being
supported by action method index of type
HTTP POST is actually returning a view
this is pretty important so I return a
view in the get request and I also
return a view in the post request
however that is different in this case I
am not returning a view I am just
returning a string however no one is
really stopping you to return a view you
can also return a view you can return a
JSON object here or you can return just
some string you can return anything here
but keep in mind whatever you return
from here is always going to be injected
right in here so if you return a view
that whole hits tml will be returned and
replaced here if you return JSON object
that entire JSON object will be placed
here so if your return string that will
be here so that is important to
understand so okay so I have a typo here
so let me clear that one too and there
is one more thing as I mentioned in my
previous video txt first and txt second
has to match with these two otherwise
this those two will not be mapped again
as the parameters so let me build this
and let me execute this
so let me open my developer tools and
let me type in some values like 507 and
click show you can see I got the sum
which is nothing but 12 which is fine so
let us clearly observe our requests on
how it has sent to the server and what
the server has responded so if I click
on the request you can see the response
is just the value however if you switch
back to my previous full page post back
example the response for that particular
request is full-blown HTML so in here I
am not actually refreshing this whole
page all I'm doing is I'm just getting
12 and the dart wall gets injected into
that particular span tag so I am not
really getting whole new web page all I
am receiving is just 12 and that
particular value is directly going into
the existing Dom element document object
model element which is the span itself
so if you open this and the inspect
element you are going to see that
particular value is 12 so let me do
another so I would like to say 12 and 15
and click show and now you can see it
has just actually modified the existing
or previous value with 27 again you
please observe this it is going to just
replace only this value so I modify this
to 67 and 78 observe only this one I
click show and now you can see that 27
has replaced I mean was replaced with
145 so if you switch back to our network
you can see I have three requests and in
all of the three requires all the
response is just only the values and let
us quickly see the headers what kind of
information we are sending so you can
see we are still sending the post and we
are also sending form data you can see
txt first number and txt second number
and on top of that there is one more
thing called XML HTTP request which is
sense essentially say
that it is an AJAX based request so you
can see how that equals are made and how
the responses are being returned okay so
as you could understand like we have a
checks dot begin form and as long as you
have all the necessary scripts it should
be working fine for example let us
consider I am having some what I say one
point eight point three so which
shouldn't work so let me comment this
and and let me see one point eight point
three or whatever it may or may not work
for that by our measure let me remove
this whatever I have in place let me see
if this is working it may or may not
work but let us see if it is going to
work with the previous version so let me
view in browser so f12 so this is my
developer tools so I go here and press
something and do something and click
show okay this seems working allow us
because you know it looks like all of
those are compatible to each other so
let me do something else I may have
something like two or for that matter
three point or something and this one I
may be having twelve or something I
don't know I just providing some values
there so let me press f5 okay so you can
see these two files are not available
and they are not loaded as part of my
existing webpage so you can see four not
four which means those two script files
are currently not available so let me
clear everything and do whatever the
stuff I am wanting it to be done so I
click show you can see it did it
however the whole page has been replaced
with one single value called 1:45 so if
you go and inspect the element you can
see this is a whole
new web page called HTML and header and
I have body so that body currently has
only 145 so this is very very important
for some reason if the Ajax doesn't work
it automatically falls back to full page
post back and if it does there is no
question of replacing the elements it
actually replaces the whole web page
with no with new web page so you can see
this particular response I have 145 so
what this one did is it replaced the
entire current page with new web page
altogether and that new web page is
having only this response so this is
pretty much important if you don't have
the compatible libraries and if it could
not understand how to do an ajax call
all it does is it will be simply falling
back to the full page post back model
and it does a full page post back
automatically so this is where most of
us will be having the trouble with so we
should always have the compatible
javascript libraries in place okay so
let me get back to my previous working
libraries so I just again remove all of
this stuff and let me get back and
ensure that this is working with no
problems so let me open my developer
tools and ensure that we are only having
whatever is necessary so click show and
I get 46 and you can see I have only 46
here
okay so right now we have seen on how we
can post information using Ajax dot
begin form okay let us consider a
different scenario imagine that I am
having say 20 text boxes or 20 UI
elements which include text boxes
checkboxes drop-down lists and
everything so I have 20 elements and at
the moment I click on submit all the 20
UI elements related information
be posted automatically to the server
whether or not the action accepts it so
even though my action says that it can
accept only these two values however
this submit button does not know
anything about this action all the
submit button does is it actually
fetches every UI element related value
and posts it automatically so that is
very important so in this case let us
consider I am going to have a couple
more text boxes and I would like to
mention like 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 so just for our
understanding here so let us see how
this is going to work so I go to view in
browser so I open this and I am going to
say something like 1 1 1 1 and all one's
for now and click show you can see my
action has honored only first and second
but if you see the request we are
actually posting all the UI elements in
the form of key value pairs so that is
one of the things what Ajax dot begin
form does so it essentially gets each
and every input table elements to be
considered and all of the relative
values will be automatically posted but
you may want it sometimes and you may
not want it sometimes so sometimes we
would need everything to be posted but
sometimes we may not need everything to
be posted so how not to post those
values which may not be required in our
scenario or in one scenario so for that
purpose we cannot go with Ajax dot begin
form anymore
so if you use Ajax dot begin form you
are essentially posting everything so
the other alternative is doing your own
Ajax or
a query based Ajax from the scratch so
which means you will take the control
into your hands so you will be saying
what values to be posted you will be
fetching the values from the UI elements
you will be posting what are required
and you will be receiving the data
whatever you are getting from the server
and you are going to replace where that
particular value needs to be sitting so
you are going to control all of that
information completely by yourself and
without using Ajax dot begin form so if
you use Ajax dot begin form certain of
the flexibilities are going to be lost
but if you take everything into the
control using jQuery dot Ajax calls you
are going to have the complete control
on the entire Ajax call what values
needs to be posted what values needs to
be returned what values needs to be
replaced and so on so let us do another
sample on that but prior to that let me
see if this is working again is the view
model so let me have the view model now
so I just wanted to have a new class to
be created and I would like to call that
one as sample view model and ensure that
I am having something like the same okay
properties as of the controls so
similarly I am going to have another one
and I am going to call this one a second
number so now in my controller instead
of using this I am going to use sample
view model directly sample view model
and that is the reference so let me
import the namespace
and now what I am saying is whatever has
been posted has to be automatically
mapped into this particular object so if
we need more information about this
particular line please refer to maybe a
previous video so where I covered how
all the ways you can retrieve the posted
information including request form
collections and what I said all the
parameters and the view models so
everything has been covered in my
previous video so for now we can say
that we are trying to post whatever the
information is available from the client
and once it has been posted it tries to
map all the necessary properties into
this particular object M and now I can
just use M directly so let us see if
this is going to work so again you can
see I am NOT modifying my view at all
all I modified was just only the
controller and the view model so let us
quickly check this before even jumping
to jQuery AJAX so I open my developer
tools and now I say 12 and 13 and click
show and now you can see it still works
in the same fashion and let us quickly
check the response you can see there we
have 25 so whether or not you use this
way which is the parameters or directly
using the view models to get the posted
information it works in either way so
regardless so this is important to know
and let us jump to jQuery dot H acts so
what I was talking earlier so let me
create a new controller from the scratch
so I go to add controller and I am going
to say sample 0 2 in this case and I am
going to have an action method in this
case I can use the exact same action
methods whatever I have in here I copy
this
and get into this so have the same
action methods no difference so let me
have the respect to namespace imported
so we are changing only jQuery AJAX but
we are not going to change how the
server is going to respond this needs to
be there no matter what so let us have a
new view to be created for our HTTP POST
sorry hits for action index so I just
add a view and I call it as index in
this case so I got new view here so let
me copy and paste whatever I have in
here so just copy only this part you can
see I am not quite being Ajax dot begin
form and the other structure so I am NOT
doing that I am just copying only which
is necessary for this view so all I have
is just only two text boxes and the
button and the label so I did not get
anything else so for this one again just
the jQuery itself is enough so we don't
need anything else but as we are already
copying everything so let me copy this
one too so let us get whatever I have in
here ok so now that we have all the
necessary libraries here so you double
check which may or may not be necessary
but for now I am just including
everything so now that we have the UI in
place now we need to do an ajax call and
we need to take the control of the ajax
call completely into our hands so for
that purpose i am going to have a new
script to be written on my own so this
is going to be my own javascript and i
would like to start with a function
called do some this is just a javascript
function so the job of this function do
some is to get the information available
in these text boxes so i need to get the
value from first number and second
number text boxes do an ajax call by
posting those two numbers whatever i
received from those text boxes get the
result one sided
once I get the result put that result
into this particular span tag so that is
what I am going to do so the first thing
is get the values of these two text
boxes so how will be how we are going to
do that so I am going to declare a
variable v1 and I am using jQuery in
order to get a reference to this
particular first text box so this is the
way on how I can get reference
I mean how I can get hold of that
particular test box that value so that
is the easiest way on how we can get the
value of a text box I mean with the
value available inside a text box using
jQuery so similarly I can use another
variable and I am going to call this one
as txt second number so now that I have
both of the values I need to do in Ajax
call so I am going to use jQuery AJAX so
I need to provide all the Ajax options
right in here so we are going to add
those action I'm in options bit later
and now once Ajax call has been
completed
I would like to execute a function
immediately once the call has been
completed so that can be achieved by
writing done so Dan is the I mean done
is I do not want to go much more
in-depth it is part of promise in
general but just consider Dan means that
Ajax call has been completed for now at
least so if you're familiar with jQuery
you should be already knowing what is
done if you are not in this case just
consider dan means the Ajax call has
been completed for now so the done
accepts a function and that particular
function can have a parameter it could
be data or D or whatever you would like
to mention that one else so done is a
kind of a function which accepts another
function so which means it is this is a
callback function if you are not sure
callback functions and so on please
refer my advanced JavaScript videos so
in this case done means the call has
been executed and once the call has been
executed the result will be placed
inside this D which means once the call
has been executed jQuery execute this
function and while this function is
getting executed I am saying that the
result needs to be automatically placed
inside D so in this case the result is
going to be some whatever the value we
are going to receive from the server in
this case it is just this so whatever
you are sending from here is
automatically going to be made available
in this variable D so once I have D all
I have to do is just get hold of this
labelled result again I am going to use
jQuery for this one so I get hold of
that particular label and I am going to
say please get that particular text so
which means I am saying that whatever
the value available inside this D has to
be placed as text inside this particular
span so which means it is nothing but
content you are working with the content
inside the span that is what this text
does so we have the damn piece working
imagine it is working successfully but
we still need to specify the Ajax
options the first thing the Ajax call
needs to be reached somewhere it needs
in URL in this case it has to go to our
action method available in the
controller sample zero two so I need to
specify the URL so the easiest way to
specify the URL is using at the rate the
URL helper in asp.net MVC dot action so
I can specify action based URL directly
so here I can say please go to index
action and that index action is
available as part of sample zero to
controller
so the rest will be automatically taken
care by asp.net MVC it generates the URL
automatically the moment you provide
this one so the URL might look like
current website URL slash sample zero to
slash index so that part will be taken
care by a MVC so once you are always
provided I need to provide the data
which needs to be posted so whenever I
see posted I have to specify method
equal to post so which means I'm using
HTTP POST
that is important the method needs to be
post and it is recommended to have cash
to be false for all the post requests so
which means sometimes the browser will
be caching the output for the same kind
of requests so in this case I'm saying
that please do not cache any kind of
output whatever you are receiving from
the server for these kind of requests so
just to ensure that whenever you specify
HTTP POST cache needs to be set to false
now now I need to send the data so which
means I need to send the data for this
model which essentially talks about txt
first number and second number which are
available in v1 and v2 I need to send
these two values through Ajax call so
for that purpose I need to specify data
and use the JSON object syntax to send
those two values so this is the way on
how to send the value all I am
specifying here is just an object an
object with two properties
txt first number and txt second number
those two are the property names and
each of those property names are having
the values called v1 and v2 so I am
posting this entire object which is
called as JSON object if you are not
swear if you are not familiar with
JavaScript objects are the JSON objects
and so on please refer to my advanced
JavaScript videos
so for now let us consider you are just
posting this JSON object and these are
supposed to be matching with this and
one - these two are match matching
already and on top of that they need to
be matching with the property with the
properties available inside the sample
view model that is first number and
second number
so this DX D first number should match
with this one that is important if those
two are not matching you will not be
able to have the automatic mapping
information from asp.net amazing so
looks like we are almost done so let me
see this is oh okay I forgot one
important thing here I did the function
which means I coded for this function
but I did not actually call this
function I need to call this function
somewhere and that has to happen
whenever I click on this button but this
button is of type submit' I do not want
to do any huge submit here I do not want
a browser to be submitting the
information so I change this one to
button so which means this is a dummy
button right now so let me see how the
dummy would button works so I just go in
here so I open my developer tools
okay so let me clear everything here so
this is the damage button you can see no
request is getting to the server it is
just a dummy button no submit behavior
is available here so the moment you
remove submit and place I replace submit
with the button it is just a dummy
client-side button where you have to say
how this button has to perform from
climb side if you Pro if you provide
this submit I mean this button is submit
it automatically does the whole submit
that is full page post back so I am not
using submit Here I am just saying this
is just a client-side button where I
will be saying how this function how
this button has to function so now I am
saying on click please execute those son
so this is not going to divide full page
force back but what I'm saying is the
moment I click on this particular button
please execute my function - Sun which
is nothing but this guy so whenever I
click on this button this function gets
executed and while execution while
executing this function as part of that
I am actually getting the values from
the text boxes doing an ajax call and
while doing an ajax call I'm saying that
it has to go to this URL which is
nothing but this action of this
controller with HTTP POST and data which
is nothing but whatever I have been
fetching and finally if the Ajax call
has been completed
I would like to execute this function
immediately after the completion of Ajax
call so once this particular function is
getting executed the result of this ajax
call will be automatically received
inside the city which is nothing but our
sum of those two numbers and that
particular value i am directly placing
inside LBL result as its own content so
let us execute and see whether this is
working fine another
so let me open with developer tools so I
type something like 23 and 34 and click
show and now you can see I got 57 so if
I click on this you can see I'm actually
getting only 57 and if let us see the
headers you can also see I'm actually
posting those two values using Ajax and
the two jQuery AJAX so this is how you
can accomplish Ajax calls using jQuery
AJAX or you can also achieve the same
using ajax dot begin form as I mentioned
ajax dot begin form is very good if you
are going to have all the UI elements
related information to be posted at a
time but if you would like to have the
flexibility of fetching your own
information from UI and pass along
whatever the information you would like
to send and once you receive if you
would like to have any kind of massaging
to be done for this particular value or
the result available in d you can still
do that here so i can say something like
d dot - upward or whatever so I can
convert everything to uppercase now just
giving you an idea so you can do some
post-processing after you receive the
result so all that flexibility is
available as part of jQuery AJAX so now
that we know a bit about a jQuery dot H
axe
we can also do something similar using
jQuery dot post so which is just a
wrapper around jQuery dot H axe so I
just wanted to comment this and so I'm
going to do something like jQuery dot
post and this is also going to have dot
done so in this case I am going to use
whatever I have in here so you can see
and doing the same thing whatever I am
trying to accomplish earlier but this is
going to have a better simple syntax so
it is going to accept parameters so I
can say
I wanted to have the URL to be something
like this so it has to go to that URL
and data I can just provide the data
right after the URL and we are done so
this is another simpler way of achieving
whatever you are already doing earlier
but it is important to understand behind
the scenes this post works with Ajax so
this post calls Ajax behind the scenes
so whether you use this one or this one
it doesn't matter it is just what is in
your convenience basically you will
comfort level so whether you go with
Ajax or post it doesn't matter why
because post behind-the-scenes works
with Ajax so let me see if this is
working fine so I go to view in browser
and now I can say 6 &amp;amp; 7 and let me open
developer tools and click on show and
you can see I got 13 and if I click
there you can see I got only 13 and you
are still sending those two parameters
in the form of posted data so we have
seen two different ways or say
essentially three different ways of
having the a tax base post back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
