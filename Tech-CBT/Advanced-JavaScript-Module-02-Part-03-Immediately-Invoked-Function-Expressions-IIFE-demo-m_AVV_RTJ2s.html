is where i'm going to demonstrate itself
in working functions so which is which
can also be called as immediately
executable so immediately in working
self execution functions so i already
have that as part of my presentation
earlier so just a quick look on that so
this is a presentation i am going to do
now so you know i have can invoke itself
so i can have a function which can have
its own particular function to be
executed by just wrapping up inside this
kind of syntax so i have an anonymous
function and i can have both of these
particular parenthesis and this
parenthesis itself makes this whole
statement to be getting executed at a
time so this is this can also be written
in this fashion all i did was you know
just rearranged all of the statements
next to each other and that's how it
came in and those can also be called as
immediately invoked function expressions
they can also be called as self
executing anonymous functions so let us
see from here so let me have the script
to be written for that and in this case
the first thing the easiest way you open
and close the brackets and you open and
close the brackets and this is where i
will be writing the function so i would
like to say something like function and
inside the function i would like to have
something like this is message so that
is the easiest way to do it so let me
click on this
and now you can see I got that function
to be executed immediately so that is
not the key went nothing it is executed
on the spots so in order to follow how
the word codes immediately executable
functions it is better to do something
like this so this is essentially how we
are going to have an ia Fe to be written
so similarly I can have the functions
with parameters so in this case again am
I going to have something like this then
inside this I can start writing the
function and inside this I am going to
have to worry about a comma B and to
those two variables I would like to send
values 10 comma 20 and inside this all I
would like to have is some of those two
values with a squared a plus B so let me
have these two to be calculating and to
be converted to string so that is how
this is going to look like so let me
test it and in return I should see value
30 so there we go
so next let me have another function
which can have multiple arguments to be
passed to self executable function so in
this case again I start in this way and
inside this I'm going to have a function
to be written in this way and inside of
this function I would like to have
something like s equal to 0 and for
wearable I equal to 0 I less than
infinite argument array dot length i
plus plus so as explained before this is
the one which contains all those
particular parameter
I'm going to send your respect of the
nimble so if I have ten items here this
is the era which holds all the ten items
so now I can add all of those elements
by just writing the statement and
finally the alert something like total
Sam a Auto plus s so this is how I can
have it so I need to have a semicolon at
the end so this is the self executable
function with infinite number of
arguments you would like to send so let
me quickly check this guy and there you
go I got the total Sam and now let us do
something very similar but instead self
executable function which actually
returns the value so let us start with
the function first so I start this I
open the function so once I start the
function I would like to have two values
to be taken as parameters and in this
case I would like to send 40 and 5 as
parameters and now I would like to have
read about C equal to 0 C equal a minus
B and I would like to return the value
of C so C essentially returns based on
the difference of those two values a and
B so I have a function but I would like
to have this function to be returned
which in fact it is returning so now I
can have a variable something like
gettable result equal to something like
this
so which means I am saying that once you
execute this function it returns a value
C and that variable C has to be assigned
to R so which means R will have the
value of exactly what C is being
returned so R is being assigned to C so
R will have the result of whatever this
particular function is returning
so let me alert our
so in this case the data returned 40
minus 5 it is going to be 30 file and
there we go it is 35 so actually instead
of doing this way I can even actually
get this whole stuff remove the variable
and I can just put everything right here
so which means I am saying that please
execute this function return a value and
that particular value which has been
returned must be alerted so even this is
valid so you can do in either way and
there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
