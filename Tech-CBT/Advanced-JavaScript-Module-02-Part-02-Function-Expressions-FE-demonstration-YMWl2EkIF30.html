more advanced the usage of functions so
I call this one as 0 to 4 now and in
this case I would like to see function
expressions or labels so let me have a
couple of buttons first type equal to
bottom value equal to show message and I
can say on click I would like to call
something like this function that is f 1
so that is going to be the name of the
function or like to execute so let us
start with the script here and now
wearable F 1 equal to function so that
is the name of the function I'm going
sorry F 1 is the name of a variable
which essentially contains a function
inside it
it contains the definition say F 1
contains the definition and we need to
have a semicolon here and now all I
would like to say is alert this is a
message so this is how it is going to
look like so assigning a portable
anonymous function definition to a
variable becomes a function expression
so click on this and now I get the
message
so similarly I can have other expression
says or like I can have a function with
parameters a comma B and again at the
same time
how the Sun to be shown for them so you
can say it's something like a plus B in
dot tostring and now I can have another
button which essentially says show some
and I would like to execute function two
by sending values to 10 and 20 so let me
execute this again let me control some
and now you can see I got some as well
and now let us have another function and
in this case I would like to have
multiple arguments so which means I may
not know how many number of arguments I
miss and so I would like to say
something like total sum in this case
and the name of the function is going to
be f3 key and 30 and 40 and 50 so I may
not know how many number of values I may
be sending if such is the case I will be
using the arguments ever so first of all
I declare s equal to 0 and for variable
I equal to 0 I understand the built-in
arguments had a dot length I plus plus
so as I mentioned earlier no arguments
array is a built-in which contains all
the parameters which have been sent to
this particular function during
execution and all of those values will
be stored in the phone on an array so
that error is nothing but arguments and
I can find the length of it and now I
can say S Plus equal to argument so I'm
just getting each of those values into
the Sun and then finally alert it using
total sum equal to
Esther to string
there you go I got 150 so similarly the
function expressions which isolated on
values I can have a part of the function
which acts of studios and which
essentially calculate something or a
fade and finally returns that whatever
value so I can have a button which can
say show difference and I can say I am
going to call f4 with two i Leos 50
comma 10 so which means I am going to
execute f4 which is this function but
this function is actually returning a
value also as it is returning a value I
need to get hold of it right now
as it is going to be part of on click
all I would like to use is alert so
which means whatever this function is
returning
I would like to alert it so I can have
something like this and then I can
actually click on this and then the
moment that you can show difference you
can see I got 40 so this is how the
function expressions can look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
