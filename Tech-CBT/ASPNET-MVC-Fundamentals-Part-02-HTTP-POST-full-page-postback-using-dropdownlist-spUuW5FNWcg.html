look at HTTP POST or say full page post
back so in this video we're going to
concentrate only on full page goes back
using asp.net MVC 5 so just for the sake
of this demonstration we are going to
use drop-down list in order to do a full
page post back we are also going to see
and how to retrieve all the posted
values also browser posted values to the
server using asp.net MVC in various ways
so let us start directly by creating a
project so I go to visual C sharp and
then there
I just wanted to sell the web and make
sure that asp.net MVC application
I mean web application is selected you
can forward whatever the application
name you would like to provide so in
this case say I would like to go with
sample click OK and I would like to
select an empty template however I would
like to ensure that MVC based empty
template needs to be made available for
my application so make sure that you
select empty template however ensure
that you have all the references with
respect to a me see our are in place
okay so now we have a sample solution
I mean sample project and we have all
the folders necessary those are the
controller's morals and views so if you
are not familiar at the views models or
controllers please refer to my previous
video on introduction to MVC so for now
we are going to concentrate on full page
post back so in order to do that let us
start with a V model so in this case yes
I would like to have it drop down list
to be made available so I would like to
have the drop down list
to be filled with a list of countries so
for that purpose I would like to use a
view model where that the job of the
view model is going to be producing or
say pulling up all the countries which
are necessary for the drop-down list to
be shown so for that purpose I'm just
going to create a new view model so in
this case I would like to call this on a
sample 0-1 view model you can just put
whatever the class name you would like
to house in this case I would like to
start with sample 0-1 and click Add and
now you can see I have a view model
class generated and now all I would like
to have is public list of country so I
would like to have a list of countries
to be made available using this property
so let me you only get for now so which
means it is just added on the property
where the job of get is going to be to
actually fulfill all the countries
necessary to be retrieved so country is
supposed to be a class I did not create
any class called country so I would like
to create that right now so go to models
had another class called country and in
this case the country in is going to
have two properties to maintain the
country information one is going to be
the ID so country ID you can say the
other is going to be name secondary name
or whatever so in this case I would like
to have both of those two so now I have
country and name so choose ID and name
to be made available as part of country
and that particular country is going to
be what I am using here and this get
essentially is going to create a new
list of countries so I would like to
have new list of contrary to be created
and to be returned back
so this is what I would like to hell but
here you can see it is just returning
empty list of countries I need at least
a couple of countries to be shown in the
drop-down list so just for demonstration
purpose I would like to hard-code a few
countries so in this case I would like
to create a country called in India so
where the ID is going to be I am in this
case however name of the country is
going to be India so I created only one
country so let me create a couple more
so I'm going to have one more and one
more so I am going to have three
countries altogether and the second
country is going to be something like
this the USA United States of America
and the third one is going to be Canada
saying so I would like to say the IDS CA
and in this case and the caption or name
is going to be Canada so now that I have
the v-model so viewmodel in this case
right now I have only one property
called countries essentially this
property is going to list out all the
list of countries available so the list
is going to be hard-coded as of now
where each of the country will have ID
and name properties okay so now that we
have the model ready let us switch back
to controller so I don't have a
controller so let me create a new
controller from the scratch I click Add
and then go to controller and now I'm
going to have an empty controller in
this case and I just wanted to call this
controller a sample zero one so right
now this is the index and that is the
get operation by default you can see he
doesn't have HTTP POST attribute so if
you have HTTP POST attribute it works as
a post operation or post action
in this case it is just a get operation
so all I'm going to have is index and
now what I'm saying is I would like to
have a new sample 0-1 view model needs
to be instantiated and finally this and
at that one to the viewer so which means
I'm going to have an instance of sample
0-1 view model for which I need to
import the necessary namespace so I'm
creating an instance of the view model
so that view model internally will have
the list of countries to be proud just
by using the property countries right so
that the same model I'm going to send to
the viewer so you should be responsible
to pull that information from the view
model so I don't have a view at this
moment you can see I don't have a view
inside sample 0-1 so let me create a new
view so the easiest way just right-click
and say add view so I can say index for
now it is asking me if I would like to
have any layout page to be created for
now I don't want any layout and just
click Add for now okay so you can see
this is a full page and this particular
index page I would like to make sure
that it is using sample of your model
why I am using this the reason behind it
is you can see this view has to work
with whatever the model we are sending
here so we are sending M which is of
type sample 0 1 view model so in order
to make sure that this view works based
on this model you need to mention this
particular model specification directly
at the top so this is essential so now
that we have it so which means I'm
saying that this view index can receive
an object of type this particular sample
be a model and that particular object is
always accessible by just writing at the
right model you can see M is capital so
here M is capital and here M is small so
whenever I say at the rate model M is
capital which means you are literally
accessing the object which has been sent
to the view so which means whatever you
are sending M here is automatically
going to be made available in model
object so this is a default object which
is already available as part of your
view and the data type of this one is
going to be exactly the same data type
whatever you have specified here so if
you specify different data type here you
are going to have this model to be
working in a different fashion however
in this case as you are sending the
model of type sample 0 1 via model it
has to be in sync in sync with whatever
you are using here so this view works
this model works with this model
similarly in order to work with this
view the controller has to send the same
model object and the same model object
we are going to send here is accessible
using at the rate model and now if I
said dot you can see I have the
country's property automatically imagine
I did not use this and I am directly
using at the rate model and you can see
it doesn't know what it is doing so it
could not give us any information
however the moment you say but the
moment you specify the view model type
on which this view is depending upon the
moment you say model dot you can see the
countries has already made available for
you so that is the significance of
actually having the model specification
as part of your particular view ok so in
order to have our particular drop-down
list so I have a helper which is made
available as part of asp.net MVC so I
can say HTML top down list and I can
provide the name of the drop-down list
in this case that could be confuse and I
can say like it can work with model dot
countries let us see if this
is going to work in our case however you
can see it is already giving some kind
of problem for us so what is that let us
see all those particular overloaded
methods we have so we have string with
option label which is fine and now this
is important this is name it is fine I
give the DDL countries as the name which
should be fine in our case however there
are there are other things which are
necessary so in this case it is
expecting an enumerable ienumerable of
type select list item but we are not
sending select list item types here but
our countries is a list of countries it
is not select list item but our
particular view is actually expecting
that one to be of type select list item
so in order to have these particular
countries to be translated to
ienumerable of select list item I would
like to have a new method to be added to
my particular view model and the job of
that particular new method is going to
be convert this list of countries to
select list items it is going to be just
a helper method in this case so I'm
going to add a new method which
essentially gives ienumerable of select
list item type so this is exactly what
that particular drop-down list is
expecting and I can say get countries
list items so in this case so that is
just a helper method okay
so where is the Select list item if you
open this you can see that what the
Select list item class is available as
part of system that web data may say I
need to import that so the moment I
import it you can see I hate that
particular class is made available and
now this method is
supposed to translate all this list of
countries to ienumerable of select list
item so in order to do that I am going
to use a link expression where it is
going to retrieve all the current
countries what I have in there dot
select and now for each of the countries
available inside that countries list and
saying that please create a new select
list item and that particular select
list item should have the respective
properties select list item has very
importantly two properties one is text
the other is value so I can say text is
going to be what the user is going to
see in this case the country name is
what the user is going to see and the
value is what will be posted to the
server once the user has selected a
country so in this case I would like to
get country ID so which means I'm going
to say like whenever a particular
drop-down list item has been selected
this value is going to be posted to the
server so which means I'm saying that if
the user selects United States of
America USA will be sent to the user
sorry sent to the server so the server
needs ID that is the selected country
but the user needs to see the caption so
in order to have both of these two
together as part of the drop-down list
I'm saying that text which is what the
user is going to see needs to be set to
the caption or the name what the user is
going to see the value is the one which
is going to be posted to the server or
sent to the server and now that I have
everything in place all I am going to
say is use this particular get country
list items directly if I go back here
and I'm going to say just use this so
let us see if this is going to work in
our case so I go to VM browser
okay did not break this one yet so let
me stop this and build it for a second
okay so let me switch sure and make sure
that the build is successful and now I
can save you in browser and now you can
see I have India United States of
America and Canada and these three
whatever you are going to see are
nothing but the captions are the names
of the countries but not the Hyades
but the moment you open a view page
source let us consider okay you can see
like you are seeing all the captions
right here however the value is based on
whatever the idea of putting so whenever
you post this information to the server
you are not posting the caption but
instead you are going to post the value
if you would like to have the ID to be
shown here instead of caption you will
have to modify your particular get
country list items in such a way so the
text I don't want caption but I want ID
so that is possible too so now I can say
again it build it and let me view it
again and now you can see I have IDs
here so again if you go to the view page
source you can see I am going to hell ID
here and also the user is going to be
saying ID you can also have both if you
would like to contribute or concatenate
together in this case so I can say
something like this so I would like to
have ID together with the caption both
of this tool so which means the user has
has to see both so just for my
convenience I would like to switch from
Firefox to Google Chrome so let me in
view in browser now now it is going to
open Google Chrome
and now you can see I have the ID along
with the caption so the user is going to
see the ID and also the caption together
the moment you say page view per source
here now you can see this is the caption
what the user is going to see however
the values are going to be just the same
as we mentioned okay now that we got the
drop-down list - what we really need
there is some more things what we can do
for example if I switch to this one let
me go back to the browser for a second
imagine I don't want India to be
selected by default I would like to have
select a country to be the first element
so the easiest way to do that is it has
a power loaded method where I can
specify any kind of caption label so in
this case I can say selected country so
that is possible - so let us see if this
is going to work and there we go so now
the first thing is select a country so
I've been a drop-down layer
I can select whatever the value I have
in here okay
so now that the drop-down list is
actually displaying what it is supposed
to now the goal of this particular video
is whenever I select something here the
value needs to be posted back to the
server and that value needs to be
retrieved by the server whatever the
value we posted and in return I would
like to have the same webpage to be
refreshed with a label here where that
label essentially is supposed to show
the value whatever we have selected so
let us see on how we can accomplish that
so in order to post something first of
all we should have a form form in the
sense a form tag so let us switch back
to our view source for a second we don't
have a form tag here if you can see
there is no form tag so whenever you
would like to post something that
particular ID
I mean that particular element needs to
be made available as part of form so in
order to have a form the easiest way is
to use the helper so I can say using
HTML dot begin form and this particular
begin form is can have three parameters
in this case so let us work with three
parameters for now it has got too many
overloaded methods but for now let us go
with the easiest way so it has this
particular form for now so let me push
my stuff here so which means what I'm
saying is whenever I select drop-down
list and if I post it it has to post to
that particular form that is what I am
saying and now this particular form I
need to specify all the necessary
features are the supporting attributes
for the respective form so in this case
what I'm saying is whenever I post
anything it has to go to index action of
this control of which is sample zero one
and the method is going to be for method
that dot post so this is essential so
what I'm saying is if I post something
as part of drop-down or any other
element available in between this scope
that particular submit or that
particular request to the server will be
going in the form of post so it is going
to be HTTP POST
so whenever it is posting it is going to
find a particular action with this name
which supports post so right now if you
open the controller sample 0 1 this is
with get I don't have another action of
the same name which supports post so I
need to have an action index which
supports post in this case it could be
index or anything else but that
particular action should support post so
that is important so I am saying that
this whenever we post anything through
drop-down list
has to go to this action which is marked
with this post and that particular
action needs to be available as part of
this controller so in this case we are
using the same controller and now I need
to have a new action to be defined which
can support post operation so I can say
public action result and I can say index
which is also and now I would like to
say something like you know string dam
here whatever so you might be wondering
why I would need that I will be
explaining that in a second so for now
let us consider I would like to specify
something like this HTTP POST so let me
return the view so that - I am going to
create okay let me return whatever I
have in here okay so what I am saying is
there is a particular action called
index which is marked with HTTP POST
which means if it is a get request it
has to go to this action if it is a post
request it has to go to this particular
action so as long as that particular
action name matches with the respective
HTTP action if no action is specified
like a specified HTTP POST here if we
don't specify anything here it is by
default it is get so if the action is
called index but if you did not specify
any HTTP verb this is the get action and
this is the post action with the same
action name so I can have the same
action to be presented with both get and
also the post so I'm having this
particular action which is supported in
post and at the same time right now if
you remove this let us consider I know
this
okay so in this case it might work but
let let me build this for a second and
see if that is going to work with no
problems and now you can see it says
controller already defines a member
called index at the same parameter nerve
so you can see it doesn't accept it
right because according to the
object-oriented terms you cannot have
two methods with the same name and at
the same time with same parameter so in
this case I don't have any parameters
here I also don't have any parameters
here that is not going to be acceptable
so this is still going with respect to
object-oriented terms so we need to have
something there so in this case yes this
is a demonstration I would like to make
some difference in the signature so
which means now this is a method index
Evolver loaded method index according to
object-oriented terms so according to
object orientation what I am saying here
is we have two methods one method with
no parameters and another method with
simple parameters so we are just for
loading it and now if I build it it
should successfully compiled but that is
only from the object orientation
semantics but from the HTTP point of
view this action will be automatically
taken into the consideration if the
request is of type post if that
particular request is of type gas.get
and the action is indexed this is going
to be picked up
okay so let us see one by one now I
switch back to index again for a second
and now I need to have this particular
drop down to be acting as a post so
right now if I execute this
okay so I have the drive down but if I
select something it is not really
posting back to the server
I need this particular drop-down list to
be automatically posting the selected
value to the server that is what is my
goal so in order to accomplish that I
need to have the drop-down list to be
doing its own self post for that purpose
I can add a particular unchanged
attribute HTML attribute which is
nothing but on change attribute for the
HTML select where I can provide my own
JavaScript so in this case I am saying
that on change equal to this dot form
got submit so this is simple JavaScript
which is inline JavaScript which is
going to be added as part of all change
attribute for the respective select tag
what this particular drop-down list is
going to emit so let us see how this is
going to work let me put a breakpoint
here so that we will know what is going
and which action is being invoked at
runtime so let me execute this and now
you can see I am actually going to the
controller sample 0 1 and index so it is
a get operation and now you can see for
the first time it is hitting here as
because I am not posting any data but
for the first time I am landing on to
the page which is a nothing but a get
request so the moment I executed okay
and now I got everything ready here so
let me quickly see on what this select
is so you can see I have the Select
which is nothing but the drop-down list
from the HTML point of view and you can
also see on change so whatever I
specified there in the markup has
directly come in here so this is exactly
what is specified on change with
whatever the JavaScript you would like
to queue and the moment ok let me go to
the network here so right now I don't
have any traffic here you can see there
is no traffic available and the moment I
select any particular item inside the
drop down
you can see it has automatically
selected HTTP POST related action and it
is waiting there okay for now I just
continue without doing much and let us
quickly observe the network on what it
is doing let us go back now you can see
I have the sample zero one so let us
click on that and let us click on
headers and you are going to see all I
am trying to accomplish is I am
requesting this URL and that a quest
method is paused this is important this
is very very important to understand I
am requesting the post HTTP verb if you
are not sure about get and post please
refer my previous video so what I am
doing is I am just specifying we need to
post something and if you come down what
are we posting you can see I'm posting
something called DDL countries which is
going to have a value for the USA so
this is the key and this is the value
and this is exactly what I am posting to
the server and once it is posted the
server is going to be responding back
with this response and right now the
whole response whatever you are seeing
here is exactly what has been sent by
the server and now you can see that
whole part is made available here this
is this response is reinterpreted by the
browser and you see a fresh page here
okay let me clear all the net of traffic
let us start from the beginning again
so I say sample 0 1 index you can see it
is going to be a get request as because
I am NOT submitting the form
so press ENTER and now you can see it
has selected the gate operation right
because I did not submit a form I am
just trying to retrieve a page so plus
continue and now let us see what is
going on I have an index here let us
click on that go to the headers and now
you can see the request method is of I
get that is important so if we have get
you can see I don't have any of the form
submission related key value pairs here
so this at the developer tools you can
always get these developers tools by
pressing f12 that is important okay
anyway now whenever I select something
now you can see it has posted so let me
continue and now you can say this is the
one which is doing the post operation
and during the post operation it is
sending form data and the key values so
now that we are actually posting
something to the server we need to
retrieve that information at the server
level so how do I do that
now we are pretty sure that this is
going to be the action which is going to
hit the moment the first operation is
selected so change once we post this
this is the action which is going to be
executed so as part of this one to make
our things simple I would like to use
view data so as part of this I would
like to say selected country equal to I
can say something like get the value
directly from request parameters in this
case so I can say a request of the real
countries so what I'm specifying a is
whenever I post something to this index
I am trying to retrieve the form data
whatever I have as part of the request
the post request what we have seen
earlier in the developer tools the form
data the key value pairs so I am
retrieving the value of a particular key
DDL countries and putting into the view
data so this is my own key the reason
behind using view data is the same view
data can be used in our view directly so
which means whatever you place in this
view data can be directly accessed in
our view by just doing something like
this so I can put a span like this you
can put whatever you need so in this
I would like to go with the spam and now
I can say at the rate view data selector
country that's it so which means what
I'm trying to do here is from the action
I would like to send some information to
the viewer and the simplest way to
achieve that is using the view data you
can put whatever the rubbish you wanted
to use inside the view by using view
data all you need to do is get that
particular value you would like to have
to be passed to the view push that value
into the view data using a key using the
same key go back to your view and return
that value out so let us see if this is
working fine so just for Sapphire
so let me open the developer tools so
now I submit something and now you can
see I got USA so if you go back to my
request here you can see this is the
farm data I'm sending TTL countries so
the value USA is being retrieved using
this key and where I am using this key
and directly using that key as part of
this one so requests of that particular
key gives the value whatever you have
posted or the user has posted from the
respective browser then that value I am
pushing into the view data so that I can
use the data in view later on so once I
go to the view which is nothing but this
I am saying that please get that
particular data out so let us see again
so let me clear the traffic whatever I
have so let me do this
and now let us quickly go to our inspect
element and now you can see I have span
which is empty why because I don't have
anything in View data our get request
here this is the get request it did not
specify anything inside the view data if
you would like to have you can also
specify something like the something
like I can say no country selected at
the moment so you can specify whatever
the message you would like to do
dynamically
even this should work so in this case
during the get request I would like to
specify this particular message to be
made available through the view data and
the same key with the same view data is
being used to here and the moment I
execute this
you can see I already have that
particular message so if you go to
inspect elements you can see this pan is
having that particular value so if I do
a pose to say Canada in this case now
you can see and doing a particular
request and that request is of type post
and we are actually sending the form
data which is DDL countries and I'm
sending Canada here and in return this
particular response if you can see the
response from the server is actually
sending the whole page from the HTML
till to the bottom most HTML tag which
is the closed diagram and as part of
this you can see I have form which is a
new form with all the options and the
span with Canada this is important so
the response from the server include the
span with Canada however if I clear
everything and just refresh this and if
you see this this is the request which
is of type get and if you see the
response from the server you can see how
the span is going to look like but the
moment you select something like the USA
you can see I have a new request and if
you see the headers it is after I post I
posted something using detail countries
and in the response you can also see the
span whatever I'm getting here so this
seems reasonable as of now but there is
one particular problem in my application
that is I'm not having the country
selected to be persisted across post
backs so which means if I so imagine
this is the first thing if I select
Canada let us consider okay so it shows
that I have selected Canada but that
particular selection is currently not
being persisted after the post back so I
need to have that particular value to be
automatically made
elected after post so right now it is
not maintaining it right because this
whole page gets refreshed so which means
new drop-down list will be created with
all the new elements and the whole
response if you see this the whole
response is actually new response from
the server
this entire select along with the form
everything is recreated from the server
that is the reason I don't have whatever
the value I have selected earlier to be
made available so we need to ensure that
that particular value whatever I have
sent or posted to the server is
persisted in the same fashion once it
has been retrieved back in order to do
that I am going to do a couple of
modifications to my particular view
model so view model essentially means it
maintains the view on how all the values
and how the data needs to be represented
as part of the view so in this case I
would like to say something like public
string selected country so I would like
to say something like this I'm just
adding a particular string nothing were
selected country this is this the
property which contains whatever the
value the user has selected during the
post so if the user selects USA that
needs to be made available as part of
selected country and while getting the
list of countries to be retrieved and
assigned to it drop-down there is a
particular property what we can make use
of that is selected so I can have this
particular property to be set to true if
that particular country needs to be
selected so imagine this text shows USA
and if I want that item to be selected I
can just say true which means that is
the default selected value so if this
particular selector is always true for
everything then the latest value only
will be the selected so I cannot have
this selected for everything so I need
to have this selected value only for
value for which the selector country has
been fostered by the user so for that
purpose I can say like if the current ID
is equal to selector control then only
it has to be selector so which means I
can say something like this so if this
condition is returning true that true
will be assigned to selector if this
condition returns false this particular
selected will be false
so right now imagine this is the first
time I landed onto the page it will be
trying to retrieve all those particular
countries and it is going to check every
particular country ID with the selected
country by default if nothing is
selected and if it is for the first time
the selected country is going to be
empty so which means it checks every
country ID whether it is equal to Mt so
it is never equal so the selector will
always be false but imagine I have
already selected a country and this
value is made available with the country
ID whatever I have selected then you are
whenever the countries is going to be
populated is it is going to check
whether the current country ID is equal
to the selected country ID during forced
infinity so that value will be selected
otherwise it will not be but we made
everything available we did not place or
we did not assign the value for the
selected country so why do I assign that
the good place will be this so now I can
say m dot selected country equal to I
can just say a request of radial
countries in this case so what I am
saying is whatever the value will get
from the DDL countries which is nothing
but the selected value that will be
assigned to selected country and once
that is in the model
whenever the view is going to be
refreshed which is going to execute our
model here and whenever it tries to bind
our drop-down for this it is already
having a value to selected country and
while getting each and every country
populated to the drop-down it is going
to test this condition for the
respective country currently it is but
getting bound and if that country it
matches our selected country it is
automatically selected if not it is not
going to be so let me build this
solution and I just executed
okay so let me throw it sample zero and
index
okay so right now you can see nothing is
selected but the moment I select the USA
you can see it has not only listed USA
but it has also made that particular
value selected so if I see the network
traffic so let me select Canada now and
see how it is refreshing so I selected
Canada so this is the post request right
this is the post request and now during
the post you can see I'm actually
sending Canada and let us observe the
response so inside the response you can
see I still have the form but you can
see hold on this is a different post I
think I'm missing something
let us go to USA for a second so I'm
selecting USA now and now a selected USA
which is fine so let us observe the
response so as part of the response now
you can see it has selected USA so this
is important selected equal to selected
if this is missing you will not be able
to have that one to be selected at all
so this is important and also you can
see the span is USA
and now you can see after the posting
back to Canada you can see that Canada
has been selected similarly if I select
India let me click here and that is
observe that as far as you can see India
has been selected so this selected
option will be made available if and
only if you maintain the selected
criteria right there so this is one way
of actually having the posted input
directly to the controller but you can
see I can further optimize this by
saying something like I don't really
need to use view data as because now I
have the selected country right inside
the model so I don't need to use this
anymore so I can just remove the s
altogether and I can also say I don't
need this anymore however I can directly
use selected country inside my span so I
don't need to use the view data anymore
and I can say from the model please get
the selected country and this is further
refactored in such a way by excluding my
view date available whatever I did
earlier so now I select USA and now you
can see it still works on whatever the
way I realist it to do so but if I
select select a country no value has
been selected and does the selected
country is empty and it does not really
show anybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
