the functions which actually return the
functions themselves so let us start
with a script and I would like to have
the function due process and it will be
accepting two parameters and I would
like to have another function display
sum which is a nested function and I
would like to say some equals a plus B
and similarly I would like to have
another nested function and I'm going to
call that one as display difference so
this is going to be different and I
would like to have this one as - so in
that way I have two nested functions and
now I can say this place on which means
I'm calling the display some right in
here which essentially takes the control
back here and executes this particular
function and after that I would like to
have something like this that on display
difference directly so the first thing I
am doing is a skewed display somehow so
which means it is going to be executed
and after that I am returning display
some so I if I do this this is going to
execute this so which I don't want all I
would like to do is I don't want to
execute the function but I would like to
return that definition of display
difference so whenever I don't use the
parentheses it actually gets this whole
definition and returns it back but if
you put in here in this way it gives the
function immediately so I don't want to
execute the function but just return the
definition of this function back so now
in order to execute that I would like to
say something like this so which means I
am saying that due process so from here
the control goes in here it is going to
execute this place some and gives this
and after that I'm saying display a
difference definition need to be
returned back so which means this entire
definition is going to be returned back
into a variable called a so a
essentially can be treated as a function
expression which points to this
particular function so all I can say
right now is a so which means I am
trying to execute the definition
available inside the a by just avoiding
the parentheses
let us see if this works and I have some
and now you can see I have the
difference too and it doesn't need to be
a complete function which is available
in this way I can also send it in the
form of an anonymous function so which
means I can remove this and I can say
just return a function like this so this
is going to be an anonymous function and
I am saying that I am returning this
entire definition back to a so even this
is going to work so you don't
necessarily need to have a particular
function with a name in order to return
it back so you can literally return any
kind of anonymous function or existing
functions as part of whatever the
requirement is so I save it again and
let us try this one out and now you can
see even this one works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
