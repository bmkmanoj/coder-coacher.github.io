covering angular JS fundamentals in this
video we are going to have a quick
introduction to angularjs and develop a
basic webpage which demonstrates
angularjs so let us jump straight into
what exactly is angularjs so in simple
words it is a client-side JavaScript
framework so whenever I mentioned
client-side JavaScript framework
whatever the code you are going to write
as part of angular JS development will
be executed only by the browser so the
code we write will be executed by the
browser and that will never be executed
as part of the server it is developed
and being maintained by Google Google
started developing angularjs in 2009 and
currently is one of the most use the
JavaScript frameworks on the planet we
are going to use 1.3 as part of this
tutorial
and while developing angularjs google
has certain goals in its mind the first
thing is that it thought to have Dom
manipulation to be always separated from
application logic if you are familiar
with traditional JavaScript Dom or used
using jQuery you will be seeing that all
of your particular business logic will
always be working with the Dom
manipulation straight away which means
you will be trying to add all the
elements or modify the elements right
after your business logic or part of
your business logic so the main goal of
angularjs is whenever you would like to
have Dom based manipulation so which
means whenever you would like to add
elements to HTML or modify the
attributes or delete or any kind of
operations you would like to make as
part of Dom manipulation that part needs
to be separated from the application
logic or whatever the business logic you
would like to write which essentially
talks to Ajax based what is LS services
or web services
the second goal is the separation of
concerns so if you guys are familiar
with MVC pattern you will be seeing
angular JS follows much of that kind of
pattern so we can say we are going to
have mortals certainly which will be
having all the data views which is
nothing but our Dom or say all kinds of
directives or we can say plain HTML and
controllers is especially to really have
all of our logic which needs to be
working with our rest services or web
services or to get in touch with server
all of that will be usually taken care
by the controller and once it fetches
the information that information will be
placed into models and we bind models
directly to views so in that way each of
those particular parts like models
contain data views contain our Dom or
say HTML controllers work with web
services or communicate with the web
services in that way we are going to
separate each of those particular
operations whatever they are supposed to
do and each of those particular
operations work themselves without
really worrying about our messing up
with other kinds of operations that is
what they call it a separation of
concerns and the next thing is make SP
development easier so whenever I say SP
a it stands for single page application
development if you guys are familiar
with asp.net or PHP or something of that
sort usually we will be having our
particular web page to be developed in
the form of home page first and we'll be
redirecting to some other pages using
response data redirect or whatever so
whenever we say like go to this page for
this kind of what I say input and after
that once we save it probably would like
to list all the information in the form
of grid for that to go to another page
so in that way we will be usually having
multi-page development as part of
server-side application but as part of
angularjs it is mainly concentrated
towards a single web page application
development so which means most of the
time or say
major content of your particular
application will be most likely to be
pushed into one particular page and you
will be using the same page just by
manipulating the Dom which means you
will try to remove bulks of data like
divs or other table tags whatever you
are going to use you just remove them
and replace with new dos so in that way
you will be working on the same webpage
most of the time however due to the
architecture of angularjs all you will
be doing is fetch the most important or
say the first master page first
something like index dot HTML and get
all the information into that and use
the Dom manipulation to remove all those
HTML elements whatever you are going to
have and just modify the elements and
modify the elements and modify the
elements based on whatever the
communication you are going to do with
the server so essentially there will be
only one page where you will be trying
to do all kinds of operations or what I
say information or data to be
transmitted to sold so in general if you
are familiar with Facebook page you can
see there will be only one page for a
Facebook however you will be seen that
you are trying to do everything on the
same webpage so like posting and even
you know marking or something or like or
whatever whatever the operations you are
going to do you are especially working
on one page so if you are trying to
develop that kind of page then angularjs
framework really suits your requirement
the next thing is provide solid
foundation for robust enterprise scale
JavaScript client-side applications so
till now usually whenever we develop any
kind of JavaScript not till now usually
who are familiar with server-side
development usually use JavaScript
especially to manipulate the Dom but
that we really do not think as
server-side developers like how much
JavaScript can be really pushed to the
client for which we can really have
robust or say enterprise client-side
applications to be developed so all the
server-side development what we have
done till today could also be pushed to
the client and we can say we develop or
we can develop client-side applications
as well which can almost what is a
compete with the server side of course
there are pros and cons here and there
whenever we choose only client side with
the server side but it is it is always
on case by case basis the next thing is
extensibility and customization so
angularjs is not like a black box
whenever we would like to have much more
additional plugins or additional
directives or additional components to
be added we can always make use of
angularjs framework so which means the a
default angularjs already comes with its
own tons of features on top of that we
can have our own features to be added to
the existing angularjs and make that
particular angularjs platform much more
suitable for our application development
so now that we have some understanding
an angularjs introduction let us see how
we can have a simple web page to be
developed which can have angularjs
straight into the web page and see how
angular JS really works what are all the
steps to really have angularjs on our
web page the first thing we need to have
angularjs
sorry angularjs file so whenever I say
angularjs so which means that entire
framework usually will be available in
the form one single file and called as
angularjs and that particular file can
be directly referred based on the URL
you can see here you can say this is the
URL which is available as part of
content develop for network so a content
delivery network so that is nothing but
CDN or you can download this angularjs
whatever the version you are going to
see locally and then refer that local
angularjs as part of your webpage so you
can use either this whole path whatever
we have seen here or you can download
that angular dis locally and just refer
that particular local
right here so can we either of these two
but importantly we should have angularjs
to be referred at the first place the
second thing is that we need to defend a
module okay so here is where our
angularjs really comes into picture so
after referring angularjs the first
thing we are going to see is angular dot
module so what do you mean by angular
module here
so a module first of all according to
the terms of angular is nothing but it
contains all the application logic to be
really used for our particular
application so all the application logic
which means all the controllers all the
models everything will be written or
will be part of the module you are going
to develop so one module contains
several components and each of those
components are self dependent and really
can work with server or communicate with
server so in simple the development of
angularjs application starts with a
module and a module is nothing but a
huge umbrella which contains several
application related components ok so the
simplest way to create a module is start
with angular and angular is the word
which you are going to get directly from
angularjs
so inside angularjs we have an object
called angular and we can use this
angular straightaway so if you don't
include angularjs at the top you will
not be able to write angular here so
once you have angularjs referred in the
previous statement next you can have
something like angular module so this is
a built-in which means you are trying to
create a module using the module
function and then provide the name of
the module so this is going to be sample
here in this case but you can provide a
bit in meaningful name for your
application so sample is the name of the
module I am going to create and you can
see there are two empty placards here so
this is pretty important here so
whenever you are providing the second
parameter it says that you are going to
create a module
if you are not providing the second
parameter you are saying that please
retrieve the module instance we might
have created already earlier somewhere
as part of our program so this is very
important if you are not providing this
you are trying to retrieve an existing
module called sample if you provide the
square brackets you are actually
creating a new module called sample and
what do you mean by square brackets for
now just forget it so we will be
covering what exactly is the square
brackets for now just simply consider
that in order to create a module give
the module name comma and just a pair of
square brackets so this essentially
creates a module called sample and that
module is nothing but an angular module
okay and once the module has been
created now we are going to have
something called ng dot app so you can
see what exactly is this ng dot app
first of all we should understand that
once angularjs is actually imported or
attached or referred as part of our
application it will be really searching
for this particular attribute NZ dot ng
- app a PP ng is a shortcut for angular
so angular application so in simple we
can say we need to have at least one
angular application related attribute as
part of our particular webpage so this
ng app could be available in at the HTML
of our body level or some deal or some
other element it is not essential to
have ng after we always be available at
HTML or body you can really have this ng
app to be made available at any level
and the first thing is that whenever
angularjs is included it tries to find
this ng - app it will really try to
figure out where is my angular
application defined and unless it's
really finds angular dot angular - app
or angular application related attribute
it cannot
proceed with any angular related
activities so it needs to see this
attribute in place and once it finds
this attribute then it knows all this is
the process or this is where I need to
start my magic this is where I need to
start my process so it will never
understand until an unlit is it finds ng
- app as part of our particular
development okay so the next thing is
that we are going to see sample so what
exactly sample here so sample is nothing
but whatever the sample we have created
so which is nothing but the module in
this case we are saying that angular
application our angular application
needs to be working closely with respect
to the definition available as part of
the sample module so which means you are
attaching your application directly to
the module itself and that module was
already created by you that is sample so
in this case the module really doesn't
have anything but an angular application
usually works with a module and in this
case we created the module called sample
and that is nothing but the root module
we are going to call it as okay so the
next thing is that usually we are going
to have only one angular application
attribute for page it is recommended in
that way but however there could be
situations whenever you would like to
have multiple angular application
related attributes to be made available
as part of web page but that is a
different story and we are going to
cover later on and another important
thing angular application attribute can
never be nested so which means I cannot
have another two here which will be
nesting as part of ng-app
there are workarounds for that one but
better to keep away from such kind of
what is not recommended practices okay
the next thing we are going to see these
kind of funny characters here or funny
expressions we are going to call that
kind of expression as an angular
expression so which means any kind of
content you provide in between two
braces two pairs of braces nested braces
we call that one as an angular
expression angular expression is nothing
but a JavaScript statement so it's a
simple code snippet of type JavaScript
you can provide any kind of JavaScript
code snippet here however that code
whatever we are going to write even
though it is called as JavaScript
expression or JavaScript code it can
never contain conditional statements or
loops so you are free to have some kind
of very simple expressions here but not
really very complicated expressions
which include if conditions or for loop
or why loop and so on so once we have
all of this in place so you can see like
I have angularjs which has been referred
then I created a module and the name of
the module is sample then I am saying
that my angular application starts at
body and it has to be linked with the
module itself which is fine for now our
module has nothing but whenever it sees
this kind of expression angularjs tries
to evaluate that particular expression
and places the result by replacing that
expression at runtime so in this case it
evaluates one plus two which is nothing
but three and that plus three will be
actually replaced by this entire
expression so wherever it tries to find
these nested curly braces - nestor -
curly pipes or braces it really tries to
evaluate it and once it evaluates it it
replaces this whole expression with the
result out of it so let us quickly
demonstrate this whole page on how it is
going to work step by step so in my case
I am going to use Adam here and I just
created empty folder called test so I'm
going to use this test folder for
developing my application so I just open
my Adam now I can say open folder so in
this case as I would like to have
everything under
test so I just would like to open that
one so I say test so currently there
exist no files inside the test
so I'll just right-click here and I'm
going to say new file and this is going
to be something like index dot HTML okay
right here so let me close this guy so I
have index dot HTML so the first thing
is that we need to have all the HTML and
the other stuff so I have the entire
structure HTML body title head
everything so let me save this so the
first thing is that I need to have the
angularjs to be referred so let us
quickly go through the CDN and see where
we can really find it so the simplest
way google angular CDN so just type in
that and you are going to see all the
hosted libraries by google which can be
directly referred as part of your web
pages and it actually I mean Google
actually maintains all of these so that
you can refer directly in your
applications jQuery and you know the 3x
core and dojo and so on but in this case
we are really interested only for
angularjs so let us click on that and
you are going to see the snippet so all
you have to do is just copy this script
and place right into your application so
in that way we are going to see the
first script so which means we are
referring angularjs so the next thing we
are going to have
so this is where I'm going to create our
module so the nothing but angular dot
module so the name of the module in this
case is going to be sample and as I
mentioned unless you provide square
brackets here you are not really
creating a new module if you do not
provide this it is going to be something
like this which means you are trying to
retrieve a module called sample which
might have been created somewhere else
in your application it tries to find a
module called sample so in fact as this
is the first statement you will not see
any sample module here so this is pretty
important so if you do not provide
square brackets you are trying to
retrieve an existing module so but in
our case we are trying to create a
module so we need to have the square
brackets to be provided so that's the
first thing next once the module is
created we need to attach that to a
particular angular application element
so in this case I would like to say like
body is my element of course it is not
compulsory you can also have something
like do and you can also mention do with
an NG app so you can provide in this
also but in my case DV is unnecessary so
I just wanted to provide something like
ng-app equals and any kind of angular
application usually will be attached to
a particular module in our case it is an
empty module however the name of the
module is sample I just provide that and
the next thing is that as I mentioned
you can provide any text so you can say
sum of two numbers that is 1 plus 2 is
and provide your angular expression so
the angular expression as I mentioned
will be having two braces at the left
and two places at the right so which
means whatever the expression whatever
the JavaScript expression you would like
to provide
has to be in between two
sets of braces so here I can provide
anything something like two so that is
it and let us see if this is going to
work clear up so we can just go to show
in Explorer and you can see we have
tests here so I just open it and you can
see index dot HTML is right here so I
can just double click it to directly
open using IE or Chrome or any of your
favorite browsers
so that is the default one I would like
to change it and now you can see this
three is actually the evaluation so even
if you see the paid source you are going
to see this one however this is being
evaluated at client-side there is
nothing coming from the server
everything is at client-side but still
this particular information or this
particular expression is still being
evaluated at client-side so that is
nothing really coming from the server
here so if you would like to change it
so something like I would like to have
10 and probably 20 here and again okay
just double click on this one and you
can see it is 30 here and not every time
it is going to be possible for you to
really work with what is a file based
execution of hets DML files imagine you
are trying to work with what is a server
based communications then usually we
need to have our hitch tml files or
JavaScript files to be hosted inside a
web server so you can use any of your
favorite web servers you can use I as or
Apache or whatever you would like to
have
so as my machine is a Windows machine I
configured my is in such a way that I
mean I installed is Express all you have
to do is just right click here on your
particular folder and I can say run is
Express here so this is the option I
created by myself and if you would like
to check on how this has been created
you can check my previous video on this
one on how to create or execute is
Express from your favorite folder so it
can really go after any particular
folder which could be you know directly
from the sea or I mean a root drive or
any of those particular nested folders
at the path you would like to go so for
now I would like to directly go with
test at the moment I click there you can
see I have run is Express here so I can
just say run is Express there
and you can see currently it has hosted
that one at HTTP localhost:8080 so this
is the configuration the default
configuration I made available the
moment I click on that option called run
is Express and if you'd like to
customize this again as I mentioned
please check my previous video so once I
have HTTP localhost 8080 which resembles
this particular folder I had to say get
this index.html
so again I open my Chrome and as part of
this I can say something like HTTP
localhost 8080 which is nothing but the
test folder so we are actually having
this test folder to be directly
represented using this particular HTTP
localhost 8080 and from there you can
just say index dot HTM and now you can
say that request has been made and all
of this verbose information will be
readily available for you but you need
not really pay attention to that just to
minimize it and all you have to do from
now is just modify this save it using
controllers and just refresh your
particular browser so the moment you
refresh it you can see you are always
getting the latest value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
