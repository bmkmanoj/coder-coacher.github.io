functions so let me create a new HTML
file and I would like to call this on a
0 for for now so let me start with in
button input type equal to button a
valuable to show and unclick I would
like to execute a function called a due
process I would like to send a couple of
parameters and I would like to have
another function called show difference
as a parameter so the point I'm making
is I am going to execute a function
called due process I'm going to send
three parameters to that one is 10 that
is 20 and another is a function itself
I am sending the definition of the
function you can see I did not put
another bracket here so if I do
something like this it is going to
execute this function on the spot so I
don't want that all I want to do is I
wanted to send the definition of this
one so in order to send the definition
you don't want to execute it so I remove
that so that is going to be the syntax
so let me start with some scripting here
so I would like to have a function so
the first function is going to be due
process so I would like to have it do
classes and it needs to accept three
parameters so I am going to have a comma
B comma do process later this is just
variable you can just put them in
anything like you know something like do
you can put anything and of course do is
a reserved word here so I can say do
later you can put any of those words
there
so essentially this is the one which is
going to contain the definition of this
particular function we haven't defined
this function so let us define that
function for now so I am going to say a
short difference and this is going to
have two values to be sent as parameters
so in this case I would like to have P
and Q and I would like to say something
like difference equal to P plus Q dot to
string so all I'm going to say here is
that this is the function which is
having a name showed if all in let me
put it a short diff okay so this is the
function name and I'm sending the same
function you are whenever you are
sending a function it sends this whole
part so you are sending this whole part
to this variable so which means this
particular variable will have this
entire definition but if you sand on
with this which means you are asking
this function to execute so which means
this function gets executed and just
alerts it and it is not going to send
anything here so it is very important to
note that the brackets are not necessary
whenever you would like to send the
entire function definition as a whole so
in this case I am sending show def so
which means this entire definition is
going to be sent to a variable called
the dual later
so this too later will contain this
entire definition okay now that we have
the function of the all whatever we need
I just wanted to have the sum to be
displayed so I would like to have a plus
B dot to string which essentially gives
me the sum so once it has completed the
sum then I would like to execute this
particular function whatever is
available inside the variable do lado so
the later is actually containing a
function definition in order to execute
this function definition using the
same variable all I had to use that is
just give available and have the
parentheses and as this is accepting two
values as parameter C or I need to send
two value c or two so in this case i
would like to send a comma B so which
means this a and B whatever I have been
received by this function or further
forwarded to show and show difference so
which means this 10 and 20 will be put
to a and B and the same a and B are
going to be sent to P and Q and finally
I am supposed to get the difference so
let me click this now I click show so
first I get some and the second I get
difference so this is what is called as
callbacks which means I call a function
and I'm saying that in return execute
again this function so I am sending a
function to execute as part of another
process which is supposed to be the
execution of another function so I call
a function and after completing the
process of this functions execution I am
just going to send another function
which is supposed to be called back and
executed so that is how is the callback
function so let us have another function
called show multiplied I can just put
any variable there any name there so in
this case m and n so I would like to say
something like the product of those two
values is going to be M star m and I am
going to sign it and now in order to
execute this I would like to have
another button and I would like to say
just another show it doesn't make what
we are going to see but in this case
again I would like to have due process
to be executed but instead of sending
showed if I am going to send show
multiplied so now what this one does is
we have some difference here I would
like to her 20 and 30 so no 20 and 30
will be sent to a and B and show
multiplied will be sent to do later
so do later now contains the definition
of this function and first sum will be
displayed that is 10 20 plus 30 which is
50 and then I am calling do later
so as this do later is containing the
definition of show multiplied it is
going to execute this particular
function so this function again as it is
having two values to be taken as
parameters I am actually sending a and B
so essentially values whatever it is
received by this function which are
nothing but 20 and 30 will be further
proceeded through do later to show
multiplied and there we are going to
have 20 and 30 where I am going to get
the product out of it it's a lightening
display this and the moment I click on
the show I get 50 and the other one is
600 so in that way I'm having both of
the functions to be executed in such a
way so let me do another example on this
so now I would like to execute in a
different way so this is 30 and 40 for
now instead of sending an existing
function like this I can actually send
an anonymous function directly so I can
say a synthetic function I would like to
say P comma Q and you can see I'm not
providing any name of the function here
it is an anonymous function and then I
can say this part of this function I
would like to say some something like
alert and difference and then I can say
P minus Q dot to string
yes so there is a possibility whenever
you would like to have a particular okay
I need to sorry this particular alert
statement is having so this is a
statement inside a function so I need to
have a semicolon here so that is
important so even though this is not
practical I just wanted to show you that
you can send anonymous functions as
parameters to other functions so which
means now do later or is going to have
this entire function definition and do
later whenever I call it in this fashion
you are essentially executing this
anonymous function so the point here
what I am trying to make is that you can
still have a particular anonymous
function to be written in place and you
can just send that entire definition to
available in the form of a primate or to
another function and get it executed
eventually so let me test this one again
and I click on another show so which is
going to be 70 and again the difference
is minus 10 so why there is minus 10 you
can see 30 minus 40 is essentially minus
10 so just to make some difference let
us have just another show so that I will
have the different buttons so again it
is going to show the same thing but all
I am going to have is just another show
which is going to give me 70 you the
same values difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
