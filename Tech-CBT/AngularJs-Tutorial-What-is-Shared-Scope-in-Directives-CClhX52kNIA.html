look at shade scope in angularjs
directives so let us see what exactly
shared scope first imagine I have some
markup related to angularjs and that
markup as you can see it has got a
controller attached to that and the name
of the controller is sample and that
particular controller is already having
a couple of bindings here like the value
of EA to be displayed from the scope and
B also to be displayed from the scope so
which means this particular element or
say this controller element is already
having some scope attached to it and
imagine that particular scope is having
two members called a and B those two
values are going to be automatically
displayed here and all of this
automatically happens as part of data
binding so the controller is going to
have the scope merged into it and that
particular element whatever we have in
place like the deal is going to maintain
the scope and you can always access or
modify the members inside the scope
directly using the controller itself and
all of these hubs I mean all of this has
been covered previously so there is
nothing much special about this one now
let us consider I am actually including
a directive so which means my particular
application has got a new custom
directive and the name of that
particular directive is message and
currently this particular directive is
trying to get the markup from this HTML
or whatever the file you might have in
place or your script base template or
whatever and that particular directive
is going to be instantiated and
displayed by providing that one at the
element level so right now it is being
used as an element level directive and
you can see do currently message so
whenever we say message here it actually
goes all the way down to this directive
gets the markup out of this URL and
replaces that right inside this and this
has also
been covered as part of custom
directives in my previous videos okay
now that we have in directive based
element to be used inside controller
element or for that say any other
angularjs element for that say which
scope is that going to axis by default
it is always going to access the scope
which has been defined at the parent
level or say in this case the controller
level so when I say it uses little H it
shares which means this directive
message or this element message is not
going to have its own scope by default
which means no scope will be created for
this development all it does is it
actually uses the existing scope which
has been already defined by its parent
controller it's a parent or controller
so in this case it just directly gets
the information straight from the same
scope where the parent has been defined
so we can say like if you are having the
controller with a scope and if you
define a custom directive with no scope
then automatically it uses the existing
scope that is it shares the scope of the
controller okay so whenever we say it
shares or or it uses it is pretty
important that if the values of those
members get changed it affects both
controller or the parent element or even
the directives as well so you might have
10 directives used here but as long as
those 10 directives are working with the
same scope if the value of the scope is
being changed by any of the directives
or even the controller it affects
everything
so wherever this scope is applicable and
if those directives are the elements are
using any of those members and as long
as the scope gets changed everything all
of the elements belonging to that
particular scope will be automatically
affected and as I mentioned the scope
modifications so if this is supposed to
be the scope modifications the scope
modifications can be happened
either from the controller so that is
using your own controller code or any
other child elements or nested elements
so that is important so as long as you
have the scope and if the scope is being
shared by any of the custom directives
we can say like all of those use the
same scope and can modify the same scope
which might affect uh everything else
okay let's jump into the code and see
what's going on okay I have a very
simple controller here so that is a
sample and you can see my markup is also
pretty simple right now it is
straightforward I have just one deal
with the attached controller called
sample so let me add a couple of members
to scope itself square I am going to
here say something like a value is B so
a value is 10 and the value of B is
going to be something like 20 okay and
now let me go back to the mark-up of a
zero one here and what I'm going to say
is from the controller perspective what
is the value of a so in this case I'm
going to say a so we need to braces here
in order to have the binding to be
happening so similarly B so we're just
trying to display the value of a and B
which automatically supposed to pull the
values from the scope a and B right here
so let me go to the browser and execute
a zero one and now you can see I have a
value is 10 and B value is 20 so let me
open my developer tools so that we can
work something around the developer
tools as well okay now let us actually
inspect this element a bit so I go to
that element and you can see it is
having its own scope so let me access
the scope directly of that element or
whatever I have selected here and once
you open it you can see the value of ID
is 2 so just keep a note of it the value
or the ID of
that particular scope is currently - and
it has got two members a and B which are
nothing but 10 and 20 respectively so we
are going to come back to this bit later
okay now it is time to actually add a
new what is a custom directive for us so
let me add something like a info - MSG
dot HTM oh okay so this is going to be
my custom directive and I do not want
any complicated code here so I just need
only one tail and I would like to have a
equal to the same thing whatever I
displayed earlier so B equals something
like this so this is a detector which is
trying to render the information from
the members a and B based on whatever
the scope it has been currently attached
to okay now how do I create the director
so that is just the mark-up not the
template so I need to have the directory
to be created so I am going to use the
deductive method and the name of the
directive in this case I just would like
to have message you can put whatever the
name you want in there so next I go to
function so as part of this all I'm
going to say is a return just the
template so in this case in for MHC dot
HTML that's it okay so now I created the
directive which actually works with this
template and that template is already
defined here okay now let me get get
back to my markup and I would like to
use the directives right here so which
means I would like to instantiate
whatever the director I mentioned or
develop the code here so I would like to
use this message and have something like
this
so that is actually nothing but you have
created a director and instantiate to
the detective and in this case it is
just only one so let me save this and I
just press f5 and now you can see the
detective is actually displaying the
values right from the template whatever
I have mentioned and the values 10 and
20 are also being pulled automatically
from its parent controller so let me go
and inspect that particular element so
which is nothing but this guy and let me
open the scope of whatever the selected
element I have in place and the moment I
open it you can see that ID is 2 and you
can see that is the same ideas of the
parent and it is using the same parent
and thus the same members a and B are
also available to the child so even if
you go and add something like one more
message ok let me give something like
this and let me do this so that is the
first directive instance and I am using
one more directive instance in this
fashion okay so I am just creating two
directive instances and this is this is
just the text so I created two directive
instances and let me refresh this okay
let me put one more bra BR at the very
end or HR so that we know the above one
is related to the controller ok so this
one is from the controller now let me
inspect this element and check the scope
the ID value is 2 for the controller
element itself and the members are a and
B with the values 10 and 20 respectively
so let me go to this element
so I click here and go to this element
hold on
so let me go to that element directly so
I have this okay so this is my element
that is message and let me clear and
again get the scope out of this and it
should be still showing the sames what I
say scope instance so you can see it is
still working with the same parent one
which is ID two and it has got the same
variables obviously because it is using
the same scope as of the parent and if
you go to the last one and again remove
this and get the scope out of the last
element still you are going to see the
IDS too which means it is still using
the parent one itself so in that way we
can easily understand like whenever you
have a directive created inside a
particular angular element by default it
tries to use the same scope as of the
parent okay now let us take this one to
next level that is I would like to have
some kind of lower ridings to be done as
part of my JavaScript so before even
going to the wall writings let me
actually modify a bit so the first thing
is that I would like to have what I say
a textbox to be created which actually
modifies the value of a so in this case
I would like to say something like this
input and let me have a two-way binding
here and okay let us see if that is
going to work okay now I just refresh
this all I did was just add add a
textbox with this message and that too
at the controller level not inside our
template level so it is at the bark up
and I mean it is in the mark-up of the
controller itself so let me press f5 and
now you can see the same value 10 is
being available in all of these
locations you have 10 here here here and
here
so
we'll let me modify this term and now
you can see how the value is
automatically being modified in every
instance or wherever this particular a
is being used so as we are working with
the same scope everywhere
the to be binding is going to modify the
value of the member variable ei inside
the scope and if the scope gets modified
it affects everywhere and that was what
I was mentioning so as long as you
modify this particular scope it is going
to affect everything else so let us have
another test box inside the detective
itself and see whether it is going to
affect everything else so I go to my
info dot message here and let me modify
this one a bit so in this case I am
going to say something like break tag
and let me save modify a input MZ modal
and let me put this so I'm having one
more so that is the same test box
whatever I have created in the parent
scope I am trying to create something
new here inside the template so as long
as the template exists the more number
of instances you create the more number
of text boxes you are going to get as
because this gets cloned for every
instance of the detective so I go back
here plus f5 and now you are going to
see the text boxes for each of the
instance of the detectives along with
the controller now let me modify this so
I select this and try to modify this guy
as well and I try to modify this and now
you can see it effects everywhere
including the text boxes including the
read-only what is the binding so all of
that is automatically being modified one
way of binding or two bindings wherever
they are available all of those are
being modified regardless of where you
are trying to modify the value of the
respective variable that is the scope
variable okay so now that we have seen a
bit about two-way binding and one-way
binding on how they are going to affect
the sheer scope let me concentrate a bit
more on the scope modifications which
might be done as part of the directives
itself so which means imagine I would
like to have more
more members to be added as far as the
directives on how they are going to
affect the parent as well okay so in
this case let us consider I would like
to jump to my a zero one here and I am
going to say I would like to have
something like a new method change value
B to be created so this is just a
function and the name of the function is
change value B here
and all I'm going to say is I would like
to have the value of B to be changed as
30 okay and now this is a function this
needs to be executed from somewhere so
for that purpose I go back to my markup
and right here let me add a button and I
would like to say whenever I click on
this button I would like to use the same
method whatever I have been writing
earlier and I would like to say
something like change value B okay so
whenever I click on this button it is
going to execute my particular function
which instead automatically modifies the
value of B from 20 to 30 so let us see
how this is going to affect I go back
here press f5 and now you can see I have
a button and the moment I click on this
button make sure that you have B value
as 20 B value as 20 and B value as 20
here and the moment I say change value B
I clicked on that and you can see B
value has been modified to 30 here 30
here and also 30 here so you can see
whether you modify that either in the
mark-up or at the JavaScript side you
are just modifying the scope itself so
the scope gets modified it gets affected
everywhere and let me do the same thing
even from our template perspective so
which means I would like to have the
same thing whatever I have in place so
let me take this whole thing the button
change value B as 1 so I go in here
now I place it in here and now it looks
quite obvious as because change value B
exists directly in the same scope where
it is sharing so it knows that it needs
to execute that so I go back here press
f5 and now you are going to see those
particular buttons coming out of the
template and get them instantiated and
attach it to the same scores of the
controller and the moment I click on
this one you can see it has modified
here here and even here okay
now let us go to the next level now I
modify the JavaScript in such a way that
the directive definition itself is going
to be changed which means I am going to
add a controller for the directive
itself and that is going to have
something like scope element and
attributes so I am trying to define my
own controller for the respective
directive so which means the director is
going to have some local controller and
right now it is going to receive the
source code and we know that by default
the same scope whatever we see in the
controller or the parent controller is
going to be always passed to this scope
so which means this scope is already
available here now I am going to add a
couple more methods to this one so the
first one is change value B okay and now
I am going to say scope dot be equal to
40 so this will be interesting what I am
saying is that I am going to define a
function called change value B and you
can see we already defined the same
function earlier in the parent one and
we are redefining the same function here
in the detector so what's going to
happen so this is pretty important this
scope is not local to the director you
are using the same scope as of the
paddle controller we
means you are changing this definition
with this one which means this is the
one which will be replaced completely so
which means you are you're not going to
have this one anymore
this gets completely replaced with this
one so I go back here press f5 okay I
have an error somewhere select me double
check on what's going on okay I need to
place a comma here so let me execute it
okay there you go so I have the change
value B and the moment I click on this
one you can see the value of B is 40
everywhere so that is important let me
refresh this again and now I click on
the parent one you can see where how to
pay 20 20 20 I click on the parent one
and still you can see it has applied 40
but not really thirty because even
though you are declaring change value be
inside the directive it is actually
affecting the same scope as of the
parent does replacing this whole
definition with this one so that is very
very important okay next let us consider
I am actually defining one more direct
order fit so which means I would like to
use the same template again but I call
this one as message to just for our
understanding and I'm using the same
template the same scope as at the parent
and now I am going to say this one as
550 so now you can see this also uses
the same parent scope this also uses the
same spirit scope so when the JavaScript
goes through this one it knows that you
know this has been defined here this has
been defined here and it also has been
defined here and we know that this is
actually going to replace this one and
not only that this is going to replace
whatever is available here at that
moment so initially we will have this
and that gets replaced with this one so
which means we can say now the scope dot
B is going to be 40
but whenever it come across this one
that 40 or this definition entirely
going to be removed and this one it will
be coming into the picture here so which
means it's not going to be 40 or 30 here
but instead it will be 50 so for that so
let me actually add one more director
here just for our understanding so I'm
going to say director too so let let
these be director ones and I would like
to call this one as directive two and
instance one and however I would like to
have the detective message to to be used
so let me have more gap here for this
guy okay so let me press f5 and now you
can see this is directed to and this is
director one directive one so you have B
value as 20 20 20 20 and you are going
to see like whenever I hit on this guy
you see the B value is 50 and you can
see 50 50 50 so that is important so
even if you go with any other button you
are going to see 50 everywhere else
so if you are modifying anything in your
controller or say directive controller
and if that is actually working with the
scope and as long as the scope is shared
with the parent controller you are
actually modifying the same scope object
and if the scope object is already
having that member earlier you are just
going to replace its value or the member
itself
