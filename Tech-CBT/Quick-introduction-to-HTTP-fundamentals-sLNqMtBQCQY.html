not have any understanding about HTTP so
in this video we are going to cover some
fundamentals of HTTP to have a very good
QuickStart on developing the server-side
web based applications so this could be
a good HTTP reference exclusively if you
would like to start asp.net MVC so as
part of this video I am going to cover
introduction to HTTP how HTTP
communication is going to happen what is
the difference between gate and post and
a couple of demonstrations using asp.net
on top of that I am also going to cover
HTTP monitoring tools
exclusively with respect to the browser
based developer tools and also fiddler
okay so let's jump in what exactly is
HTTP so HTTP stands for hypertext
transmission protocol or Transfer
Protocol what exactly do you mean by
hypertext so first of all this is very
similar to normal text but it has been
structured in such a way that it will be
having references or links to other
parts of the text if you are familiar of
the Wikipedia you can see any article in
the Wikipedia will have certain
references or links to other articles at
the same time so if you would like to
have such kind of text to be developed
you will be calling that one as
hypertext which means text with special
features and those features could be
displaying images styled and even
linking to other documents or other
hypertext files and so on so hypertext
is usually defined using HTT HTML
language so i HT M stands for hypertext
markup language
so this is the language we use in order
to have hypertext to be developed so we
use all those grammar or syntax and all
the options available as part of this
HTML and then we are going to develop
hypertext sometimes HTML alone may not
be enough and we can even have a
combination of other technologies which
includes CSS and JavaScript
so usually with respect to the latest
developments you can see HTML 5 plus
css3 and JavaScript together can give
you the best hypertext you could ever
develop so which means essentially web
page so the latest web page development
technology is mostly should be added to
the standards of html5 and CSS version 3
along with JavaScript and this
JavaScript could be based on ECMO secret
version 5 or 6 6 being the latest the
next thing is that what exactly is HTTP
so I covered hypertext but I haven't
covered the protocol first of all a
protocol is nothing but a set of rules
and regulations especially it has got
its own set of principles so we need to
have those rules to be followed in order
to accomplish certain tasks and pass
through that protocols a protocol means
definitely rules so these set of rules
are exclusively in need to transmit the
data across so whenever you would like
to have the data to be transmitted
across a wire or across a network there
are some set of rules to be followed and
all of those rules become part of a
protocol and HTTP is no difference HTTP
is nothing but a protocol which explains
certain set of rules in order to have
any kind of data to be transmitted
across the wire and in this case
whenever I say data to be transmitted
most of the time the transmission of
HTTP
transmission of data across HTTP happens
between servers and clients so if you
have a server which essentially could be
called as a web server so any kind of
web server will be hosting a set of web
pages so which means this server
essentially will be hosting a website
and that particular website can have
multiple web pages and you are going to
request any of those web pages from that
particular website by mostly using a
browser and the browser could be called
as a client client means the consumer so
this particular browser can be thought
of as a client which actually request
some information from the web server and
the web server will be returning that
information back to the client so that
client most of the time will be
happening in the form of a browser and
it could be also application store but
for now let us stick to the model like
any browser is a client and the browser
communicates with the web server in
order to fetch some information and web
server returns that information back to
the browser so in order to have this
kind of request and that kind of
response to be transmitted across the
wire or across the internet certain
rules need to be followed and all of
those rules are going to be defined as
part of H DTP protocol and discussion of
HTML CSS and JavaScript is just beyond
this the scope of this particular module
so you can find more information at
these particular places for learning
more about HTML CSS and JavaScript I
forgot to mention this particular HTTP
whatever I am talking about is really a
part of existing tcp/ip protocol so
which means this is the parent protocol
this is also called as a network
protocol so this particular protocol
internally will have HTTP so essentially
we can say HTTP is a child protocol of
tcp/ip which essentially behind the
scenes
works with the tcp/ip protocol and again
I am NOT going to cover tcp/ip in this
hour concentration will be completely
with respect to HTTP as part of this
module next let us think more about HTTP
communication so now that we have some
understanding about HTTP which is
nothing but a set of rules what happens
during the communication or how the
communication happens so let us see
imagine I have a web server server
observer
Azzam and this is a particular server
which will be holding hosting multiple
websites one or more web sites so each
of the web sites will have multiple web
pages and the client can actually access
any of those web pages from any of the
web sites by directly going to the
respective web server so as I mentioned
a web server can have multiple web sites
hosted in it and now I may have a client
so in this case I am considering a
client as a browser and it could be an
application or a mobile app or anything
else but for now let us consider we are
working with a browser and now browser
is considered as a client and the web
server will be continuously listening
for the requests so the job of a web
server is to listen for any kind of
requests from the client from any client
for that matter so the only thing it
does is it continuously listens for
requests and imagine now a request has
been sent from the client to the server
so which means that particular client
whenever it needs some information is
going to get in touch with the web
server and pass a sarah quest and now
this particular web server will be
actually forwarding that request to the
respective web site based on whatever
the you are the client or the browser
has son
so if that particular browser sends any
URL which is trying to set some
information from website one the whole
request will be forwarded to website one
so as I mentioned accepts the request
and the redirects are far worse that
particular request to the respective
website now the client will be simply
waiting for this particular web server
to return back with some information so
this client now will be waiting for the
response from the web server as because
it has already forwarded a web request
and now web site is going to process the
data so the request has been pause I
mean the request has been sent to the
website and now web site will be doing
its own process to complete that request
that could be fetching from the database
or fetching from text file or doing some
other process and so on so this
particular website is going to be
responsible to passes that particular
request whatever the client has sent and
once that particular processing has been
done the result is returned back through
the web server back to the client now
you can see the web site process data
which has been complete and the next
step is web server receives reply so the
web server receives a reply from the web
site and it is going to be the
responsibility of the web server to
actually send that information back to
the client and now the client has
received the reply so which means based
on the request it has sent the website
has passes or the data and returned that
particular data to the client through
the web server and now the client has
received the reply and once it has
received the reply that particular reply
is going to be shown in the form of a
web page or we can say displays results
on the client surface so this is the
very basic understanding on how the
communication happens between a client
and a web server
using HTTP protocol so this is just an
overview in general and again so this we
are sending a request and you know that
we are also getting a reply from the web
server back to the client and there is
certain terms for which we need to
understand here and both of them are
usually called as messages so the
message which is actually being passed
from the client to the web server is
usually called as a request message and
a particular message which is being sent
back from the web server to the client
is usually called as a response message
so the communication always is going to
happen in the form of messages in
between a browser or a client and the
web server so in simple terms client and
the web server exchange to communicate
each other only through messages and the
message from the client to the server is
always going to be called as a request
message and the opposite which actually
happens from the web server to the
client is called as a response message
so let us deep into the request message
so as mentioned we still have the same
diagram we have the client and the web
server they exchange messages and now we
are going to concentrate on the request
message and that particular request
message usually will have any URL
requests head or HTTP request method and
content data so let us see one by one so
you are so we should be certainly
familiar about this it contains the
domain to which it needs to connect to
and the path to the respective web page
like you know default web page or login
web page or something of that sort
it might even have some kind of query
strings or a string in the sense
anything other than the web domain and
the path to the web page if you are
sending some parameters like you know
login user ID or you know something like
paging first page page two page four etc
all of those will be part of career
strings so which means some kind of
parameters to that particular page you
are requesting so all of those will be
usually part of Evaro
so the next one is request headers so it
contains browser information cookies if
available authentication information and
other information so which means the
browser information will also be sent
back to the web server like what browser
you are using what version is that is it
a mobile browser or a desktop browser
what kind of operating system you are
you are currently on date and time and
all that information will be sent back
to the web server in the means sent to
the web server as part of the same
request message and cookies whenever you
would like to have any kind of login
information to be recent back to the web
server so you logged in to a website and
you are requesting more and more pages
from the same website you don't want to
relock in every time for the request so
it needs to have some information to be
stored at the client which will be
reused while requesting more and more
information from the same website that
reusing of that particular client
information which is stored at the
client is nothing but a cookie and that
cookie is going to be sent across the
wire for successful and progress a
request over the time so authentication
information as I mentioned if each of
those requests are supposed to be
authenticated it can contain some
authentication information which
includes user ID and password and so on
and it might even have other request
information based upon how it has been
implemented and HTTP method so usually
these are all the types of methods we
can have like
get post put delete mods and so on
usually most of the time people are
going to work with the gate and post and
more and more about put and delete later
but for now we are going to concentrate
and get and post
so get is going to simply request using
URL and will not have any kind of data
to be sent as part of the request body
so the request body is not going to have
any data except the URL so that is what
is called as get and post is very
similar to get except that you are going
to send some data back to the I mean
back to the server so whenever you have
some kind of data which needs to be sent
to the server you are going to call post
and so which means it is still going to
be the request message however the type
is going to be called as posed as
because you need to send some data along
with this information and the last one
is content and data as I mentioned the
data whatever you are going to send from
the request so usually the data is
signed whenever you are using the HTTP
method as forced or put and it is sent
as part of a request body so usually we
will be having the URL request header
request type and then the request body
that particular request body is
contained will contain data if you are
using the HTTP method as post or put
next comes response so as we have seen
that a quest message let us dig more
into the response message so again the
same diagram we have the request passing
this way but the response is coming from
the web server to the client so we are
going to concentrate on the response
message now so the response message
again contains two parts in general the
headers and the data the headers again
can contain the Kitsch TTP response code
cookies Thai size etc so HTTP response
code is something like a standard and
open chord which essentially gives some
kind of status message back to the
pointer for example response code 200
which means this request has been
successful so in order to say that this
request is successful it is going to
send a code like 200 back to the client
for example you are requesting for some
information which is not available at
the web server now it is going to
respond back saying that 404 is a code
for 0 4 so which means that request is
not being that request is unable to be
handled as because that information is
not found at the server so in that way
we have several HTTP calls which
essentially let the client know about
the status of its previous request so
the response message first of all always
contains the response code on top of
that if this server is going to send
more information back to the client to
be saved essentially for future requests
that is called a cookie so for example
if you'd like to send any kind of user
ID information back to the client so
that the same information can be reused
while the request or successor requires
it could be used so for that purpose the
server can send some cookie information
back to the client
we're flying behind the scenes will be
working with temporary internet files
folder where all the cookies for that
website will be getting stored up on top
of that it also contains content type so
content type usually it could be HTML or
image or a zip file or anything else so
what type of information is being sent
from the server to the client is nothing
but content type and the next thing size
that particular response message size
which means how much of information or
how much of data in the form of bytes
are going to be sent from the server to
the client even that information may be
available and it might have more
information other than the top 3 on top
of that it can contain the data so this
is very important
apart from the rest the data which is
supposed to be received by the client
and then shown to the user is going to
be called as content or data usually the
result whatever we get from the web
server for a typical web page will
always be in the form of HTML as I
mention hypertext markup language so
that is the HTML format or the data or
the information which is going to be
sent from the web server back to the
client and the browser is going to
understand that his tml it is going to
execute the HTML and that is how we are
going to see a web page and whenever I
call content or data it is going to be
usually part of a response body so a
response header and response body
together frames a response message so if
the web server is going to return any
kind of web page that particular web
page content is going to be sent in the
form of HTML which is a plain text on
XML together and that information is
going to be executed as part of the
browser as browser receives that entire
HTML and after executing that HTML the
result is what the web page the user is
going to watch
and let us say a couple of things or a
demonstration of all this get post and
everything typically for a particular
web server you can use IAS or no jails
or Express or whatever but we have
various waves in order to in order to
have a particular web server to be
hosted and how the website and the web
pages and everything but for now I am
going to use typical asp.net application
using visual studio where visual studio
itself will be hosting its own web
server whenever you press your file
which means execute or debug so during
the debugging of your asp.net
application visual studio hosts a
temporary IES server or a web server and
using that particular web server the
browser is going to communicate so the
browser will be requesting some
information to that web server and the
web server job is to actually process
the request and return back the response
so all of that we are going to say as
part of this demo and I am also going to
demonstrate get and post and not to
mention and not starting asp.net MVC in
this session but we are just going to
use a spit out an application for now
and on top of that we are going to have
browser-based
HTTP tools to be covered a bit using any
of these IE or fire Firefox or Chrome or
something at the top of that we are
going to have some fiddler some of the
tool called fiddler which is going to be
essential as for any developer
so this is Visual Studio community 2015
so I'm going to create a new project in
this case I am going for a visual studio
project and a web-based project called
asp.net web application I can select my
own folder whatever you would like to
have and this is going to be the project
name and this is going to be the
solution name so in this case I can say
first project and I can say this one as
first solution so you can type in
anything whatever you would like to have
click OK and now it is going to ask me
whether I would like to go for web forms
based asp.net application or enemies
your Web API or others but for now I
would look I would like to go for Mt so
that you know I can provide my own
information or my own pages in whatever
the way I want it and ensure that their
forms is checked in for now
as because I would like to use web fonts
base D allows to be used with this empty
folder which means empty template if I
select empty template no styles or no
default web pages will be added
everything will be added on my own if we
select anything else some default
templates with some bootstrap and jQuery
and other stuff will be automatically
added so for now I go with empty no
template and the forms based dll's and
the technologies to be added by default
as part of the project and if you need
any integer project you can just switch
it on for now I am NOT going to do that
let's click OK
okay so this is my solution and I have
the project here and let us create a new
web page so I right click here and go
with add and now I can say new webform
or new item anything so for now I would
like to go for waveform so I can just
provide whatever the name I would like
to provide here so far in this case I
would like to say something like sample
zero one so that is going to be the name
of the waveform I would like to call so
now you can see within the project you
are going to say sample zero one dot
aspx so you can see this is the
hypertext I was talking about so this is
the structure where I am going to have
all the HTML based stuff to be written
and half of that I can provide whatever
the information I would like to say so
like you know this is my first web page
so I can just write something like this
and now whenever you would like to
execute and test this page you can use
the options available here so by default
Firefox is selected for me but you can
have other browsers like Google Chrome
or Internet Explorer or whatever you
would like to choose from so I would
like to select google chrome for now and
the moment I click on this you need to
work watch what are all the things
happening here as well so the moment I
click on here you can see it has started
building and at the same time you can
see a tiny thing has come out and it
says is X was so which means a web
server has been kicked in and if we
click on that I mean if you right click
on that you can see that particular web
server currently hosted my web site at
this location
so whatever the web page I developed
that entire web site has been hosted
right here temporarily so in future you
can move it to any other web server and
then make it public but
now as this is development environment
Visual Studio is smart enough that it
needs to actually kick in a web so
instantiate it and then deploy our
website at certain location and expose
the port member so that we can actually
access something from there and if you
switch back to the browser you can see
it is being using the same port number
whatever is available as part of is X
plus so you can say four nine three five
five here the same thing is being used
here so essentially the browser is
actually requesting the web page sample
zero one day at aspx which has been
hosted at this web server so and now you
can see this is the output I got which
is nothing but the response I received
from the web server and you can see this
is nothing but whatever I typed in
earlier and that is what is being
responded back imagine I would like to
make this much more fashionable so which
means more structure more informational
with some kind of you know they say
emphasis on first for example I would
like to make it strong or italic or
whatever you can make all of that so you
can stop it for now the debugging
information and now I can say something
like strong so which means what I'm
saying is that I would like to have the
name first to be in border and the page
so I would like to say the page in
italic
so let me execute it again
and now you can see first is in bold and
pages in italic and whatever this strong
and I those are part of HTML hypertext
markup language so you need to learn
HTML in order to learn all of these
particular elements or markup related
elements so now that we have this let us
see what is get here I didn't see any
cat information I could not see any
request information and I could not see
any response information but in my
previous slides I mentioned you are
going to say request response messages
going through the server or getting back
to the client and so on so all that
information you can really troubleshoot
or view using developer tools so the
developer tools from chrome perspective
you can always get them using this and
you can say more tools and then you can
say developer tools so the moment you
say that you are going to see all the
developer tools right here so the other
easiest way just press f12 on your
keyboard
and you are going to see all the tools
right in there so for now I am going to
actually dock it at the bottom and you
are going to see various parts of your
particular developer tools and you can
see the network information so let us
start from here so the moment i refresh
a page or for the first time and typing
something here like I remove this and I
say aspx or something and press Enter
so you can see there's a lot of things
or a lot of communication happening as
part of the network the most important
thing is this guy so let us forget about
everything else as because rest of
things are being used by Visual Studio
internally but the most important thing
is only this guy let us concentrate on
this one as because that is the request
you
which is really the one which is
requested by you the rest are for visual
studio so forget about the rest so let
us click on this guy for a second and
now let us look into headers you can see
I have a request URL so you can see this
is the request message I mean this whole
part is a request message and this whole
part is really the response message and
as part of the request message you can
see I have the URL and the request
method is get and in response the
response code I was talking about is 200
which means the server said yes
everything is fine the request is
successful and I'm here it is what I'm
sending the response those that is the
status code it is going to send it and
as part of the response you can say it
is saying like the content type it is
going to send the text which will be in
the form of HTML the length or the size
of the data it is going to send which is
seven nine to something and what is the
server and all the respect to
information and more about the request
message is going to be available here so
which means it says like currently I am
using this kind of a browser and at the
same time all the respect information
like what kind of language I'm using as
part of the browser and the respect to
information so all that request
information will be sent to the server
and in return as part of the response
the server is going to send the status
code and all the response information
back so the more information or exactly
the response what it is getting the body
the response body is not available here
it is just only the headers the response
body can be seen here so you can see the
server has actually returned this
information back so this is what in
general this whole thing is exactly what
the browser has sent to our sorry the
server has sent to all browser
so our browser has received this entire
information from the server and now our
browser has executed this or interpreted
each of these particular tags and
finally I could see the web pages in
this fashion so it is not just this one
alone for example let me clear
everything first so even before going
anywhere houses so this is the one you
can use to clear all the network related
requests here let us type in something
yahoo.com okay and now you can see it
has really got plenty of requests and
really really lot and you can see all of
this information and the status code and
what type of information it is sending
from where how much size how much time
it this one really took for the request
and so on all that information so all of
this stuff is really sent from the
server to the client and all that
information is actually available
through the developer tools in order to
show what's going on so the same kind of
information you can also see from
Firefox so let me open Firefox for a
second so I have a tool called Firebug
installed and current weight is
deactivated but let me execute my
particular application using Firefox and
just press yes I click on that in order
to show me the Firefox here and now I
have it here so let me press f12 and the
moment I press f12 you can see it has
actually opened a Firebug so what is
this Firebug so this is an extension or
an add-on you need to install after
installing firefox so for chrome
developer tools are automatically built
in what five five
firefox you still have the developers
automatically made available but this is
more intuitive and has more options than
the default developer options which
comes with Firefox so in order to
install this you need to go in here
click on add-ons and search for Firebug
and the moment you search for Firebug
for example you are going to see that
and just say install so in my case it
has been already installed so that is
the reason it gives the option remove
and disable but in your case if you have
not installed it might look Firebug here
and you are going to see an install
option so the moment you install it it
is going to be made available here so
even this one will be similar to
whatever the network or the developer
tools were might have seen as part of
Cajon so if you click Network here for
example in this case it is disabled so
let me enable it and now let me request
this and now you can say forget about
the rest of the requests concentrate on
this one and you can see the first
request here is actually get request so
if you open down you are going to see
all the headers the request header what
it is sending and you can see now I
don't see Chrome it is actually sending
Firefox as part of user agent or the
browser information and this is the you
are over so you are ok the URL itself is
this guy in this case you can see it has
put in all that stuff right at the top
so all the request information is going
to be made available here and the
response information is here you can say
response headers like what type of
information it is sending back how much
is the content and so on
and on top of that the real response or
say the body of the response is
available here so which is exactly what
it has sent earlier and now the browser
has received this response the body and
the body is interpreted and finally
we are seeing that here in the form of a
back page so the same thing I can also
see using or solving the same thing I
can also see using Internet Explorer so
I can select this and click on run now
you can see you how sample zero one
sample and you can also get after all
and the moment you press you're going to
see the information just play around
with this okay now let us jump into
fiddler so let me close everything
whatever I have here and for now I
switch back to Chrome and now in order
to install fiddler first so let me give
some information on where to install
fiddler so you type in FI DD le R and
this is the first thing you have the
fiddler from telluric you go in here you
click on that and you can say free
download and the moment you say free
download it is going to give you the
options like which version you can
install as long as you have Visual
Studio 2010 or above you are already
having dotnet framework for so you
better go with this one but if you don't
have that kind of version so probably
you can go with this option but again
you should have dotnet framework already
installed most of it by now should have
been already on your machine so you can
use either of these two options and that
essentially gives you the fiddler to be
installed on your machine so once it has
installed which is as simple as
installing winzip it is very simple so
after installing fiddler you are going
to see that particular fiddler to be
made available as part of this and the
moment you click on that
it is going to bring up fiddler and this
is the environment of fiddler first of
all fiddler is a kind of HTTP monitoring
tool so any kind of communication
happening through HTTP protocol will be
automatically trapped and listed here so
you can act and more information of
every HTTP communication happening from
your system using this tool called
fiddler it can also be called as HTTP
monitoring tool and we have various and
various options and very in-depth
options to really try to troubleshoot
each and every particular HTTP request
so let us try it with our own existing
solution and I executed and now I am
requesting a web page and it has
resulted output so let us switch back to
fiddler and now you can see all the
requests which have been through that
have been made available here so let us
not focus on everything else but let us
just focus on this one which is
essentially nothing but what you have
asked or went through the HTTP request
so in this case I select this and now
you can see all the statistics of
information that how many bytes have
been sent how many bytes have been
received as part of the request and more
and more what is a performance related
information all that stuff and the very
important thing for the developers is
going to be inspectors so actually go to
the inspectors here it is going to show
you what kind of request is that is it a
get or a post and what is the request
URL and if it has got any query string
or whatever and request header sending
what information like you know I am
currently saying that it is using Chrome
and so on and on top of that the above
top is about request and the bottom part
is about the response so whenever you
get this message just say click here to
transform just
con that so the bottom panel is going to
show you the response but the top part
is going to show you about the requests
so usually my favorite is go with raw so
that you can realize exactly see on what
kind of information is going to the
server in a very raw format so this is
what is going to be sent to the server
and now in the response you have the raw
option here as well as if you click on
that this is exactly what I received
from the server back to the browser it
includes the response header and the
response body so the response body is
the one which is being interpreted by
the browser in order to show the
information in the form of a web page to
the user and the response header
contains the status code which is 200
and on top of that the type of the
content the size of the content and the
other related information so this is a
very very important tool exclusively for
the developers to really troubleshoot
each and every particular HTTP request
which is going to be communicating
between the client and the server ok so
let me clear everything so in order to
clear everything in just click on here
and say remove all all the information
will be lost so now that we have
completed something related to the get
request let us see how it really works
so let me click we add a new web page
something like sample zero two and now
you can see this is my new page and I
would like to have a text box and a
button in this case so I would like to
have a test box where the user will be
typing in some information and in this
case I would like to name the test box
as text message that is the name of that
particular ID
I mean element and now I am going to
have a button
and I would like to say something like
button sure whatever on top of that I
would like to have a label so which is
nothing but I am going to call it as a
label message and for now no info yet so
this is the default label so if you
switch back to the design you can see
how the webpage is supposed to be
looking
whenever you fetch from the web server
so I'm going to have a text box I am
going to have a button and then a label
so if I wanted to have this button to be
made in the next line so for now I just
wanted to give something like BR tag so
that you can see the button is going to
be made in the next line sorry this is
supposed to be but I'm sure that is nee
that is the ID and in this case I just
wanted to put the caps not show so that
you can see I have a show here I have
the test box and I have the label so my
goal is that I will be typing something
here and click on show which essentially
get that information whatever I typed in
and showed in the form of a label so
this information need to be replaced
with the content type I put inside this
test box so for that I need to write
some asp.net code in this case so I
click on show and I am going to say LBL
message dot text equal to txt message
dot text so essentially what I am saying
is that I am trying to fetch the
information available inside this
particular test box so that Xbox is
being identified with the name
txt message safety switch back txt
message dot txt I am saying that please
get the entire text information whatever
the user has typed in inside this text
box get that information and he is
signed to the text property of the label
so you have the label with this
so I am saying that has signed that one
by replacing whatever you have in here
so this will be replace you can see text
this will be replaced with whatever you
are actually fetching from here so let
us quickly execute it and see if it is
working fine so let me close the
previous one so this is the default
information what I could see and now I
would like to say hello world and I
click show and there you go that exact
information whatever I have typed in has
been actually placed into the label the
moment I click on show let us try once
again hi and it looks show and now you
can see I got higher so okay so let us
start from the beginning and observe
whatever the get request and our water
on the post Rick what's happening as
part of this simple application so let
me open the developer tools for a second
and now let us start from the very
beginning
now I type everything here and press
enter and this this is treated as the
first request to the server the moment
you type in enter here it is treated as
the first request to the server which
means that will be refreshed as if it is
a first request to that particular
webpage and now you can see sample 0 2
dot aspx request
forget about rest of the 4 we don't need
to concentrate on this let us consider
on this one alone so let me open that
and you are going to see what kind of
response we are getting out of it and
you can also see like how it has a
transform the our particular but text
box and the button and the label so all
the asp.net controls have been clearly
modified and sent back in the form of
pure HTML elements so that is pretty
important to know anyway so let me
refresh that once again
let me click on that and I get the
response and now you can see I have the
label which is no info yet you can see
that and I have the text box and the
show button and everything so I have the
get request happening so let me clear
everything here and also observed the
same things from the fiddler as well so
again I cleared everything i refreshed
it which is a get request I click on
here let us go through the headers you
can see this is a get request and it is
200 so let us go to a fiddler click on
here and let us go to raw and click on
here if it is asking for something and
make sure it is right as well it is a
get request and swallow and I have
sampled 0-2 and I have all this
information from the server along with
the status code 200 so for just for
clarity let us remove everything else
except the first one which is get now
let us switch back to the browser and
type in some information hello and click
show so let me clear everything or let
is not clear let me click show okay and
now you can see this is treated as a new
request and at the same time let us
click on this guy and see what's going
on
so this is our request and the first
important thing it is a post it is not
get anymore it is a post so which means
a post request has been made to the
server and the URL is same and the
server responded it 200 which is
successful and on top of that the
response headers all we have all of
their stuff and request headers this is
something important we should have and
as part of the request body you can see
we are actually sending the information
to the server
so we are saying that txt message which
is nothing but the text box is actually
sending the information hello to the
server so as part of the post method we
are going to have some kind of data
which needs to be sent to the server and
that data is a request body and that
request body is exactly what we are
seeing here so in this case it is
sending the text box and even the button
let us not concentrate in button but let
us concentrate on the test box so the
text box identified with the txt message
is currently having a value of hello
with a couple of dots and this entire
information is going to reach the server
and once the server has processed it it
is going to send back the response and
the response body you can see I have the
label with a different value called
hello so this is the response I received
from the server back so let us switch
back to the fiddler and see what's going
on so as I said let us not worry about
rest so this is the second request this
is the first request you can see it is
type get let us click on here you can
see it is type post and the get the same
URL we sort of get in the second request
I am actually having it as post and let
me click on that for more understanding
and on top of that you are going to see
all of the information whatever is going
to be sent to the server and let us see
if there is anything special okay and
now you can see somewhere the text
message and how it is really being sent
from here to here so txt message so this
is the textbox ID and how the message
which is going to be sent to the server
as part of the request and in side of
the response you can see I have hello
but if you switch back to the previous
form and go to the response and
in here you can see the label is
actually knowing for yet but in the
second request which is a post that
response has given something different
so this whole thing is being interpreted
and given in a different way so let us
do it again so in this case I would like
to say hi drag and click show and now
you can see I have hijack in the label
so if you switch back to the response
here you can see I have hijack in the
label and from the request headers and I
started the request body you can see
that request is actually sending this
information and if he sits back to
fiddler and concentrate on the third
request you can see this is still post
post means you are sending some
information to the server and what kind
of information you are sending you're
sending this whole thing this whole
thing is the head over and this is the
body and as part of the body you can see
now you are actually sending txt message
follow the XT message hijack so this is
exactly what you are sending to the
server and now the server has responded
of this response message which includes
the response header and the response
body now the response body is having
hijack so that completes our
introduction to HTTP communication along
with you know get and post kind of
methods the information on how the
browser is sending to the server the
request message which contains request
header the request body and how the
server is sending back the information
to the client in the form of a response
message which includes a response header
and response body the response body in
in all of the cases we have seen now is
actually working in the form of HTML
with the updater content based and
information posted by the user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
