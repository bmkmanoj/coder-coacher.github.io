look at evaluating angular expressions
using dollar eval dollar pass and door
interpolate and also understand the
differences between them so let's jump
directly into the code first so imagine
I have a simple HTML page in this way so
the header is going to have all the
necessary Java scripts and styles to be
imported like the jQuery bootstrap and
angular there and on top of that I am
also importing a zero one dot J's which
looks something like this so as of now
all I'm having is just a simple module
and just a controller with the dollar
scope already injected and of course I
do not need this stuff so let me remove
this one so dollar scope is already
injected at the moment and you can see
I'm using the same controller sample
right here so we have the deal and we
have ng app we have the controller
everything in place now let me quickly
add a couple of scope variables so in
this case I would like to go with scope
dot a equal to 10 and again dollar scope
dot be equal to 20 so which means we
added two variables or say two members
to the scope itself which can be
accessible directly in your review
template or even in your JavaScript as
long as the scope is available so I can
quickly check whether a and B are really
being data bound here by just writing
something like a equal to a and at the
same time B equals B so in that way I am
trying to display the value of a and B
so let me see if this is working so I
need to go to localhost at a zero one
dot HTML and now you can see I got both
a with the value 10 and B with value 20
okay so now let us have one more
expression something like
a star B to be calculated and if you
just write a star wait just displays a
star B as we know data binding does not
really apply here it just displays a
star B but my opinion here is that I
really want to have something like a
star B to be really calculated also
evaluated so whenever you put inside
these braces which means you are saying
that this expression a star B needs to
be evaluated based on the current scope
object attached to that one so I can
also say something like the result or
whatever so this is just a caption so
this whole part is a caption however
this expression is called as an angular
expression and that angular expression
is going to be evaluated at runtime by
the angular JS framework itself so
whenever I say a 5 here now you can see
we are actually getting result equal to
200 so which looks fine so now let us go
back here now I would like to have
something like this alert and in this
case a result and now if I say something
like H star B this is not going to work
because you can see a means it doesn't
know what is e a so we need to specify
something like scope dot a into scope
dot B so that can be achieved something
like this scope that a star and dollar
scope dot B so this is the way actually
we can make our scope to be useful here
as because you are trying to access the
members of the scope so you will need to
be very specific so whenever I do this
now we are going to have the alert to be
displayed which is fine now let me
actually try to execute this alert
statement using a button so I would like
to have something like scope dot demo
equal to function so I'm just trying to
have a function to be defined under the
scope and I would like to have this
particular function to be executed as
part of a button so I would like to
introduce a button right here and
let me put in HR and I am going to say
button and as part of the button I would
like to say something like demo so this
is that that is just a caption and now
upon click I would like to have the demo
function available inside the scope to
be executed so let me go back here and
let me press f5 and the moment i say
demo you can see we got the result as
200 so still we are not using any of the
eval or pass or interpolate we are still
fine without really using any of those
but now imagine I would like to have
whatever the expression I gave so
something like this I need to have this
expression to be directly calculated or
evaluated in the JavaScript but not real
in the markup so I just wanted to copy
this expression and I go in here so just
let me comment this guy now the moment
if I say result plus and if I put this
we pretty well know that this is not
going to work why because a and B
variables are not available those are
available as part of scope so you are
not referring to scope here and this
this will not be displaying anything so
let us go back here and just press f5
press f5 and click on demo and now you
can see it might be throwing some arrows
here so you can see a is not defined so
similarly you know B will also be
providing the same error saying that B
is not defined so you are trying to
access available without really
referring to the scope even though it
belongs to that scope now I do not want
to provide the scope here but at the
same time I would like to have a store B
to be evaluated so for that purpose we
can use a dollar evaluate and I can say
please evaluate this expression and this
expression needs to be provided in the
form of a string
so what I am saying is that please
evaluate a star B however this a star B
needs to be evaluated based on the scope
and dollar eval is a particular method
or a function available inside dollar
scope so you need to use dollar scope in
order to use dollar eval so if you write
dollar evil without dollar scope is not
going to work and at the same time it is
very important to understand that dollar
eval works not just or not JavaScript
expressions but it works with angular
based expressions so which means it
tries to evaluate and execute those
expressions whatever you might be
providing in the form of strings
attached to the scope so it is smart
enough like whenever you provide a it
has to be scoped that EA if you provide
be it will be scoped dot B and at
runtime it knows that this whole
expression needs to be replaced right in
here and execute it and give me the
result out of it so this actually gives
me the result out of it so let us save
this or you can also place this in a
variable if you would like to have
something like s equal to something like
this you can put whatever probably are
so that might seem better and I can just
display the value R so let me go here
and press f5 and now I say demo and now
you can see I have the result with 200
so that is pretty important which means
whenever you have a store B or any kind
of expression you provide here that will
be evaluated against whatever the scope
you are mentioning here aligned with the
dollar a well method okay now that we
have some understanding about dollar
eval so let me comment that whole thing
and now let me go to the next level now
I would like to have the same evaluation
of expression using evaluation which
looks fine however I would like to say
something like start 3 is that even
possible yes it is so it is not just
only the angular expressions so for
example you might even be having some
like this score blood EMP equals an
object and inside the object you might
be having some other object like what is
the address and inside the address I
might be having something like city so
you can have all of this stuff directly
by just referring the evaluation so if
you have something like this and imagine
I would like to have what I say employee
name as well and in this case I would
like to say drag so this is a simple
object and you can still evaluate that
expression directly using you are so
sorry I'm going beador so let me see if
this is working fine so I would like to
have a valuation of this expression
called EMP dot e name and that is still
valid so let me go to alert and R so
just would like to have the e name to be
displayed and I go back here or press f5
and the moment i say demo you can say
got Jagga so it's just returning by
evaluating that expression so similarly
I can still say I go to address and pick
me the city directly from the current
scope so in this case it has to display
Austin so the moment I press f5 and demo
here you can see it is displaying Austin
so it is not just only the calculation
of expressions it really evaluates that
scope related expression I - an angular
related expression with the current
scope okay so let me not focus on this
one anymore so let me go back to
whatever I have here so this is still
valid in this case what it does is it
actually multiplies a with B which is
200 into 3 which becomes 600 so this is
still valid so let me go back here and I
just wanted to say a alert R so I go
back here press f5 demo and you can see
is 600 is still there no issues now let
us consider I am providing something
like C in this case we do not have C you
because you can see I provided only a
and B but there is no C but imagine I am
providing C and let us say what it is
going to
suppressive fire press demo now you can
see it is giving something like not a
number kind of an message and we know
that why it is giving is because there
is no value for C but indeed we are
trying to multiply with the value of C
but there is one what is the advantage
or one feature which is available as
part of dollar eval there is you can
provide some local values so which means
if those particular values of those
particular variables are not present in
scope
those can be still taken directly from a
particular object you provide in here so
I can provide a new object here saying
that if it is asking for C please take
that value directly as five I can
provide something like this so this
object will be automatically provided to
evil and eval will be taking all the
values from this object first and then
it takes the rest from the scope so this
gets the preference that is important
this gets the preference so the object
whatever you are going to have is going
to have so that the object whatever you
are going to provide is going to have
all those particular members or the
variables you would like to have to be
provided with the values during the
evaluation of that expression so in this
case so let me f5 and now you should be
able to see the C value is also made
available as part of that expression so
which means I am having 600 into Phi
which is 3000 let me do something
different now I would like to have the a
value to be replaced which to that is
important which means now a value is
going to be 2 as I mentioned this object
takes the precedence over the scope so
if we do not provide anything in this
particular object where that particular
member is available then it falls back
to the scope itself but if you do
provide a particular variable then that
takes the president so I go back here
self-five and now you can see this is
actually 600 because a value is to P
values 2040 into 3 120 into 5 is 600 so
in that way we can have the evaluation
of scope to be also accomplished using
some local object by falling back to
scope if the respective members are not
available inside the local variables ok
so let me have one more example now we
can still have a particular function to
be provided to an evaluation method
I mean dollar eval method where it can
not only calculate anything but it can
also modify the values inside of the
scope so that is still possible so let
me do something like variable R equal to
something like dollar dot scope and I
would like to use download function so
this is the end of it but now I would
like to have the function to be provided
where it is going to have the scope and
the locals as I mentioned it in the
previous example this object is nothing
but called as locals object which means
you would like to provide some values
which need to be overwritten or to be
taken into the consideration whenever
you are providing the evaluation
expression so similarly you can provide
the locals if you would like to have if
you don't provide locals it will not
even consider so in this case I can say
something like a return scope dot a
scope dot being so this is still valid
so which means you are providing an
function which needs to be executed
while it is trying to evaluate so in
this case the it is not an expression
but it is a function which gets
evaluated say executed so let me see if
this is working so I go back here and
where is this so I go back here and
press f5 and plus the demo now you
should be able to see 200 ok but again
as I mentioned you still have the option
to provide the locals so let me get this
object ok let me type in
so in this case I would like to have a
to be considered as just with a value
true so which means now the scope dot a
will be overwritten sorry a will be
still there so let me check what we have
here so go back here and press f5 and
now you'll be you are still with 200
because you're purposefully specifying
scope but you are not just saying a year
earlier you are not specifying scope
here so it knows not it has to fall back
to a so in this case it needs to have
scope to be referred and thus there will
not be any difference even though you
provide the local variable a but that
being said you still have the options to
provide new value something like this so
this is still valid so which means SC is
not available inside the scope you can
just mention see something like this it
will be automatically taken from the
local variable that is see right here so
go back here press f5 and the moment I
do this well okay
I had to write locals that is important
so you can see this whole object is
actually is gone into this particular
variable called locals so you can also
say L whatever you would like to have so
you have to provide locals so that is
important locals dot see then you are
literally getting the value from this C
so now I go up here and press f5 and now
you should be able to see 400 so that is
important so this object is actually
passed into this variable and you are
referring that variable so this one is
nothing but your dollar scope that will
be automatically passed into this
variable called scope you can also
provide s whatever you would like to
have and you are using that if you have
a something like 3 you can still use
that right here saying that I would like
to have locals
dot a to be used so in this case you can
see 10 into 20 which is this 200 into a
value of C which is 400 and 400 into 3
it has to give me 1,200 so let me go
back here and now whenever I say demo
you can see I have 1200 so in that way
now you have access to both scope and
also the locals without really
overwriting each other but if you do not
use a function but indeed just provide
the locals there is a chance that it
might be while writing the values in the
existing scope as because the locals
will be taken into the precedence
whenever you use this expression but if
you provide a function you are still or
you are in full control of both scope
and also the locals you provide okay so
that is pretty much about the evaluation
in general so that is using dollar p
value so there is nothing much we can
cover about dollar a well at the moment
so let me call this one as demo eval so
that we are pretty sure of what's
happening here so I wanted to call this
one as demo eval okay so we're done with
eval so let me jump to parts
so let me create a new thing called demo
bars and I would like to call the
function so let me have the function to
be returned and of course we know that
we always can do scope data into scope
dot B and that is not what we are after
here we are really after this kind of
expression so let me try to use this
kind of expression here so first of all
again you can use dollar parts
indirectly
however we should be actually injecting
it so we need to have dollar parts to be
injected here and use that right here
so which means that injection is made
available through this variable so this
could be any variable like a or B not
even a dollar symbol so I go in here now
you are actually using that one here so
you need to use that variable here and
whenever you use it here which means you
are saying that please evaluate this
expression but there
some things which we need to understand
where this parts is really doing the
first thing is that download part even
though it says it is trying to evaluate
this
it doesn't really return a result it
actually returns a function it is just a
template function you can call it as
because dollar parts is not working on
the scope if you can see dollar eval it
is really working on the current scope
but in this case dollar parts doesn't
really work with any context or any
scope or with any data it really
evaluates that particular function sorry
that particular expression and gives us
the function and now you can use this
function to apply against Disko or any
kind of other objects like even this
object your locals object anything so
this is pretty important this actually
returns a function that is very
important once you have the function now
you can use that function to actually
apply again is to scope something like
this now once this is applied in this
way it is going to give the result and
you can then store the result into a
variable so which means the other parts
always gives a function and then you can
use that function any number of times to
apply against any kind of object doesn't
need to be just a scope so I can say
function of dollar scope and immediately
again I can say function of root scope
and again function of object o or object
EMP whatever so the same function can be
used multiple number of times in various
different contexts of data but eval is
different eval can always work only with
the current scope okay
now that we have the result so let me
display the result by saying something
like result equals plus R and see if
this is working fine and of course I
need to have demo parts to be actually
added to my button so I would like to
have one more button and let me have a
break tag here and
in this case I would like to call it as
demo parts and let me have parts here as
well so go back here press f5 and I
should be having a new button here demo
parts and now you can see I have 200 so
that is important I think I have a typo
somewhere a result right here okay so we
can make it short actually instead of
having three different variables I mean
three different statements I can
actually make all of those available in
single statement by just writing
something like a result equals first of
all I try to parse the expression is rod
B which results a function and that
particular function can be used to
actually go again is the scope so most
of the time whenever you are going
through online samples you are going to
see this expression which is nothing but
if you split it you are going to have
something like this so this one
statement is actually identical to
almost all of these three so I go back
here press f5 and the moment i say demo
parts you can see still I have the same
result okay so that is in simple
whenever you consider a particular
parsing so let me do it with not just
the scope but with any other object yes
we can still do with any other object
now instead of providing the scope I can
say please do again esthe my particular
object I am going to say a value is 2
and B value as 3 yes this is still valid
now what I am saying is that please
evaluate this a store B based on the
values whatever you come or whatever you
get from this object so if this object
is scoped it tries to fetch from scope
if it is not from scotts just provide
whatever you would like to have here as
long as it helps the variables a and B
and now it is going to display 2 into 3
which is nothing but 6 so I go in here
you can see I have 6 so in that way you
can use the same function or I can say
something like let me use this one
so I would like to have the same
function to be used against both so now
I would like to say alert function so
let me say r1 here so that says our
result 1 and I would like to call this
one as r2 and in this case I do not want
this whole stuff but instead I would
like to have this particular object just
the object alone to be used instead of
the scope so I just get rid of this and
use that right here
now let me display r2 so what I'm saying
is that in this case this function is
actually going after scope and
evaluating again is the scope gives the
result of r1 and the form of r1 so which
means as it goes after scope it is going
to display in to be from the scope which
is nothing but 10 into 20 is 200 and now
I am using the same function f but not
with the scope but with a different
object and now I am saying please
evaluate a store B from this object
which is 2 into 3 again 6 and now you
are going to see two different results
from the same expression being evaluated
using two different context objects so
let me go back here
plus the file and now if you press this
one the first value is 200 and the
second value is 6 so that is how you can
use the same expression to be used on
multiple context of objects either scope
or anything whatever you provide here so
that is just another example okay
now coming to even this kind of
expression where is that I have this so
imagine I would like to use this one yes
we can still use that so if I go in here
so let me say something like alert and I
would like to use that so I do not need
any of this stuff I just would like to
have that pass to be used so I am saying
please pass this particular expression
directly using the scope so this is
still valid so I just go back here press
f5 and okay I am missing some X bracket
here so okay so this is an arrow okay so
let me press f5 and the moment I say
this you can oh okay Austin this is the
one so I have one more alert somewhere
which is still working so let me
actually comment that one too and now
you can see I have Austin being
evaluated directly from the scope even
through paths so whether or not you use
eval you can still use dollar parts and
the most important thing is that even if
you use dollar eval behind the scenes
angularjs users dollar paths so which
means if you use dollar eval all it does
is it uses dollar pass with the dollar
scope so it is still the same if you are
always going after the scope it is best
readable just by using dollar eval but
if the case is like you would like to
have multiple kinds of context to be
executed based on the necessary
expression you can just go with paths
again I just wanted to mention dollar
eval behind the scenes uses dollar pairs
okay now let us you there is one more
benefit of using dollar paths that is
you can actually modify the values from
path so which means you can provide
certain values which can be directly
modified to the object so let me see
this so I have this city so in
this case the city value is Austin we
know that it is going to display us in
no doubts but let us consider I would
like to modify that particular value of
city using parts yes you can still do
that so I can say download parts the MP
dot add rows dot city and there is a
function called assign and that assign
is automatically available the moment
you pass it as you know whenever you
execute this one it actually results in
a function that function internally has
another function called a sign and I can
say assign to the scope object with a
new value called Dallas so I can I can
provide something like this and now
again let me use the same alert so here
in this case it actually goes to Austin
however here you are saying that please
modify the value available in city in
scope with a new value called Dallas and
once it has modified you can see while
we are executing this it should display
Dallas but not Austin as it did earlier
so let me press f5 here and go in here
and you can see the first one is always
going to be Austin and the next is
Dallas that is pretty important okay so
not only that let me go in here so let
me do is some simple thing here so I
would like to have the scope to be
actually displayed here so I would like
to go after this expression EMP address
dot city so let me do this okay so and
okay so I go back here so let me not put
any of the alerts here so all I'm saying
is whenever I click on the button it has
to just modify the scope and in the
scope go to this path and just modify
the value to Dallas and they go back
here let's save file and you can see by
default I already have Austin the moment
I click on it you can see it came with
Dallas so that digest cycle has been
already performed here so that is
important so if you are using assign the
digest process is automatically is going
to be kicked in
you can also called either sponsors or
digest cycle or digest loop whatever you
call it as is kicked in so this is
pretty pretty important and if you are
not familiar with the digest process or
digest cycle please refer to my previous
video which covers that part in very
much depth okay so this is pretty much
what we can cover about parts so dollar
parts which needs to be always injected
at the very top and can be worked with
any scope or any other object and it can
also be used to actually modify the
values okay so let me do this one in the
scope yes can we do can we modify values
inside the scope we can so let me do
that we can modify the values inside
dollar evil as well whenever you are
using the functions so in this case I
can also say something like scope dot C
equal to locals dot C even that is
possible so what I'm saying is that
please get the value from here using
locals get the value out of it and
assign to C and now instead of using
this statement
I can say instead of local see I can now
say scope dot say even this is possible
so you can still modify the values
inside the scope using eval by a writing
your own function so this is still
possible so let me see if this is
working so I go to this and now it is
still giving 1200 as a mentioned so a is
still considered 10 into 20 is 200 into
see that is 400 into local so that a
which is nothing but this guy so 400
into 3 becomes 2 or 100 so in that way
you can still modify the values using
either email or using parts where from
the parts you have the what is a the a
sign statement right there I mean a sign
function okay so that is pretty much
about dollar eval on dollar parts and
now it is time to work with interpolate
so let me add one more function just way
the way I did earlier and instead of
calling this one as demo parts I just
would like to call this one as
interpolate and let me add a new button
just for this case so that may add
something like this let me get dollar
interpolate all right here and I just
would like to call this one as
interpolate okay so what is so different
about interpolate so let us see what's
going on so let me get whatever I had
earlier so let me get this stuff okay
and now I need to use interpolator so I
just wanted to use interpolate and again
when we are using interpolate that needs
to be injected at the very top so I need
to have something like this and now I
also need to have interpolate something
like this so you can use any variable I
or dollar I or whatever you use the same
thing you provide their needs
views right here okay so I'm using
interpolate and I am trying to actually
evaluate some expression and again
execute the same thing again is the
scope and would like to have the result
there is no difference right now as you
can see this parts and even the
interpolate so let us see if this is
working fine first so press f5 and now
you can say got a new button and you can
see how it is working it just displayed
as if it is a string yes it is because
this parser takes the string as an
expression but here you need to provide
an expression again the string whatever
you provide here itself is an angular
expression but in this case it is just
treated as a string containing an
expression so if you would like to
evaluate this you literally have to use
how you are using right here so you can
use this whole statement or say whole
syntax or this particular message
however you are using in the view the
same thing you can use it right here so
I can say please do that right here so I
can say something like this which means
it actually interpolates which means it
translates and evaluates all the angular
expressions it found inside the string
that is important so here you are
directly providing the angular
expression but here you are providing a
string which may contain one or more
angular expressions and does behind the
scenes this interpolate works with
dollar parts again so whenever
interpolate finds any of these angular
expressions those angular expressions
will be automatically executed or
evaluated by dollar parts and then
further the results will be returned
back to dollar interpolate and just like
dollar parts dollar interpolate also
returns init function and that function
can be executed against any of the scope
or any of the objects you provide and
finally we should be having the result
in this case I do not need result here
because you are already
during the same caption here so let me
get rid of this result here and let me
go back here and press fi and the moment
i say interpolate now you have the
result right here so which means you
have the expression to be evaluated
right here and let me do something
different I would also like to have not
just this result but some other result
of course this is some stupid
calculation I would like to provide here
so I would like to have something like a
star B star something like 10 or
something so which means 200 into 10
becomes 2000 so I need to have this
whole string to be evaluated along with
the angular expressions yes that can be
still done so I go back here press f5
and you can see I still have all the
expressions within the same string all
the angular expressions within the same
string being evaluated and provided
along with whatever the scope you
provided here okay
so now that we have some understanding
about the interpolate here
yes just like our what I say parts you
can actually push or make everything
available in one statement so I can let
me do this and just have one alert which
is simple like dollar interpolate and I
can just do this
and now after that I can provide dollar
scope right here so which means I would
like to have that particular expression
to be evaluated against scope so I go
back here let's save file and I click on
here I get the result okay so just like
pass you are using interpolate here
except that the interpolate actually
works with strings and all the angular
expressions mixed up so let me go to the
next level it is not just only the
angular expressions the expressions can
also contain the filters angular filters
if you would like to include as part of
the angular expressions if you are not
familiar with angular filters please
refer to my previous videos but in this
case imagine I would like to use a
currency filter which I would like to
use to decorate the expression related
value whatever it might be evaluated so
in this case I would like to use the
alert in the same way I did earlier but
whatever the value I get out of this a
store B needs to be formatted using that
particular filter called currency with a
value something like this so let me go
back press f5 and go through interpolate
and now you can see I have USD dollar
sign and that 200 so you can provide any
filter here so if you are using strings
you can have different kind of filters
if you are using dates you can have
years and so on to be actual fetched
from the filters so filters are one of
the most important things available in
angularjs and you can also use your
custom filters if necessary here also
but this feature of evaluation using the
filters is not available in dollar avail
order or parts so that is the feature
available only for the interpolate and
that is pretty much whatever we have
seen as part of interpolate and again
there are a couple more things which we
need to understand interpolate always
uses dollar pass behind this
means dollar eval also uses dollar paths
behind the scenes and finally dollar
interpolate cannot change the values of
the respective context so which means if
you provide dollar scope interpolate is
just always read-only so you can see in
the parts you can actually use dot
assign but in the case of interpolate
you do not have any assign you cannot
change the values for that particular
context object you provide whether it is
dollar scope or some arbitrary context
object like one simple object whatever
we provided in this case like this so if
we cannot use any of those particular
objects to really change the values
using interpolate that is available only
as a feature for dollar parts using s
sign or you can use dollar eval with
your own function you actually can
provide okay so this is pretty much
about dollar eval dollar parts and
dollar interpolate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
