to declare and define various methods
directly inside a JavaScript object not
only that we have also seen on how to
define methods inside a constructor
function creating stands out of it and
then accessing the same methods using
the Newlands created instances in this
video we are going to look bit more
about methods so first of all methods
which are very similar to functions
those particular methods can always
accept parameters and at the same time
they can return values so those are the
quite so common things what we generally
do with respect to functions so all
those particular function features
whatever we do are also valuable for
methods methods can have objects as
parameters that is important so till now
we have seen like the functions
accepting the primitive types like
strings or integers or whatever but
methods can also have objects to be sent
as parameters so now you can see whoa
here is just a parameter however you can
see I am trying to access members from
the same object foe and then assign to
the members of the current object so
indirectly what I am doing here is I am
sending an object and at the same time I
would like to have all those members to
be accessible and fetch the values from
those members and at the same time it
sent those values to the current object
whatever I created out of this one so
this is a constructor function anyway
and not only that we can also have
methods which can return objects so if
you can see this is a particular
function or a method which is internally
building up its own object and finally
returning an object so this function
currently doesn't accept any parameters
however it is doing its own
creation or it is creating a new object
and then returning it so it doesn't
necessarily be the same object as of
this particular constructor function but
it could be any object or any anonymous
object on the fly and the same object
can be returned back and to make it
quite so simple instead of creating
available and then returning it you can
directly use the syntax which means I am
actually creating an object on the fly
in the form of an anonymous object and
then how all the members defined and
then return it directly so all I am
doing is I am just eliminating the
object
oh so variable just the variable but
still the definition of that particular
object is still available here so this
is another shortcut way of directly
returning an object what sells storing
an object in available and then
returning the same variable back so let
us see a couple of examples on this one
so let me create a new HTML file and I
am going to call this one a 0-6 and let
me start with script here and now I
would like to start with the constructor
function so as part of this particular
function I would like to have a couple
of members like first of all I would
like to have employee name to be defined
and then I would like to have salary to
be made available and of course those
are the default values I'm providing and
now I am going to have a new method
called set employee to be developed in
such a way that it is going to be an
anonymous function as of now and on top
of that I am actually having a
particular object to be sent as a
parameter and I can directly access the
current object related member
and assign the value of feature from
other objects so in this case I can just
say like all those particular members
these a name and cell are these two so
which means I am trying to fetch the
values available inside these objects
which is letting with that particular
object oh so all the members are
available inside the object ago for
which I'm going to pass that whenever I
am going to execute that employee so
while calling set employee I am going to
send an object and I am expecting that
that particular object is going to have
two members and I am fetching each of
those particular values directly from
the respective members of the same
object whatever has been sent and
assigned those values to the current
properties of the current object
similarly on top of it I can still have
something like get annual salary to be
returned and this is going to just
return the multiplied value of the
current salary by twelve so this is just
another method which I would like to use
it for testing whether this particular
function is working correctly or not so
after that now I can just create an
object out of it by just saying we MP is
nothing but a new instance of the
constructor function EMP and now I can
access each of those members by writing
directly in this fashion the MP dot
salary equal to five thousand four
hundred okay so that is the usual way I
am going to write however I can also
create another object something like
available or say a variable object emp2
and now I am saying this is also new EMP
you can see this is a particular object
currently do not have any
and of values inside the members of the
object emp2 it so emp2 is currently a
new object with having all of these
members however there are no values
assigned but for the previous object I
already assigned those two values in
this case I am going to call oh my two
dot set employee and then I am going to
send OMP so if you can see I am calling
this method on Y EMP - so which means I
am calling this particular method set
employee based on the context of o mp2
so right now at the very beginning even
before calling say to employee all of
the members are already available
however the properties of these two I
mean the values of these two properties
are currently just the default values
but however once I call set employee
what it does is that this is the method
which accepts another object as
parameter and this will be automatically
gone into object war just available so
this variable will have all the members
along with their values everything will
be copied or j referred by this
particular variable
oh now whenever i say o dot e name you
are indirectly accessing we MP dot a
name which is nothing but j AG similarly
if you are accessing what salary you are
actually accessing we MP dot salary
which is nothing but 5400 while
accessing those two values you are
assigning the same values to the
respective properties of the current
object so what is the current objects
context it is voet MP - so essentially
you are copying all the values from we
MP into the OEM p2 so after this
whenever I say alert and now I can say
annual salary and okay let me get even
the
name a song so I can say or mp2 dot
imply name concatenated with yawns yawns
or EMP - dot get annual salary or annum
so I got a typo here let me remove that
so or EMP tool so I am accessing a name
in wimpy tool and accessing get annual
select Celtic directly from OMP - which
is nothing with this guy and all of
those together with concatenations
and just let us check if this is going
to work and now you can see it is
working exactly the way it is supposed
to do ok so now that we understood on
how we can actually send objects as
parameters the other thing is that we
need to also learn the way on how a
particular method can return the objects
so let me create another HTML file for
that one and I'm going to call that one
as 0 7 so in this case I would like to
have something like script again so
again I am going to start with the
construct function very similar to what
I had earlier but in this case I would
like to send some parameters directly
during the instantiation so once I have
that I can just say this dot name equal
to ve name so I'm just initializing the
members with the parameters so I can say
salary and now I can say get details
with annual salary so I can just put
whatever the name you want it but in
this case I am thinking that it is more
readable so I have a method which is
going to return
so let me first create an object out of
it so I'm going to create an anonymous
object right then earlier itself and I'm
going to say that exists a property name
for this object war so object war is an
anonymous object and creating the
structure along with the values right
here so at the same time I can say this
dot a name so have the first property
and the second property I would like to
have something like this salary this dot
cell and now I can say annual salary
equal to this dot sound star 12 so in
that way I can have an object to be
created and finally return the same
object so I created our object with
these three members and returning the
same object so now let me create an
instance of this particular constructor
function so I'm going to declare the an
object called EMP and that is going to
be nothing but an instance of
constructor function EMP which is going
to have two values to be sent as
parameters for which I sent two values
like jag and assembly and those two will
be made available as part of why EMP so
once we have that now I would like to
have all of those members to be
accessible so I just wanted to take
whatever I did earlier so that I can
minimize my typing work so I would like
to have MP to be used and in this case I
can still work with what I what I say
a name and salary so earn salary for now
so I'm not calling the method yet so if
this is not for annum so in this case
what I am doing is I am just accessing
these two properties so
you can see I'm just accessing those two
properties however now I would like to
have another variable called something
like this or EMP two equal to I can say
will impede dot and execute this
particular method so as I mentioned this
is the method which returns an object so
which means all of these is
automatically stored inside VMP two so
om P 2 is a new object which will help
three properties called the names L will
be an annual salary with those
respective values so let me do the same
here but care should be taken in a
different way right here first of all o
mp2 is an object of this type so which
contains this object this object
essentially has a name but not a name so
it has a property name called a name
just name so you need to provide the
same name right here similarly we MP 2
which is again nothing but the same
object is not having Sal it is indeed
having salary so I need to get that one
here and on top of that I can also say I
know salary hats
Oh MP 2 dot annual salary so I'm just
using the same property Y whatever I
have in there right here so the first
one is just our traditional employee
name and salary which is jag and 5 400
even the second one we are going to get
the same values however using different
property names jag earns salary five
thousand four hundred and another annual
salary which will be roughly about sixty
thousand plus so let us see so the first
one which is just an ordinary one and
now you have the annual salary also to
be displayed
so this is one way of doing so let me
accomplish the same in another way so
instead of actually having a variable
which contains the reference of the
object whatever it is returning I can
also do the same thing by just writing
something like this I can say annual
salary black layer so just if I'm
interested only in annual salary I can
just say because I need to have OMP
already created first so I can just say
Oh
EMP dot get Haniel salary so get details
which means currently and getting this
entire object but I am interested in
only this property so I can just say dot
annual salary so in this way you can
actually get rid of this particular
variable however you are not going to
access anything more than this
particular variable so just make sure
that if you are just accessing only one
property this is good enough but if you
would like to access more than one
property this is the way to go so let us
see this is working fine and now you can
see I still got the annual salary in
such a way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
