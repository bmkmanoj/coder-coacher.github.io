the concept called JavaScript objects so
let us start from the very basics of
objects and what exactly are objects in
general the first thing let us consider
an object and that I am considering
in general terms so which means this is
not specific to JavaScript or object
oriented terms or whatever but in
general what exactly is an object in the
software world so we can typically say
like whenever you say an object an
object internally contains some kind of
data so whenever I say data it is
nothing but some kind of information
which will be associated to that
particular object and usually it is
private to the object but it would be
sometimes exposed outside the borders of
the object to but in general information
is supposed to be as private as possible
within the boundaries of the object in
such a way that no other world can
access data directly as because that
particular data will be sitting inside
the object if the data itself is inside
the object how do we fit the information
outside I mean from outside and how do
we put some information to this
particular data which is inside the
object so there should be some kind of
interfacing which needs to be available
to the outside world in such a fashion
that the outside world can interact with
that particular private data available
inside the object now let us see on how
the interfacing is going to work like so
for example a particular object can
expose a certain kind of interfaces to
the outside world and the outside world
can actually manipulate this particular
data through the interface so whenever I
say manipulate
the first thing is that it can assign
the data or it can fetch the data or it
can calculate and compute more and more
information by using the same data but
using that particular data only through
the interfacing provided so the outside
world can access that data only through
certain mechanism provided in the form
of an interface so this interfacing
could be in any form however as long as
it is able to provide access to this
data via this interface to the outside
world that should be good enough so
outside world will not be directly
getting in touch with the data but in
barek it gets in touch with the data
with a certain safety and security
operations are options available as part
of the interfacing okay now that we have
some understanding with respect to the
object data interfacing let us think
from the object oriented terms what
exactly is an object and how do we call
this interfacing and data and so on
so usually we maintain all the
information inside a particular object
in the form of properties so properties
could also be called as fields in Sun
turns but in general properties are the
ones which hold data inside the object
so using the properties you maintain the
values you store the values and all of
that particular data will be stored
inside the object and the interfacing is
usually achieved from the object
oriented terms using methods submitting
some very simple functions so these
particular functions or methods will
have direct access to this data and
provide that information to the outside
world so in general these particular
methods are mainly useful to actually
work with the data or work with the
properties so properties could be
private properties or public properties
so whenever we say private properties
those will be available within the same
boundaries of the arc
but cannot be exposed outside if we have
public properties those particular
properties can be directly accessible
from outside world without really going
through the interfacing which are
nothing but the methods some methods
again we could have the private methods
and public methods so if you go with
private methods those are accessible
within the boundary of the object and if
you have public methods those are
accessible from outside the world so in
any case methods can access properties
and at the same time properties are
always accessible to methods so methods
could be public in order to make sure
that those particular methods can be
directly used or accessed from outside
world properties could also be public
which means we can have those particular
properties to be directly accessible
from the outside world without any
mediation from the public methods so we
can implement in either of those ways
and there is one more thing called
events so in certain scenarios like
whenever I change the date data or
whenever the data gets changed or
instantiated or computed if I would like
to let the outside world know that
something has happened or some change
has happened for this later
I will let the outside world know using
events so events are the special kind of
notification mechanism which notifies
the outside world about the internal
changes of that particular object and
now you can see like we have the
properties to store the data methods to
make the data accessible to outside or
manipulate the data and events to notify
the outside world based on the internal
changes we have on all of these three
together can be simply called as members
so in essential object can have various
members and a member could be a property
or a method or even any event so
whenever we talk in the terms of objects
and members we should be really thinking
about this diagram
okay so now that we have some
understanding with respect to our
Jackson's in in the terms of
object-oriented programming we need to
look into objects in JavaScript so let
us start with the very important first
point which is JavaScript is not a true
object-oriented programming language it
is not object-oriented programming
language period so it doesn't support
the classes our inheritance or
polymorphism or great a encapsulation to
the extreme limit of the principles of
object-oriented programming however we
achieve certain or most of the
object-oriented programming principles
or the features necessary using the
built-in JavaScript language features so
JavaScript language has got certain
features and using those features
somehow we can define our own pattern to
have certain object-oriented principles
to be met so this is pretty important
you cannot directly have the entire
JavaScript will be defined in the form
of object-oriented programming or
pattern this can be easily easily
achieved using associate arrays as the
first principle so which means if you
have followed my previous videos an
associative array is nothing but a
simple array however the indexes of
those particular array elements are
strings so an associate array can have
any kind of values to be stored inside
the respect to error elements however
the array indexes could be string not
necessarily being Emmerich's so if you
have any of such kind of an array you
can call that particular array itself is
an object so what is the difference how
we can have an object here I'm talking
about array but at the same time saying
this is an object there is one
convenience in JavaScript that whenever
you have an associative array I can
directly access each of those particular
array items using the syntax of object
notation so you can see if I have EMP
here I can just say EMP dot my number
similarly EMP dot E name EMP dots al the
impeded Department number so in this
case you can simply consider like these
are all the values being stored in the
respective properties of that particular
object EMP so I have one huge object
called EMP internally and maintaining
the data in using those particular
properties and it can always access
those properties just using the dot
notation of course you can also access
using the same notation of an as of an
array so you have both options you can
access those particular members using
the array notation or using the dot
notation if you are using the dot
notation it is quite synonymous to say
that you are actually accessing those
particular properties in the form of
members and your area becomes an object
so an object in JavaScript is very much
similar to an associate Ally so as long
as you define an associate array behind
the scenes you can directly work or it
works with the object based notation so
let us have a quick demonstration on
associative arrays or objects as part of
JavaScript
so let me open my webstorm you can use
any editor so I go to new HTML file and
in this case I would like to start with
0 1 so let me start with some script and
inside the skater I would like to tell
an array and the add a name itself is
EMP you can put add a ary or EMP so in
this case just for my convenience I'm
using EMP and now I can say EMP of
employment or equal to 1 0 0 1 so what
I'm saying is I would like to have this
particular value to be stored in this
array element for us that particular
area so the array element is being
identified with this error index
however the air index is currently being
notated with respect to the string but
not index numeric index array so it is
not numerically indexed data it is a
string index string based index array
and now let us have something like
another one called as a name and the
disc is I would like to say Jack and
similarly I might want to have another
one called cell and similarly I might
want to have another one called the
department name border
something like this and now I have
various values already stored as part of
the array and now in order to retrieve
any of that information
I can just say EMP of employee number
so which means I am saying that I would
like to get the value of this particular
location the value available at this
location which is nothing but 1 0 0 1
and let me add further so something like
this now I would like to have another
one called ename and again okay so I'm
missing here okay so next I would also
like to go for the NP and in this case I
would like to have the salary plus a
comma and then something else
EMP of department number so this is the
easiest way in order to get a particular
added to be displayed so which means I'm
accessing each of those elements
individually as part of the same alert
statement so the first value of
employing M bar which is nothing with
this concatenated with comma
concatenated with the Jag again with
comma and 5,400 comma 10 so let us
quickly run this and ensure that it is
working fine
and now you can see I got all of the
elements automatically displayed but as
I mentioned earlier in order to access
any of these values you always need to
access using the string based array
indexes here so let us consider I do not
want to use array based notation in
order to access the respective element
values instead I can also go for the
other way using object notation that is
I can say a MP dot employ number
concatenated with a comma and now we can
say the MP dot E name concatenated with
this one and again plus the impede our
salary class and again the MP that
apartment number so instead of using air
a basic notation to access the
respective element values I am using dot
based notation so let us see if this is
going to work and there we go even this
one works with no problems so this is
pretty much important like whenever you
have an associate array so whenever I
say associate add an array containing
the elements with the string based
indexes you can always access those
string based elements string based index
based elements using the object dot
member notation so whenever you are
going with the dot notation you are
essentially using object syntax so
object syntax means object dot member</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
