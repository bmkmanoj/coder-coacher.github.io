mostly used web server in Windows
environment especially to host asp.net
or web-based applications if you install
visual studio chances are that you might
have already have is expressed on your
machine is Express is the light version
of full-blown areas which is mainly used
for development and testing purposes if
you do not have adjust to be installed
you can still install I express is
Express as a standalone so which means
you can just still go to Google and say
something like is Express download and
you should be able to see something like
the latest version of OS 10 right here
so as of now that is the latest that is
number 10 2015 the moment I click on
that one you should be able to see a
download button right there so this is
the one so just click on this download
which essentially gives you a standalone
exe the install is Express on your
machine so if you would like to have the
world version obviously you might need
to select is 8 point or X plus year so
once you have installed is Express on
your machine whether directly installing
through the browser or installing
through Visual Studio you should be able
to see is Express folder on your PC
something like this so you can go to see
Program Files and you should be able to
say this folder so inside this folder
you will be able to see is expressed at
exe so this is the main file which
essentially helps us to actually fire up
a web server a lightweight web server
exclusively for development and testing
purposes ok so in order to run is
Express on any folder so which means
imagine I would like to create a new
folder or something like
sample here so just to go to this sample
and imagine I have a file called HTM so
sample dot HTML so I go to notepad here
and I'm going to say something like HTML
body body here and closer to mo so
inside this I would like to say hi jack
so this is a simple HTML file which I
would like to have it served through
this particular folder called samples I
just save it so I would like to save
that one sprite into that particular
folder called sample and in this I would
like to say something like it is that's
dot HTML and click Save ok and now I
would like to test this particular page
directly using is Express so usually if
you are using a full-blown is you will
be creating a virtual folder and then
you know you will be copying all of
those files into that respecto virtual
folder and then once it is created as
virtual folder you can expose it or say
access it directly using the browser or
else you might actually create a virtual
you can turn this physical folder into a
virtual folder using is as well but if
you are not really using the full-blown
features of all the ayahs but instead
you would like to have a simple
mechanism to simply turn this particular
sample or this particular folder
instantaneously using is experts and
serve this whole folder as if it is a
virtual folder you can easily achieve
that from command line so which means
you can just go to command prompt and
once you are here you can just say
something like is expose right now this
may not work as because you know I do
not have the path to the is X plus y but
there are a couple of ways to achieve
this one the first one is directly
providing the path to
is Express and writing your own command
at the command prompt the other easier
way is prepare a simple batch file where
that particular batch file can be
executed from any path wherever you
would like to return the respective
folder into a web folder
lots of virtual folder so for that
purpose what I'm going to create now is
a simple batch file so I already wrote
the command right here so you can see
this is the batch file I'm going to
create so right now I'm specifying
something like my is Express dot exe you
can see this so this is the file which
exists in this folder in the root folder
called Program Files x86 so that is the
executable file which I need to execute
once I execute this particular batch
file so once I have that particular
command set I'm saying that I can
provide the port number if required so
if I provide the port number as part of
the execution of the batch file the same
port number will be considered otherwise
it tries to take the default 8080
and you can also see I'm using
percentage CD percentage which means it
goes it it goes after the current
directory or the current folder so
imagine I am just trying to save this so
I click on save and this is important I
am trying to save this particular folder
where my path is already set somewhere
by default in your particular what I say
in your particular environment you
should be able to see see windows 32
windows and then you will be able to say
system 32 so let us see system 32 what
is that right here so this particular
path by default will be already added to
your environment path so if you go to
environment path setting so if you go to
sea
not see you go to this PC go to
properties and inside that you are going
to see advance of system settings and
you are going to see environment
variables and inside the environment
variables you can see something like
that so inside the path let me copy this
whole thing and just canceling right now
so inside this whole path let me cancel
this and let me turn the word wrap so
that you can see everything and search
for system that and now you can see the
system 32 right now is already added to
our path in this manner you can also see
this system rotor by default is nothing
but C windows so in by default it is C
windows and the top of that you have
system 32 so if your windows has been
installed in C column out say C Drive
you are going to see the system route by
default is automatically translated to
see : windows so inside C windows you
have system 32 so if you'd like to have
your own new path to be added just put a
semicolon here and just add one more
folder so that you can have that
particular folder also to be picked up
as part of your command line so for now
I just wanted to keep my things simple
so all I really need is just save this
particular file inside this particular
folder yes because that particular
folder is already added to the path and
is available automatically through the
command prompt so for now I just wanted
to close this and now I save this so
while I'm saving it as I mentioned I
would like to go to see
windows and then system32 so inside the
stone 32 I would like to say something
like IAS Express dark bad for that
purpose let me make it much more easier
run is Express dark batch file double
quotation see up so that no special
extension will be added so the moment I
save it it will be saying you need
permission I just say yes and now you
can see one is exposed not bad or it has
been added somewhere let me add it using
run as administrator so sometimes it
will not add as because if you do not
have the permissions to be adding it so
your particular application whatever you
are you trying to use should be executed
as a run as administrator and then it
can try to do that so if not you can
create wherever you would like to have
first in this case it has added to my C
user Jake this run is X plus not bad you
can just manually move this file
directly to see windows so let me do
that one so I can say C users and you
are going to see from I express not bad
I am just cutting it and then I will try
to go to see windows and some 32 and
then I copied and you can see you will
need to provide administrator
permissions I just say continue and now
you can see run I Express run is Express
not bad
is already available here so make sure
that the batch file whatever you are
going to create has to be made available
in this path if not if you are not
following this process make sure that
your particular application like notepad
or notepad plus plus right-click on that
one
run as administrator' right your batch
file command here then directly save it
into this particular folder that is just
another way but so looks like we already
have run is Express dot bat so let me go
to that particular folder so where is my
folder which I has my HTML file that is
see sample so let me go to see sample
here so I say CD sample and now you can
see I'm available as I'm available
directly inside this particular folder
sample and I would like to turn this
folder into a web folder so that I can
use my browser and try to fetch this
particular file as if this particular
folder itself is a virtual folder so all
I'm going to do is run is expose and now
you can see it says starting is X plus
it has successfully registered a TI T so
that is important so by default it has
gone through 8080 and now I can use my
particular browser to actually go to
localhost with port number 80 80 and
then view this particular file called
test dot HTM and the moment I press that
I can see I got hijack which is nothing
but the HTML whatever I have in here so
now you can see I have hijack so which
is nothing but the one I received
directly from that particular browser so
I can use any browser for this one and
by default it is actually going to 8080
so and you can also say in order to
close the current is session all you
have to say is enter Q so I just wanted
to press Q and the moment I say Q you
can see it has already stopped the ASX
plus and if I go in here and try to use
the same URL once again by pressing f5
or pressing refresh you can see it is
going to say unable to connect as
because we already shut down I are
is Express okay so if you would like to
have on any other port you can also say
is Express like 1990 and press ENTER and
now you can see it is available at local
host 1990s because that is how I'm
always modified our batch file earlier
so now instead of using 8080 I can use
the port number 1990 here and then press
ENTER and you can see it is still
working on that one and again I can stop
it by just saying queue so just type
queue in order to have that one to be
stopped and if you refresh this it is
going to say it is not available okay so
this is one easier way as I mentioned
whenever you would like to turn a
particular fold or to be served as if it
is that basic folder or virtual fold or
for which you can access all the files
inside it if this is only for developer
and for development and for testing your
particular applications usually for
development of JavaScript or HTML based
applications okay now that we knew on
how to have an is expressed to be used
directly from the command line but I
would like to make things much simpler
so which means I just wanted to go to
this folder and say right-click and I
would like to have one one more option
in this menu saying something like run
is Express here so that that will be
much more easier for me so instead of
going through the hassle of command
prompt and then you know going to the
switching to that folder and then
executing the command instead of going
through all that mess all I would like
to use is just go to Windows Explorer
drill down to whatever the folder you
would like to expose just right-click on
that particular folder and I would like
to have the option somewhere around here
saying that you know run is Express so
if you need something of that sort you
actually need to modify your register
and for that purpose I already have the
registry file or CA this tree
modification file here so in this case I
have something like Windows registry or
500 and this is the option which you are
going to see once your I click on your
particular windows folder and you can
see this particular option currently
will be automatically made available the
moment you put in shell so this goes to
H key local machine software classes
there a picture you need to type in all
of this one
or you can use something like regedit
and so which is nothing but the registry
editor and then you can see you can go
to the same path as ever as I'm showing
here H key local machine and software
and then classes or other classes right
here and then you can see the directory
so I should be able to see directly
somewhere here all the details there you
go so you see the directory here and you
should be able to say shell here so
inside the shell you can have is Express
web server to be created manually just
by right clicking and clicking new and
so on so you can use this way by
directly creating it or you can have a
simple file like this and you can save
this in this case I would like to say on
in C and you can just put in a any
folder right now I would like to put in
root folder and I would like to call
this one as something like yes Express
registry
they'd astray into something like that
so just click Save the important thing
is that you need to have the extension
as our EEG that is important so just
let's say it says I do not have the
permission and instead it will be
putting in Jagadish again so we shall
follow the same method let it put in
Jagadish and I would like to move it
somewhere else Oracle you can also work
directly excuse right from the Z this
year so I went to currently putting
inside say users - so let us click Save
and now you can see that is the registry
file we have at this particular folder
so let me open that particular folder ok
so now that we have it the moment we
double-click on this particular file you
can see it is saying adding information
cannon and and you know it is just a
warning saying that you are modifying
the register you should be really
careful so I just say I am quite careful
it just press yes and now you can see
the keys and values contained inside
this registry file have been
successfully added to the registry and
click OK so let us double check if all
of that information is available so
prior to that I would like to refresh it
and once refreshed you can see I under
the shell you are going to see is x plus
web server and you can see as part of is
Express verbs or you have the option
called run is exposure so if you double
click it you are going to see that
option and you can also see the command
which is being executed once you have
that particular option which essentially
says something like this right now I
hard-coded the port number to 8080
always so if you would like to change it
you need to change it right here so you
need to open all the way to register
entry here modify this 8080 to 1990 or
you can also modify using the file
whatever I have written here so once you
have that one in place
but let us close everything here so let
me close close and close even my command
prompt close this just wanted to keep
this so now I open and go to see a
right-click sample and you should be
able to see a run is x+ here so the
moment I execute it you should be able
to see our is Express automatically
brought in front and you should be able
to see our browser still working with
that particular port number whatever has
specified as part of our run so in the
more the requests you do from your
browser you can see you're also going to
see all that requests right here and as
I mentioned if you can see I say system
tray equal to true you can also mention
this as part of your batch file if you
really need to so that you will also see
is Express right here so you can say
like currently it is available here you
can stop it or you can show all the
applications currently hosted again is
those particular ports or whatever but
this is an optional thing so if you want
it you can keep it otherwise you can
just remove it so those are those two
are the easier ways are say simple ways
to immediately turn any kind of folder
and serve it through is Express</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
