we can minify javascript files using
grunt GS so let us jump directly into a
temporary folder so in this case let me
go to C and I have tests right here so
inside test I currently do not have any
folders so let me quickly create a new
folder called my app or you can also put
something like app or sample or whatever
in this case so I have created a new
folder and into this new folder I would
like to have a couple of files to be
dragged and dropped so that I can reuse
them so let me quickly execute or test
this normal dot HTML right using is X
bus so in order to use is express in
this case I would like to use my batch
file here which actually tries to
execute is right in here we need a web
server obviously to test my particular
page so let me execute this so is is
running now and I would like to test how
this normal dot HTML file is being
executed so you open this and now I go
to something like HTTP localhost 8080
and what is the name of the folder here
in this case my app so that is the
folder and right inside my app I have
normal dot HTML so I would like to take
all of these and execute this so once I
execute this file you can see all I am
having these two buttons like first
message and second message the moment I
click on first message I am getting them
message like this is from first method
and the moment I click on second message
I am getting this is from second method
so what is they really inside those
files called source so inside the source
folder I have a couple of JavaScript
files and inside T I have one more
JavaScript file so if you get back to
normal dot HTML and if you open that
using edit dot plus plus or in my case I
can directly use sub blind so it's just
open using the editor sublime here so I
have normal dot HTML and currently this
normal HTML file is importing all the
necessary JavaScript files first in the
source folder so inside the source
folder I have AB dot J's so inside the
source folder let me open the app de
geus and inside that all I am trying to
accomplish is just create an variable
called app so this is just available and
this variable currently is nothing but
an empty object so we have an object
named app and is being defined as part
of AB dot J's so next inside normal dot
HTML again you can see the second which
is one dot J s so if you open one dot J
s you can see I am reusing the same
object app which has been defined as
part of F dot J so I'm just using this
app dot J app object and using the same
object I am actually adding a function
called first method so this is just a
method is which is being added or or
added or inserted into that particular
app object so you are defining a
function called first method and all it
does is alert and similarly if you go to
the third one which is nothing but
inside the source I have a folder called
T and inside the T I have two dot J so
if you open that you can see I am
actually defining one more method called
second method but in this case it is bit
different as because I'm having a
debugger there just in case if you are
using developer tools it actually stops
right there before even alerting so all
I have is just the JavaScript files app
which defines the application object or
whatever the JavaScript object you would
like to have and adding one more method
in one 2gs and one more method using two
degeus so once all of the methods and
app object is made available upon
clicking on the first button I am just
executing the method I have got first
methods similarly I am executing the
second method called Abdur second method
so in that way once I execute first
method I get the first message once
execute second method I get the second
message okay so just for our clarity in
this case
I just wanted to use Chrome so I go in
here I open developer tools and let me
clear everything so it's just refreshed
here the moment I click on first message
you can see I have the first method here
the moment I click on the second message
yes there is a debugger it actually
stops right there and further pressing
this button it actually goes through the
next or the successive statements of the
JavaScript and finally you are getting
the second message called this is one
second method why because that is the
alert you have immediately after the
debugger so I click OK and every time
you press that particular second message
it is going to stop in there okay so
this is the pretty pretty simple web
page I have designed using a couple of
JavaScript files and a particular HTML
file but as I mentioned our goal is
really to minify the JavaScript files
using grunt ideas so at this moment in
this file I mean in this folder I do not
have any kind of grunt related as or
grunt related what is a plugins or
anything installed so this is just a
plain folder called my app so I would
like to have all the grant and
everything to be installed and in my
previous video I already explained on
how to install grunt on your machine so
if you do not have grant you should
install that first so let me open
command prompt here ok so now we are at
the command prompt so let me go to that
particular folder called what I said the
test folder so I go to test and I go to
my app and inside the app the first
thing I need to have is grant to be
installed so i would like to say npm in
it so which means i would like to have
my application to be turned as a node
based application so there it is us
going to ask me about all the minimum
details which are necessary to configure
our packaged or json file so in this
case my app is going to be the names i
just press enter enter enter so just
taking
all the defaults in place and once
everything is ready it is going to
create a new file called package dot
JSON and you can see these are all the
details which have been asked by you
know that NPM install I'm an NPM in it
and once we provided all the details
that respective packaged up JSON file
has been created right inside the same
folder called my app and once we have my
app and what I say it has been upgraded
to NPM application the next thing is
that we need to install grant so for
that I am going to say it npm install
grant so there is one more thing if we
do not really need anything to be stored
as part of package dot JSON then only we
would need NPM install grant but if we
need anything to be stored directly
inside package dot Jason then we can say
like NPM install grant - - say or
something like that okay so for just for
our understanding it just wanted to say
NPM install grant - - say so the only
difference between without - - say or
with - - say ways the moment you provide
- - save it is going to update package
dot JSON file which actually includes
all the add-ins or the plugins you might
be adding as part of our application so
if you go back to package dot Jason you
are going to see this dependencies with
grant or Jess so this is going to be
included if and only if you use that
switch called - - save and you also have
save in the developer mode and save in
production mode and just save and so on
but for now we just go with say oh so
similarly I would like to have one more
thing called NPM install a grant
contribute a queue file so this is the
plug-in I'm in grunt plugin which is
mainly used to minify javascript file
which means all the JavaScript code
whatever you might be writing will be
removed with all the spaces and all the
variables might be really renamed
and you know all the carriage return
line feed characters will be gone all
the spaces will begin on all the tabs
will be gone all the debugger statements
will be gone everything so I just press
save
so which means you are just installing
ideal if I as the plugin right now okay
so if you go back here now you can see I
have one more dependency called grant
contribute a glyph I which has been
added to my app so right now I have the
folder structure like this and inside
the node modules you are going to see
grant and grant contribute active I and
so on so the the next thing is that I
would like to have grunt grunt file J
has to be created so I already have a
template I just wanted to reuse my
template what is available so let me go
back to my sublime and here you are
going to see the template so as part of
this I already have the grant module to
be defined within it config which
actually reads all the plug-in
information right from the package dot
Jason if you are not familiar with this
you have to watch my previous video so
now that we have some understanding
about the plugins which have are needed
in this case only just idea pfeiffer the
javascript minification so we really
need to write or other our grant file
the GS in such a way that the task needs
to minify the JavaScript files wherever
I mentioned so in this case all I am
going to do is add Levi which is nothing
but our name so that is nothing but our
contribute a glyph I plugin so which
needs to be actually imported at the
very top so let me go in here I need to
write something that grant that load NPM
tasks and inside this all I really need
is grant contribute I defy so this is
exactly the plug-in whatever you
installed earlier and I just need that
plug-in to be loaded at the very
beginning and then you specify the
plug-in name uglify and that start
providing all the tasks necessary so in
this case I would like to say task 1 and
something like it
files so which means I'm going to define
what are all the files which need to be
minified into one particular file so in
this case I would like to say all the
files are all the JavaScript files need
to be minified and created and
concatenated into one file and put in a
different folder so in this case I am
going to say I would like to have a new
folder called destination to be created
it could be any name here and a new file
called minified all so this could be any
names this is going to be a new file
which is going to be created by this
task so I'm going to say all dot J's are
all that minify dot J's any name any
file name here and this file name
essentially is nothing but the
minification of average a as available
in source folder similarly one Raja is
available in source folder you can see
these two are the files I'm actually
specifying they're one DOJ's in source
approaches in source and similarly I
would like to have the third one which
is source and T inside that I would like
to have to dot yes so I have all the
files mentioned there under once I have
mentioned all the files all of these
files will be minified and concatenated
into one file and at that particular
file will be named as all that Minda GS
and finally placed into the folder
called destination so let me save this
and I go back to my command prompt so in
this case I would like to say grant and
the name of the task so in this case it
is ugly Phi T one so let me press Enter
ok I am missing something somewhere so
okay I don't need a semicolon here so
just remove that semicolon let me go
back
and now you can see it says one file
created and it should be created in
destination folder and you can see the
test is automatically created by grunt
and if you open that you are going to
see all that mintage is and if you open
this you can see the content from app
dot J's is there and again the content
from one dot J s has been minified in
this way and even the content from
second the Jessica Dodgers has been
minified removed with the debugger
statement as well there is no debug
statement here which used it to be
available in Tudor je s so this
statement has been automatically removed
while it is trying to accomplish the
minification and you can see first dot
and second dot so we have all the things
in place so let me go back to my normal
file here so I just wanted to create a
duplicate of this one so I am going to
say create a duplicate and I would like
to call this one s something like zero
one okay so instead instead of having
all of those files all I have to do is
go to the destination folder and using
the destination folder the name of the
file is all that main dot J as so just
import only that all got main dot J also
just save this go back to your browser
and I as I created a new file called
zero one dot HTML just use that and you
are going to see first should be working
second should be working as well and if
you go back to you your application you
are going to see only destination is
available with all dot min dot J's and
you can see this is already a minified
version of everything and as you can see
this is just a very simple what is a
application which actually demonstrates
on combining and minifying all the files
into one single file you can also have
source Maps for debugging purposes if it
is really necessary so during the
development sometimes it may be
necessary to actually debug over a mini
fide file if it has the respect to
sources if such is the case you can
simply add a new thing called options
so if you go back to your grandfather J
s so as part of T one just say options
and inside the options all you have to
say sourcemap equal to true so the
moment you say that let us see how it is
going to work so I just wanted to
execute the task again and earlier it
was just saying one file created but in
this case now it says a source map has
been created and a file also is created
so if you go back to destination you see
I have two different files one is all
dat window J's which is essentially what
earlier it was except that there is one
more statement which say source mapping
URL goes actually to all dot main door
J's that map which is nothing but this
file and it has got some information
which actually relates to how the
minified file can map its source
to all the existing source files if the
browser really detects the source maps
then it obviously the user or the
developer can debug the what is a
minified version of the javascript files
if the source related files are already
existing so let me go back here and it
just press f5 and now you can see I have
destination file and I also have the
source file now cancer earlier if you
did not specify the source map you are
not going to save so which means even
though I have the destination here which
is nothing but a poor everything and
even if you open 0 1 dot HTML I did not
modify this all I have is altered mndot
yes but browser is smart enough to know
that from all that Minda jas based on
this information it knows that it can
pull some information from source in
order to debug something so in this case
I can actually go to to dodge ES and
probably I can say like I can and you
can see it has stopped right there so in
that way you can actually debug your
existing source if you have the source
map specified so similarly I can go back
to one and have one more debugger here
and click on
first message and you are going to see
it is actually stopping there
so if you do not have the source maps
there is no way you can really deep bug
you have a particular minified file okay
so this is pretty much what we have in
place for multiple files to one single
file mapping so which means I have a
bunch of multiple files like app one two
and so on which are being unified to
only one file called at all that Minda
Jia's but imagine I would like to have
all of these files to be created with
their own respective minified versions
so which means I would like to have
something like AB dot min dot J's and
one dot min dot js2 dot min dot J's and
so on if such is the case we might be
really wanting a different kind of grunt
file way of doing the things so let me
go back here let me comment this for a
moment and I would like to create in new
tasks and in this case I would like to
call this one as t2 and inside the t2 I
would like to specify something like
files and now you need to specify the
configuration of the files so let me
open one more brace your so it needs an
object or multiple objects that this is
an array of objects so inside the files
the first thing is that you need to
specify the current working directory
which is called as CWD and I am going to
say the working directory is source
folder so which means all the files
available in the source need to be
considered that is what it says I mean
not all the files it starts with CRC so
any file whatever needs to be minified
is available in this folder that's what
it says so it starts working with this
folder called source it's a current
working folder and what are all the
files which need to be picked up in this
case I would like to say go through all
the JavaScript files and go into the
subfolders as well so that is what it
says once we say start start it says go
inside multiple sub folders to any
number of
state levels and always try to pick up
starter J's files and now the
destination folder so I would I would
rather not to disturb this destination
files I would like to create a new
destination folder something like target
you can say you can place anything there
I just wanted to mention target and now
there are a couple more options which
need to be specified like expand equal
to true and flatten equal to false and
finally the extension of your minified
files so in this case I would like to
have something like Minjae s so which
means whenever those files are being
minified each of those file is going to
be having this particular extension to
be automatically appended to those files
and placed into the folder cut target so
this is t2 so let me go back to my
command prompt and instead of t1 I'm
going to say t2 and now you can see I
have three files created and if you see
here you are going to see target which
is exactly mint I mean cloning the same
structure of the source so inside the
source you have one to two files and a
folder you have the two files in the
folder so inside this folder I have one
file and inside this folder I have
another file so the structure of that
particular directory or the folder is
going to be maintained even in the
target as well however those files are
going to be minified at now you can see
those are minified in all the ways
whatever we wanted and not just that you
can still have whatever I said earlier
that is with respect to the source map
so if you still need source map you can
just still have this one like the
options you can just specify that ok so
let me go with this so options and you
can specify something like this source
map so so this is optional if you really
need it you can just do it otherwise you
can just ignore it
so anyway let me try to execute this
once again so that we do not have any
problems and of course we need to have
one more HTML to be created as because
the existing HTML goes to destination
folder but we really need to have the
target folder so
like to duplicate my normal.dot HTML
file which is going to be called as 0 2
in this case and instead of source I
would like to say it needs to be
actually going through target so I would
like to say it needs to go through
target here and after the target as I
mentioned inside the target I need to
have one dot mintage a s so all of these
files have been modified to AB dot min
show E and here and similarly 2 dot
mintage a s as well so in all of the
cases you can see I'm not modifying this
so this will be still working the way it
is supposed to be so I just save this
one to go back to my browser so I fetch
0 to X D ml and you can see it is
actually fetching everything into the
folder from the folder called target and
all the minified versions are available
right there and these should be still
working with no issues and if you still
need to have the source map which means
I would like to debug so I would like to
have the source folder also made
available here so let us switch back to
my sublime again go back to your current
file and let me actually uncomment this
go back to your command prompt recreate
grant which actually creates three
source maps for three files respect to X
so you are going to see a broad window
J's that map for the respective MnDOT
year so every JavaScript file is going
to have its own map s so once everything
is done again go back to your browser
and refresh this and now you can say you
have the target and also the source
right here so you can still open the
source probably you can go to the one
and you can either put in here or
probably inside of the two you can also
put in here so now you face it first you
can see it is actually stopping right
here even though all the information is
being fetched right from the target so
similarly second it still stops there so
this video concludes actually the
concept of a minifying javascript files
using current yes tune in for the next
one for
doing the same using gulp door jazz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
