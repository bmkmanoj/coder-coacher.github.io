look at installing and testing node.js
or node package manager on a Mac using
homebrew there are basically two ways to
install node.js or node package manager
one is directly downloading node.js
package mounting gator and installing
from the website itself so that is you
can just open your browser and then go
to node.js website you can see here you
can just open node.js here and directly
you can go to the downloads and here
you can just click on Mac installer
where it is going to download that
particular package so once I have that
you know you can just go through this
one to actually install the node.js or
node package manager on your machine but
our concentration is not really on using
the node.js website in this video what
we are going to see really is on how to
install at work with homebrew package
manager and at the same time on how to
install node.js or node package manager
using home Pro so I am going to skip
this one
so let me remove these two
before even thinking about homebrew
package manager we need to have the
Xcode and command-line tools of the
Xcode to be installed so in my case I
already have Xcode installed so if you'd
like to check whether Xcode is already
installed on your machine or not you
just need to execute this command at
your terminal so you need to say Xcode
select - P which essentially gives you
this particular path if your Xcode is
already installed on your Mac so if you
do not have Xcode installed just open
your app store and try to search for
Xcode right there
so in this search you can just go with
Xcode and once you search for that you
are going to see Xcode right here you
just you will have the button like
download here so once you have our get
so once you get it our downloaded you
are going to have Xcode to be installed
on your machine successfully once you
have Xcode installed we need to have
Xcode related command tools to be
installed command-line tools so in order
to test or check if those are already
available the easiest way is to
reinstall the same command-line tools
using the terminal window so once your
Xcode has been installed you have to say
Xcode - select double - install so this
is the command which actually installs
command line tools of Xcode on your Mac
so once I press that in my case I
already have it installed so that is the
reason I get this error of saying that
command line tools are already installed
so if you do not have the command line
tools installed this automatically
installs all the command line tools
necessary for your Mac using the Xcode
related framework and from then onwards
you will be able to go with homebrew and
at the same time work with Xcode related
command line tools
okay so imagine that you have Xcode and
at the same time command-line tools of
Xcode installed on your machine now we
are going to see on how to install
homebrew so let's open our browser just
type in homebrew so we are going to see
homebrew the missing package manager of
Mac OS so this is the first one which we
are going to hit at it and you can see
there is a command right here so just
copy this command go to your terminal
and just paste it and just press ENTER
that actually make sure that homebrew is
installed on your machine so it will be
asking for a couple of confirmations
here you can see plus returns or just
for a Center and at the same time in the
in my case it is asking for the password
that is the administrator password so
just provide the administrator password
here
so let's give it a moment to install
okay once you have brew installed you
can just clear and double check if it is
installed by going through the command
brew - V which essentially shows you the
version of the homebrew which has been
installed in your machine so in this
case it is home 1:05 and that is the
version we have got and now the next
thing is to install node.js on your
machine so the easiest way is you can
search the existing libraries of the
brew by going with brew search and
provide whatever the package name you
would like to search so in this case I
can provide node if you don't provide
any it is going to give you all the
currently packages currently valuable
packages for installing using prove so
if you take a list here you are going to
see node somewhere so let me search for
node here quickly and let us go for that
so there you go so you should be having
node right here so this is where it says
that it has got the package called node
where you can install it so the other
way is you can quickly search using brew
search node so which essentially gives
you all the node related packages or all
the package names having node as part of
their names
okay just cancelled it so let me clear
so now I need to install node I go to
brew and I'm asking brew to install the
package called node so this is the only
command you require in order to have
node.js along with node package manager
to be installed on your Mac so just
press Enter if you do not have node or
if you would like to check whether node
is installed or not you can just say no
- way and right now you can see there is
node node installed similarly you can
also test whether node package manager
is available in your machine or not by
just typing NPM - we and you can see I
don't have node a node p.m. in
p.m. on my machine at the moment so I'm
going to go ahead with pro install node
and press Enter
okay so we are done so we have node a
node package manager or NPM in simple
already installed on your machine so let
me clear and test it NPM - we so you
should be able to see their version of
NPM and whenever I say no - we you are
going to see node also on your machine
installed okay so in order to test node
the simple way is to actually write from
write some JavaScript and execute using
node so for that purpose you can use any
of the text editors you may be
comfortable with like sublime or
webstorm if you have license or you can
also use Visual Studio code so in my
case I just wanted to use a very simple
text editor called
text Wrangler so let me have a couple of
variables here to be declared something
like a equal to 10 and B equal to 20 and
I would like to have a console dot log
provide some I mean I would like to have
the sum of a and B to be displayed and
this is the Java Script which I would
like to save so I go to file and I'm
going to save it in a particular app so
right now I do not have that folder so
let me create that folder so I go to my
path so in this case I would like to
create right here so let us consider I
would like to create apps and inside
apps I would like to have another new
folder called my app to be created so or
in this case abs Eero one whatever you
would like to call it as so I am inside
this so let me jump into this particular
folder so before even saving this file I
need to have that app 0 1 folder to be
actually what I say initiated with node
so I need to have the installation of
node on that particular folder so in
order to achieve that I need to go to
into that folder
going to say CD apps and inside that I
am going to say AB zero one so right now
I am on ABS ero one so which is nothing
but this guy and I need to have this
particular app zero one folder to be
converted to a node application so which
means I need to initiate the node
package manager I mean under a node
package manager in order to have this
application or this folder to return to
a node application so for that I need to
use NPM in it as the command right
inside the folder called AB zero one so
just press ENTER and now it is going to
ask me on all the details of my
particular application so in this case
the default values AB 0 one for the
names I just press ENTER and what is the
version of my application 1 any
description if you would like to say
just in this case I just keep on
pressing enter so that it takes all the
defaults so you can provide much more
information if you really need to have a
beautiful application to be developed
using node.js so in this case as it is a
demonstration I just kept on pressing
enter in order to take all the defaults
and finally it is asking for the
confirmation I press yes again and now
you can see it has actually created
package dot Jason so this is important
every particular node.js application in
general is supposed to have package
rotation which includes all the
dependency related files and also
explains what exactly is your
application as well so you can still
open that with your text or angular and
see what's going on you can see this
actually includes the exact details what
you have provided while you are trying
to convert your folder as a node
application ok so let me close this
okay so now I have my node.js related
JavaScript I need to save this so I go
to file and save and while I'm saving
this I really want that one to be saved
right inside my AB 0 1 folder so I go to
add 0 1 folder and click Save ok I
should have saved in a different name
with a different name here let me save
as once again
I save as I should have saved with the
extension JavaScript file so that was my
mistake so let me go in here and in this
case I'm going to say sample gorgeous so
just press you here ok now once it has
turned to JavaScript file it knows that
it needs all kinds of highlighting to be
done just for our better readability so
let me minimize this and let me remove
this guy we don't need this and you have
sampled ojs right here so in order to
check whether our node is currently
working on our machine or not all you
have to do is just execute this sample
at yes the simplest way use the node
command and then provide the name of
your javascript file available so the
moment I press this you can see you have
some to be automatically calculated
based on whatever the script you already
have as part of your sample to GL so in
this case and just adding 10 and 20 to
be displayed as part of console dot log
so in that way you can have no J's and
node package manager to be installed
using homebrew and test using a very
simple javascript file
