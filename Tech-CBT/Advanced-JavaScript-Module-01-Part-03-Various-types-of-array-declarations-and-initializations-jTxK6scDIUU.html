on various ways of declaring and
initializing JavaScript errors so first
of all the simplest way or say there are
quite a few number of ways but we have a
vague using array so air is a reserved
word and it can also be called as a
function and using this particular add a
keyword we can actually create an array
by providing the number of elements you
would like to add to the array and of
course the number of elements whatever
you would like to provided during the
declaration itself is optional so you
can use the add a keyword to actually
create an array and you can add items
later so the next thing is that you can
declare and initialize using the error
function itself so as I mentioned error
I could also be array is also a function
so error itself is a function and now
you can have multiple items to be added
to the same array within the same line
so which means you are declaring and
initializing at the same time so all of
these four values will be added to the
same array so you can see items are
added during the declaration itself so
you are declaring and initializing the
array at the same time and the array is
going to have four elements so the next
one is using the set brackets so you can
see this particular array right now is
having four elements and all of those
elements are actually encapsulated
inside square brackets so whenever you
have any kind of initialization to
available using the set brackets and if
you have certain number of values inside
those you can consider that it is being
declared and initialized in the form of
an array and again it is not necessary
to have all of those values to be
provided at the same time as the
declaration you can also define
something like this so
which means this array essentially is
empty but you can add as many number of
elements as you want or the period of
time so there is no real reason to
provide the length of the array anytime
so you can just put empty set brackets
and the later you can add as many number
of elements as possible so let us have a
demonstration or various declarations
and initializations of arrays so let me
create a new file I would like to call
this one as 0 3 for now and I would like
to start with script tag so I would like
to declare an error in this case so as I
mentioned this is the first type using
the array function
I'm also specifying the length of the
array which is optional and now you can
add the elements to the error by
defining the position and the value so
this particular value is going to be
placed in the first position which is
nothing but 0 the position similarly you
can have one more and I can provide
another value similarly I can have one
more and I can have some other value one
more another value so now that we have
array I would like to display the array
and in this case I would like to have a
function called display array and I
would like to send an errors parameter
to that so I would like to display what
are all the elements available in this
array so for that purpose first of all
let me have UI elements I would like to
have 4 buttons to be declared so
which will be having something like this
input type equal to button and value
equal to show a day one and on clicking
of this guy I would like to call display
a day one
so essentially you can see that a r1 is
nothing but whatever we have declared
here so similarly I would like to have a
couple more buttons for displaying
various other areas so I would like to
have era two three and four so I would
like to have more Alice to be created in
future and for now I am going to just
declare all of those and once I have all
the buttons I would like to have
horizontal rule and then the do tag
which essentially lists out all the
elements available in the array so in
order to get reference of this guy I
will be having another variable called
results deal and I will be using
document dot get element by ID and then
I am going to use the same results do so
prior to that I would also like to get
the number of elements available in the
array I pass to this so you can see I'm
using this one
so whatever the error you pass to that I
am going to get the length out of it and
I'm placing that value inside the
variable N and now in order to display
everything here I need to remove
everything already available inside of
the div for the first time we may not
have any elements but whenever I click
on second time I would like to remove
all the elements which have been
available inside this tag and then
recreate all of those so in my previous
video I already explained on how to
remove all the existing elements using a
while loop and I'm using the same thing
right now
so instead of
items let's do here I'm going to use
whatever the do I'm using right now in
this case so after that I would like to
actually add all the elements using the
for loop which I explained in my
previous videos I'm going to use the
same thing here except that instead of
items list do I need to have results due
to be added here so let us check if
everything is working perfectly
so I save this and let me open the
browser and let me click on the first
button okay so I ran into an error let
us check so list is not defined of
course I have list of I which is a
typing mr. cute I had to use the same
array and that is going to be our list
so which is nothing but the error I am
going to use the same area whatever
being sent to this function to be used
in here so let us test it again and I
click on show and now you can see I have
all the elements so let us test the
other three as well
so I don't have array two three and four
declared so let us do all those kinds of
declarations as well so as I mentioned
apart from this particular way I also
have other ways to declare an array so
let us do added two so I can use array
function but at the same time I can
provide the values right inside the
function itself during the declaration
itself so which means I am going to have
all the elements to be initialized as
arrays while declaring the error itself
so this is another way of doing it and I
can also have another way and I am going
to call this one as a array three in
this case using the set brackets however
I can provide all of those values
whatever I provided here to be directly
made available as part of the set black
so this is just another way of doing
things and I can also have another are
to be defined with just only the black
braces sorry set brackets and then I can
add more elements to that later so
something like this so you can say Jack
3 or something and similarly a couple
more and I can have one and I can have
two and I can have shared and
acknowledge have done or whatever and
ensure that the address could also be
holding various types of data so I can
have had a with a string and integer
another integer a boolean value or any
floating point value all of these are
valid so I don't have another button for
era 5 so let us create another button
for air and 5 here and I would like to
call this one as a RFI and I'm going to
send ahead a 5 for display
so let us strictly view inside the
browser and see what's going on so array
1 which we have already seen so it's
going to display in this way and at Aitu
you can see it is actually displaying
era 2 3 is having a problem so let me
see what's going on for number 3 okay I
don't see any problem here there is all
right 3 I do have era 3 here which
should be fine did I send error 3 here
yes I did and oh ok I think I'm missing
something so Airy 1 2 3 4 5 is different
here supposed to be just this and I have
that so
let me refresh this
click show so now you can see I have all
the values and three and four okay so
okay sure add a five is actually
displaying everything show add a four
and A four is what we have so everyone
is going to have only three values which
is exactly what we are seeing added for
is three values so edit three is also
going to be having the same values as we
have here so in order to have the
confusion to be gone let us put this
last three so that we will see some
difference in the output when we are
clicking those that's it so let me
refresh the game so sure every one which
was all the ones to all the tools three
all the trees for all fours and five it
is essentially anything but all the air
elements of various types to be
available as part of the single Ally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
