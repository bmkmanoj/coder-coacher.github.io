node.js tools for visual studio in order
to have no JS tools for visual studio to
be installed on your machine you should
already have no js' and node package
manager already installed so those two
are the prerequisites before even
installing no chairs so if you did not
install node.js or npm on your machine
please follow me previous two videos
accordingly so the easiest way to
install node.js or NPM is just by going
through node.js
directly and just click install so the
moment you click install it will be
automatically going to guide you on the
paths and the NPM package manager and
everything and everything is almost
straightforward and you could just get
nodejs and npm installed once you have
no Jess and NPM install make sure that
there's are added two paths so whenever
I mentioned added two paths the first
thing is that go to your command prompt
and just type in node you should be able
to get a prompt from the node whenever
it is successfully installed so in this
case now you can see I can just type in
dot help for which I am having node repl
commands to be executed and dot exit to
come out of node and similarly I can say
NPM just to check if node package
manager is installed so in this case I
have NPM version 2.1 point 1 already
installed on my machine so no Jess and
NPM both of those are going to be
automatically installed and added to the
path the moment you go through the
node.js escalation process which I
covered in depth in previous of my two
videos so in this case I would like to
have no J's tools for visual studio to
be installed so before even installing
that stuff I just wanted to show you
what are of the currently available
joust
types you have as part of visual studio
so the moment you type in file new
project so let us see what are all the
various templates we have so in this
case you have Visual Basic C sharp and
so on and we have typescript and
JavaScript so if you open JavaScript you
can see I have store abs or multi device
hybrid or whatever and similarly I have
typescript essentially just only the
hybrid in this case so once you install
node.js for visual studio tools you are
going to find more templates in this
section so let us install node.js for
visual studio first so make sure that we
just studio is closed while you are
installing node.js for visual studio you
open your browser and just type in no
just tools for Visual Studio 2013 in
this case so which automatically gives
the first link to codeplex dot-com to go
in there and download that particular
installation file and once I have the
installation file all you do is just
executed I just accept the terms click
install
it will be asking for some confirmation
so just for the SAS so it looks like
we've got no Jess tools for Visual
Studio successfully installed just click
finish
so prior to click in finish you can also
see that it is asking us to install
node.js before even starting in TBS so
as I mentioned earlier we need to have
node.js installed so as my machine
already got no GS and npm installed i
don't need to go through this step again
so just like finish for now so close my
browser and let us open with a studio
and now i go to file new project and let
us see what are all the templates i have
in here and now you can say i have the
javascript for which there is a special
section called node.js and as part of
this section i have all the necessary
templates to work with node.js
in better fashion so let me open
typescript and you can say as part of
the typescript we already have another
section called node.js so both of these
two will be automatically installed as
part of node.js to this your studio
tools and as i would like to have a new
node.js application to be tested so that
we can go through about all the features
available in Visual Studio while you are
working with node.js which is studio
tools the easiest way is to start with a
blank node.js console application of
course you can start with other things
like we have if you already have a
node.js application you can create a
project from there or if you wanted to
link with the edge or and you can or if
you would like to have your own web
application to be developed which will
be using the core concepts of node.js
including the socket ring and ever
you can start this one or if you'd like
to have X plus J s to be used for your
web application tier you can go with
this one and we have other various
applications
I mean templates very similar to what we
have here so in this case I just would
like to go with a simple one called
blank node.js console application so
just like okay for now
okay so now we already have hello world
which is written using javascript you
can see that and within the solution
Explorer you can also see like I have a
project the same name as I asked it to
work with and at the same time it has
got an NPM branch exclusively for the
NPM or say node packages so this is very
similar to our references fold or
whatever we are going to have in asp.net
or other d'arnot applications but
essentially whenever you would like to
have any kind of node packages to be
installed or brought forward into your
application then we are going to use
this stuff but anyway before we are
going further this is the first file
where the application is going to be
starting its execution and in this case
I would like to have hello world to be
executed I mean shown to the user so
once I click start which means
essentially I am asking it to start and
execute it
so it is asking for my firewalls I just
fellow access and now you can say got
hello world and you can have any of that
kind of information like you know you
can use any of the Java scripts
including variable ABC all of that stuff
to be used whenever you would like to
have you know JavaScript applications to
be executed on node.js platform so let
me close this and let me start it again
and now have hello world again okay so
on top of whatever we have right now
whenever you would like to have the node
related command prompt to be opened you
can always do that in a couple of ways
for the first thing is that when you
when your right click here you are going
to see open command prompt here so this
is nothing but you are going to the task
from - directly the current world so it
will be directly opening your particular
command pop into the sea
application folder whatever you have
here so once you have in here all you
have to do is you know and you can just
say something like no commands whatever
you might have or NPM commands you might
have you can use any of those particular
commands in order to manage your
particular nodejs application so this is
one way once you are into the command
point you can work with all of the NPM
commands as I have shown in my previous
video
similarly node.js commands as I have
shown in another video so all of those
commands are valid you can install
update or uninstall all of your
particular packages right at the command
to whatever you are going to see here or
there are a couple more methods on how
you can accomplish the same so for
example is imagine I would like to have
I would like to have the kind of package
to be installed so in this case I would
like to go for underscore dot J's that
is the package I would like to install
in my particular application so the
easiest way if you are already familiar
with NPM commands go with NPM install
underscore that is the name of the
package I would like to install and then
I can say - - say oh so the moment you
say in this fashion what happens is that
it is going to install underscore into
your particular application that is the
package it is going to install and the -
- save we will essentially update
package to Jason so if you open package
that Jason for now you can see that it
does not have any dependencies but the
moment I execute this command it is
going to install this package underscore
into our application and not only that
as I'm using - - save it is going to
update package dot JSON as well so let
me press enter here and now you can see
it has automatically installed and
score Russian one point eight point
three which is the latest test at this
time and at the same time if you switch
back to package the chase and you can
see it is asking something has changed
passes and now you can see when the
dependencies have been added so this is
one way to actually install any kind of
packages you would like to have and all
of the related commands like uninstall
update listing all of those comers
whatever I explained in my previous
video for node package manager are still
valid here and all of those are going to
be applicable for this application
the moment you start and work within the
same folder as part of the command
prompt so let me exit from here so as I
said there are quite a few way quite a
few number of ways to work with this one
so let us look into a couple more as we
already covered the command prompt let
us go through another one which is
interactive with window so this is
essentially nothing it is nothing but no
jazz prompt so if you are familiar with
not just commands like if I go to
command prompt and whenever you type in
node you are actually provided with that
particular prompt that is exactly the
same prompt whatever you will have here
as part of a Joe studio so now I just
wanted to say that exit and close this
comment run for now but in this case I
can actually type in whatever the nodejs
commands are available so if I say dot
help it is going to give us all the help
related stuff so I can say dot CLS it's
for clearing the screen and similarly I
can still go with all the NPM commands
but just typing dot NPM and then
providing whatever I would like to have
so in this case I would like to
uninstall whatever I already installed
earlier so I can say NPM uninstall
underscore - - save so which means and
trying to uninstall the one which has
been already installed here and remove
the same from package dot JSON all of
this you are using all of this you are
actually doing so using nodejs interact
two windows so the moment I type in here
now you can see it has it has said like
uninstall successful and just plus yes
and now you can see the dependencies are
empty and it also removed underscore
from your package so in that way we can
have any kind of package to be installed
or uninstalled either from interactive
window or from command window I mean
command prompt so apart from these two
ways there is one more way for which
most of the visual studio developers
will be familiar with which is you can
just right click here sorry
not here on the NPM right click here and
then go for install new NPM packages not
only that if you are having any of the
packages currently listed as part of
package date Jason but they are missing
in one way or another you can go with
this option if you would like to update
all of your packages or any of those
particular packages with the latest
versions then you can go with update as
well so you can use any of these
particular options and they are UI based
are not command aligned at all so the
moment I say install new NPM package you
can see it is going to essentially load
all the respective index of the packages
list which are made which is made
available as part of node.js directory
online so it is going to build up
everything and all of that building of
indexes is going to be stored locally in
the form as a cache and that is going to
be displayed immediately so just give it
a couple of seconds in order to get that
information out so there we go
now after having all of the cache
prepared now we can search for whatever
the packages you would like to have so
in this case the moment I type in
underscore now you can see this is
exactly what it is asking for what we
are asking for and we can select
whatever the package we need the amount
of is selected you can see we get all
the respect to information and we can
also choose in which direction it needs
to be installed either in the standard
or global which means
globally available for all the
applications or development or other
options so in this case I would like to
go for standard and this is the option
which says if I install this please make
a note in package dot JSON so that it
will be always made as part of
dependences so if any other third-party
developer wants to install your node
module it is going to list out all the
dependencies so that he can understand
our particular project and what are all
the packages my project is really
depending upon so it is a really good
idea to have all of the dependencies to
be listed as part of package dot JSON so
once we have that already checked the
next thing is that just click install so
the moment I click install now you can
see I already got underscored at one
point eight point three click close and
it is asking to refresh this file just
press Yes and you can see I already have
underscore that has to be installed
so in order to test this particular
underscore library for now so the
easiest way is that you need to import
it and the way to import that particular
library into your application page is
using the require and the name of that
particular package and you got the
entire object which is essentially
nothing but the instance of that
particular package so now I can say you
dot each and I can say something like
any of the error here in this case I
would like to say one two three that is
the array and I would like to execute a
function for each of those particular
elements so which means each of those
elements are going to be available as
part of M which means this function is
going to be executed for each and every
particular element available in that
array so after that I would like to have
that particular element M whatever the
value available inside am to be
displayed on to the console so I can
just say consulted log M so let me do
something different so I would like to
have a square of that particular element
to be displayed always the moment I
click on start you should be able to see
two four six so which means that's
exactly I would like to have which means
each of those particular elements have
been executed or evaluated using this
function and I am essentially testing it
around so that is one way of doing
things so the next thing is that we can
also have various other ways to do what
I say compare sorry
debugging so Visual Studio is really
famous for debugging so we also wanted
to check on how we can have various
debugging options currently available as
part of this so you can just pass a
breakpoint here so which means you are
marking a breakpoint there which means
it has to stop at that breakpoint the
moment the runtime hits at that location
so I click start and now you can see it
has already stopped right there so the
moment I go there you can see it is
already giving the value of M which is
nothing but 1 and in this case so I
press continue and now you can see it
has stopped for the second which is
nothing but M and all the related call
stack like from where it is being
executed the breakpoints command window
immediate window locals watch whatever
you are familiar with Visual Studio
development all of those debugging tools
are made available for you in order to
have any kind of node.js based
applications to be developed so now that
we have some understanding with respect
to node.js which is studio tools you can
play around by installing more and more
packages from node and then start
developing your own great node.js
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
