array which contains functions as
elements so let us start with some
scripting now so imagine I am actually
creating an area and currently it is
initialized to an empty array and the
first element which is supposed to be
made available for the array is going to
be an anonymous function so I am saying
that the first element inside the array
itself is a function so as part of this
function I would like to say something
like first for now somebody much after
that so similarly I would like to check
another function sorry another array
element which is also a function but I
would like to have an alert with second
similarly another element which is going
to be two but with the third another
again which is going to be three and in
this case fourth now you have created
and initialized an area with empty later
you added four elements to the array and
each of those elements are nothing but
the functions themselves and each of
those function carry out different tasks
so now in order to execute all of these
functions the only way first of all I
have to have a first loop which
essentially goes through each of those
elements in the array and why they get
that particular element I really wanted
to execute the respective function so
let us start with the furlough and I
would like to start with I and it has to
go till the length of the area I plus
plus
so I had the for-loop and now let us get
that particular function so function f
equal to array of I so which means if I
when u is 0 I am saying that a get which
is available inside array of 0 so error
of 0 itself is a function and I am
saying that get this definition into a
variable called f so f contains the
definition of this particular function
during the first iteration for the
second iteration f is going to get the
definition of this for the third
iteration f is going to get the
different definition of this so once I
have the respected definitions all I
would like to do is just execute the
function so the definition available
inside the F is going to be executed the
moment I write the paranthesis your so
let us see if this works so you need to
receive for alerts 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 so you can
automate this without really using in
this way or assigning to any variable so
as long as I have access to the very
element which is a definition as it is a
function definition I can just enclose
the parenthesis right there so this
essentially gives the definition once I
have the definition I am saying that
these execute immediately so this syntax
is also valid so I go in here and now
you can see first second third and
fourth so in that way you can either
have those particular error elements to
be assigned to the respective variables
or you can just directly execute those
particular functions which are available
as elements inside the array
