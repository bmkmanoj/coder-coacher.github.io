to install configure and test
nodejs installations on windows egg
machine in this video we are going to
look into node package manager in short
it is called as NPM so NPM is the tool
which we can call it as a package
manager where we can search for various
packages on the web and get them
installed or say imported into our
applications and use those as part of
our application development and
especially JavaScript so whenever you
would like to have any kind of external
javascript libraries to be installed and
as long as they follow the rules with
respect to github the versioning and so
on
most of those particular packages will
be related in the form of node.js
modules so using those node.js modules
we can have our particular applications
to be developed very easily so for
example we have jQuery similarly we have
underscore we have Express so these are
all various and powerful JavaScript
frameworks available open source on the
web where we can have all of those
particular libraries to be included as
part of our application and on top of
that we can have those particular
modules to be used in our application
and finally we can also have our own
modules to be developed and the release
in the form of packages so that other
developers throughout the world can
reuse the same kind of packages as part
of their application development so let
us start with installing a particular
NPM out sorry installing an NPM package
so on this machine I already have
node.js installed and along with that
comes NPM so I have no GS and NPM
install as I did yes I have already
covered that as part of my previous
video I am NOT going to demonstrate that
but just imagine and consider that we
have no js' and npm already installed on
me locally i mean on my machine locally
so in order to test whether nodejs is
available or not you can go to the
command prompt and just type in node so
the moment you type in node you should
be having a special prompt here which
essentially is waiting for certain
commands for nodejs to operate or now I
just say dot exit so that you know I can
get out of that node environment and you
can also type in NPM so that you can
test whether node package manager has
been already installed or mod so as long
as you have something of this sort which
means NPM is already installed in your
machine ok so imagine I would like to
create a new application for node.js and
I would like to have various packages to
be imported for that particular
application and I would like to put all
that stuff inside a folder called
node.js samples so let me switch back to
that so I go to node.js
samples ok so this is the folder where I
would like to have a new application to
be developed and each of the
applications usually will be developed
in a separate folder where essentially
that folder name itself sometimes could
be called as application name so in this
case I would like to create something
like samples 0 1 so that is going to be
in my application and now you can see I
already have the sample 0 1 creator so
let me go inside sample Zeta 1 so right
now I will not have anything inside the
sample 0 1 so if you open it everything
is empty yes because it is just a new
folder anyway and now I can have various
node packages to be installed or I can
install various node packages from
various directories available on the web
and get them imported as part of my
application called sample 0 1 use those
in my JavaScript or say node.js
application and execute it and test it
but let me keep it simple
so in order to search for any of the
node.js libraries or say npm libraries
or NPM packages you can always go to NPM
j/s and you can see the first one is NPM
JS comm just go inside there and you can
always find various packages available
for your particular application
development for example you can see one
five eight or 158,000 packages have been
made available well the developers to
consume them and you order them and
develop the applications from and you
can see I have the very famous packages
like X plus J as grant Bower Cordova
especially for mobile based development
and all the various stuff so I can even
have angularjs and all the respective
cell so you can see if I type angular
you can see angular is going to be made
available so I can always install
angular just using this particular
command and similarly you can search for
for example J clothing and letter sensor
and now you can see I found jQuery there
so I can just select that and you can
see the command for that one is this one
so you can install all those particular
libraries and make them available
locally for your application and in
order to do that first things that you
really need to know what kind of
packages you would like to import so if
you don't know their names then it will
be pretty difficult on what packages you
being used for what so first of all you
should be able to understand what
packages are going to be necessary for
your application and then from there
onwards you can search for those
particular packages from this website
and you know you can start installed
also by using the respective commands
not only from the web you can also
search directly from your particular
command prompt about all those libraries
so for example I have a command called
NPM search
so NPM search and then just say jQuery
and you will be finding a ton literally
a ton of libraries with respect to
jQuery and just hold for a couple of
seconds so that you could bring in all
the respect to jQuery libraries to the
machine it is not going to bring in but
it is going to bring in only the list
and you can see we literally have tons
of jQuery stuff related information here
so wherever it finds the word jQuery it
tries to bring in whether it could be in
the package anymore in the description
somehow so this one as I mentioned may
not be that good whenever you would like
to search for the packages I would
rather use this particular website in
order to find the packages packages if
they are really available in certain
situations even here I might really find
it difficult to find the respective
packages as we are literally having
thousands of packages there so if you
are not finding the proper packages here
again you can search using Google so for
example using Google I can just say NPM
underscore for example so I'm just
trying to find underscore.js library
using NPM so all you can do is just
search for that and you will be lucky
enough somehow to find that particular
underscore shares which is going to be
still part of NPM TS website so the
moment I click on that now you can see
it is the JavaScript library where you
can get it installed using NPM install
underscore so those are the ways
essentially to find the packages however
to install those packages we can use
various ways but we'll be starting from
the command prompt first enter two in a
simplest manner so let me clear the
screen and let me close this particular
browser as we are not going to need it
and let us ensure that this particular
folder is currently empty no information
is available inside it and now let us
first
check for a library which means I would
like to search for a particular library
I know that it exists but I would like
to view the information relative to
their library not really searching it so
imagine I would like to view the
information or say more information
about a particular library which may be
available as part of NPM so all I'm
going to do is just say NPM view
underscore so underscore is a JavaScript
library in this case just something like
that so the moment I press enter you are
going to see tons of information from
that one
and when I say tons it really has lots
of information where it makes sense in
certain scenarios for us to understand
and it may make sense for all of the
rest of the application somehow but you
can see it has really crossed B on my
screen limit here so let me look at the
very initial thing so I can just say I
can use the same command I provide more
so whenever I say pipe more it is going
to stop it for every page before
scrolling to the next one so press ENTER
and now you can see is waiting here
there so it started from the version 1.2
0.3 ever since it was available as part
of NPM and it has gone through all of
these versions so just press the space
in order to go to the next page and now
you can see it has gone to one point
eight point three and now we already
have other information and the more and
more information like who are all the
users contributed to that where exactly
is the repository for github so which
means you can get all the source code of
that particular library from this kit
and apart from the users list I can have
other information like if deed has got
any dependencies or whatever and the
respect to licenses and so on and how to
get the testing and other information
already made available the documentation
and so on and what are all the files
which are going to be installed once you
actually import that particular package
so we really have lots of information
there so the command as I mentioned you
can just see NPM view and the respective
JavaScript library package or say node
package name so just using view you are
not really importing it but having more
information to be showing about that
particular library even before you
wanted to install it on your local
machine or say for the respective
application so there are also couple
more commands like I can say and just in
npm view underscore washer for example
so this gives me the latest version
currently available as part of NPM so
similarly if I wanted to search for
jQuery version I can say jQuery version
what is the latest version of jQuery in
this case now as of now we have two
point one point four but imagine I would
like to look for all the versions
available so I can say NPM you
underscore were shown what else so just
add s so the moment you add s you are
going to find all the list of those
particular versions currently you can
import as part of NPM so using NPM you
can install any of these versions not
necessarily be the latest so that is the
way how you can find for the latest
version without using s and all the
versions just by adding s so now that we
understood on how to search for the
packages how to view more information
about the packages and how to look for
the versions of the respect to package
and so on now it is time actually to
install something for our application
called sample zero one so how do we
install so the easiest way as already I
have shown you just go for NPM install
and they give the package name in this
case I can just say underscore so the
moment I do that it is going to install
the latest version which is currently
available for the respective package
and currently you can see it is autumn
it has automatically created a folder
called node and discord modules if it is
not available if it is already available
it will not recreate it but instead it
will be going inside the same folder and
have that particular module to be
installed so this is essentially a sub
folder inside node underscore modules so
the moment I open it you can see and the
score is the one which we installed and
further if you dig in you can see what
are all the files which got care I mean
which came with dot installation and you
can see this is a kind of a full-blown
JavaScript file where you can really
understand the code and this is the
minimized version of it and the
respective mapping file and if we need
any more information about this one you
can certainly look into packaged or jsm
so package dot jason is a kind of
special file which essentially lists out
the entire information whatever we have
seen earlier using NPM view so whenever
you use NPM view it is going to find
this particular package dot Jason for
that package and it opens that
particular package dot Jason Reeves all
that information and provides us the
information the moment you type in VO
NPM view so let us open this particular
file in notepad plus plus for now and
you can see it has got all the
description the home page the keywords
over orders and the respective
information you can also see like you
know what are all the scripts we have
and what are the files which are going
to be installed as part of the
application and so on all the
description about that particular
package all the dependencies others and
and also the current version on our own
respective stuff each and every stuff is
made available as part of this and you
can see this is the one currently
identifies that particular package so
for each and every version we are going
to have various of the respect to IDs
based on the versions we might have and
the list of files are going to be
available here
and so on so in general each of those
particular packages will have the
respective packaged or JSL so now our
particular application sample zero one
has got that particular module already
installed locally so if you switch back
now let us again do npm install
underscore and just enter and again it
did not do anything but it said it has
installed but instead let us go back and
see you will not find any difference so
it is not going to say it is already
installed or something like that so
imagine we would like to list out all
the modules which has which have been
installed as part of our particular
applications and then there is one more
important thing whenever I say
application it is sample zero one in
this case so this module or say this
package underscore has been installed
only for this application sample zero
one if I have another folder called
sample zero two here that is considered
as a separate application and whatever
the modules or whatever the packages you
might have installed in the first
application of sample zero one will not
be available in the second application
7:02 so those particular packages
installed inside the respective folder
are only men are meant only for that
particular application and not beyond
that folder sample zero one which means
those packages are local to that
particular application and they can
never be automatically installed on
other applications so that is one
important thing to note okay now
switching back to or what is null thing
where we are how do we know what are all
the I mean packages installed as part of
our application so in this case you can
just go to the you know folder and list
out everything but imagine you are
really having hundreds of applications
here and you might not really find the
version information immediately so you
can see I have underscore okay which is
fine I got underscore in
on my for my application but what
version is it
I cannot immediately get that
information until and unless I open
packaged or Jason or underscored RGS
using some editor and then find that
particular version so it could be
problematic if I really wanted to have
the list of all the packages along with
the reduction in information and so on
so for that purpose we have a command
called NPM list so I can just say NPM LS
or list so either of those two should
work so in this case I just wanted to go
for NPM list so now you can see it says
under this application sample 0 1 we
have installed underscore version 1
point 8 point 3 so let us consider I am
installing one more called NPM install
Express for example so this is another
big Java framework and let us install it
and see what's going on so it is taken
couple of seconds to install it and you
can see and it has installed tons of
other information along with that one so
in this case you can see Express is
having dependencies on several other
packages and all of those packages will
also be installed automatically so now
let us see NPM list and see what's going
on now I have Express which is installed
under sample 0 1 and Express has got a
dependency on some other and it has
dependency on some other and in that way
the entire tree of all the dependencies
are also going to be shown along with
the respective modules we have installed
we have installed only X cuss but the
Express has got several other
dependencies where it is depending on
the respect to packages and those are
also automatically brought into our
application so along with Express we
also installed an underscore and we
should be seeing underscore at the very
bottom right now so if we open node
modules here you can see I have both of
these two at the moment I open Express
again Express has got its own node
underscore modules as because all of the
dependencies for this
Express packages will be made available
as part of node modules subfolder for
that package and you can see we have
really tons of those particular packages
which are for which expresses depending
upon and all of that information is made
available and let us open package dot
JSON of experts and see what's going on
so I have all the contributors others
and the respective things which are good
and here you can see there exists
another section exclusively for
dependencies so whenever review you try
to view the information related to
Express package by using NPM view you
are going to see even this list of
dependencies as well and we are going to
have all of the respective dependencies
to be shown along with all the respect
of other information of directories or
you know maintainer verbs and what are
all the files which are going to be
installed and so on anyway now that we
have some understanding on how and where
the modules are currently being
installed let us check on how to
uninstall something so the easiest way
instead of using NPM install just use
NPM uninstall and in this case I would
like to say please uninstall Express
this for Center and it says it is gone
so let me again go for NPM list and now
you can see I am back with only
underscore and Express is completely
gone so the moment I open this one now
you can see I have only underscore and
Express and all of its dependencies are
automatically removed at the moment we
say uninstall so in that way I can
uninstall the Stars and now let us
imagine I would like to install a
particular version so let me uninstall
even underscore as well so let me
uninstall underscore in this case so
even underscore is been uninstalled and
now you can see it has removed node and
score modules as well as because you
know no more packages are available
so everything is lost so the moment you
remove it I mean the moment you
uninstall that everything is gone and
even the folder node underscore modules
and so now let us try to install a
particular version of the package but
not really the latest so as I mentioned
earlier you can always get the list of
versions by just typing NPM underscore
washers sorry
NPM view so this is important
do not forget view NPM view underscore
versions s is important so it says that
I have all of these versions which can
be installed individually or as
necessary using NPM so imagine I would
like to install one point five point oh
but not one point eight point three so
there is used way row four NPM install
underscore which is the name of the
package using the @ symbol just queue
the version number so which is exactly
on how it is going to list here one
point five point or just give the exact
same thing here and just press ENTER so
the moment I press ENTER you can see it
has installed node modules and let us
open the underscore and let us see what
this particular underscore GS is about
the moment I open it and now you can see
it is version one point five point oh
and as I mentioned you don't really need
to open any file in order to check all
the list of libraries of packages
installed for your application so the
easiest we'll just type in NPM list and
it is going to show you what are all the
packages available along with the
respective versions so as I installed
one point five point over you got one
point five point o in this case as well
so but in order to uninstall it you
don't really need to specify the version
but you can say just NPM and install
underscore and it knows what to do and
now you can see that is gone completely
so now if I say NPM list now you have no
modules installed and as it is giving
entry
and now let us consider I would like to
have my own package dot Jason 5 to be
created with all of those particular
modules my particular application is
depending upon so imagine sample 0 1 is
my application which is depending on
something like underscore or Xpress and
so on and I developed a package called
sample 0 1 and imagine there exists
another third-party light developer who
wants to use my package sample 0 1 he
needs to understand like my particular
package sample 0 1 about its information
what are all the files it is going to
install what are all the dependencies it
has and all of the information will be
first viewed by a third-party developer
even prior to installation but who is
going to provide package dot Jason it is
going to put the developer's
responsibility who is developing sample
0 1 so in this case I am the developer
who is going to develop sample 0 1
library and make that particular package
to the third-party with developer so if
such is the case the first thing is that
we need to have package JSON file to be
created and the easiest way for creating
that particular file is using NPM in it
so which means you are saying that
initialize my particular sample 0 and
application in such a way that it could
be treated as an NPM package so the
moment you type this NPM in it you can
see it starts to ask more details about
our particular package so that all of
the information I provide right now will
be automatically added to package dot
JSON so in this case it is asking me
what is the name of my application so it
says by default it is suggesting samples
801 as because it has taken my folder
name into the consideration so in this
case I can say my sample app for example
sorry it should not have any capital
letters so I can say my my sample app
and it is asking me what washroom is
currently my application or my package
so I just say 1.0.0 so you can give any
version number you would like to provide
or press ENTER just to take one point
zero point zero now it is asking me for
description I can say this is my trail
or this is my first NPM package to be
distributed throughout the world just
like that and now it is asking me what
is the entry point of my particular
application so in this case I just
wanted to take whatever it is asking
index dot J's
even they don't have it just for the
center for now if you do have any
certain JavaScript file which needs to
be considered as an entry point then you
need to provide that one here so for now
I just press Enter
it is asking me for testing command and
so on I just press ENTER for now git
repository I don't have a git repository
as of now so just for a central and this
is asked me for keywords I would like to
say sample or a trail or whatever and
just press ENTER and ordered it's going
to be me Jack and it is asking me the
license the default licensing scheme
whatever is available for now I just
wanted to take it which is IFC this for
a center and it is giving me right now
it is about to write packaged or JSON
file so which means it is about to
create a file called packaged or JSON in
this folder and it might look something
like this so with all the values
whatever I have provided here so it is
asking if it is okay so I just say yes
and now you can see I have package dot
J's and automatically created by NPM and
the moment I edit it and now you can see
this is exactly whatever the information
I provided earlier so in that way you
can have a default package dot J's and
to be made available for your package so
that in future if you distribute the
package the other developers are going
to have more information
your package directly from this package
door Jason so this is one way but there
is another way instead of that one
asking for all of those details you can
actually ask you just to create the
package de Jason but later you can
modify all those details using an editor
or whatever so the easiest way for that
is again using NPM in it but I am going
to say force so you can use double - two
hyphens force or just say - F any of
those two so double - two - force or
single - F you can also use a - Y or
double - s so any of these are going to
work so I'm so used to this double -
force so that I would like to have a new
packaged adjacent to be created and it
will be written in this way so for now
you can see the name what shown
description you can see it has provided
its own defaults for which I need to go
in there and modify all that information
as necessary so I can say if this is a
description for Mouse of course you can
provide something and keywords I can
provide something like you know sample
trail or whatever and other that is
going to be me and you can provide as
much as information as possible so just
let's say for now say close this okay so
that is one way of creating package -
Jason so how about the dependencies for
example as I mentioned earlier pack is
not Jason not only contains the
information of the order of the files it
also contains the dependencies of other
packages for which the current
application is depending upon so let me
install something so in this case I
would like to install NPM install
underscore so let us see what's going on
so I am trying to install the latest
version of underscore for my application
sample zero 1 plus central ok so there
is an error somewhere here so what
exactly is that way
okay that is the keyword error here okay
so let me go back and fix this so I
don't have here so let me remove the
keywords for now just remove that so
okay
now I have installed underscore so I
don't have a repository field or readme
data or whatever it was suggesting is
because from my package dot J's and it
couldn't find any of that information
but some but in one way or another it
has installed underscore so the moment
you open it you can see I have
underscore installed but if I open
package dot JSON
there is no dependency made available
here it does not record or it did not
record underscore package which I
installed and I was expecting that one
to be made available as part of bacon
package dot JSON and for some reason it
did not do that and let me try to
uninstall now okay that is gone so as
well as my node modules folder but as I
mentioned whenever you are installing
any kind of package it needs to be made
available or listed in the package dot
JSON so the easiest way is just add - -
save so the moment you do that it not
only installs underscore package into
your application but also adds that
respect to dependency information to
your package dot JSON if you don't do
this
it is going to be your responsibility to
open this package dot J's and manually
and add the respective dependency
information I find this one much easier
as because it knows exactly what to open
way to write and what to write it so it
makes my life easier
the moment I pass here s now I go to
package situation and open it and you
should be able to see dependencies and I
already have underscore as part of it so
in that way I can always have that
respective
what is a installed package to be always
made available or listed listed as part
of packaged adjacent and in order to
remove that we know that we can always
uninstall any kind of package however in
order to update back our particular
package that save it back is the Jason I
have to use save again so the moment I
type in now you can see that one is gone
and the moment you open package that
Jason you can see in the dependencies
even that one is gone too so let me
install a particular version like NPM
install underscore at the rate one point
5.0 so which means I would like to
install 1.5 version of underscore and I
would like to have that information to
be stored as part of package dot JSON as
the dependencies I just for Center and
you can see I have underscore and inside
this I should have that one point 5.0
which is nothing but whatever I install
and if the dependencies you can see that
exact version has been reflected so as
usual I can still go for and say NPM
list and you are going to see what are
all installed as part of yours
and there is one greatest command which
essentially shows you all the list of
libraries which are currently outdated
so which means now in this case you
install one point five point five it is
an outdated version compared with the
latest one one point eight point three
so as part of your application
development today you might be
installing lots of packages but after a
couple of weeks or same months most of
those packages might have been updated
with the latest versions and you would
like to check out what are all the
versions currently are outdated from
your application perspective and what
are all the latest relators made
available so for that purpose you can
just say NPM outdated and the moment you
say that you can see it says underscore
is the currently available or greater
thing
and it gives the current version what
you have as part of your installation
and what is the latest available so you
can see we have all the respective
information automatically and now you
can update it automatically by just
typing NPM update so care should be
taken the moment you say NPM update with
no package specification this one this
single command update really gets the
latest of all the packages available for
your particular application so if I
specify underscore then it is going to
update only that package if you don't
specify the package name it is going to
update all the packages to the latest
version for your entire application so
we have to be using this one in a very
careful manner otherwise we might
actually have other things to be broken
if certain features are duplicated our
removed from other packages so handle
this one with really care ok so now I
would like to underscore I would like to
update underscore alone but at the same
time as I mentioned I would like to
update package dot JSON so for that
purpose I need to end with I mean I need
to add I am in two hyphens and the save
so the moment I do that now you can see
it says it has updated to one point
eight point three and let me list it now
you can see I got one point eight point
three at the moment I open package dot
JSON you should be able to see one point
eight point three okay so we have seen
on how to install on how to initialize
package the choice on how to install and
make all of those packages to be listed
in package Jason how to uninstall how to
check for the outdated versions how to
update and almost recovered everything
except one concept
so for now let me remove human
underscore tool oh sorry let me
uninstall underscore and at the same
time I would like to get it noted what
I'm doing uninstall I have a spelling
mistake here okay so everything is gone
and even my package is updated and I
have no dependencies at the very moment
okay so as I previously mentioned the
moment you actually install something or
some package in the particular folder it
is made available I mean the respect to
package is made available only for that
application but none of the other
applications can use it so for example
if I say npm install underscore here and
further for simplicity i just would like
to remove packaged or json altogether so
let's go with this guy npm install
underscore so installed underscore and
it is made available as part of sample
zero one and i say npm list and you can
see i have underscore already installed
which we have seen earlier so let me go
back create another folder called sample
zero to go into that particular folder
and use npm list and now you can see it
says empty as because sample zero two
doesn't have any kind of installation of
this underscore as because we installed
that package as part of sample zero one
and sample zero two doesn't have any
idea about any of the other
installations in any other folders so
that care has to be taken however there
is a way on how you can install packages
globally so when I say globally you can
install all of the NPM packages in one
certain folder
and all of you the applications
currently available on that particular
machine can really make use of all of
those things so how can I do that
so for example in this case let me clear
everything up so let me remove this
nodes node underscore modules and in
this case is FC NPM list and you can see
it is empty okay now let us try to
install one library and make it globally
available for any application so what is
the easiest way to do that and again as
I mentioned I am still going with the
same command NPM install underscore
however I can say - G - G R - G or I
always go with complete specification -
- global so the moment I say that it is
going to install underscore in a very
different folder so in this case it is
actually installing two NPM in some app
data or whatever however it is not going
to be made available as part of your
application it is available locally
available globally which means all of
the applications on your machine can
make use of it now let me say NPM list
it doesn't have anything why because a
list is the one actually lists only from
your local folder but let me say - G so
which means it is going to give you all
the list of libraries of a global so
similarly even if you say series sample
0 - so which is a different folder and
again as a NPM list - G it is going to
be made available here - so which means
you have that particular library to be
installed globally and of course you can
always install that particular global
library by using and install NPM
uninstall the name and from there
and it is gone so now I can say NPM
lists NSG and everything is out so
whenever I say npm install and beyond
uninstall you can still use update and
all the relative commands with the
suffix as - - global or - - save so
that's just global goes to the global
storage where all the applications on
your machine can use - - save can
essentially have those particular
packages to be listed as part of your
package by Jason so now that we
understood on how to install the
packages how do we use them in our
application so I imagine I am developing
a JavaScript application and I would
like to test a particular every package
whether it is working or not so in this
case let us go and check with underscore
so let us go back to my previous
application sample zero one and
currently it has got nothing here no
packages and let me make sure I don't
have any packages globally so we are
clear no packages anywhere and now let
me install them underscore so I
installed that particular application
locally I mean that particular package
locally now I would like to test that
particular package so in order to test
it I need to have that particular
package to be imported into my
JavaScript file and then use it so in
this case you know you can use your own
favorite editor or like jetbrains or
whatever so as I would just like to
write only a couple of lines I just
wanted to use notepad plus plus so let
me create a simple JavaScript file so in
this case I am going to say something
like EU or you can use any variable like
war whatever any variable and you have
to use require underscore so this first
statement says that okay
sorry I have a typo here so this first
statement says that you are already
having underscore package installed
either globally or locally get that
particular package into your application
execute that and get the instance of it
to be stored as part of object war so
essentially object o is the one which
gets that entire library in the form of
a module object into war so this entire
map package will be executed in the form
of a module and that module reference is
going to be stored inside the variable
called o so two steps in order to have a
package the first thing is install the
package either locally or globally the
second thing is that refer that
particular package using require and get
that reference into a variable called
whoa in this case you can use any
variable and once you have that variable
now you can literally use any of those
particular features available as part of
that particular package for now let us
open underscore dot J's and see what are
all the features available there so
underscore Dodgers in this case so let
me open the first one and it has got all
of these particular functions in this
case you can use a any of those
functions so that you know we can have
much efficient way to access the
collections especial so you know it else
it is already giving you on how to
install underscore and so on and it's
each of those particular connects re
functions are provided with certain
kinds of examples you go now in this
case I would like to use this particular
feature so this function called each
which for which this particular each
will be going through each and every
element available in an array and that
array element for every iteration we'll
be sending to the respective function
here and that function gets executed so
in this case I would like to use this
one in order to test my application so
our our entire and
SCOR object is made available as part of
war and now I can use Oh in order to
make use of that feature so ODOT each so
essentially I am using each and in my
case instead of underscore I am using Wu
as because Y is my object similarly if
you would like to use something like map
so you can just say what map similarly
oh that's um you can use any of those so
let me go back to each so I have now I
have array 1 2 3 so let me use the same
thing so I would like to have this and
now I would like to use specific
function here yes you are using nodejs
you cannot use alert directly but you
can use console.log so I would like to
make use of console dot log here instead
of alert
so let me write my own particular
function here an anonymous function
where it is going to receive a value
from this particular array for every
iteration into available called M so in
that way I would like to have a new
function to be executed so which means
this is the function which gets executed
for each and every value available in
this array and each and every of those
values available for every iteration
will be made available as part of the
variable M so the easiest way I can just
say console dot log M in this case over
so now that I have that information like
each of those elements in the variable M
I can get that M here and just using
consultant log so let me save this so in
order to save this as I mentioned I am
actually using sample 0 1 as my
application so let me go to that
particular folder and man ODS sample
sample 0 1 and Here I am going to say
something like test dot J so you can put
whatever the JavaScript file you would
like to provide here so just click Save
and you can see test J s is made
available here and how to test
so in order to test that just say node
give the name of that particular
javascript file and you can see that
particular file getting executed but in
fact internally as part of that
JavaScript you are importing a package
and using that particular package for
example if I wanted to multiply by two
let me save this and we execute the same
command and now you can see I am getting
all the values respectively so now we
have seen on how to get NPM packages for
your particular application or make them
globally available and at the same time
you can also test each of those
particular packages or use those
packages using the require statement and
you can make use of all those particular
features available in the inside those
packages and here our job with your
JavaScript application can become more
and blast and more powerful based on the
150,000 plus libraries we have as part
of NPM GS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
