on how arid land may not be really that
good whenever we are trying to use it in
almost all the scenarios so it is
something like arid or in length is
pretty much whatever we can do in order
to find the length of the array which
means it counts the number of elements
available in an area however that will
be situations like it could be really
ending up with really no proper
information whenever we use air a dot
length so which means we can run into
scenarios where air a dot length is not
really giving crop or values or proper
count so we need to consider certain
scenarios whenever you are using a red
land and not fall into a victim of
having a complete very good length or
very good is a number of elements to be
always shown to the user so first of all
we all knew that whenever I say length
and to be used as an array so which
means to be used with an array it
essentially gives the number of items in
an area so this is a common practice so
it's the array one is an array length is
the property which is supposed to give
us the number of items available in that
array and finally it will be showing the
Raelians idea but in reality it is not
quite that
Raoh inside all scenarios so which means
in not all scenarios it is going to give
us the length properly so first of all
it does not work properly with SSA to
have various so for example let us
consider I have an SSA to air it defined
in this way so I'm having four elements
stored in four different indexes and
whenever I say MP dot length I will be
expecting for whereas because I have
four memory allocations as part of the
area but in fact it gives zero so it is
very important to understand that
whenever you
associative arrays those locations with
respect to the string indexes are not
going to be counted
whenever you use dot length next the
harris with numeric indexes have some
default characteristics which means
whenever you declare our work with
numeric indexes there are couple of
important things we really need to
consider the first thing is that if you
add an element using numeric index ya
allocates for all of the previous
indexes if they have been not allocated
already so which means imagine I have an
array 1 and currently it is empty and
the next immediate statement is array 3
so which means I am placing some value
inside a array 3 just immediately once
it has been declared usually we go with
the error 1 of 0 say one of two air f0
f1 f2 and so on till we go to 3 but
imagine we directly declare 3 and we
have to provided any values for 0 1 and
2 positions and now we are going to see
different result whenever we say lengths
so again there is one more scenario
whenever you mix the numeric index cells
together with the string based indexes
so which means this and this whenever
you mix together you are going to have a
different account as part of the length
so this is one scenario we'll have to
keep in mind and it is not at all a good
idea to really have various kinds of
indexes to be mentioned in the same kind
of an array so which means it is not
really a good idea to have a numeric
mezzotint access and string base and
access to be made available as part of
the same array and it is not that good
in general
okay so let us deal with a couple of
options whatever we have here so let us
go through the demo and we will be
checking out a headed out land associate
away which means we will be working with
associative array and see what all of
the differences it we may find using
area dot length and how error dot length
can really go wrong in couple of ways so
let me create a new file let me call
this one as 0-6 for a second and how
script and now let us consider I am
creating an area something like this and
now I would like to say my number equal
to 1 0 0 1 and employee so for example
my name equal to check and something
else like every equal to something like
this and the department number something
like accounting so it doesn't mean
number we could also call such a
battement in this case so imagine I have
an associated a array declared something
in this fashion and now let us consider
a couple of buttons here input type
equal to button and then value is going
to be button 1 so which means that is
the caption just I put some dummy
caption there but unclick I would like
to execute something like button one
plate so that is going to the function
which I am going to develop now so let
me let me define the definition here so
this is going to be the function I am
going to work on and all I would like to
do is just say
the MP declined so let us quickly check
on what's going on
and the moment I click on that and you
can see they chose as if there are no
elements at all in the array but we are
pretty sure actually we have four
elements so it is not at all a good idea
to use the length property against an
associative array or an array having the
string indexes so in the next scenario
so let us go with the button tour so
that is how this one has button to click
and let me define another area and I
would like to call this one as a day one
in this case and I would like to have an
empty area to be defined so usually in
order to have any kind of elements we
start with zero but let us consider I
start with three directly provide
something like something and now on
clicking of button - and clicking off
button I would like to find the length
of this particular array to be shown so
usually we will be expecting something
like there is only one element in the
array logically so which means the
length is supposed to be one but what
happens is that the moment I execute
this and test it you can see it says
four so why we have four here is because
the third means you haven't defined zero
one two and JavaScript automatically
adds all the previous indexes creates
those elements whether or not you are
using the indexes so in fact if you say
array of thousand it will be exactly
creating thousand and one locations you
though you use only one location so if
you provide a particular index and if
the previous indexes are not filled in
the same array it actually creates all
those indexes and all those elements
whether you use them or not
and finally the length is going to be
what it really counts with respect to
all the indexes currently allocated
together so it is very important to note
that length
whenever you use with uneven indexes
will have to be careful so let us worry
about another scenario so in this case
I'm going to have a Rho which is an
empty area by default and now I'm going
to have something like three with
something and now with some string based
index and now let us have another button
and in this case I call it as three and
button three three three here and I
would like to find the length of eret or
so we already knew that you know if
something like three is already there
with no allocations to zero one two
it automatically allocates all the
previous locations so we are sure at
this moment that it is supposed to be
four and on top of that we are adding
one more element in the form of string
based index and that is supposed to be
the first one but let us see how it is
going to look like so instead of showing
five it is actually showing four as I
mentioned earlier none of the array
elements which are having the string
indexes will be counted as part of
length so that is the reason I have one
before till here and this is not at all
counted so we will have to be pretty
much optimistic about using length
whenever we are using the string base
and excess or an even numeric indexes or
mixing both of those which may not be
really necessary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
