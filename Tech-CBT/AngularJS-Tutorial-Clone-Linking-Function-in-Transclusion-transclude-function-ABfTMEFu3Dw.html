what is transclusion and how the
transload function works in this video
we are going to discuss a bit more about
plants clewd function and see on how it
can really transform into a clone
linking function so a bit more about
transport function so there are two
flavors of a transfer function on how
you can really use it as part of your
development
the first one is transclude with no
callback function so you can see if you
just use the transclude function with no
parameters here then we call that one as
transclude with no callback function or
in simple with no clone linking function
so this is just a plain transcript
function and what does it do it will be
mainly used whenever you would not like
to use ng transclude as part of your
template so if you have your template
and that particular template doesn't
have ng transclude and if you would like
to have more control over how they
transclude content to be injected into
your template then you will be using
transclude so there will be certain
conditions when and where you would like
to have your transclude at content to be
injected into your template without
really using ng transclude so that is
where you will be using your transport
function
and whenever you use a transfer function
it actually creates an instance of
transclude content so whatever the
content you provide is what if you
directive and if you would like to have
that content to be injected into your
template it has to be trans cluded so
which means that transclude at content
is going to be created in the form of an
instance so that whole content will be
actually created in the form of an
instance at that instance is usually a
jquery Dom element in general and that
particular instance will be created by
this transclude function and that
instance contains all the transclude
content which needs to be injected as
part of your template and it creates the
instance if and only if it was never
created earlier
so imagine you are executing this
transcript function for the first time
then only it actually creates the
instance of that translated content if
you are if you never use it the trans
fluid it creates for the first time but
if you are already using the transport
content for more than once it actually
tries to reuse the existing that
instance with the existing instance
which has been created earlier so which
means if you call transclude for the
first time it creates an instance if we
call the transclude for the second time
it doesn't create an instance but it
actually reuses the already existing
created instance and it will be reusing
which means it will be applying the same
instance to your template and it is not
just creating the instance but it also
creates the transclusion scope which we
are going to cover the next video so I
am NOT going to focus on what exactly is
transclude scope at the moment but just
for your information it is just the
scope for the trans cluded element
whatever it has created and a transclude
function actually creates an instance of
transGlobe content and also the
transclusion scope so this is a simple
way of how you can define a transfer
function and that too with no callback
function and there is another flavor
which I wanted to discuss about the
transclude function that is a transfer
function with callback so here we do not
have a callback but in this case we have
a callback so which means you can
provide some kind of callback function
here and there is no difference this is
also going to be used whenever you would
not really want to use any kind of ng
transclude or any other your own
directive for the transclusion so if you
would like to have more control you can
use either of these two flavors and no
difference either here so it will be
creating an instance if it was never
created earlier so that I included
content whatever you provide as part of
your template needs to be injected into
some other template so it gray it
creates an instance of that transclude
at content and it gets the jquery Dom
element out of it
which can be used to inject to any other
template in the target now this is where
the real differences that is in this
case it reuses the existing instance if
it has been created but in this case it
clones it so which means every time you
use the transcript with the callback
function it tries to create and exist
create an instance if not already
existing but if the instance is already
made available earlier or created
earlier it actually clones that instance
and reuses or say just uses the cloned
instance so we'll have to make sure that
whenever you use transclude callback
with a callback function every time you
use this statement you are guaranteed to
get a new clone out of your transloaded
content along with the new transclusion
scope so every instance are every clone
whatever you are going to get out of
this transclude with a callback function
you are going to have a new transported
scope also so in this case there will be
only one scope is because there will be
only one instance in this case every
time you use transclude we are going to
have a new instance to be created or a
new clone will be created from an
existing instance along with the
transclusion scope for the new instance
of the new clone so it is better to
understand from the coding perspective
on how these to differentiate each other
so let us check ok there's one more so
whenever you use this transclude with
the callback function that is where you
will be calling that one as clone
linking function so a clone linking
function means just the plain transfer
function however with a callback
function so whenever you use that we can
call that you are really using a clone
linking or attaching function okay so
let us jump into code so this is a
simple HTML and currently I have the ng
controller named as sample and you can
see the sample controller currently
having no information here but currently
it is just displaying a message called
this is controller also
let me go back here and you can see once
you press f5 here we are going to see
this is controller right there and let
us enhance this and check the first
version of the plans group that is with
no callback function so I go back to my
JavaScript here and let me create a
detective and I would like to call this
director as something like message one
okay and I would like to return the
template so in this case I would like to
have the template that we made available
through an URL so which means a separate
file and I would like to call this one
as message one dot HTML so it needs to
be create or right here so I would like
to call this one as message one dot HTM
so this is my template which will be
used for my directive so all I would
like to have is I do and I would like to
call something like this is from message
one template and the following is inner
content so this is just a plain message
and I would like to have another div
with an ID called inner panel and I
would like to have some styles so that
we can differentiate the transloaded
content so I would like to use blue
color for this one and any of the
transclude content and needs to be in
blue color which means it is tray it is
expected to be injector right here so I
go back here and I would like to use my
directive and I just wanted to provide
some message here and a separator so
that we know what's going on
so message 1 and I would like to use do
and that director what I'm going to use
this message one so you can see I have
the message one director right here and
I'm going to use the same thing and as
part of this particular directive I
would like to have some translated
content so which means I would like to
have some content in this du which needs
to be trans cluded into this particular
template mmm msg one dot HTML so I would
like to say something like this is inner
message so the goal is to have this
particular message so this is the
content which needs to be injected right
into this so that was our goal so let me
go back to my template here sorry my
JavaScript and the first thing I have to
use is trans clothes so I have to say
like I would like to have the
transcribing mechanism to be made
available so which means the current
directive supports transclusion that's
what I'm saying and I would like to have
the controller that is the directive
controller to be used here with all the
necessary parameters so which means it
is expected to have the scope element
attributes and the trans close function
so this is the function we were
discussing about so this will be
automatically passed by a angularjs
framework and we are going to use the
same function right here so at this
moment what I would like to say is I
would like to access my element that is
I would like to get access to this guy
and in order for that it should be
automatically available as part of my
element and I am going to say dollar
element dot find inner panel 1 dot
append and now I would like to have the
transclusion to be happening so which
means I would like to execute my
transfer function with no callbacks
right here so whenever I execute this
what happens is that it actually gets
the content so this is the content which
will be automatically instantiated
extracted and instantiated and finally
injected into this one so you can say
I'm just saying append into the content
of inner pan
one which is nothing with this guy so
into this Dale and shame that please
append something inside it so this is
where we are supposed to have that
content to be trans Claudette so let us
see if this is working
however there is a mistake it doesn't
look like it's working okay I miss this
it has to be inner panel so let me just
press f5 and now you can see I have this
is inner message so in that way we have
our message one directly from more
markup and this is from our template and
this is the trans cluded content so we
have everything in place now for a
change I would like to have a new inner
panel to be created so I would like to
say I would like to rename this one to
inner panel one and this one - not Allen
- so I have two inner panels so just for
our differentiation I would like to have
this one to be red instead of 0s or
instead of blue so that will have a
better understanding so in this case if
I say enough talent and not two which
means our content is supposed to be
placed inside inner panel - so which
means the content should be in red color
now so if I press f5 now you can see I
have in red color but we have nothing in
blue is because you can see as part of
this we are not placing anything into
the first panel will be placed into two
so if I go in here and just use inner
panel one and comment the other now you
should be able to see the content to be
actually put inside inner panel one
which is nothing but blue so similarly
if I comment this and if i uncomment
this one it is going to be red so no
issues so everything is working
perfectly fine but now let us consider I
am on commenting both so what I am
saying is that I wanted to execute
transclude which means the content will
be extracted instantiated and placed
into this one okay and I'm again saying
that it has to exclude and instantiate
and get back into the panel - so let us
see what happens at this moment so I go
back here but
safai now you can see I do not see the
blue message I only see a red message
but if you go back to my JavaScript you
can see I place this content into the
blue as well and also into the red but
it doesn't work like that because if you
seem a presentation it reuses if it has
already created the an instance so if an
instance is already available it's not
going to create a new one so it is going
to be reused so in this case what it
says is that first of all it is already
appending into the inner panel one first
with no issues it has done it but the
issue is that once you say this
statement it actually removes whatever
it has appended in inner panel one and
injects into panel two so thereby we are
going to see only the trans cruder
content in L panel - but not in panel
one because it has been removed from
panel one even though it has been added
in this statement it has been removed
and riad ydynt ooh the inner panel - so
the outcome of this one is we are going
to see the content only in inner panel -
but not in panel one so in whenever you
use transclude with no callback it is
going to be good however if not in
multiple transclusion elements so if you
would like to have the transcoding
content to be made available in multiple
locations then this might not be the
right way to do so you might need to use
which is clone linking function so in
order to test this one let us create
another directive and I would like to
call this one as message two and I just
wanted to remove all of this so that it
will be completely clean and let me
create another and I would like to say
message 2 here and I am going to say I
am using message - here as well
so which means I am using the second
derivative so what is so special about
this second directive so instead of
using transclude with no callback I
would like to use transclude with
callback essential
you wanted to use clone linking
functions so from now onwards instead of
calling transclude with callback I would
like to call that one as cone linking
function so let us see how this is going
to work so I am going to use still
transclude and it is going to have a
callback function to be provided and I
am providing the same here however for
this function it actually sends the
instance whatever it has cloned or
created so in my previous presentation
you can see actually I said whenever you
use this it actually clones an existing
instance if it is already there so that
cloned instance or that created instance
will be automatically passed to you in
the form of Trance cluded element so
this is a jquery object so we can use
this particular object directly as part
of our dollar element so i can now say
please go in here and now i am going to
say it happened my transclude element
which is nothing but this guy so what
I'm saying is that whenever I use this
get a new instance and send it to this
one so which means it will be sent to
this and that will be bended to this if
you want in some other location use the
same thing and instead of inner panel I
am going to use a node panel too so each
time we use this content linking
function you are getting a new clone of
this element which will be particularly
used for that application of that
function execution so I just specified
here and now we should be able to see
that particular transclude content being
made available in multiple locations of
the target template so this is what is
really about clone linking function so
which means it clones while it tries to
transclude the content of the original
template
