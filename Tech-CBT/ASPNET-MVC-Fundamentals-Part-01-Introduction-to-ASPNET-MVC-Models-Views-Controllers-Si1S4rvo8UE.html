a speed Arnett and Macey basically we
are going to cover some fundamentals and
a very introduction or say basic
beginners introduction to asp.net MVC so
as part of this video first of all I am
going to introduce you a speed up net
MVC and then I may see a life cycle so
in general how model-view-controller
work together in a very brief and very
understandable manner and next we are
going to develop a very basic asp.net
MVC application so that is going to be
on how MVC all of those three components
work together and we are going to see
that in the form of an example and we
are going to touch only get operations
for now but not really the post yet and
now we are going to start with asp.net
MVC so what exactly is a speed are
native machine so first of all it is
just another technology which is mainly
used to develop web based applications
so we already have tons of other ways
actually in order to develop any kind of
web application like we have asp.net PHP
JSP nodejs at X plus and so on so you
can just transfer race without net and
we see as just another technology in
order to have a web based application to
be developed and the asp.net MVC is
based on the core fundamentals and the
concepts of asp.net if you are familiar
with asp.net and its basic fundamentals
and the basic concept we should be
really having a great idea of how
asp.net MVC works internally so the
entire asp.net MVC framework runs on top
of asp.net so as long as you have a
speed are not installed on your machine
which usually comes
to visual studio under with windows as
well you should be having a speed-up net
and VC to be installed seamlessly all by
just using a nougat back package manager
or other package managers you might have
so all you have to do is just install
asp.net MVC related dll's using Visual
Studio or other package managers and you
are going to have em easy install
automatically so this is very much
important again asp.net MVC is not
completely different it is built on
existing standards and the existing
principles or existing core of asp.net
so it is really working on asp.net so if
you don't have a suite are not installed
and this is not going to work even
though it is developed on top of asp.net
the development methodology is entirely
different from that of asp.net so those
guys were familiar with asp.net may have
an understanding of page lifecycle for
example I may have page in it page 3 in
it page load all the event handlers
spades pre-render render and so on so
how a kind of a lifecycle for any kind
of request for a particular page and all
of that lifecycle is completely gone so
there is no page lifecycle with respect
to a and we see a Mesa has got a
different life cycle so all the
knowledge whatever you have in asp.net
with respect to page lifecycle you state
and all that stuff is completely gone in
MVC
so the environment or the development
methodology for MVC applications is
completely different from that of
asp.net and MVC as I mentioned it stands
for Model View controller so asp.net MVC
the core development or the core
strategy behind this
is to implement a standard pattern
called MVC pattern so NEC is basically a
pattern and that particular pattern for
asp.net has been implemented and the
product came out as asp.net MVC so I'm
going to call about MVC pattern bit
later but for now just consider this is
a frequently used pattern by the
developers among all kinds of platforms
in order to develop various user
interfaces and using MVC you can have
asp.net based applications by using
asp.net m86 framework so prior to
asp.net emissive framework if you would
like to implement your own and we see
you have to develop your own emissive
framework from the scratch using asp.net
and then somehow hack around existing
page lifecycle so we don't need to do
that anymore as because microsoft
introduced its own and nice a version of
asp.net which includes this M is pattern
all together so the core idea behind the
asp.net MVC is to integrate with all
kinds of user interface frameworks or
JavaScript frameworks seamlessly so
which means but whenever we use asp.net
MVC we really have full control for each
and every particular tag or HTML element
along with the styles and we can dictate
on how the user interface is supposed to
behave and we are in full control of it
unlike asp.net which actually controls
itself by emitting its own HTML its own
view state its own javascript and post
backs and so on
but coming to asp.net MVC nothing of
those particular rapid application
development features are going to be
made available for NVC
in MVC you are the guy who is going to
develop and write the applications from
the scratch including each and every
part
the tag you would like to check so
nothing is automatic at the same time as
you are going to develop everything from
the scratch you will be in control of
everything and you have the flexibility
to integrate with anything and another
goal is asp.net MVC to become as open
source so asp.net MVC source code itself
is available in the github and you can
download it for debugging or publish the
think of the source so ACP dotnet em
easy is open source and at the same time
it integrates with the other open source
frameworks are technologies as long as
they have the same kind of principles of
the open standards and the MVC related
stuff so we have angle of J's jQuery and
knock out which they themselves are not
em easy but they are somehow related to
M ABM framework but jQuery is not jQuery
is something related to Dom so that is
document object model and Ajax
communications and so on
no MVC or more yummy VM is available as
part of jQuery but still it can
integrate with MVC
I mean asp.net MVC asp.net MVC can work
with any of the front-end frameworks
whether or not they are MVC or any VM
related stuff so it has got no idea
about the front-end frameworks and any
kind of content frameworks it is very
easy to integrate with MVC and it's
reductant NEC itself is open source so
let us jump into m ec so in that
particular MVC i am going to cover muse
and controllers first and later on we
are going to look into models so for now
I am NOT going to touch the models at
all
we will be working with Leo's hand
controllers and have sound understanding
between the differences between these
two so let us consider we have a web
server and this web server currently is
hosting an asp.net MVC application in
this fashion so I have one asp.net MVC
application hosted inside
a web server so let us consider what
exactly is view first of all view sits
inside an MVC application and this
particular view is nothing but an user
interface so which means all the user
interface elements like the text boxes
checkboxes grids or whatever will be
defined as part of you so mu is
essentially what the user is going to
see later on so view stands for the user
interface with all the user interface
elements like text boxes labels grades
checkboxes buttons and so on and those
particular UI elements are going to be
supposed to be bound to data like if I
have a text box like first name it has
to be bound to some kind of property
like first name which could be filled
from a database for example I have a
grid which might be able to display all
the addresses of a particular customer
and I would like to fetch all the
addresses from the database so data
grade which is going to be available on
the user interface which is nothing but
view so the data grid inside the view
maybe need to be binding to the data
with respect to addresses or something
else so all of that UI or user interface
elements gets bound to the data and
finally will be presented to the user
next this is pretty much important view
is going to be sitting inside MVC
application so which means view will be
available at the web server level and
once this particular view has come
completed its causes it is going to
render or spit out HTML CSS and
JavaScript and finally returns that one
to the client in in this case client is
nothing but browser so view is going to
be responsible to render all the HTML
and send that particular HTML back to
the browser so when are as a HTML as
actually it includes other components of
the page which are metamer CSS and
JavaScript and so on so this is pretty
important a view which is going to be
sitting at the webserver level inside an
MVC application once it has completed it
passes of data binding all the user
interface elements will be rendered I
had spit out HTML and that hits TM l is
going to be sent back to the client next
we are going to look into the controller
and again controller is going to be
sitting inside an MVC application here
and which along the sits with the view
so we have the controller and be sitting
inside MVC application so what is
controller first of all the controller
is the one which receives a request from
the browser
so whenever request anything from the
browser any kind of web page or a kind
of some kind of information to be
requester that entire request actually
goes through the controller also
controller is the first component which
gets hit by that respective request so
the first request or any kind of request
will be are handled only by the
controller first which is going to be
sitting inside a messy application so
controller internally contains several
actions so you can just consider each of
those actions are nothing but methods in
general so a controller can have
multiple actions and each of those
actions can be considered as methods we
can have as many number of actions as
possible inside a controller and
whenever any kind of request is sent
from the client that particular request
is going to be handled by the controller
and will be forwarded to the respective
action so which means finally a request
whenever it is sent from the browser is
going to be handled by an action
and that the far wording of that
particular request is going to be done
by the controller so which means our
emissive framework is smart enough to
figure out which control needs to be
picked up and within the controller
which action needs to be picked up I can
have multiple controllers in an MVC
application and I can have multiple
views and each of the controllers can
have multiple actions based on the
request the MVC framework receives MVC
framework will be forwarding that
particular request to the respective
controller and that true to the
respective action only so let us see
what exactly is action ah so action is
responsible to passes the request so
once that it first has been sent from
the browser as it is going to be
received finally by an action the action
is responsible to process a request so
whenever I say process a request
imagine you are fetching from the
database filling with some data are
sending any email or consuming a web
service any business logic should be
part of action so any kind of
information you are going to fetch
dynamically from multiple other sources
or push to other sources all that should
be happening inside action and
ultimately once action has completed its
process it is going to pick up a view
from a set of views available and that
particular view is going to be finally
selected and that view is going to be
responsible to get the information or
data from action and finally send the
information back to the client so which
means the request comes to the
controller and then the controller
throws that request to an action and
action processes the request gets the
data out of it picks a particular view
and the view receives the data and the
view binds all the data to the respect
user interface components it renders the
view with all the user interface
elements as part of the rendering
process it generates the HTML CSS and
JavaScript and finally that entire
JavaScript or HTML or CSS will be sent
to browser so this is pretty much what
we can say about use and controllers so
essentially views and the controllers
will be sitting at M is the application
itself view gets the rendered it so the
result is going to be HTML with all the
respect to CSS and JavaScript and
finally will be sent to the browser so
let us see more on muse views can
interact with control of store so it is
not just only one way it is it could be
the other way around s or so which means
action can pick up a view and send the
information to the view and not only
that a view itself can sometimes invoke
any kind of controller or an action so
you can have the flexibility to actually
directly call any kind of action or
access the controller itself and this is
an example imagine I am having a change
in the view so which means the user
might have changed of something or the
user might have requested different
information or whatever that can trigger
a kind of a request from the browser and
that could again go to the controller in
action and not only that a view from the
server itself can access the controller
directly for more information and then
finally based on the information it must
have received from the controller within
the server that particular informational
gets bound to the user interface
elements and final will be sent back to
the client so let us have a quick
demonstration on developing or creating
an asp.net MVC application from the
scratch let us add an controller and an
action and a view
testa application just wanted to ensure
we are not we have not covered the
models yet we have just covered views
and the controllers and the controllers
having actions so let us have the
demonstration sorry of individual studio
I create a new project and ensure that
you have selected web here and so now I
put in C samples you can put anything so
in this case I would like to have the
project to be named s sample Zeta one
and ensure that you have selected
asp.net web application click OK and now
let us go with empty we have other
options but I would like to start with
the empty so that we'll know what we are
doing and after selecting empty make
sure that you have selected M easier so
that is pretty important and for now I
am NOT going to select unit test but if
you would like to have any kind of unit
has to be added you can just add that
one too but for now I am NOT going to
add any unit test and just to go clear
and now you can see I have a solution
with sample zero 1 which is having a
project called sample 0 1 so of course
in this case both project name and the
solution same odds are same but if you'd
like to make it different you know you
can do that while creating the new
project itself so for now this
particular project has got three folders
like controllers models and views
so essentially you can see MVC models
views and controllers so as we have not
covered on models we will be working
with use and controllers for now and
later we are going to cover models in a
bit of time so let us go with views we
have got nothing here rather than web
contact and nothing inside controllers
nothing inside views so now we are going
to start creating the controller first
it has because from the previous
presentation you might have seen like
that from the client the first request
always comes to the controller and the
controller needs to have an action so
let us follow the same I start to create
a controller first create an action so I
right click on the controllers go to add
and go for the controller here and now I
can just select MVC controller and click
Add so you can give your own name here
it could be anything so in this case I
can say home or you can say sample
whatever you would like to mention but
ensure that the controller name has to
be suffixed with controller so this name
has to be there so let us provide any
other name prefix so the controller name
has to be there in order to figure
figure out by the asp.net MVC framework
itself so it is important that every
particular controller file should have
the name suffix with controller so in
this case I just wanted to go with
sample and click add and now you can see
I have sample
the same name and by default it has
already added an action for us this is
the action I was talking about those are
nothing but very simple methods so you
can have the actions which are
essentially nothing but the methods and
you can have more and more actions as
necessary so for now index is the only
action available inside the controller
called sample and that particular action
you can see it is actually trying to
retrieve a view and send back to the
user so let us switch back to my
presentation
the action is supposed to pick up a
particular view from the list get the
viewer of it and finally get the view to
be rendered back to the browser so once
I switch back to this you can see I have
the sample which is the controller
inside that I have an action called
index it could be any name here but that
is the default action it has created and
this particular index action is actually
trying to pick up a view and finally
return it back so as part of this
returning process the view processes
itself by actually rendering all the
user interface elements gets the data
bound and finally generates the HTML out
of faith and sends back to the user but
you can see I don't have any kind of
view currently available you can see
whenever you have created the controller
which is nothing but the sample which
was studious smart enough to create
something like a folder called sample
with the same name as the controller so
you have the same name is of the
controller here and but that is inside
the views folder but I don't have the
view so no view has been created so now
it is going to be our job to create a
view so that the same view gets picked
up by the respect to action called index
so the easiest way to do that is right
click on the action and say head view so
the moment I say add view
it is going to ask you the view name so
essentially in this case I would like to
have the same name as of the action name
so I go with the same name for now and
it is asking us if I'm having any kind
of master page or whatever so in this
case I don't want to provide any of the
master pages so just remove that and it
is asking if the view is supposed to be
bound to any kind of model so even now I
am saying I don't want to have that you
to be bound to any of the models it is
just going to be very plain simple view
so just like a de and the moment I click
on add you can see it has actually added
index which is nothing but the view
itself so it is having an extension dot
CSS HTML so this is completely different
from our SP X or SP x dot CS so this is
entirely different this is based on the
razor right now so this is based on race
or engine or region markup so this has
got no relation with our traditional
aspx page tools or the controls so this
is entirely different for now let us
switch back again so I have the
controller which is named as sample
inside the controller I have the action
called index and this particular index
action is going to send or pick up a
view as I did not name that view it is
trying to find the same name as of the
action name so in this case as you did
not provide any name here it is going to
try to find the view which is having the
same name as of the action inside the
same folder as of the controller folder
inside the views folder so every time by
default yes again I wanted to say by
default whenever you say return view it
tries to find the view which is having
the same name as of the action name
inside the same folder as of the
controller name finally made available
as part of view
so you can say this index is nothing but
named as vo and at the same time this
controller name sample is nothing but
the one what we are going to see here so
that is how it is going to check so if
that is not available in this location
there are other further locations where
it is going to check are those will be
covered eventually but for now just
consider ourselves like whenever use try
to return your view with no name it
tries to find a Mew with the same name
as of the action inside the same folder
as of the controller name and that
folder needs to be available as part of
views folder at the very root so yes
like that we have let us go to index and
let us put some information like hello
so I did not do anything other than just
hard coding some information here and
now the easiest way to test this is you
can just right click on this and go to
view in browser or you can just say
execute so anything is fine so the
easiest for me right now I just right
click here and go for view in browser
and let us see what is going to happen
and now you can see I got hello so let
us take a quick look at the URL view
first of all you can see sample and then
I have index so you know that the name
of the control of R is nothing but
sample so in our case if you quickly
switch back to our controller you can
see the name of the controller itself is
sample and this is exactly the same name
what it is actually being put as part of
the URL and within the controller I am
saying that please go to the action
named index and so if you switch back to
this you can see this is the index I am
going to the floor so this is pretty
important whenever you asp.net MVC
evaluates the URL it certainly looks for
the controller name and then the action
name and so on so this concept is called
as the routing and I am going to cover
that routing between
later but for now let us consider you
are just going with the controller name
and the action name for now so I am
trying to fetch or execute the action
called index which is available inside
this particular controller and while
executing that particular action this
action is going to be responsible to
pick up a view with its own name and
that view is going to be rendered which
finally actually spits out the HTML
which contains hello so in that way I
have my first application but let us
consider I would like to add a new
action so I can add something like this
so I can say say hi and in this case I
can say return another view so this is
valid too
but again I don't have a view with the
same name as of say hi
so they exist where right click here go
to add view and say say hi so that is
going to be the default name and again I
don't want to provide any of these and
just like add and now you can see there
is one more thing called
say hi which is essentially added to the
same folder as because say hi is my
particular action which is available
inside the same controller called
samples so there is the reason inside
the same views and inside the same
sample Country folder I have say hi so
in this case I just would like to say hi
so let me test this I go to view in
browser and now you can see I am saying
from the controller sample execute
action say hi and now say higher returns
the view so I have the controller I have
the action action picks up the view and
returns back the view so you can test
the other two so I can say index and now
you can see index action is still
working it is returning hello
and similarly I
and again switch back to my say hi and
just say say hi so I get hi out of it so
I can also have a view to be returning
either view for example imagine as part
of the execution of this action I would
like to return a view related to this
index so which means say hi by default
whenever you say view it tries to fetch
with the same name say hi so this is the
one which gets associated automatically
but instead let us consider I would like
to return index as part of say hi even
that is possible by just writing index
here so what I'm saying here is that
whenever I try to execute say hi it has
to return a view with this name index so
it is going to the same folder sample
inside the views and searches for the
view with this name called index so let
us build this project for a second and
now go to say hi and say view in browser
and now you can say say hi it is
supposed to say hi but instead it has
switched to hello as because even though
I asked the action say hi to be executed
it indeed picked a different view called
index so that is how you can actually
pick other views even though those
particular views may or may not be
related to the same action okay
so now that we have some understanding
about the controller's actions and views
we should really jump into models so let
us get back to my presentation so we
have already completed the demo so let
us switch to the next one sub called
models so as part of MVC we already
covered the views and the controllers
and now we are going to cover models
so what is mortal first of all a mortal
represents data some model contains data
model contains information but again
data nothing but it is an instance of a
class plane class with plane properties
so I can have a student class with
essentially register number first-name
lastname just three properties so that
particular class essentially can be
instantiated in multiple ways in order
to hold the data so I can create an
instance of a student and I can store
the information of the student inside
that particular instance and that
instance is nothing but the model so I
can have the model which represents the
data the model is nothing but the
instance of a class the model can
contain several properties and each of
those properties can hold values or
collections of information where is it
being used in our an easy model or the
architecture we discussed earlier first
of all it can be used anywhere in the
lifecycle especially inside the MVC
application so as long as you are inside
the MVC application it could be used
anywhere so which means here or here or
here or anywhere so let us see where all
we can use it first of all the main mode
of the model is to transfer the data to
maintain the state to hold the
information or to hold the data and to
transfer the data across controllers to
actions or actions to views or views -
back etc so as long as you wanted to
maintain or transfer data across
multiple components inside the Ameche
application you are going to use models
so in this case let us consider I am
going to send some kind of information
from the action to the view you can
generate a model you can instantiate
your model
and send that model straight to the view
so in this case I can say from the
controller to the view you can send a
model of course via action controller
itself will not have anything but
controller essentially has actions
inside and the actions are going to be
responsible to process the request fetch
the data from the database push the data
into the model and finally send that
model to the view and view is going to
honor that model and bind all the user
interface elements to the respective
model generates the HTML and sends back
to the browser
so in this case you are transferring the
data from action to view using model
from action to another method or another
process imagine from the action I would
like to call some other method which is
not related to action or view it could
be something else in general so I can
have a method some external method or
some external process that particular
process or the method may wanted to
receive some kind of data from the
action and that could also be a model
and in the return from the external
method or from the external process I
can get that particular data back to the
action in the form of model again so
which means the data can flow out of the
action and can also be received by the
action so you can see the model is not
just only for the view or not just only
for the controller or action it could be
everywhere as long as you have some data
to be transferred it could be a model
and that caterpillar and that particular
model could be used to transmit the data
regardless of whether it is view or
controller action or method or whatever
and there is one more scenario imagine I
am sending some information from the
client to the controller whenever I say
action it is nothing but the controller
so imagine the browser has sent some
information and that's all information
will be
to be a model and that particular model
will be finally forwarded to an action
action receives the client information
in the form of model processes the data
creates a new model out of it sends to
the view and view again renders
everything back to the client in the
form of HTML and you can see model is
almost everywhere but model is sitting
inside the MVC application borders that
is very important and now let us add one
more demo so which means I would like to
have a model to be added to our existing
solution and I would like to use the
same model to be transferred or to be
having some kind of data which needs to
be transmuted from action to the view so
which means action is going to be
responsible to create or instantiate the
model and send that model to the view
and view is supposed to be honoring that
model fetch the information from the
model and finally display that
information right inside the view
generate the HTML and send it across so
that is what I am going to see now so we
will leave this alone so let me close
this altogether so let me create a new
controller completely so I am going to
call this one as something like first
controller and just put any name there
but ensure that you always have
controller as a suffix so I have the
first controller and by default I have
an action here and I just wanted to
leave the basic action like that but
with a view so let us add a view for
this action so I call the view name as
index and I click add and you can see
under views I have the same name as of
the controller name first if it new
folder ded new folder has been created
and inside that I have index so I am
going to say
switch to first message for model demo
so this is just plain text nothing
special about this so I just build the
solution for now there is no model in
MALDI at just wanted to ensure that this
is working so I fetch the model here
sorry if it's the view here and you can
see it is currently going to the first
controller and inside that I have the
index action which essentially goes to
this one so my goal is instead of using
first index I would like to say first
message so I'd like to say first message
so the moment I say in that way it is
actually supposed to execute an action
called message and that particular
action is supposed to instantiate a
model and that particular model is going
to be sent to the view and view is going
to be fetching the information from that
model and send it across to the client
so let us create a model so in this case
I would like to create a model so I just
say add class so ensure that I'm
actually creating inside the model
folder and the class name is going to be
something like a sample model you can
put whatever the name you want it so
just click Add and you can see it's just
a plain class and inside that I would
like to say or add a property called
message for that purpose msg to be shot
so just don't want things to be confused
between the actions and the models here
so I have a model class called sample
model and of course it is not essential
to have model in your class but it is
just
our understanding or better readable if
you have model there so it is not
compulsory to have model as part of your
class name or file name so it is just
for our demonstration so I have a class
named sample model and inside that I
have a property called message which is
of type string so that's exactly the
model so now inside the first controller
I am going to add a new action called
message so inside this particular
message so which is nothing but an
action which could be fetched using
first slash message in the browser so
inside this action I would like to
create an instance of a sample model so
this is currently under a different name
space that is sample 0 wondered models
so let us include that so you can see
sample data models so as because if you
open your sample model you can see it is
under this namespace so you need to have
this namespace to be imported here at
the top in order to use that particular
class so I have the sample model I
instantiated it so this particular
object war
internally will have a property called
message and I can say something like
hello sword so this is the message I
would like to have and that particular
model currently is nothing but war so o
is the mortal instance which is
internally having all the required data
which needs to be sent to the view so
all I am going to say is return a return
view and I am going to send the model so
I am saying that I am actually returning
your view at the same time I am sending
the mortal instance which is nothing but
whoa
but I don't have a view yet so let me
create a view where I clicking that and
say
mooo and view enemy is going to be
message it could be anything but for now
as I mentioned let us actually go with
the same view name as of the action name
and it is going to ask you for the model
if we have any so in this case I can
just say something like you can get the
model from the sample one dot more
models dot sample model so this is one
way but let us consider I don't want to
provide anything here but you can also
provide it later so select that so I
will say empty without model for now so
just click Add and now you can see I
have the model I mean I have the view
here but I need to fetch the information
which is being sent from the action so
if you switch back to our controller our
action is sending an instance called woo
and voice of type sample model so I need
to fetch this particular wall directly
inside our view so in order to fetch
that first of all you need to say to the
view that this particular view is going
to receive an instance of type sample
model so that is essential so in order
to say that you need to improve model
attribute ii say i am going to use a
model available like this so all i'm
saying here is that the view message so
messages the view here this view is
going to receive an instance of this
particular class which is nothing but
the model and that particular instance
can always be retrieve good just by
using model so this is very important so
the moment you type in model you can see
it could automatically recognize it is
of type sample model inside the models
namespace of sample 0 1 that is
essential
so mortal is a reserved word here which
essentially maps to the instance of the
mortal which has been received by the
view so if you switch back to the
controller this instance war is going to
be automatically made available in the
form of more model so this model
essentially contains whoa and whoa is
nothing but model and you can say this
model is of this type which is
essentially the same type as of war so
whoa here is actually sample mortal type
and you are saying that the view is
going to receive an instance of type
sample model which is essentially the
same and that instance can be
automatically referred using the built
in asp.net MVC keyword called model and
the model the moment I say model you can
see I have message right away so all I
am saying is that that particular model
once it has been thrown to the view can
be accessed using model attribute or say
model keyword and this is essentially
nothing but the instance of this
particular model and I can access all
the properties out of it so I just save
this let us build this and that I click
here and view in the browser
and now you can see it has actually
fetched hello sir
and let us quickly see the view source
of it this one and if you see here it
has actually thrown hello sir
so inside the Deo it did not push Mortal
dot message instead it fetched the value
available inside the message which is
available as part of the model object
and a directly placed that message right
at the same place as here and that is
how I got hello sir so if you are using
any kind of what I say text box or
something you can still use that so for
example I have hello Bob hello message
here so just leave it like that now I
can say input type equal to text and I
can say value equal to I can still say
model dot message so even this is valid
essentially what I'm saying is that I
would like to have a text box and that
text box should have a value which is
nothing but the value available inside
this property of that model object
thrown by the action method so let us
again right click and go to the view
browser and now you can see I have a
text box which essentially has the same
value as of whatever we have seen inside
our model object so in that way we can
understand like I have the controller's
I have the actions I have the model and
the model is going to be sent to the
view and the view is going to fetch the
information from this model and have
that information to be directly put into
the user interface elements and that
will be finally sent back to the client</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
