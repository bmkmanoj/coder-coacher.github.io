into JavaScript functions and that toy
in depth so we are going to look into
advanced or concepts of JavaScript
functions so as part of this agenda we
are looking into the basics of functions
and then using the same functions in an
advanced manner so the first thing what
exactly are functions these are nothing
but an executable unit of code so those
are nothing but one simple unit which
can be executed whenever we call it so
each and every particular function is
going to have a particular name and that
particular function is going to be
executed the moment we call it using the
same name and with the parenthesis so as
I mentioned before it gets executed only
when it is called so if you don't write
this statement that this particular
function would never be executed so a
function will have its own name and I
should use the same name with
parentheses in order to have it executed
it can have parameters tool so which
means this particular function is having
two parameters a and B so which means it
can receive the values into a and B
whenever it is being executed so you can
see that I can have a particular
function called two son which is being
executed by calling it and sending these
two values so once I do this the control
immediately jumps from here and all
these values like 10 and 20 those both
of those values will be gone to a and B
and we can do our own work here a
function can also return values we will
return value basically so which means
this is a function
which essentially returns a value back
so whenever a function returns a value
back you need to hold it in a sort of a
variable or you can alert it or you can
push to some other function but in
general whenever you are calling a
function which returns a value that
particular value usually will be stored
in a particular variable so that return
whatever you are going to see here is
the value which actually returns it so
the return statement inside a function
returns a value back where it is being
called and that particular value will be
caught into the respective
variable so there are other advanced
ways actually developing the functions
so first thing if function can be
declared as an expression so we are
already familiar with you know writing
the functions by providing a name and
providing the parameter names aren't
calling them so this is called as the
traditional way and there is one more
way to do the same so that is using
function expressions so whenever I say
function expressions it is essentially
the same function except that this do
process or the name of the function is
removed from there and instead assigned
to a particular variable so now this is
a variable which contains a function and
now I can use this particular variable
directly in order to call that in the
same way as I am doing above so whenever
you are having a function which doesn't
have a name but instead that is being
assigned to a variable and it the
variable has it call has got its own
name you can call this kind of statement
as a function expression and that is one
more thing it can now be used before
definition so imagine I am writing this
do process here then JavaScript still
can understand how this particular
statement needs to be executed if you
follow the traditional method but
imagine I am writing this statement here
and JavaScript runtime doesn't
understand where this particular
function has been available and this
statement if you don't write it here is
going to throw an error so it is very
important to understand like all the
function expressions once they have been
declared then only you can use them but
in the case of traditional manner you
can use those particular functions even
before they have been declared so
sometimes these function expressions are
also called as anonymous functions so
which means those particular functions
which do not have any kind of name can
be called as anonymous functions and
those anonymous functions whenever
assigned to a variable then will be
called as function expressions and in
some terms it can also be called as
function literals so whenever anyone is
talking about function expressions or
function literals those are essentially
the same and whenever anyone is calling
about anonymous functions so which means
the functions with no name can be called
as anonymous functions and functions can
be assigned to other variables so you
might be already having a particular
function available inside a particular
variable in the form of a function
expression or imagine I have another
function declaration just like the
traditional way so there is a chance
where you can actually H sign those
particular functions are directly two
other variables
so either you follow this way or this
way you still have a chance to actually
assign a particular function to another
variable called
F but the point I would like to note
here and very important is that I am not
using a parenthesis here if we use
parenthesis that function is going to be
executed then at there itself which I do
not want to so in this case I don't want
the function to be executed but instead
just assign that particular function
definition to the variable F and again F
becomes very much similar to
due process available and then you can
still call that particular function just
by using the name f and now the function
is going to be executed as part of this
statement but not this this is just
assigning a function or assigning a
function definition to available but not
executing yet it gets executed at the
moment you put a parenthesis which is
being done as part of this statement and
functions can be passed as arguments
tool and now you can see I have a
particular function called due process
too and have another thing called due
process so now I am actually calling due
process to here so this is the statement
which tries to execute this function
while I am executing this I am actually
sending another function as a parameter
and you can see this particular function
is not having a parenthesis so which
means I'm not executing this function
but instead I am passing the definition
of this do process directly to an
parameter variable called process 1 and
now this is the variable which contains
this particular definition of due
process and whenever I use the same
variable with parenthesis it essentially
executes the definition available in it
the definition which is available inside
that is nothing but due process and this
gets executed whenever you call that one
so essentially I can send the function
definitions as arguments to other
functions and that kind of scenario is
mainly used whenever you would like to
have callbacks
so callback is nothing but a simple
mechanism in order to send a function
definition to a particular variable and
that particular variable is going to be
executing as the last statement after
the entire process of that particular
function has been completed so a
callback process or a callback function
is very similar to another function
except that that particular function is
the one you are going to send it to
available and that variable is going to
be executed as the last statement of
another
and there is one more thing you can have
a particular function to invoke itself
so imagine I have an anonymous function
and I can have this particular function
to be executed on the spot so which
means immediately once after that
particular definition has been completed
and that can be achieved using this
syntax so which means that anonymous
function need to be wrapped inside
another set of parenthesis and this
actually makes this particular entire
function as a statement kind of a deal
and that whatever part you are executing
immediately by using your parenthesis so
whenever you use this parenthesis you
are executing something what is that is
internally available inside these
parameters a solid parentheses and
inside this I have a function anonymous
function this anonymous function gets
executed the moment you use this kind of
syntax and that too immediately and the
frequent syntax what are you are going
to see on the web is going to be
something like this so essentially it is
just a wraparound in a proper manner
this function statement I brought it as
part of the first statement and again I
actually brought this here and these two
right immediately after that so all of
these characters have been rearranged in
such a fashion that it looks in this way
so throughout the web you are going to
see these kind of sin taxes which
essentially means that whatever function
is going to be executed on the spot or
in working itself and these are also
called as immediately invoked function
expressions so IIF e so which means
those are immediately invoked the moment
you have a particular function defined
they are also called as a self-executing
anonymous functions so those are self
executable and they are anonymous
there have been self executable because
we have actually embedding them as part
of another set of prepara brackets or
parenthesis and again die those
functions which are essentially anything
but immediately invoked function
expressions can also help parameters so
in this case you can see I have an
anonymous function which essentially has
two parameters and if I would like to
send it a couple of values to those
parameters I can execute and sand within
the same statement using this syntax so
in this case 10 will be assigned to a
and 20 will be assigned to B and it does
the job in its own way so let us have a
demonstration of all of those whatever I
covered like the general functions in
animal self invoking function arguments
and the callbacks and everything so let
me create a new HTML file and I call
this one a zero one for now and let us
have some UI hooked up so I would like
to say the first one has button and I
would like to call this one a show
message show message and ant like I
would like to execute show message
function so I would like to have a
scratch and inside the script I would
like to have a very simple function
called show message so as part of this
message all I would like to do some kind
of alerting so I would like to say that
this is a message
so I save it and execute it using Chrome
and the moment I click on it I got a
message
so essentially whenever I click on this
button I am saying that please execute
this function and that is the function
which gets executed and let us add one
more function which has some parameters
so I can say display some and they can
have a couple of parameters for this one
so in this case I would like to have
some of those two values to be displayed
and I would like to write something like
this a plus B double string and that is
going to be it so now let us have
another button which essentially does
call that particular function display
some by sending a couple of values like
10 comma 20 and in this case instead of
calling a show message I would like to
call this when I show some so let me
execute this and show some essentially
is going to give us 30 so you can see I
am sending those two values and those
two values will be automatically
assigned to a and B respectively and all
I'm doing is alert that by just summing
up those two values so let me have one
more input button so and then value
equal to short total sound in this case
and click equal to
so so this is going to be different one
I would like to have a new met you
function called show some to be
developed in such a way that it can
accept any number of values like 10 20
30 40 50 I don't know how many number of
values I may provide but it has to do
show based on the values I provide here
so for that purpose let us see the
function definition so I am going to
write show Sun and how many number of
parameters so I don't know how many
number of parameters I might be sending
it would be 2 or 5 or 10 so for that
purpose JavaScript has given an ability
to actually go through all of the are
arguments or parameters using a built in
called arguments array so for that
purpose I can just start with a variable
sum with 0 and then I can start
available I equal to 0 I understand and
how many number of elements I have here
which I do not know but you can get all
of those by using arguments dot length
and then I plus plus so arguments is
actually built in the reserved word
available as part of JavaScript so this
is always available for any kind of
function you are using and this
essentially holds all those particular
values which have been sent during the
call so in this case this arguments
internally will hold all of these values
in the form of an array and that is
where I am getting the length and now I
can say please sum it up and I can say
arguments of I so in that way I'm
getting each of those particular
elements and adding up to yes and now
finally I can say total sum equal to
as dr. string so let us see if this is
what you find and now I click on show
total and I get 150 so for example if I
add one more called tan which is
supposed to give me 160 automatically
without changing any of my code and
there you go so that is how I can use a
built-in called
arguments which essentially contains all
of those parameters whatever you are
going to send will be showed in the form
of an array and it is available for the
JavaScript runtime and now functions
returning the values so in this case I
would like to harm the function or get
difference and I would like to have
something like this
so which means it accepts two parameters
a and B and I would like to have C equal
to a minus B and so in this case I am
just finding the difference that is a
minus B into C and finally it done C so
let me have another button and I would
like to call this one as show difference
and now I need to call this so I would
like to say it get difference and I am
going to say 20 comma 10 or say 20 comma
5 for now but as I mentioned this is
going to return a value back during the
call so where is that value going we are
not storing and available so in this
case I would like to alert whatever it
is going to return so which means I am
going to execute this particular
statement which means it essentially
calls the function and in return this is
going to return C and whatever the value
this function is returning back will be
actually alerted to the user
so let us quickly check this and I click
on it and now you can see 20 minus 5 is
15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
