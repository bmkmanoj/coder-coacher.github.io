dollar apply and dollar digest available
in angularjs in order to understand
these you need to have some
understanding about how the data
bindings work in angularjs a bit more
about watchos a digest cycle and loop
and so on which have been covered in
much more depth and detailed in my
previous videos so if you are not
familiar with any of these I highly
recommend to go through my previous
videos which covers all of those topics
much in depth ok let's jump on to the
first slide and I just wanted to give
some quick over your board Isis process
of angularjs here and I grabbed this
slide from my previous video which
essentially gives us a complete overview
of angular digest cycle I am NOT going
to explain this whole diagram as it was
already explained clearly in my previous
video but there are a couple of things
we need to be aware of before even
trying to work with or trying to
understand how dollar apply and dollar
dices really works the first thing is
that we know that the data bindings
happen after dices process so which
means digest process will be essentially
going through all the watch lists and if
there are no more modifications to be
really keeping track of then it actually
pushes that information to update the
Dom and from there it actually goes to
the Dom render process and this digest
process will be kicked in as long as it
falls into the angular context so which
means if you happen to modify scope
variables using any of these like ng
click or dollar HTTP or dollar time
order in our case Dollar apply or
whatever those will be automatically
kicking in this process called digest
process and this digest passes is
responsible to watch or to look after or
to keep track of all those values of the
scope variables to make sure that
they're really
being modified and at the same time all
the modifications really get applied to
respect to UI and that responsibility is
automatically taken care by digest
process and this digest process is going
to be kicked in if and only if you use
any of these as part of angular context
okay there is an important note here Dom
events which are not related to angular
so in this case you can see I imagine I
am having jQuery related on click which
I might be writing somewhere inside this
JavaScript
so if I have jQuery related on click
events or if you have direct
browser-based events like set timeout or
intervals or whatever then those are
really working outside of the angular
context so if you happen to still access
the scope variables and modify them
outside the angular context then those
are not automatically kept track of
because the digest process is not going
to be kicking in so if you modify any of
those scope variables outside the
angular context even though the values
get changed those are not automatically
updated as part of UI so this is pretty
important the UI gets updated the view
gets updated by angularjs if and only if
the digest process completes and this
digest process can understand only the
context of angular angularjs and from
these particular bridges available so if
there is anything which is outside this
bridge and outside of the angular
context it will not kick in the process
of digest as you will not see UI getting
updated so this is pretty much in simple
about how the digest process really
works within angularjs and how it is not
going to be kicked in whenever you are
outside angularjs so let us now really
focus on a dollar apply and dollar
digest okay
so first of all again this part is
actually grabbed from a previous video
so every particular scope is going to
have its own watchlist including the
road scope
so if you are not familiar with watches
or watch list please refer to my
previous videos so dollar apply or
dollar digest any of these two whenever
you use with this scope they actually
kick in the digest process manually so
which means if the digest process is
automatically being kicked in and if the
developer needs to have the digest
passes to the kicked in which means you
want it to invoke that I just process
manually then you are going to use
either of these two the dollar apply or
dollar digest and these two are mainly
used whenever you would like to have the
scope variables which are modified
outside the angler context so which
means if you are trying to modify the
scope variables using jQuery events or
some other set timeout related events or
some other jQuery AJAX events which are
out of the angular context then it is
going to be the responsibility of the
developer to ensure that the respect to
digest process is always invoked so that
the you a get updated with the latest
values which are made available as part
of scope and this is pretty important
the third one behind the scenes
whether you use delay or apply or not it
actually uses dollar dices which means
if you call dollar apply insert inside a
dollar apply internally it is going to
call dollar digest so you can either
work with dollar digest or dollar apply
doesn't matter but if you work with
dollar apply behind-the-scenes it
actually calls dollar digest we are
going to see the difference between
these two when to use what but it is
important to know that dollar apply
always calls dollar digest internally
and how to use dollar reply or dollar
digest is quite simple as long as you
have access to scope variable just
providing dot you can ask it to actually
call dollar apply or dollar digest in
this matter so this is how you can use
dollar apply or dollar digest to really
invoke that I just process manually okay
so now let us think about dollar apply
lately I am NOT referring to dollar
digests anymore but this is simply about
dollar reply first of all the digest
process will be invoked always on route
scope you can see the digest process
whenever it is going to kick in it
always starts at a root scope the moment
use dollar apply it doesn't mean it is
going to end at root scope but it starts
with root scope completes its watchlist
parsing and from there it goes to the
child level scopes compute each of those
and further it goes to the nested scopes
and completes each of those so the
digest process will be always invoked
right from the root scope always
whenever you use dollar apply that is
pretty important and next one is whether
or not you use dollar apply behind the
scenes whenever you try to use ng click
event or any other angular JS related
events dollar timeout
or dollar HTTP with callbacks and so on
they actually call dollar apply at the
end of the logic so whether you use ng
click or timeout or HTTP or so on behind
the scenes internally inside angularjs
all of these will be executing dollar
apply and that is the reason why Dahl
why the digest process automatically
gets kicked in whenever you use any of
these so if you use any of these dollar
apply click kicks in and that actually
invokes that I just process all the way
from the root scope and the next one is
dollar digest so this is almost similar
to dollar apply except that the digest
is going to be kicking in on the current
scope only so it doesn't start with root
scope always so if you are on the
current scope and if you use dollar
scope dollar digest it actually tries to
kick in the digest process only for that
scope so it's not going to be affecting
any other scope related watchlist but it
actually does in work that I just
process only on the current scope and
then further it actually goes to the
updating of Dom only for the current
scope
this is mainly used to improve improve
the performance of your entire single
page application whenever you have too
many number of scopes and you do not
really need all of the scopes to be
updated when you are pretty sure that
only one scope really needs to have the
values to be updated in the UI and this
I already mentioned like it doesn't
really starts from root scope or any
other parent scope so when our use
dollar scope if this dollar scope it
refers to this one it actually does that
if actually does with this one it does
with this scope along with the internal
one as well so it doesn't stop for the
current scope it actually goes through
the current scope and all of the
children and the nester ones okay and it
could be called from root scope also so
if you have the reference to dollar root
scope and if you called all the root
scope dialog digest it is as good as
really calling the dollar scope that
apply so whether US Dollars code that
apply or whether you use dollar root
scope digest those are almost similar
okay so now that we have some
understanding about dollar apply and
dollar digest I think the next thing is
we need to have some practical scenario
on how we can demonstrate these
capabilities okay so I have a simple
HTML which actually has a controller
assigned to EMP so you can see I have an
EMP defined with two scope variables a
and B and those two are currently made
available in the form of text box and a
one-way binding so which means this is a
read-only binding and easy Road only
binding however I have readwrite binding
here and another retried binding here
for both a and B respectively so let me
get this one out using my browser here
and now you can see I have both of the
variables so let me open my developer
tools let me clear let me refresh this
and now you can see my developer tools
are ready with those two values so the
moment I say ten at the moment I said 20
you can see these two are automatically
updated because
those are actually working with ng model
so ng model actually kicks in the digest
process automatically and it knows that
once clicking on the ng model or once
you are modifying the ng model related
expression at the end of evaluation of
that expression it actually calls the
digest process and the digest process
will be updating the UI and does this
gets updated automatically
so ng model behind the scenes actually
calls dollar apply and that is the
reason we have it but imagine I am
actually trying to modify manually so I
go to my body
get hold of this controller and I come
in here and now I am going to say
angular dot element of dollar zero so
dollar zero is essentially the chrome
chrome related what is a feature where
it really gives you access to the
currently highlighted element so if you
click on this guy you are actually
getting the reference of that element
using dollar zero so this is not jQuery
this is chrome related feature so the
moment I pee type in there you can see
I'm actually getting the reference of
that one here okay let me clear again
and now I can get the scope of that
particular element so I can say scope so
which actually gives me scope related
variables like a and B so you have a
value is 10 and B value is 20 so let me
clear everything and now let me try to
modify the value of B to something like
40 okay
now I modified the scope and the
variable B to a new value called 40 so
let me check my scope again I open the
scope of the current element and you can
see a value is 10 which is the same
thing B value is 40 however this is not
getting updated because
you are modifying the scope wearable be
outside the angular context whenever I
say angular context you are actually
modifying inside the console so this
console has got no access to angular
context and angular context doesn't know
of any kind of activity you do inside
the console so even though you are able
to access the scope variables here and
still happen to modify the value of
those variables using the console it
doesn't go inside the angular context
and thus the digest process doesn't know
that it has to be kicked in so the dices
process is not at all invoked and the UI
is not being updated at all so even
though you happen to modify the values
of the scope variables outside the
angularjs context as long as you do not
invoke that the digest process you are
not going to get the UI updated now how
do I get that UI updated so very simple
as we know we have the manual way of
asking the digest process to be invoked
so the moment I say this one I am saying
that please go to the root scope and
kick in the digest process for this
particular elements the moment I plus
enter and now you can see the value of B
has been automatically modified not only
that now even if I say something like a
let us consider I'm modifying a to
something like 100 and at the same time
I'm modifying B to 200 so I modify both
of those but none of them are appearing
here but the moment I say apply you can
see the entire UI gets updated as
because that I just process has kicked
in ok now that we have some
understanding of the dollar apply here
we need to understand on how we can
really make use of fit as part of our
particular application so in this case I
would like to have an you button here in
this case I would like to call this
button
something like calculate some so I would
like to have some some to be calculated
in this case and in this case I would
like to have ng-click to be used and I
would like to call calculate sum method
again is the scope so this is a simple
one and of course I need to have the sum
to be displayed and that I am going to
have some to be displayed using a new
scope variable called s so I need to
define calculate sum and I need to
define yes in my scope so I go back to
my a zero one GS and the first thing is
that I would like to have the default
value of sum we actually specified as
zero so that is the sum by default and I
would like to have the calculate sum to
be defined in the form of a function
here which actually calculates the sum
of a and B and places the value inside s
so I am going to say something like this
okay so I just saved everything and I
also saved this one and let me go to my
browser I to flash this and now let us
see I modify the value of 10 and I
modify the value of 20 and now I'm going
to say calculate sum and now you can see
I have 10 20 okay because it is playing
to concatenate 10 and 20 here if you
really want to probably you can just
modify this one to something like number
something like this so that you are
trying to convert the strings to number
and probably it can give a better result
rather than simply what is a
concatenating at the moment I do you can
say got some so let me go back here and
try to modify the same way I said
earlier so I modified okay I need to
highlight that so let me highlight this
one so now I am specifying a value as
100 and B value as 200 and now I am
going to click on calculate sum and now
you can see not only did calculate the
sum but it actually did update all of
this so from this we can easily
understand like ng-click you can see
that our ng-click whatever you used in
here behind the scenes even though it
calculates all of this it actually kicks
in dollar apply and that is the result
why we have the entire UI updated
because the digest process has been
kicked in okay we are fine with this one
but still I did not use dollar apply in
my application so how can I make use of
it in order to make use of the dollar
apply you should really try to update it
outside the angular context but ng-click
works within the angular context and we
don't need dollar apply so let me define
another button and I would like to call
this one as just some you can place
whatever the caption you would like to
have and I would like to define
something like this and click
button click and I just wanted to
execute this guy and you can see this is
a Dom event and I just would like to
execute a dumb function and this whole
part is not related to angular at all so
now I go to a zero one that is my
angular JS here and now I am going to
define it doesn't need to be an
angularjs why because this is just a
plain function you can you can define it
even within your HTML also this one
doesn't need to be part of a zero one
dot J's but I just wanted to make this
one as a global function this is not
related to angularjs or app at all so in
this case I just wanted to have the
element do so you can see the name of
the ID of my div is d1 I just wanted to
get hold of it using jQuery or using
angle a angle element just like I did in
my consoles so I am going to say angular
third element and using jQuery reference
I would like to have what I say t1 to be
the three order using jQuery and once I
got hold of element I would like to have
the scope to be Retriever and I would
like to store that in dollar scope or
whatever the variable you mentioned here
this could be a or b so now I have the
scope of that particular element day one
now I can modify the value of it so in
this case I would like to have something
like scope that s equal to this whole
thing so I can I can easily write that
right here so let me see what's going on
here
so using this scope I am getting the
current value available in the a and
current value available in be summing it
up and placing in dollar s sorry dollar
scope dot s which means s is the
variable so I'm not doing anything here
other than just calculating and placing
the value inside s so I go back to this
just refresh this one okay so this is
our button which has got no relation
with angularjs so let me go in here and
let me see how the scope is available
currently so I select ok i need to i
always forget this so i need to
highlight the element and again I select
scope and now you can see I have the s
value of 0 which is default so let me go
in here I do this let me clear both of
those and again I do the scope and now
you can see I should have a and B but
not s and the s can be calculated as
certainly now I click on sum and this is
being done outside the angularjs context
so I click on here so which means sum
should have been done by now
so I again check the scope you open this
one you can see the sum is right there
it has calculated 10 plus 20 s 30 but it
did not update this value because even
though you modified yes it is outside
the scope of angularjs and as you can
simply fix it by saying dollar scope dot
dollar apply so which means you after
manipulating all the values of the scope
in whatever the way you want it after
modifying all the values you just kick
in the digest process which knows that
it has to update the UI
once all the Watchers has been passed so
let me refresh this and now I said 10
and 20 and the moment I click on some
now you can see 30 has been
automatically done so this is how you
can use dollar apply and you can use
dollar apply fund only if you are
outside the context of angularjs and
there are a couple more syntaxes of
using it so instead of writing these two
statements you can have dollar applied
to bill having its own function so which
means applies to execute this function
before even trying to execute the apply
so I can just use this one right here so
which means dollar apply says that
please execute this function and after
the completing of this function please
execute dollar apply so even this should
work with no issues so i refresh this i
modified something like 200 and click on
some you can see
reply still works with no issues okay
now that we understood on how to work
with dollar reply now is the time to
work with dollar digests so we did not
use dollar digest in our application so
I already had some right up on dollar
digest so let me grab that and push
inside this one okay so let me close all
of this now let me open a zero one zero
one GS and my what is it template so I'm
opening all those three here okay so
this is a simple one where I am using ng
repeat so which means I'm going to have
a repeat here and that is actually going
through all the objects available in the
data available at scope levels so if you
go to a zero one j s you can see I have
data variable which is having a
collection or solid array in this case I
have four objects so it has got four
objects and each object has got
properties we and are essentially I mean
value and result so you can see those
four objects are going to be repeated
here and for each and every iteration I
am going to have whoa which means for
each and every iteration of this data
every object will be actually stored
inside whoa and I am trying to access
this whoa inside my custom directive
called message so if you see that you
can see I have a custom directive called
message which is using a template
available in in photo at MSG where
inside this all I am saying is that just
get the value available inside the
property V of the current object whoa
which is currently nothing but the
iterated object of that particular data
so if I have four objects then you are
going to have this template to be
evaluated for four times and that I am
going to have four values to be
displayed so let us quickly test this
and see if it is working so now you can
see I have all the four values to be
spread here 17 24 32 48 so if you go
back here you can see I have all these
four values to be displayed using the
same template so I define one template
and it is being repeated four four times
okay so this is using custom directors
so if you are not familiar with custom
detectives please refer to my previous
videos okay now is the time to actually
work with our dollar apply our dollar
digest in this case so let us start with
button click as we know I can have any
kind of year what is a markup here so in
this case I just would like to have a
button and again very similar to my
previous example I would like to have
calculate sum and on click I would like
to execute button click on the scope so
which means this actual works with
angularjs context because you are using
ng click and as part of this I would
like to have the result also so in this
case just like our previous sum I would
like to display the result to be
immediately after the button so and of
course I need to still define button
click and let me go to my what is say my
message and here I can have the
controller to be defined with my own
what I say controller in controller to
be defined with my own button click
event or method so I am going to say
function where I have access to scope
element and attributes of course not all
of those are compulsory just in this
case I am using only scope so I just
wanted to make use of it
scope that button click equal to
function and now I would like to have
the value available in way to be
multiplied with the same value which
means I am trying to accomplish the
square of
value V and I would like to have the
results to be placed in scope that word
R so which means please get the value
valuable in V of current object to o
again multiply the same value and place
inside R which means you are replacing
the current object related property are
with the latest value which is nothing
but the square of these two and finally
that needs to be placed inside wall so
which is nothing but you are updating
the scope with few values so let us go
back here and refresh this and now you
can see I have every row displayed based
on the current template so you can see
the template has the first value the
button and the result so this template
will be applied for all the objects
available in data so you go back here
now the moment I click in here now you
can see I have sorry it's supposed to be
calculate product not calculate sum so I
can say probably a better one there is
mine so instead of calculate sum I can
say calculate square so that is more
appropriate okay that's not some we are
not summing up here so now you can see
it is actually doing the square of it
and now we have the square but again we
did not use the dollar apply or die
alert digest here because we know that
ng-click automatically kicks dices
process so we don't need dollar apply or
dollar digest here now let us consider I
would like to have a simple button not
related to ng click so I would like to
say a normal button and I just wanted to
say Square and I would like to use a Dom
event so for that I just want it to
identify the button as ID so in this
case button sum is being identified by
ID so I cannot use on to create away or
straight away here of course I can still
use it but I just wanted to make use of
the post link and
the compile options available in
angularjs so I just would like to refer
this one straight into my post link so
that is the linking function I am
talking about so as part of this I can
go with compile so this compile can
actually return a linking function
netting with post link function which
has access to all of these and by the
way if you are not familiar with compile
or link or post link please refer to my
previous videos ok now I can access the
Dom element of I which means if you are
the third iteration you are going to
have the third instance of this template
and you can access that instance using
the I element so using I element by the
way this is nothing but a jQuery element
here by default I can find my button let
me see what is the name of the button so
you have buttons some so in the current
instance I am trying to get the
reference to button and on click so
which means this is the jQuery clicky
one and I would like to execute the
scope related button click event so this
is as good as that so what I'm saying
here is that I am accessing button sum
so for every new instance of this
template I am accessing this button some
attaching an event handler to that and
even handler being button click
automatically and this is a jquery event
so which means it will be working out of
the angle of context and even though you
are actually assigning the value or
modifying the value of r it is not going
to be shown automatically so because it
is working outside of angular context so
let us prove it so i just refresh this
now you can see a half square so let me
access a particular element here so in
this case probably the
third element so I click on that I
wanted to get the scope of it and let me
go to the scope you have the object whoa
and now you can see the value of R is
zero the value of V is thirty-two
obviously and let me click square yes
I clicked it it should have done its
process so let me again do this so I
open the scope of the current one which
is nothing but the third one in this
case I open war and you can see the
result has been calculated which means
32 into 32 becomes thousand 24 the value
of R has been modified by my function
but it was not immediately made
available here because it did not digest
which means it did not kick in the
process of digesters or digest cycle did
not come into the picture so in order to
accomplish that I had to say dollar
apply so I can simply say that dot
dollar die just so you can use dollar
digest or dollar apply here but if I use
dollar apply still it works so it
doesn't matter whether US dollar apply a
dollar digest in this case but there
exists one difference that is you may
not really see the difference but we
need to understand how it does so let me
click a square here now you can see it
is actually doing all the process okay
let me reflect this whole thing again so
we are out of it so let me go to the
second one so that is one this is the
third one so I go to the second one and
now I am going to say like dot R equal
to some value like 9 9 9 so I don't care
what it is but you can see that I am
actually modifying the second robe but
not the third row so modify to the R 2 9
9 9 and press Enter ok now I click on
the third row I modified the second row
but I am clicking on the 3rd row so the
moment I click on the 3rd row you can
see it
it has not only calculated the result of
this one but the previous one whatever
the value are placed in here also did
appear because I use a dollar apply so
dollar apply actually starts from the
root scope so whenever I mentioned root
scope it actually starts from here so it
calculates it watches for all the values
and if there exists any value changes
inside the scope it immediately updates
the down so even though you are clicking
on this button as you're working with
dollar apply it actually updates the
entire root scope which means your
entire UI in this case but let me
consider I am just using only digest let
me refresh this okay we are back now
again let me select the second one this
is the first one and this is the second
one so select it now I modify the value
to 999 and now I click on the third and
now you can see it applied only for the
current scope even though the value has
been modified in the previous coop we
did not because our particular digest
process kicked in only for the third but
not from the root scope and does even
though you modify 999 did not come into
the picture here so every scope really
works in here so in this way actually
you can improve the performance saying
that if you click on this square please
apply or kick in the digest process only
for this row as because I am pretty sure
that all the values in this case
actually work only for this one so that
is pretty important so if you have if
you're pretty sure that your particular
scope modifications are going to be
taking place only for the current scope
you always download digest instead of
dollar apply okay so let me take this to
the next level like for example I would
like to have what I say another view
here
and in this case I would like to have
some total to be calculated so I would
like to call a scope related function
called get total so this is the scope
related function at the root controller
I'm in the main controller to be
executed and calculating the total of
all the values available inside R so I
would like to have a total of all these
arts so let me go in here and yeah right
here so I I would like to have something
like dollar scope that get total
function in this case I would start with
some initially with zero and I return
the sum and for each I in dollar scope
data dot length and I greater than zero
I am s right so that should be fine and
now I should be able to get the variable
o from the current scope related data
object of the index I and I would like
to have the sum to be calculated based
on the value available inside R and
finally return the S so let me select
this one so this should be it so let me
refresh this okay now you can see I have
the total now I say calculate Square and
now okay so I have some problem
somewhere so let me see what it is so
okay I had to switch off this so it
cannot accept all of these at once so
the digest is already running there
because I am using ng click so in this
case you can see if I click on ng click
that I just happens automatically but at
the same time I am saying that please do
the digest again
which is going to be giving us the
problems so let me refresh this and now
I'm going to say calculate squared and
now you can see for every click on the
calculate square all of these values the
sum of all these values are
automatically calculated and provided at
the very last okay
now how about this square so let me I
don't want to use this of course let me
use this guy and let me use this one as
well and as you can see it actually
applies only for the current scope but
not for the entire root scope and if you
go back to your HTML this doesn't
actually go under the current scope of
the current object - oh this is outside
this part is outside this day oh so this
doesn't go inside this scope that is
important so I go back here plus f5 and
I click on this square you can see
individually all the squares are working
but this total is not getting updated
because the digest works only for this
scope but not the root scope or not the
parent scope but this one is outside
these scopes available so this actually
sits somewhere outside the divs or
outside this scope and does this one
doesn't get calculator but you can still
fix it by just saying instead of dollar
digest dollar apply as because it
calculates all the way from the root
scope so now let's save it I return back
here plus f5 and now you click square
and you should be able to see all of
those automatically getting calculated
so hopefully I guess you understood the
difference between dollar apply and
dollar digest the only difference is
that dollar digest applies only to the
current scope and it will simply neglect
any other scope beyond the current scope
and it's children whereas dollar apply
really works all the way from root scope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
