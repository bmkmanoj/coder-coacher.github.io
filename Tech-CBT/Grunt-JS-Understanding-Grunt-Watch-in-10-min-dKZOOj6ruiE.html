how to minimize JavaScript files using
crunches in this video we are going to
see an how to use grunt watch and
automate minifying files as they are
modified first of all what is grunt
watch it is a simple grand jazz plug-in
which keeps an eye on all the files and
folders based on your configuration and
upon modifications to any of those files
it is going to execute a respect to
grant J's task or target so let us
quickly see what I have in here so this
is a simple my app which is having a
couple of source files those are the
JavaScript files and a grant GS and a
couple of HTML files here so if you see
my package that jason all I have is
grant and the grant contribute a click
file so which means I would like to have
javascript minification to be done using
this plug-in called a grande kind of
uglify and these are the source files i
have in place app one and one more
called two so if I open one dot J's you
can see all I am doing is it is saying
this is from first method and again from
two Gs it says this is from second
method and t1 dot HTML actually gets
everything from all that Minda ge'ez
which is available in destination folder
like all that Minda GS and this file is
going to be automatically created by our
grant using the grant file here so you
can see in the grunt file oil I am
saying is that go through the source
folder get all the JavaScript files and
combine those JavaScript files into one
minify that particular combined one and
finally rename that to all that Minda
J's and place it in destination so this
file is automatically going to be
generated based on all the JavaScript
files it finds in source folder in order
to test this you can see there is I defy
task and t1 is the target so I can say
something like grant
a glyph I target one as you can see it
says one file created so even if I
remove this destination file here for
example I go in here and say delete you
can see there are no files in the
destination and I go back here and the
moment I say this one you can see all
that Minda jas is automatically added
and if I go back to my browser and
refresh this we are going to see this is
from first method and this is from
second method okay so now let us get
back to this and imagine I would like to
have some modifications to be done to
wonder Jas so I go to one dot Jas and I
would like to say this is first sample
method for example and once I modify
this I should save this so I go to file
save and in order to have this one to be
reflected in all that Minda J's I should
go back to my prompt and again execute
the task so that it refreshes all that
Minda J s and then again go back here
and refresh this and I am going to say
this is first sample method so executing
this particular task from the command
prompt is always bit tedious so which
means while it is not a big step to -
each and every time you modify any of
those particular JavaScript files you
know if you have to come back to this
prompt and execute this task it might be
a bit of anointment to the developer who
cannot really you know focus on other
things while he is developing a
particular application so it might be a
better idea if grant can automatically
detect any of those changes happening to
those JavaScript files in a particular
folder and execute the tasks
automatically by themselves so that is
where the grunt watch comes in so watch
means watching for files so whenever I
say watching for files it actually keeps
an eye on the folder or all the files
you
might be letting it know and while it is
watching or keeping an eye on those if
any of those files are getting modified
it immediately tries to execute the
respect to grant tasks or targets
whatever you specify so in order to
achieve that the first thing is that we
need to have the current watch to be
installed in our application so we go to
npm install grant contribute watch and
in this case i would like to say you can
also use save do dependencies whatever
I just wanted to use save here and if
you get back to this and if you open
package dot JSON now you should be able
to see grant contribute watch so that is
made available there and the next thing
is that I had to modify my grant file in
such a way that the grant watch is
configured so earlier I configured only
uglify now I need to configure current
to watch so the first thing is that I
need to have grant contribute watch to
be included as part of load npm tasks
and once that is there i need to add
watch tasks so what do we need to watch
so the okay the first one is target you
can just put any name there is because i
have only one target in this case so I
just put w1 you can rename to anything
here but this needs to be watched so as
part of w1 here as part of my target
called w1 what all I am going to say is
watch for all the files available in
source and within source go to all the
subfolders and watch for only JavaScript
files so that is how I'm specifying so
this is identical to whatever the
specification I did here so you can see
here also I am saying that go through
all the JavaScript files fetch them
combine them minify the file and place
it in this folder as this folder and in
finding so in this case what I am saying
is that a please watch all the
JavaScript files in all the sub folders
from this source folder
okay so the next thing is that if any of
those files are getting modified what
tasks need to be executed so in this
case I am going to specify a task and
all I have the task right now is just a
glyph I so which means a glyph and the
target is T one so I'm going to specify
uglify t 1 so which means if any of the
files are modified or JavaScript files
are modified please execute this
particular task which is nothing but my
task with T 1 which essentially grabs
all the JavaScript files and combines
them unifies them into one so that is it
this is pretty straightforward I just
save this I go back to my prompt and you
can say I go to ok the name of the task
in this case is watch and the target is
w1 so I would like to go for a grant
watch w1 that's it and now you can see
it is waiting which means it is
monitoring all the files available in
that folder called source folder and in
fact it actually watches or monitors
only the JavaScript files and as there
are no modifications being done at the
moment it's just waiting if there exists
any modifications it is going to
immediately execute our task and after
the execution of this task again it
starts waiting so let me minimize this
and let me push this a bit so that we
are going to see what is going on while
we are modifying things so here I have
this alert this is first from sample
method so just imagine I am going to
remove sample here so I am going to say
this is just first message instead and
after that I am going to say file save
the moment I save you can see it has
automatically picked that one so it says
that the file 1 dot J's has been changed
and immediately it is executing our task
called identified at T 1 and 1 file
created so if you go back to your all
that MnDOT GS you are going to see this
is first message so it has already
modified immediately
and you can see our grand task has been
completed within these number of seconds
and it is still waiting for a Dinesh
modification so I can go back to - and
I'm going to say something like second
message and I am going to save file save
now you can see it says the second file
has been changed and a new file has been
created and if you go back to all that
mandir j/s you are going to see this is
second message so if you go back to your
browser and refresh this you are going
to see this is first message and this is
second message so this is pretty
straightforward video about grunt watch
you can always use grunt watch in order
to monitor any of the files you
configure and if any of those files get
modified based on its content it can
automatically execute any of your grant
tasks or targets you specify to the
client watch thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
