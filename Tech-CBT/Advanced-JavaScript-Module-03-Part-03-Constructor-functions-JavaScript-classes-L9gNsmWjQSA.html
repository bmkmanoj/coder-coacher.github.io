various options and creating JavaScript
objects so in this video we are going to
look into constructor functions so these
are very specific to JavaScript so
constructions functions can also be
called as instance objects so we can
call either of those two but it is quite
so common to think any kind of
constructor functions in JavaScript as
classes so let us see one by one so what
exactly is a constructor function it
describes the structure of an object so
whenever I say it describes the
structure of an object essentially you
are creating the data type the data type
internally is going to have certain and
members basically so each of those
members could be either properties or
methods or whatever so in this case you
are actually trying to create a
particular data type called EMP EMP is
just in user defined data type which
internally can have four properties
employ number name himself in Department
number so whenever I would like to
create an instance of this data type we
call that one as an object so if you
create a variable based on this
particular data type EMP you are going
to call that one as an instance or an
object of this data type so basically
instead of simply calling this EMP as
data type you can call this whole thing
as constructor function so construction
function is very similar to class in a
the C++ or Java so whenever you think of
a class it is nothing nothing but the
most important feature of
object-oriented programming that is the
most minimum so whenever you define a
class you are essentially defining a
template of its own members where from
that particular template you are going
to create more and more objects or where
sort of it so in the case of JavaScript
you can literally have the same kind of
syntax or the features of a class or
object oriented class using constructor
functions and the most important thing
whenever you use in the constructor
functions is each of those particular
members have to be proceeded with this
operator or this keyword so if it is a
traditional JavaScript or just normal
JavaScript function you were just going
to have a function within the Amanda I
have that respective parameters and you
are going to write whatever the
instructions you would like to have here
declare variables do some process and so
on however in the case of constructor
functions you are going to have very
similar syntax of a function except that
those particular members which need to
be acting as properties will be preceded
with this keyword and just like
previously I explained about anonymous
functions you can also have those
particular constructor functions to be
defined in the form of anonymous
functions so even in this case you are
actually defining EMP which is going to
be constructor function and that
particular constructor functions can
have all of these particular member
variables now as I mentioned earlier we
can really instantiate or create objects
from those particular constructor
functions so how do we do that by using
new keyword so which means I can use the
new keyword along with that particular
name of the constructor functions so in
this case I have EMP and the same EMP
I'm using here and I am saying that
please allocate some memory based on the
structure I have here so whenever I say
new it is going to create a new memory
location to actually fit all of these
members and I am saying that all these
values need to be actually be sent to
these particular variables and those
variables will be reused to a scientist
as values to the respective members so
these are essentially nothing but the
parameters to be passed whenever you are
creating an instance or creating an
object out of that particular
constructor function so once that
allocation has been made that entire
memory location will be assigned to a
new variable or an object variable
called Oh EMP you can use any of those
particular available names whatever
you'd like to have and essentially now
you can say like oh MP is an instance of
this EMP for constructor functions which
internally has all of these four members
and those four members will have all of
those values assigned to them
respectively
so in theory behind the scenes that we
EMP could be represented in this fashion
so which means that we MP is going to
have all the members associated inside
the same object and all the values are
going to be assigned to all of those
members respectively
one of the important features is that
whenever you modify the constructor
function just like the class whenever
you modified the definition of the
constructor function it is going to
automatically affect all of those
relevant objects why because you are
modifying the structure if you modify
the structure any kind of instance which
has been created based on that
particular structure will have the same
kind of template or copy of those
members
so essentially you are adding or
modifying structure that means you are
modifying the definition or the values
or the members available inside that
particular instance so let us quickly
take it demonstration on constructor
functions how we are going to declare
and define constructor functions how we
can define objects based on the
construction questions and on top of it
how do we access
members available in those objects using
various notations we have so let us
start and jump into the program right
now so let me add a new file here so I
just call this one as 0-3 for now and I
would like to have the script to be
added so as I mentioned any kind of a
constructor function is very similar to
normal functions all you need is just
the name of the function with the
necessary parameters you would like to
send while instantiate an object so I
just wanted to have some difference like
we salary we Department number and so on
so it is very similar to a function
declaration except that you are going to
have the members of the function to be
defined using this so this dot my name
or equal to be employee number
so similarly I can say this dot a name
for the ve name and this dot server V
equal to V sellable this dot Department
M or equal to V Department number so in
that way I can define a particular
constructor function so which means
essentially you define a class called
EMP and once I have a class called EMP I
need to create an instance out of it and
the easiest way to do that is create
available with whatever the name you
wanted and then use the new operator and
use that particular function name or
class name or construct the function
name and provide all the necessary
parameters it is expecting so in this
case I would like to say employee number
has 1 0 0 1 and my name is Jack and
other things like celery and Department
number and so on since that way I can
have all of the stuff has mentioned
earlier and now I can access each of
those members try using
the object dot member notation which
means I'm using the object name which is
nothing but we MP dot the member so this
is very important to know the moment you
press dot here you can see all the
members have been automatically provided
for you for example imagine if you're
not using this but instead you are using
something like there where instead so I
can say some member equals some value
let us consider so I declare that
something as such it is it is not going
to give you any errors but however if
you press dot you can see that is not
going to appear here as because that is
not preceded with this but the moment
you turn that particular variable in the
form of a member by proceeding with this
you can see it is automatically made
available for that particular object so
this is important to know anyway so I
don't need this in here as because that
is only to let you know that each of the
members available inside the constructor
function need to be preceded with this
operation
oh sorry operator or say this keyword
and now I can have employee display and
again I would like to have Department
member to be displayed and once I have
everything in place
I just wanted to ensure that this is
working so I'll just execute it and let
us see if it is going to give us the
alert with all of those particular
values
and there we go so it has actually given
us all those particular values so we
have actually created a constructor
function where you are going to define
each of those members by proceeding each
of those members with this and then you
are going to define or create instances
of those particular constructor
functions so which means using the same
structure you are going to create a real
object of the fit and once the object is
created it is going to have all of those
values to be populated to the respective
members and you can access those members
accordingly and now let us see if there
are other ways to actually get the data
or fetch the data from the object so as
I mentioned behind the scenes any kind
of object is very similar to associate a
array so a already we already discussed
about associate a have a as in my
previous videos so as long as those are
associate areas we have the luxury of
using for in loop so we are going to use
the same thing here for each property in
object EMP so I can use like that so
this P could be anything it could be M
or whatever so just for my understanding
and better readability is start with P
and now I can say please display the
name of the property and the value of
that particular property using associate
era syntax so what I am saying is that I
would like to access each of those
particular property members using
associate array syntax so OMP behind the
scenes is considered as associate array
which means the index cells are going to
be the names of those particular
strengths so each of those properties
are automatically maintained in the form
of array indexes so that is where I can
get all the information
so if you need more information about
associate errors I strongly suggest you
to go through my previous videos so let
me check if this is going to work for us
and now you can see I have the first
property second property the property
and fourth property so not only this I
we also have other ways to accomplish
the same for example I can start with
something like function so empty and I
wanted to send an object as parameter
and that particular object is going to
be stored as part of war now I can say
like with all so with is a different
construct which can be used only with
objects so the beauty of that particular
width statement is I can use the same
kind of statements or whatever I am
really working with those particular
objects however instead of defining ODOT
EMP everywhere so imagine this is how
usually I am going to write any kind of
statement so instead of using whoa
everywhere you already defined you are
have already defined whoa at the top so
all you have to do is just work with the
members straightaway without using the
object reference so JavaScript runtime
is smart enough to figure out that these
members are actually being deduced from
that particular object as because it is
inside the with constructor so the width
construct makes our particular life
easier by actually specifying the object
at the very top but we are going to
access only the members out of it so
this is another way of accessing the
same object members but anyway as this
is a normal function I need to call this
particular function somewhere so in this
case I am going to call here
and I'm going to send whatever the
object I have created here to the same
function as parameter so which means
this particular statement is going to be
executed the moment sorry this function
is going to be executed at the moment
this statement gets executed so which
means I'm zenui mp2 all and using or it
is going to execute the rest so let me
test this one too and now you can see I
got all the information as necessary so
in that way we have seen three different
ways of accessing the object members
along with the creation of constructor
functions and instantiating the objects
out of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
