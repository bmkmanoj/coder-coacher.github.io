are you are already familiar to visual
studio this is a video which introduces
on developing angularjs applications
using Visual Studio 2017 this video is
not intended for beginners who do not
have any understanding about angularjs
2.0 if you are completely new to angular
JS 2.0 I strongly recommend you to refer
to my previous video before proceeding
ahead and in this video mostly
concentrate on how to get things working
using Visual Studio what are the goals
of this video few things are expected
from your site that is you should have
some understanding about angularjs to a
point or above that is like modules
components how typescript is going to be
used how system j/s is going to be used
how to configure typescript how to
compile typescript and so on and on top
of that your machine should have node
and NPM already installed that is
version 6 + + 3 + respectively and you
should have a better understanding on
how
package rejection is going to be working
which actually is mainly used to install
or uninstall node packages and on top of
that you should have visual studio 2017
installed what is going to be covered as
part of this video we are going to
create a visual studio project from this
class and in fact we try to create a
sweet ended project here even though we
do not write any c-sharp or darknet
related code we create a sweet acne
project exclusively for the web server
purposes but we do not write any kind of
darknet code as part of this video at
least and apart from creating visual
studio project here we are going to have
a complete development environment to be
set up for an angular application
locally for that application alone we
are going to develop a simple angularjs
2.0 application and we are also going to
demonstrate on how we just through the
intelligence is going to be working in
order to develop angular based
applications we are also going to see on
how to compile
transpile our typescript files and in
order to compile our typescript files
you can always do that
as part of the widget studio itself so
which means you can use Visual Studio to
compile edge script files or you can
also go out of Visual Studio and compile
the same typescript files you are also
going to use gulp here just in case if
you would like to have all of these to
be automated so if you are not familiar
to gulp just refer to my previous videos
as part of the same channel next we are
going to execute our angular based
application directly from within Visual
Studio or outside Visual Studio which
means whenever I say outside it is
essentially using command prompt we can
also debug our angular based application
with the code which is written in
typescript completely come within Visual
Studio and without really going out of
Visual Studio so in simple we would like
to layer eyes and take advantage of
Visual Studio as much as possible in
this video in order to develop angular
based applications before even jumping
into Visual Studio let us make sure that
we have node and NPM already installed
on a machine so I go to command prompt
and then here I am going to test whether
node has been installed by typing a
command node - V in this case we have
6.10 installed and similarly we should
have NPM also installed with version 3.1
so make sure that both of those are
installed on your machine prior to
proceeding ahead and now I'm going to
switch to visual studio and inside the
visual studio the first thing is that I
need to create a new project from the
scratch so for that purposes I am going
to click on file and go to new and click
on project so we are going to select
asp.net web application by actually
drilling through c-sharp
web and then going through this one we
are not going to write any asp.net or
c-sharp related code we will be focusing
on angularjs but the project type what
we are going to create now is going to
be a spit out and web application and
you can also see that I am currently
giving the name of the application as
web
one you can provide your own name and it
is going to be stored and see them so if
you switch to C temp you can see
currently this is the folder which is
completely empty and the moment I click
on ok it is going to ask what type of
template you would like to use I just
would like to go with the very basic
like literally nothing empty template
which means no files related to HP
document will be included
no waveforms no MVC no web api nothing
no unit tests and north indication so it
is just empty with no other features
enabled click ok so the moment you click
in ok here you can see it is going to
have the folder or web application one
to be created inside your temp folder
now once you switch back you are going
to see you also use an explorer with all
the asp.net related default stuff we are
not going to use any of that stuff we
are going to create our own stuff and
make sure that that stuff is really
working so the first thing is that we
need to make sure that our particular
application is really being executed or
successfully being executed by pressing
this button so which means you should be
able to debug our application and test
it just by simply pressing this button
or pressing f5 so for that purpose this
would like to create a new HTML page for
our testing purposes so I'm going to say
add HTML page so in this case I am going
to say something like dummy you can
provide your own name there and in this
case I am going to say something like
this is dummy web page I just would like
to make sure that this is working by
just pressing this button and if you
have AF Express installed and your
richest 30 2017 working successfully you
should be able to see your web server
automatically having its own port number
determined by your project and on top of
that it should be automatically going to
damage out HTML which in fact shows the
message whatever we typed in
okay so now that we understood like our
project is working fine for debugging
and other purposes let us get rid of
this demo dot HTML and start creating
the real angularjs stuff so before even
proceeding anywhere the first important
thing for angularjs application is
bringing in all the libraries of
angularjs that can be easily achieved by
using node package manager and in order
to start NPM with our application we
should help package dot Jason and the
easiest way to include package dot Jason
as part of your application is either
using command prompt or directly using
the Visual Studio here
so in this case I would like to use the
results to do so I just right click on
the project there go to add new item
just search for installed templates and
go for NPM and you are going to see NPM
configuration file the moment you
selected you are going to see package
door Jason right there and click Add and
now you can see you have packaged or
Jason already made available as part of
your application so in here we need to
include all the necessary angularjs
related libraries but you know typing
those libraries could be very difficult
if you don't know what kind of you know
wash ins are currently available or
latest ly available so the easiest way
to include each of those libraries again
is through command prompt so in this
case let me just add one library called
angular core for example so for that
purposes I will be switching back to
command front for a moment by going to
open folder so which means I am going to
open my web application folder directly
in Windows Explorer or fire exploded so
you can see right here so I am in temp
and inside that I have web application
and this is the project folder and
inside that you can see I have the
package de JSON so try opening your
command prompt right in here and start
installing any of your angularjs
libraries so all the angularjs
libraries which are necessary have been
already covered in my previous video
so reflected that one if you do not
understand this stuff but in this case I
just would like to go with a very basic
one called something like npm install
and i would like to save that
installation directly to our packaged or
json and i am going with angular slash
core or common so in this case let us
consider i'm typing something like this
and you will be having a bunch of other
libraries to be included before even
proceeding ahead but for now we just go
with one so that we are going to see and
how it is going to be reflected in
package dot JSON so the moment i press
enter you can see it has installed
something and of course it is expecting
other dependency libraries as well but
for now let us clear everything and see
what's going on the first thing you
should be able to see is that you have
node modules which has been
automatically created so once you open
this you are going to see angular and
inside that the common so this is the
folder which will be automatically
created by node package manager in order
to bring in all the respective libraries
download them and get them installed as
part of your application and if you go
back to your visual studio you are going
to see the package dot jason has been
modified so there is a notification
click yes to reload it and once you do
that you should be able to see your
library whatever you have added from the
command prompt and all of those
libraries whatever you might be adding
behind the scenes using the command
prompt will be automatically listed here
for some reason let us consider you
happen to delete this node modules
folder you are not going to see this
node module folder directly inside your
visual studio so if you open show all
files then you are going to see this but
there is no need of including that
folder in your application at all you
can just make it completely hidden or
exclude from your project you don't
quite need that in your visual studio or
solution so let us consider I am
actually removing that folder and which
means if you remove this folder you have
removed everything you have downloaded
that is in this case you removed all the
libraries or all the files are related
to this package and how do we get it
back do we need to again get back to
our command prompt turn in the reinstall
them not really necessary you have that
simple option by right-clicking on the
package rejection and just say restore
packages so whenever we say restore
packages you are going to see this time
thing at the very bottom saying that
installing packages and the
installations have been completed right
here so if you open output you are going
to see angular common has been
downloaded and installed and if you
switch back to your web application
folder you are going to see node modules
again being created by ourselves so let
me make sure I again delete this I go
back here and register packages and
again it is trying to install everything
and if you go back here you should be
able to see node modules so in that way
you can add as many number of and number
of libraries as you want for your
angularjs but I do not want to include
I mean install each of those libraries
one by one as because all of those have
been already covered earlier but in this
case I would like to have a reference to
my previous video source code which has
been uploaded to github so in this case
I'm going to switch to my github account
that is text ability so github.com
slashed activity where the entire source
code for all of the videos have been
uploaded here and you should be able to
see YouTube channel source code the
moment you open it now you should be
able to see something angular 2 in this
case so I open this one and this is the
application which has been demonstrated
and completely explained from the
scratch in my previous video so I am
going to reuse this code in order to
make this video simple so the first
thing is that we need to include all the
angular JS related libraries in my
visual studio solution so I open
packaged rotation and you can see I have
tons of libraries which have been
already mentioned here so I just copy
this whole thing I go back to my visual
studio remove everything and replace
that with this one so you can see I have
all those versions or the libraries
which have been brought in exclusively
for my application so in order to make
sure everything works fine that has
ensured that I delete node modules
folder here so I go back and it here
the simplest way I can just right click
here and destroy packages so the moment
I say that you can see it is installing
all the packages here and it is in
progress right now because there are
tons of things which are supposed to be
downloaded and you can always see the
progress by opening your output ok now
that you have this command I mean this
message which is saying installation of
packages are all complete so if you go
back to your folder and if you open node
modules you are going to see all those
libraries which have been downloaded
exclusively for our application and
you're going to see bunch of angular
things and you should be also be able to
see the typescript and other stuff ok so
the next one is typescript configuration
so which means our code for angular JS
development will be develop using
typescript so in order to have
typescript to be added as part of our
application the first thing is that we
need to create a type script file write
some code configure our typescript in
order to get it compiled so the first
thing I am going to add a new folder
called app and in this case I would like
to add some kind of very simple dummy
execute file so I go to add new item we
can search for typescript and you can
see how typescript file you can provide
your own name in here so in this case I
am going to call something like test
type script press add and I can just
simply type in some typescript code here
in this code I'm going to create a
simple test class which is going to have
something like message so that is going
to be the function which which returns
string and on top of that I am going to
use the return with test so this is a
very simple
Plus with just one method and the method
returning a message called test in the
form of string so this is the typescript
file which I need to compile or set
transpile into plain JavaScript or say
Eggman script 5 in this case so how can
you achieve the compilation of this type
script so that all the browser's can
really understand this code so in order
to accomplish that the first thing is
that we need to actually create PS
config or typescript configure jason so
the easiest way again right click here
go to add new item select the types clip
and in this case you are going to see
type script JSON configuration file just
select that which actually gives you TS
configured jason click add' and it is
going to give you some default options
but i'm going to use my own options from
my previous source code and i go back
here go to TS config and i'm going to
use all of these options so just copy
all of the stuff writings to my tales
config ok the next thing is that we need
to compile this type script so how do i
compile it so there are a couple of ways
in achieving this one so the first one
let us compile this using command prompt
so again I go back to command prompt and
how do you compile it so if you have
typescript globally installed you can
just type in TS see it works but in my
case i installed typescript locally
which means local to the application so
for that purposes if you go back to your
node folder you can see in the node
modules you are going to see bin and
inside that you are going to see TS see
that commander this is the one I'm going
to use in order to compile my type
script from the command prompt not from
the visual studio yet so how to compile
from command prompt so I'm going to say
node modules slash dot bin slash TF see
that actually compiles all the
typescript files available in my
application so if you go back here and
if you actually show all the files you
are going to see test GS
which has been automatically created by
the compliation so again let me remove
these two files and again I compile this
I go back i refresh this and you are
going to see those two automatically
generated you should be able to see them
directly in your folder as well so if
you open your app folder which has been
created you are going to see these two
have been created after compilation or
compiling this type script file as well
okay what are the other ways to compile
this I know it will not be very
convenient to always switch the command
prompt and do the things so we should be
able to have these things automatically
done from our visual studio so let us
refresh this now you can see there are
no files or say no compile the files of
the type script the simplest way are I
click here and just build so once you
build it actually tries to build using
all the asp.net or c-sharp related
compilers and everything is because we
created a project as such but even
though it actually does everything on
top of that it actually compiles even
our typescript files as well so you
don't really need to go to your command
prompt in order to compile your
typescript files those could be
automatically done the moment you say
build your solution that is the easiest
way of compiling typescript files once
you have TS config successfully
configured okay so the other way is
actually involving gulper let me remove
these stuffs so what is the use of gulp
in our case the use of gulp in our case
is it works as a task runner behind the
scenes and watches for all of my
typescript files and if those typescript
files have been created or modified it
automatically gets triggered the gulp
triggers the compilation of any of those
type script files which have been
modified or newly created so let us see
how we can achieve that the first thing
is add excel file so I am going to add
new item search for gas
and here you should be able to take gulp
configuration file so we have this gal
file click add and you can see it has
given some default stuff they remove all
that stuff so try to write any kind of
code there are a couple of things which
needs to be downloaded for your package
or JSON so which means we need to have a
few more libraries in order to help to
be working and for that purpose I'm
going to include a couple more so in
this case I'm going to use gulp that is
going to be under the devil dependencies
so which means we do not want that in
the production only for the development
so you can see I'm saying that please
get me gulp gulp client calculator
source maps and also the typescript
stuff related to God so all of these
four are essential in order to have
Delta V working so I go back here I can
either say npm install to actually
install the new stuff or as i mentioned
you can always go with packaged
rejection but i click there and restore
packages but chances are we just really
is smart enough to actually monitor the
modifications of package.json
and try to download all that stuff
automatically for you and let me go to
the temp and in the node modules you can
see right here the gulf has been
automatically downloaded for us and that
too at the very latest way so you have
the gulf beauty is gulf typescript and
everything so you don't quite need to
actually a right-click and restore but
you can still restore packages if you if
you really want to be confident enough
that it is really syncing up with all
the package libraries locally so just
would like to do this once again and
make sure that all the packages are in
place and now as it says installing
packages are complete so which means all
these packages already now i have to
develop the script for the gulp
where it can be used to compile or
transpile our typescript files and at
the same time may be added with a couple
more tasks for watching our typescript
file
and continuously compiling them as we
modify them and share them or as we
create them and save them so in order to
do that I need to write a couple of
lines of code for which I'm going to
copy and paste right now and if you are
not familiar with this code again please
visit one of my videos regarding on gal
so I I included a complete video
exclusively for gulp alone so I save
this in simple words you can see I'm
actually getting all those packages gulp
typescript TS config you can see I have
that PS configure gulp source map all of
these have been included in my package
rotation you can see all of these
packages I am referring here and now I
am saying that from the PS configuration
get me the source so in this case that
is nothing but our application folder in
this case all the source related stuff
on top of that initialize the source
Maps compile the project right here and
if we have any kind of source maps
created always write those to the
current folder and the current folder or
the compilation of the whole of this one
should always be written directly to app
folder and you can see our app folder is
going to be the destination once all
these compilations are going to be done
and this is a task which is named after
default similarly I'm actually creating
one more task called Dell so we are
going to have two different tasks
default and Dell and you can use either
this one or this one however this will
be continuously watching for any of the
dot PS files available in the app folder
so if you have any of the typescript 4
files which have been modified or newly
created then this task is going to be
automatically switching to this task
which means it calls this task called
default and immediately compiles those
files which have been newly modified or
newly created so this is a watcher and
this is just to perform the compilation
alone so all of these can be performed
directly either through the command
prompt or from the visual studio alone
so let us start with gulp from the
command from itself so I go back to
command prompt this is only for
demonstration so in this case
and I would like to work with gulp so I
can just go with node modules and I have
the Gulf installed and have been folded
as usual and I can say gulp and provide
your gulp task name so in this case the
task name is default so if we don't
provide default it automatically figures
out the default already exist so it goes
with that so even if you don't provide
default here it knows that it can pick
up default so I can just remove that and
click enter and now you can see it tries
to go through that task called default
and it has completed it and if you go
back here and refresh it you are going
to see those two automatically generated
so now again I can remove it ok that is
how you can use gulp using command
prompt but again I would like to keep
myself away from command count as much
as possible so is there any better way I
can use this scalp right inside Visual
Studio yes that is just by clicking on
that calc dot j s that is gulp file
DOJ's file and you are going to see
tasks run not explorer exclusively for
that gulp file alone and E if you open
it you are going to see this so just
refresh this and you are going to say
tasks default out there if you are not
going to see this just keep refreshing
for a couple of moments and you are
going to see that and you can see this
is our default the easiest way to
execute that is just double click on
that one once you double click it
actually knows on how to execute it so
you can see it essentially goes through
the same kind of command whatever we
expressed earlier using call with all
the necessary you know
parameters finally to execute that
default again if I go back here and
refresh this you are going to see that
automatically created so let us see side
by side so this is my type script file
and this is my test OGS file so if this
test is modified it is supposed to
modify this test as well so I am going
to say this is like first test so I save
this and I return back it is not going
to be mmediately reflected here because
a compilation needs
we accomplished so I can just go back
and double-click this guy and once that
is done you can see it is going to give
a notification that it has to be
reloaded so I click yes and you are
going to see first a straightaway now it
is always going to be problematic to go
with you know clicking on that gulp file
or gulp task every time so rather it is
better to continuously watch for me and
then go after the type script files and
immediately get them compiled so the
easiest way is to actually have our del
to be working so just double click on
that and now you can see it will be
continuously listening for any of those
modifications of your pipe script files
so just I am pinning it here let's go
back here and now I am going to say
second test at the moment you click Save
you can see it has automatically
triggered our default tasks compiled it
is notified and if you return back here
you are going to see second and again if
you see third save it you are going to
see triggered and it is going to be
loaded right here so you will not get
any notifications if you don't have that
file open so all you have to do is just
type in fourth click Save and it is
going to be triggered so this is the
easiest way on how you can have
immediate compilation of each of those
particular tie script files whatever you
are going to create new or modify
existing so I really like this approach
personally as because this shows both of
the command line process and also from
integration to visual studio in line so
you have both options at the same time
ok let us remove all of these files and
let us start creating the original app
files so I would like to create the
first file directly from my previous
application so that is going to be app
and in this case I have hello world
component RTS so I would like to
demonstrate some kind of intelligence of
angularjs here so instead of copying and
pasting let us go through if the visual
studio supports intelligence of angular
JS related grammar so I just would like
to create a new file called hello world
component RTS
and type in this one all the way from
the scratch and see how it works so I go
back here and I try to create a new file
add new item and in this case I can just
say hello world that component the case
click Add and now let me delete
everything here the first thing is that
I need to import angular core so I'm
going to say from at the rate angler so
you can see intelligence is
automatically working for me and on top
of that from the core I would like to
actually get component and you can see
component is right there and on top of
that I would like to use component right
here so I go down all the way and I
would like to use component to attribute
right here and on top of that I would
like to use export and I would like to
create a class called hello world
component and I would like to create get
message as the first method which
returns a string and in this case I
would like to say return hello world
this is my first message something like
that and I would like to configure my
component here a bit by actually writing
this one so in this case I would like to
mention the selector so you can see I
have the selector already in place so
I'm going to say hello and at the same
time I would like to provide some
template so you can see I can provide
template and in this case I would like
to hell'
strong and I'm going to say get message
and this is going to execute my method
called get message and you can see all
of these components getting from angular
core everything is being automatically
included as part of the intelligence so
you can really take advantage of visual
studio intelligence in this case and
with no issues it should be able to
automatically compare successfully ok
similarly let me add a couple more files
so I go back here and along with hello
world I should
having app module the TSS also let me
create a new file called app module TS
so I go back here add a new file in this
case I'm going to call this one as app
module the TS click OK and let me copy
some code from whatever I have in place
here so that is right here this is the
route module of our application so I'll
go back here and copy this so I save
this and you can see it should be able
to have a HelloWorld component to be
automatically received
so if not let me remove this and you can
see hello world component is already
there so you can configure all of that
good stuff right there and let me
include one more file for entry part
that is the main entry so that is main
dirty-ass
i would like to create this file as well
so main dot TS so i go back here right
click Add again add a script file and in
this case main to 3s and the code for
main dirtiest is going to be this I save
it and now you can see how my entire
types could related stuff successfully
done so what's going to be the next one
that is our system J's config which is
mainly used to hook all of these things
together and get them on to the web page
so I need to create a JavaScript file so
for that purpose I am going to add new
item so in this case just a Java Script
so select JavaScript here and I'm going
to say system desk config yes so I'm
going to just minimize this for a moment
so as part of this again I would like to
get the previous code whatever I had in
place so I go to test so you can say I
have system gestured configure Jas so
just copy this whole thing so this whole
code whatever I am copying and pasting
from this entire application has been
covered in my previous video and you can
get the complete details from there so I
save this so the next thing I need to
create index dot HTML
so which actually fails at the webpage
so I go here add a new item and the HTML
page in this case I am going to target
eyes index dot HTM again the code for
that one I am going to reuse whatever I
had in place so just copy this and I
have everything in place right here
so looks like we have done with the
application just press this button or
press f5 in order to debug your
application and at the same time execute
your application and show the webpage
directly in the browser kicking up your
web server so I click on this and if
everything worked it has to come out
with the browser and the web page
together loading your JavaScript
together with angular and finally you
should be able to see the output and now
you can see hello world this is my
message so that is the message which we
have actually got directly from your
hello world component so right here this
is the one hello world this is my
message so that is the message you are
going to see right here and you can also
debug your stuff here for example I just
put a breakpoint in your typescript file
and click on this one and once you do
that you should be able to see the
breakpoint automatically hit at that
moment and you have the complete luxury
of your immediate window and at the same
time your call stack your local
variables your watches autos and
everything you have the complete luxury
of visual studio debugging environment
for your typescript and that too for
your angularjs based applications okay
so is it supported for Chrome yes it is
but a bit more different way like for
example I choose Chrome here and just
press the same button again and let us
see whether it work and initially it
will be showing a different message here
saying that it is kicking in the chrome
script debugging and once it is there it
is going to show automatically it is
going to skip that page
and jump right into our page here in
this case so that is one important thing
if you actually go to developer tools
here it is going to stop your debugging
session because you are you cannot debug
both in the visual studio and in the
Chrome browser at the same time so if
you are using this just use this but if
you would like to use Chrome you will
not be able to use your widgets to do
both at the same time okay but you can
see it is not hitting the big point here
the moment I executed so let us try it
again so again I click on this it is not
hitting the break point earlier and it
will not either now chicken you can see
it tried to load and it was here it has
loaded my application but the breakpoint
was not hit and the easiest way just
refresh your web page and it is going to
hit right away and I don't know the
reason at the moment maybe it could be
fixed in future but for now that is how
chrome is going to work you had always
refresh your web page in order to get
that one hood but as long as you are
really debugging inside the visual
studio it will not matter on whether you
are going to work with Google Chrome or
Internet Explorer until and unless you
really want to use client-side tools to
the button to debug your application
okay and if for some reason you are not
able to see this debugging or
breakpoints working make sure that you
always have this option always set that
is inside tools and options you are
going to see debugging and inside the
debugging go for general and inside the
general almost of the half of the way
you should be able to see this one that
is enable JavaScript debugging for
asp.net the two for chrome and ie so the
Visual Studio debugging environment is
going to be kicked in if and only if you
switch on this one okay till now we have
seen on creating a new a speed item
project from the scratch and developing
angularjs application on top of that
there is one more way to accomplish the
same
using website project instead so let's
see and how we can achieve that so this
is my web application so I just wanted
to keep it like that for now again let
me create file a new website so it's
better not empty website and here I'm
going to say sample website and now you
can see you will not find much
difference with respect to how your data
structure may look like so even if you
go back to your temp folder so let me
close this so you can see sample website
you're going to see with very minimal
web web files on how you are going to
work with so in this case let us imagine
I would like to bring in all my files
whatever I created from a previous
folder so let me close everything let me
duplicate this and the second one is
going to be the sample website so I just
would like to bring in my gulp file my
index my package system tears config and
my app so I'm just bringing all my
angler J's related resources of only so
I just copy all of this and go back here
and just copy all of those in here and
if you return back to your visual studio
and if you refresh this guy you should
be able to see all of those readily
available for you so you don't even need
to include them so let us see the output
here so we don't have any of the output
and if you go back here you can see no
node packages are currently available
again you can just right click here and
it is the package that Jason currently
you do not have that option that is a
restore package this option is not
available here so the easiest way
probably sometimes is actually modifying
this and you know do some kind of
modification and just click sale it is
going to kick in your installations
automatically so you don't really need
to jump into command prompt so if you
try to modify your package digestion we
just or you're smart enough to think
that package deal Jason has been
modified and let us ensure that all of
the related packages are locally
made available so in this case I did not
really modify anything I just pressed
enter deleted the line and just saved it
and again you can see it is actually
trying to download everything else it
might not show you everything from the
output point of view but if you go back
here you should be able to see node
modules with all of the stuff being
downloaded successfully on your machine
it will take a bit of time on that one
but on top of that as you have your gulp
file you can always compile your stuff
using gulp file so you can just right
click here and go to the task Explorer
so as mentioned you just try to refresh
this a couple more times once the
installation of all the packages are
done you can see installing packages are
complete still you are not seeing
anything in the output window but behind
the scenes is it does everything and if
you switch back to your nor modules
folder you can see I have everything
ready so it is smart enough in that way
you don't really need to click restore
packages just modify package rotation
and now I have the gulp file the
simplest way I run it and now you can
see it as successfully executed it which
means I should be having all my stuff
automatically compiled here so looks
like I already have all in place so let
me remove all the JavaScript files as
because they copied the entire folder I
just try to delete all this stuff and
have only typescript files now I go to
tasks folder delete it let us try to
execute my default again it is trying to
compile now and let me refresh this and
you should be able to see all the
JavaScript files there is one more
easier way of course it might not be
easier but that is this an option so I
just delete everything here you can ask
your gulp task to be always executed
whenever you have completed your
building of your project so which means
in this case if I say after build option
enabled so I just click on it and once
you do that you are going to see this
check mark which means this task default
is going to be automatically executed
the moment you build you
solution so that is pretty important so
the moment you build it it is trying to
build in its own way but immediately
after the build you are going to see
your task successfully executed as well
so once that is done and once you
refresh it you are going to see all of
those as well there is one difference
between asp.net project what we have
created earlier versus this one this is
not going to automatically build your
JavaScript files from the typescript
files that is very important so let me
delete this task and you can see this
default is not bound anymore so this is
not going to be kicking in so just build
it so I built it and let me refresh this
so you can see the JavaScript files are
not created but in my previous project
that is ASP doesn't project all the
JavaScript files have been created from
the type script automatically the moment
I build it but in the web site project
that is whenever you are using file new
website instead of project you will not
see typescript files automatically being
built whenever you build your solution
okay so now that we have everything in
place so let us try to execute this and
see whether it is working or not so I
would like to close this for now and
this is going to be my starting page set
a start page and just press Google
Chrome in here
yes it has done and let us see if it is
actually able to jump into my type
script and have a breakpoint there so I
am going to put a breakpoint here and
the moment I say refresh you can see it
has automatically hit my breakpoint
right there so those are all the various
ways on how you can use Visual Studio to
actually develop your angular JS
applications without losing the luxury
of intelligence and the compilation and
at the same time debugging capabilities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
