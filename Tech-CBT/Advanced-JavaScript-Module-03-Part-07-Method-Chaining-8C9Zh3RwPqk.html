method chaining so by now we should be
already familiar with JavaScript objects
its members methods and so on
so let us say what exactly is this
method chaining so two things first the
first thing is that a method is only
accessible from an object so we should
be able to understand that an object can
have members and the members could be
either properties or methods so if you
would like to access any method or
execute a method it has to be possible
only from an object that's the first
thing we should always remember the
second thing is that a method can return
an object so a method can or may or may
not return an object so in this case a
method can return an object that is very
much important to understand a method
not only can accept parameters but it
can return values or even objects now
what exactly is chaining so imagine I
have a particular construction
constructor function like this so
constructor function is very similar to
a class so in this case EMP is a class
which is having a method called the
increment salary so this is a method
which is essentially returning the
current object so this is important so
this method accepts some value as a
parameter that's some process here and
it returns the current object so return
this this stands for the current object
so when when you instantiate EMP it
could become something like a EMP so we
MP could be available which essentially
contains the entire physical instance of
this particular EMP function or say
construct a function or say class so
imagine I could write something like
variable EMP equal to MU EMP and I can
have all those values to be passed in
but and that statement essentially
could give us a particular instance of
this particular EMP class called as Oh
EMP and now I would like to access this
particular member or say method in this
case so I would like to execute this mem
method directly from this particular
object called EMP Soho EMP dot that
method and as it is accepting a
particular parameter I just wanted to
send in some value like 500 so till here
ye MP dot increment cell 3 of 500 so
whenever this part is getting executed
this particular function gets executed
and once this function gets executed we
are actually returning the current
object so which means this method is
being executed by this object called ymp
and we are saying that a return the same
object so which means whenever you say
oh MP dot particular that method that
method is going to return the same
object no matter what so as we are
having the same object called we MP we
can further access more members or the
same method once again and again and
again so in this case this whole thing
is converted to EMP as because this
particular function is returning the
same instance so they just consider
replace this whole thing with OMP so
again we are saying why MP dot increment
salary why because increment salary is
still the same method available in the
same object which is being returned by
the previous execution caller so in that
way we can have that particular method
so the method increment salary returning
the same instance and once you return
the same instance we can further access
the members of the same instance of over
and over again so that is called method
chaining which means we access methods
in the chained manner until the any
infinite level as long as that
particular function
our method returns the same instance
over and over again so let us see a
demonstration on this so let me go
through this so in this case let me
create a new file as I would like to
call this one oz09 and let me start with
the script okay so let me declare the
particular scalp-lock constructor
function something like function we
empty number the name and we salary so
this is a constructor function which is
having or accepting three parameters so
I would like to have three members like
this dot employee named board to be
initialized with EMP and OH and again
this dot name to be initialized with
whatever the name I am going to send as
part of the parameter and similarly
another member called this dot salary
and now I am going to declare another
method called increment salary and this
is going to be a function so I would
like to have the function definition to
be brought forward and this is going to
accept a particular parameter in the
form of variable increment whatever you
would like to provide there so all this
particular function does is just
increase the salary by whatever they
amount to a provider so this is just a
simple way of incrementing salary in
this case so just wanted to explain the
context and the concept here so the main
concept here is in order to chain the
methods this particular method in this
case has to return some kind of object
if it doesn't return anything we cannot
do that so dot can be done if one
we have a particular object so object
dot remember is the notation so if this
particular function returns an object
which is nothing but this in this case
then whenever I access this method I can
say execute this method in turn you get
the object and use that object dot
whatever the member you would like to
access so now I am going to declare an
object or create an instance of that
particular constructor function by
providing whatever the values I would
like to provide here so in this case I
would like to say Jack and then four
thousand five hundred and something like
that now I can say om p dot increment
salary which should be something like
five hundred so let us do what does so
in this case if I say alert om p dot
celery so at this moment it has to give
me four thousand five hundred but after
increasing the salary again if I use
this same statement here that is
supposed to be returning five thousand
so here in this case it is 4500
incrementing by five hundred returns
five thousand so let us see if this is
working fine for a second and make sure
that we are not using method chaining
yet so I do this
and now you can see the first one which
is 4,500 click OK and now you can see I
got 5,000 so it is doing the way it has
to do now let us consider I wanted to do
something like this so I can still do
this so which means I'm having this
entire part to be stored inside a
particular object if necessary so for
example if I can say wearable or equal
to something like this that is still
possible so what I'm saying is this is a
function which is returning an instance
of the current object which is nothing
but we MP so what I'm saying is whenever
I execute this function return the same
instance we MP and assign that to all
now I can say o dot increment celery 500
more so what I'm saying is 1/2 of 4500
here increment by 500 return the same
object
and using the same object increase 500
more
so essentially you are adding thousand
to eight system four thousand five
hundred and it should return five
thousand five hundred right now so let
us check if that is the case so I have
the first one as four thousand five
hundred and immediately I have five
thousand five hundred so all I am doing
right now is instead of using oh I just
wanted to replace this Oh with this guy
directly so in that way I can use a
syntactic interference call the method
chaining so which means you are using a
method in order to access another method
and further proceed with more and more
methods if necessary for that matter I
can even say dot celery here so which
means I would like to get the value of
the celery
after increasing after incrementing
twice of price in this case so in this
case I had twice only so even now it has
to give the value it is supposed to so
go in here
the first values 4,500 and the next
values 5500 and similarly if you'd like
to do further I can use the same thing
in any number of ways and increase for
any number of times so as long as that
particular method is returning some
instance you will be able to have access
to any of those members to whatever the
object it is returned so in this case I
am incrementing by 1500 for 4,500 so
it's supposed to become 6000 so let me
execute it again
so 4,500 becomes 6000 so in that way you
can have multiple methods not
necessarily be the same method you can
have multiple other methods there all of
those methods as long as they return the
same instance they can be chained
together to any infinite level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
