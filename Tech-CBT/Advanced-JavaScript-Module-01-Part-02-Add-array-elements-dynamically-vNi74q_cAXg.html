demonstrate on how to add elements to an
existing array in a dynamic fashion so
which means I will be adding a textbox
to my webpage and based on the values I
provided inside the textbox I would like
to have those elements to be added one
by one to the list whenever I click on
the button add so for each and every
value I provide inside the textbox I
click the button add and once I click on
that ad it has to add that particular
number whatever I provided in the text
box or might be also string so those
values needed to be added to the array
and finally list that particular array
of values inside it day one so let me
create a new file so I'm going to call
this one a zero two for now so I will be
starting with script tag so the first
thing is that I would like to have an
array and I'm going to call that one as
a list for now so you can also put error
here of instead of Lists so this is just
available you can put whatever you would
like to have so list is the array and
now I would like to have a function
called add items of existing list so
this is the function which I would like
to execute whenever I click on a pattern
so let me design the UI first so I would
like to have a table first and inside
the table I would like to have a TR that
is a table row and I would like to have
a definition table definition and the
first one will have and
any value so that is going to be
valuable in the first column and the
second column I would like to have a
textbox with input ID equal to 3 x2
value and so the type of this particular
input tag is going to be a textbox so I
define the textbox and the name of the
textbox is going to be t XD value for
now and then I'm going to have another
table row and this is just a blank
column so that you know I will not have
anything here and out of underneath the
first column so in the second column I
would like to mention a buttom and I
would like to identify that button as BT
and AD and type equal to button and
value which is going to be the caption
so I would like to have something like
add to list and on clicking this button
I would like to execute add item to
existing list function so this is
essentially nothing but whatever the one
we added here so I'm clicking on this
button I would like to have this
function to be executed which is nothing
but this function okay so I have the
table which is going to list move the
text box and the button which is fine so
whenever I would like to display the
results I would like to have first of
all items count to be displayed so I
would like to have items called as a do
tag so which means I would like to have
some kind of value to be displayed here
dynamically whenever I click on add so
which means it needs to count the number
of elements available in the array and
finally place it inside the do
and on top of that I would like to have
another do and I would like to call this
one as items list so this is the deal
which is supposed to list our each and
every element available in the list so
the more elements I add the more
elements we are going to see inside this
particular do so let us concentrate on
add item to existing list so in here I
would like to say we are number of items
equal to list dot length so this is the
one okay so list dot al is small case
here as because you can say list dot
length so length is the property which
gives us the number of elements
available in that particular list so in
that way I'm having the number of items
and whenever I would like to add you
know I can just get the same number of
items which is nothing but the last
position so the position starts from 0
so a number of items if there are 4 if
the position starts from 0 the last
position is 3 so in order to add a new
element I have to have 3 plus 1 which is
nothing but the new location so the new
position is always going to be list dot
length as because if I have 4 elements
the last position is 3 and now I am
adding to the position for which is
nothing but the new element so inside
this one I would like to have something
like document dot get element by ID and
txt value so this is the one I would
like to fetch from so this is nothing
but this one so I am getting hold of
this one which is nothing but the test
bars getting the value out of it and
then placing inside the list and after
that I would like to have
the array to be displayed house I would
like to call this nice display results
so this is the function I would like to
have and I'm going to write the display
results function in this case so in this
function first of all I would like to
get the number of elements available
using list dot length so which gives me
the number of elements so I have a tag
called items count I would like to place
the number of elements in this div so
for that purpose I need to get hold of
that element so I'm going to say
document dot doc you're maint dot get
element by ID and then I'm going to use
the same day whatever I have in here
place it here so that way I get hold of
items can't do and in order to write
inside the day I can use the property
inner HTML and then I can say a number
of items added click at the end or two
string so now that we have the number of
items already displayed inside the items
count do we need to have all the items
to be displayed in the items list so in
order to do that first of all I need to
get hold of this guy so I just copy this
for now and I'm going to say something
like variable items do equal to document
dot get element by ID and then I can say
items list so that way I get hold of
that deal next I need to remove each and
every element available in that list why
because the more elements I add for each
and every element I click on this one I
need to have the refreshing of display
elements so whenever I am going to
refresh the display elements I need to
get rid of all those elements which are
already available here so all the nodes
are going to be removed from here
and I am going to add a fresh list of
all the new items so in that way I'm
going to create new items every time
whenever I click on add of course there
are more efficient ways to do this but
for now I just wanted to demonstrate but
on how to remove all the existing nodes
and then recreate all the nodes
dynamically so for that purpose I'm
going to have a while loop and I can say
items list do dot if it has got any
child nodes I am going to remove them so
the easiest way to remove there is
remove child and I can say items list
div dot last child so you can use first
child or last and it doesn't matter here
but as long as it removes at least one
of those children we are good enough so
it removes each and every child here and
again goes back and if it finds more
child nodes it's going to remove further
saying that way
at the moment I complete this while loop
we are going to have all of the child
nodes which are in between these two
tags are going to be removed completely
and once everything is done now I would
like to add all the elements from the
beginning it is starting from zero the
position in the array so I equal to zero
I understand and I plus plus so which
means I would like to start from zero to
position in the array and less then n
which is nothing but number of elements
so first of all I need to create a new
deal to be added inside this do so for
that purpose I'm creating a new do and I
am going to call document dot create
element
a new element to do and under that I
would like to have New Deal related
information to be placed so as I
mentioned innerhtml is the property
where we can place any information so in
this case I would like to have first of
all what item we are going to display so
in this case I would like to display I
plus one so that we will be knowing the
logical representation of the current
position so I could also say I which
essentially goes to 0 so in this case I
plus 1 just because you know it makes
more sense for our readability okay so
on top of that I would like to say of
inductive string so which means I am
saying item 1 of 4 item 2 of 4 so this
is the land and I plus 1 makes more
sense as because I'm working with n here
which is nothing but number of elements
so on top of that I would like to have
the element itself will be displayed by
saying list of I so this is where I'm
really getting the element inside the
array so once I get it
and all of this information will be
placed together as a simple caption or
simple information inside this interval
now HTML of that video so once I have
the new do completed I need to add that
new view to my items list so the
reference of this items list is
available here and I am going to use the
same reference items listed ooh good
appendchild
so app and child is the method which I
can use in order to have a new child
node to be added to that particular do
so
so you do let us ensure that you have
the correct one okay and there we are
so let us execute this and test it so I
go in here click on this and I have
entered any value here so let me add
something like jag and click Add and now
you can see item 1 of 1
I don't have the element to be displayed
here I might be missing something let us
quickly check so I have a semicolon
which is a bug I need to remove that so
let me refresh it again so let me say
jag and click Add and now you can see I
have item 1 of 1 items are available as
Jag so I can say chat and I can say
added now item 1 of 2 so out of 2 items
the first one item is jag the second
item is chat and they can add any kind
of string to that and all of those are
going to be displayed dynamically so I
am adding to the list and at the same
time that count and everything is going
to be updated accordingly and how all
the items to be displayed dynamically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
