to access associative arrays using
object dot member notation in this video
we are going to see on more with respect
to how to create and initialize the
various JavaScript objects so let us
start from new object so first of all
object is already a reserved word it is
a built-in function you can call it as
so using this particular new object you
can actually create a new instance or
say new object so this is a particular
object which you can essentially use to
add more members to that and assigned to
the values to those members
simultaneously so the moment you say new
object
it creates or allocate some memory and
decides that memory 200 MP 1 so this is
the object name and using the same
object you can create members by just
assigning values to the respective
members so in this case I'm actually
adding a new property called employee
number by assigning a value 1 0 0 1 so
once this statement is executed a new
property called employee number gets
added to that object and at the same
time that particular value will be
placed into that particular property so
from now on whenever I access for EMP
dot employee member I am going to get
this particular value out of it
similarly you can add as many number of
properties as possible and you can
assign it as different types of values
as possible so this is thing like
members can be added later so which
means while creating the object you will
not specify the structure of the object
however you are going to add all the
members later all the properties all the
methods later after instantiating the
object so this is one way of doing the
things the second way is using the
braces
so whenever you see a breath something
of this sort you can say nothing but you
are initializing or creating a new
object and that particular object is the
same as what you are going to create
here and you can also call that
particular object an object literal so
it is a kind of a little object and
again you can have all the members to be
added later so you can use either this
particular syntax or this syntax in
order to create an object and add all
the respective members bit later the
other way is instantiating and assigning
all the values at the same time along
with creation of properties so which
means in this case this whole part is
one single statement in one single
statement you are essentially creating a
new object along with all the properties
and the values in the form of key value
pairs so you are doing both the jobs of
instantiation and initialization of the
object at the same time in one
particular statement so in one statement
you are creating an instance you are
creating the properties for that
instance you are assigning the values
for those properties which will be
residing inside inside the same instance
so you can use either of these three
methods while you are working with
JavaScript objects so let me have a
quick demonstration on achieving the
same so let me create a new file here so
I call this one as 0 2 4 now and let us
start with some script and in this case
the first thing is that I would like to
create an object called EMP one using
new objects into X so you just declared
an object called
EMP 1 and it has got no members or no
properties at the moment and you would
like to add more now so I can say we MP
dot
employee number equal to 1 0 0 1 so this
could be a string or it could be just a
number or boolean value or any kind of
data type so similarly I can say Y MP 1
dot a name equal to any string and
similarly Y EMP wondered salary equal to
5 400 and similarly another one called
EMP one the department number equal to
10 so in that way I added four new
properties to the same instance and
along with those properties I also
assigned the values into the same
properties so in order to get the values
out of those the simplest way is just
accessing each of those members using
the same object dot member notation so
in this case I can say I would like to
display MP number concatenated with the
comma and then I would like to have EMP
1 dot employee name to display the
concatenate it with the comma and next I
would like to have MP dot salary plus
again another concatenation with the
comma and OMP 1 dot Department member so
I can have all of these at the same time
and say that I would like to have an
alert which essentially goes through
each of those particular properties
fetches the values and separates them
using the comma so let us say this is
going to work for us
so now you can see I got all the values
displayed in the same alert so as I
mentioned we have other ways to do this
so I just wanted to copy the whole thing
and paste in here so let me comment this
whole thing so that we are concentrating
only on this part so instead of using
new object notation as I mentioned
earlier you can just use two curly
braces a pair of curly braces so
whenever you use something like this you
call this one as object literal so it
could be called as an object literal and
again all of this is going to work no
matter what so let me save this and
execute this still you can see I
received the same output no matter what
so the initialization sorry the
instantiation could be done using a that
new object or using object literal
syntax by just providing a pair of para
curly braces and then let me copy it
again and do another one similar to this
so in this case I would like to remove
everything and start with an object
literal however I would like to have all
of the properties to be mentioned along
with the values using key value notation
so in this case I can say employ number
is going to be 1 0 0 1 similarly
employee name is going to be Jack in
strings and celery which could be 5400
and a departmental member is just going
to be something like 10 so there are a
couple of things to note here first of
all I don't need to have a MP 1 to be
always added in front of those
properties because it is still being
added within the same object instance so
you don't need to prefix OMP 1 as we did
earlier here and on top of that the next
thing is that each of those key value
pastes whatever you are going to define
has to be ending with the comma if you
have any successful properties or
subsequent properties and you can see
the last property doesn't have a comma
as because we are not adding any more
properties so the more properties you
have the previous property for every
successful property should end with the
comma and the last one will not have a
comma and now this should still work no
matter what so let me say this again and
execute this so there we go
and as I mentioned each and every
particular object inside behind the
scenes it works as if it is in the form
of an associative array so instead of
going this way we can also go in another
way in order to fetch the elements
something like I can just say alert o
mp3 or ymp one and instead of writing
employee number I can also say I would
like to get the value available at this
location and that is going to have the
location in the form of strings this is
nothing but the associated array I
covered earlier in my previous videos so
each and every object internally even
though those are called as properties
they can be accessed using string based
index and the object can be treated as
an array and this should still work with
no problems
so let me get the others too
so let me copy this and make my life bit
easier so I am going to have the next
one as employee name and next one salary
and next one department member so as
this is going to be the last I don't
need any of this stuff so let me see if
this is going to work
and there we go this one still works so
as I mentioned either you declare and
initialize an associative array or if
you declare any kind of object using
literal notation or a new object or any
of that sort you still have the
flexibility to access each of those
properties using object not member
notation or associative array with the
string based index and that string is
nothing but the property you're going to
use so this is just another way of doing
the things and imagine I would like to
actually go through each of the
properties no matter what how many
number of properties I have so imagine I
have hundred properties and I would like
to pass through each of those properties
available inside the object so we have
another way of accomplishing the same
and as I mentioned this is a nothing but
an area behind the scenes that we
associate to array I can start with a
for loop so in this case I would like to
have the entire result to be placed
inside a variable called result
initializer with just an empty string so
now I can say for each property inside
OMP one so I can start something like
this so P is just your own variable it
could be I or M or whatever so this will
essentially have each of those property
names but not the values so you are
fetching only the names of those
properties which are available inside
this particular object it so for every
iteration you are going to have a
property name to be stored inside the
variable P and now you can easily fetch
the value by just specifying OMP one of
P so as P is nothing but the name of
that particular property you are
literally using this syntax to get the
value out of it and in this case I would
like to get the value and I would also
say
which property is this particular values
belonging to so in this case I would
like to say result equal to P plus dot
something like this there's not Pete I
start so I can just say equals so after
that I would also like to have next line
so that you know it it might give a
better idea on where it is and how it is
really displaying it and now I just
alert result so let us see how this is
working so let me click this and now you
can see I got all the property names
concatenated with equal to and all the
respect to property values so how did I
achieve that this is nothing with the
property name concatenated with equal to
getting the value outside that
particular associative array is by
providing the name of that particular
string based index as I mentioned here
so using the same property name I am
getting the value inside that object
concatenated again with the previous
equal to and finally slash in at the end
so that it goes to the next line so this
is just another way in order to have all
of those particular values to be fetched
in one instance and there are more waves
for example let me commit this guy and
there is one more way we can accomplish
for example let us consider I am using
object of kaizo EMP one let us see what
this one does so I just throw this and
execute this and now you can see this is
nothing but an array of all the property
names I have all the property names
fetched automatically the moment I use
object or keys so object is a built-in
object in JavaScript and it has got a
property called keys where it extracts
all the properties are keys available in
a particular object
and returns an array so this case is a
function which goes through all the
properties available in the object and
returns an array of all those property
names so this gives us all the property
names available in an object in the form
of an array if I have an array then it
is quite easier for me to use a for loop
and get all the values out of it so let
us go with another for loop where I will
be starting with 0 I left an object dot
keys and then I can say Oh empty one dot
length so which means I am going through
all the elements available inside that
particular array and now I can just get
this so just to make our life easier let
me declare something like the edible
array equal to this whole thing so that
you know we can reuse the same array
over and over again so as I mentioned
this returns an array of employee sorry
array of all the property names
available inside this object so area so
I can use the same error right here so
that way my code will be looking much
simpler and we can reuse the same
instance over and over again now let us
use whatever I did earlier so I am going
to use the same thing here and now I can
say I have array of I so which means
nothing but I am just getting the value
of that particular property name so let
us not worry about this whole stuff for
now so let me see if this is working
first and of course I need to declare a
variable result here with an empty
string and let me alert it
so let me execute this and now you can
see I got all the property names
automatically but just by using a for
loop and going through the same property
array whatever I have but the goal is to
get the values out of those so as I
mentioned you can still use this whole
thing in the same fashion as I'm using
this gives the property names just
imagine this gives the property name I
did not get the value out of it I am
going to use the same property name in
right in here so let me quickly quickly
execute this and now you can see I got
all the property names and the values so
you can literally use the same property
name whatever I have in here to be
always searched using the same thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
