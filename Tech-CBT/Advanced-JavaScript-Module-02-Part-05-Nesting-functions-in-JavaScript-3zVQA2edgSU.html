more advanced ways of developing the
functions themselves so in my previous
video we have already covered the basics
of functions and the function
expressions literal notation self
invoking functions are immediately
invertible functions and in this video
we are going to look into a couple more
advanced ways on developing the
functions themselves and the first thing
is that we can have the functions to be
nested so which means I can have a
particular function called the do
process and I can call this particular
function by just using to process right
here so this is the statement which
calls this function and this function
internally has a couple more functions
and the names of those functions are do
Locker process 1 and Duloc a process
tour respectively and in order to have
those two functions to be executed I am
actually using two more statements which
are going to be the statements inside
the do process so which means if I call
this statement it is going through this
and after executing other statements it
will be skipping all the functions but
once I execute this statement it is
going here and then execute that and
returns back and then after that it
might execute this one which essentially
goes back here and executes this one so
in that way I can have the functions
which can internally have other
functions and those are nothing but the
nested functions and the scope of the
nested functions are local to their
parent so which means these functions
are not accessible outside due process
so these functions are declared inside
this new process and these can be
executed only within the due process
scope so
means these are local to due process and
I can execute these to only within the
to process but not outside the due
process as I as I mentioned if I try to
execute this particular statement
outside the due process cope which is
this that is not going to work out and
it might throw an error so if you have
nested functions the scope of those
nested functions will be within their
parent and they need to be executed as
part of their parent and the next thing
is that the functions cannot return
other functions so imagine I have a
particular function called due process
this is the to process and I am trying
to execute that particular to process so
whenever I am trying to call do passers
you can see essentially the control
might go in here
and of course I have parameters here
they can provide the parameters if
necessary after that it is going to
execute whatever the statements which
are available there it will be skipping
this function execute this skipping the
function executes all the rest of the
statements but end of this particular
function I am having a return which
essentially returns do local process one
so if you see what exactly is do local
process one it is nothing but this
particular function and again you can
say I am NOT executing this function
there are no parenthesis so if I am NOT
executing the function by using the
parenthesis this actually returns the
definition of this function so whenever
you specify just the function name
without any parenthesis you are
essentially talking about the entire
definition so whenever I return the
definition of this to local process
essentially that entire definition will
be stored inside a variable called F so
in this case F is nothing but a
particular variable which will have the
definition of do local process one so
Smith is impaired definition of this
function is going to be valuable in F
and now F itself can be considered as a
function expression which actually
points to this and finally whenever I
say F with the parentheses I am asking f
to be executing the definition available
inside that particular variable F so the
definition is nothing but do Locker
process and the moment i say parenthesis
it actually goes in here and executes
set so in that way I can have a parent
function which can return a child
function to an external variable and
still I can take that particular action
available external variable and execute
it as if this particular function is
outside the to process so even though
you have those particular functions
locally available inside the parent can
be returned back and executed outside so
that is what is called as functions can
return functions too and the next one's
inner functions can be assigned to outer
so which means here you can see first of
all I am calling to process so this will
essentially go in here and I have a due
process which is nothing but a function
it goes tries to execute whatever is
available here it skips this function
goes here executes any of the statements
there and then and trying to fetch do
lot or process one that is the
definition of this function as I don't
have the parameters so it is going to
fetch the definition of this function
and a science to this variable and you
can see this variable essentially is
nothing but the name of the parent
function so which means now this
particular parent function actually
loses its definition but it will have
the new definition of do local process
one so you are replacing this entire
definition but you are assigning this
particular definition to do process now
for the second time if I try to execute
it is actually going to execute this one
as because you are you have already
assigned the definition of this one to
this one in the first statement itself
so from then onwards any successful a
calls to the same function execution
will be actually executing this
particular do Locker process one and and
the thing is that I can have an array
which can have various elements and
those elements can themselves the
functions so which means you can say I
can have an array and in this case it is
an empty area but the first element in
the array is a function second element
is a function third element is a
function so in that way I can have other
elements to be the function store and I
can also have various events to be
attached to functions and those are
nothing but you will be calling them as
event handlers so in this case you can
see I'm having a button that particular
button is actually is nothing but a
reference to some element inside the
document and once I get hold of that
particular button element I am saying
that on click please execute this
function this is an anonymous function
but you are attaching this function as
an event handler for that particular
button so which means this function
handles the event on click of that
whittler button so you can also make use
of functions in such a way as I
mentioned those particular functions
which are essentially assigned to those
events are nothing but event handlers so
I am going to demonstrate on nested
functions as part of this video right
now
so let me create a new HTML file so in
this case I would like to call as
something like zero five four now
let us start with some script and in
this case I'm actually starting with a
function called do classes and inside
this new process all I am going to do is
something like sum equals so let me take
a couple of arguments here a comma B and
then I would like to say a plus B dot or
string so all I am doing is this
particular function ok so let me call
this one as display some for now so this
is the function which takes two
arguments a and B and finally gives me
the sum of those two and now let us have
another function which I call it as
parent function so in this case I can
have due process in a comma B and inside
this particular parent function I would
like to have a nested function which is
nothing but a chain function similarly I
would like to have one more nested
function and in this case I would like
to call this honest difference and now
yes a and B are made available here I
don't need them any more here as because
the inner function can access the
variables available in the parent so I
am trying to access those particular
outer or parent variables inside the
local or Nestor functions so similarly I
don't need this either and just I would
like to say is difference so for the
difference I would like to mention a
minus B for now so that essentially
creates a parent function to process
which will have two nested functions
inside those and the parent function is
going to have these two values which can
be reused in any of the local functions
it has
and now in order to execute this display
some all I would need is just call that
right inside the parent and in order to
have this executor this right in here
sign that way I am trying to execute
both of the functions but in order to
execute this particular function
directly I would like to have a button
to be made available and I would like to
say input type equal to bottom and I
would like to say sure and unclick I
would like to execute the process with
the values 10 and 20 send that way the
moment I click on this show button it is
going to execute due process which is
this guy by sending the values 10 and 20
to a and B and those two values are
going to be preserved in the parent but
whenever I call display some the nested
function is going to kick in and it is
going to use those stored variable
inside the parent to be used inside the
child
so I'm planning to execute that
and now I have the button so the moment
I click on the button I have some and I
also have the difference as - time so
let us consider I'm not using the button
at the moment so let me convert this and
imagine I am directly calling to
processor right here which is perfectly
valid as because I'm saying that please
execute this function immediately during
the page load itself so I can execute
that and I am going to see the sum and
the difference but let us try to do
something else
so imagine I don't want to use two
passes but I would like to call this
place some directly outside so let us
see what it is going to do and it is
essentially ran into an error which
could not be seen here but if you press
f12 you are going to see a particular
error right here and you can see display
some is not defined so that is the error
