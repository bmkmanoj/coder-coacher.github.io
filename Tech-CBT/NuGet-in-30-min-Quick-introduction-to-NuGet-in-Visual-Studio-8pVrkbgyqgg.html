you get which is a simple but smart
component available as part of Visual
Studio so let us start on the scratch
what exactly is nougat nougat is nothing
but a package manager so whenever I call
something is a package it is essentially
nothing but a file a package is nothing
but a file but what exactly is that file
on that file essentially you can compare
against a zip file so each and every
package is released in the form of a zip
file that particular zip file or that
particular package file internally can
contain multiple dll's or multiple other
files or scripts or images along with
configuration information and so on so
most of the fellow developers who are
working on the open source stuff or
other organizations who wanted to sell
the stuff they release all of those
particular software components to be
used in our particular projects in the
form of packages so we search for the
packages and once we find our own
package is related to our particular
project we essentially downloaded into
our project install it and then make use
of those particular components as part
of our project nougat is free and at the
same time it is open source so you can
essentially get you get onto your
machine just by downloading it and on
top of it you can also contribute as
because it is open source not only that
even the down nougat documentation
itself is being maintained with the
community even the website tool so there
is an entire source code available which
is which can be actually retrieved from
github where the entire website of MU
gate itself is open sourced so we can
download the nougat website itself
complete hub
and you can fork it and you can make use
of it or you can actually collaborate
with other developers and enhance new
get to the next new level
so not just new yet you can create your
own particular package and you can
publish it and make those particular
packages available to other developers
so which means if you are actual if you
develop a very good component and if you
would like to distribute to other
developers you can make use of new get
and as new kit is directly integrated
inside Visual Studio each and every
particular developer who is searching
for the respect to package can easily
find your package if if it relates to
him and finally those particular guys
can simply download into date projects
and make use of them and at the same
time each and every package is
associated with the respect to washroom
so they can download whatever the
versions they need or they can upgrade
as long as new versions are getting
released progressively and all of those
packages are available through certain
sources so which means there exist
several sources just like our github as
a what is a source control source
similarly Visual Studio and the source
control so in that way we we even have
all of the new get packages to be
available from several sources and those
are released in the form of feeds so in
general we can simply call it as
packages are available through feeds and
by default we already have a couple of
fields configured as part of Visual
Studio but we have not limited to those
we can have our own foods to be added
when necessary and as I already
mentioned a new gate is directly
integrated in side Visual Studio and if
it is not available as part of we just
studio you can always get it by
installing your own you get extension as
long as you are using Visual Studio 2012
or above
you can say that new gate is already
installed by default so you can make use
of that particular extension as long as
you have Visual Studio 2012 or airball
on your machine and more and more
particular convenient options are going
to be made available as part of new gate
extension eventually and using this
convenience you can actually add or
update or remove packages from within
Visual Studio project solution so let us
have some demonstration so as part of
this demonstration I am going to
actually explain two methods of
installing or updating or uninstalling
packages the first one using dialog so
which is essentially the GUI dialog
where everything can be just done using
clicks the next one use command line
which means essentially we had to
remember a couple of commands in order
to install or you know work with
packages so there are more convenient
options available in command line versus
the GUI especially if you are in need of
installing very specific versions or
don't creating two previous versions or
whatever the versions you would like to
specify so you have more control
whenever you go through the command line
but most of the work can also be done
through the graphical user interface
based dialog
so let us start from here so I would
like to create a new project and in this
case I would look I would like to go to
web and so see sample is my location and
I just wanted to create a web
application and in this case I would
like to select empty and I would like to
have a unit test project also to be
added to my solution and just click OK
so right now you can see this particular
project is a web based project and if
you see the references you can see I
have the default system dot web
references which is fine and at the same
time I have the unit test project which
will be actually used to unit test this
particular web solution and so it is
just another project and let us consider
I would like to have another project to
be either something like Visual Studio
human visual C sharp and in that I would
like to go for class library and just I
would like to say something like sample
dot library so you can just for whatever
the name you want it so I have three
projects inside one solution so let me
save everything and imagine I would like
to have certain packages to be installed
into this particular project the easiest
way first of all ensure that you have
you get in your visual studio so if you
have new gate you should be able to see
new kit package manager right here so
tools NuGet package manager and you have
the options like manage new gate
packages for the solution and you have
through the console where I was talking
about the command-line options and we
have couple of settings where we can
make use of much more customization but
anyway so the easiest way is just right
click there and you should be able to
see manage NuGet packages and when you
are doing this you are working on this
particular project only
let us consider I'm switching to
solution and right-click there and then
you can see you have the option manage
new get packages for the whole solution
so you have both options so let me
consider I would like to go to a
particular project here and then I
right-click down there and then I go and
add sorry let me go to manage and you
get packages for this project alone I
click on this and now you can see these
are all the sources or the fields I have
so all means please get from all the
fields which have been configured
currently so I have two fields right now
two feeds so I can have more and more
fields based on the configuration or the
settings as part of your results to do
so right now if I select all which means
all of those particular packages which
are listed here are going to be brought
from all the fields available here so in
this case I can search for any of the
packages like for example if I say
jQuery and now you are actually
searching for all the packages available
from these particular fields which are
filtered again is the word jQuery so in
that way you can have any other quote is
a package name to be specified here and
you can search for that so in this case
you can see jQuery is already available
so I can just select that and click on
install if we need that particular
jQuery to be installed into the current
project and you can always see the
current version right in here and when
it has been published and so on so you
can go to the next page and see what all
the other jQuery related stuff is made
available similarly if you would like to
search for something else example unity
so imagine I would like to have a
microsoft application block so which is
unity to be searched
so I search for it and it is made
available in this fashion and latest
version is 3.5 and I can get it
installed so in that way you can search
for the respective packages and all of
those packages will be listed here and
conveniently when you select any kind of
package you have the button install to
install it to your particular project so
in this case let us consider I would
like to install unity so so I just click
on install and I click accept and I
click close
so before clicking close you can see
that the moment you see this it has been
installed in the current project I click
OK and let us open this and you are
going to see all these particular new
references have been automatically added
so that is important to understand like
we might have multiple other components
or multiple other dll's which have been
referred by it based on the package you
might have selected and on top of that
it has also created a configuration file
exclusively to show you on what are all
those particular packages which have
been installed for your project and the
package manager really goes through this
particular file and all of these what is
a xml elements it has gone through it
will be going through all of these
external elements and then it tries to
find out what versions are available and
if there are any upgrades available on
top of what we have if there are it is
going to give us the new list of updates
based on the options we might select or
search for so on
let us open either another another
project so you can see I do not have
packages configure and I don't have
packages configured you installed those
particular packages or in this case only
one pack is only two this particular
project so let us save the solution and
let us quickly open the folder of this
solution you can also see that it has
actually created a folder named packages
inside this solut I mean just in
parallel to other project folders so
this is the solution file I have so
within the same folder of the solution
folder you have the packages folder
automatically created by the new get
package manager and it is going to list
out all those packages we have created
here we have installed so not only just
listing it essentially contains those
dll's or the scripts or the files which
are downloaded for that particular
package so in this case you can see
unity 3.5 something is exactly the
folder made available here and I can
open it and now you can see it has got
other files at the moment I open this
folder you are going to see all these
particular DLL which have been actually
referred right here so these are all the
DLL which are actually referred from
here so not only that you also have
another file called new package so this
is the package file I was talking about
from the beginning so this is the
package file which contains essentially
all of this together bundled into single
file called this new package file so you
not only have that bundle expanded in
this way but you also have that entire
bundle in single file called a new
package so this is the package file you
downloaded and that bundle has been
expanded in such a way that it is
created into the respective folders and
once it has expanded all the files all
those particular files have been made
available for references so which means
it automatically referred all those
respective files necessary in order to
get in touch with project and sometimes
there will be situations even the
web.config will also be modified based
on the packages you might be
acting so in general you have most of
the things happening the moment you
install a package it might modify web
configure it could add a couple of
reference files it might add a couple of
entries to packages dot config if it is
already available if not it creates the
file itself it will be creating a new
folder is not available as part of the
solution in order to maintain all the
packages so if new package is created if
the packages folder is already existing
then the new folder or new packages are
going to be added here so let us
consider I would like to add another
reference sorry
another package also I go to manage new
cat again and there let us consider I
would like to install entity framework
and click install so X of the license
and now you can see packages that config
is actually getting modified and now you
can see I had two packages which have
been installed for this particular
project and if you open the references
now you are going to see entity
framework related references and let us
open this particular packages folder and
you can see inside this I have both
entity framework and unity and let us
open web config and now you can see even
the web config is modified with respect
to the entity framework related entries
so we have lots of things happening
behind the scenes the moment you install
any kind of package now let us go to the
solution right-click the solution and
say manage new get packages for solution
and it says entity framework is made
available but in fact it is not
currently available for all the projects
for example let us consider I would like
to have something like n log so I would
like to install n log yes I am actually
starting from the solution let us see
what it is going to say I click install
and now it is actually asking me where
to install that particular package
whether all the respective projects or
particular projects so in that in this
situation I would like to select all of
the projects and click OK and now click
close and now you can see packages
config is created inside sample door
library with just this and there is one
more packages that config which is just
this and let us open this one which is
essentially having three as because I
already added a couple earlier and now I
have the new one which has been added
here so if you open back your particular
packages folder you are going to see the
new one called n log so in that way you
can actually
eight or install those particular
packages from the solution level so that
all of those packets I mean the same
package gets installed in multiple
projects in the same fashion okay so let
me close on so now I would like to
remove certain particular a certain
package so I just right click here and
say manage new get packages exclusively
for that project only and in this case I
have n log installed so let me search
for n log and you can see it says n log
has been already installed so how to
uninstall that so you can always
uninstall something by going through
install the packages and you will see
all the list of installed packages as
part of your particular application or
say project so you can click close and
let me right click here and go to manage
nuclear packages and now if you see
install packages you are going to see I
have three installed packages for that
particular project and at any moment you
can uninstall certain packages whatever
you don't want by just pressing the
respective button so let me uninstall
from this particular test project so I
go to this and go in here I search for
the install packages and go for n log
and click on uninstall and I click OK
and you can see packages that config has
been automatically removed and I should
not see any n log related references as
they are made available as part of the
other project so for example I have n
log here but I don't have it here
similarly I can install from here as
well so I go here and go to manage nukid
packages I go to install packages and
say n install and click close similarly
I right-click here manage NuGet packages
all and in this case I would like I have
install on and log only and
and if you open the packages you can see
an log is automatically removed and now
I go back here and you should see n log
fold that is completely removed as
because none of the projects are
referring to n log anymore so we can
also remove others so I go in here I go
to manage nougat packages let us
uninstall entity framework
let us uninstall unity and so it says
one or more packages could not be
completely uninstall the visual studio
needs to be refreshed so restarted so
let us restart and click S and see what
is going on
so first of all you can see packages
that config is removed so you open web
config there are still a couple of
references which have been left inside
the web config so those need to be
cleared manually so none of the settings
which have been added by the package
manager have been removed automatically
so it is going to be our job essentially
to remove them manually if NuGet doesn't
do it so we'll have to be careful and
we'll have to be watching the respective
configurations inside web config and let
us go to the references it looks like
all the references have been completely
removed and let us go in here
and you can see even from the packages
everything has been removed so that is
how you can actually uninstall and
install the respect to packages again
from the dialog so that is using the
manage NuGet packages dialog so this is
the UI dialog so now let us start doing
the same or achieve the same using you
get command line option so I go to add
in manage and sorry you get package
manager and inside that I have package
manager console so let me clear
everything whatever I have in the
console host and there are two things
will have to always consider while
working in the console the first thing
is the source so which means the feed
from where I can search for and install
all the necessary packages so right now
you can see it has been switching to
Microsoft and darknet but in fact if I
would like to install from every other
source in this case from any of these
two I need to select all and whenever
you are installing any kind of package
by default it goes to this particular
project as that is the one which has
been selected by default
you can always switch that to any other
project based upon the necessary
so let us check on what are all the
packages which have been currently
installed in our solution so the easiest
way you can say get package so get
package is the command which essentially
lists out all the packages which have
been installed throughout the solution
and currently it says new packages
installed and obviously no packages are
made available or installed so let me
clear and let me list out all those
particular packages related to say L ma
so I would like to say get package list
available so if I do this it is going to
really give you tons and tons of what is
a packages list for which I don't really
need to I would like to provide a filter
so which is optional but in this case I
would like to cover the filter like l ma
so i am trying to search for a package
named el ma so it is going to throw all
the fields as because i specified all it
is going through all those particular
fields and searches for this elmo and
where our elma is found it is trying to
lists list out all those particular
packages along with their respective
auctions now the moment i say install
package l might is going to install this
particular one point to point to version
so let us do that so again the default
project is sample library so the moment
i say install package alma and click
enter
and now it has actually opened a readme
text file which if you want you can go
through that and right now you can see
Elma version 1.2 has been added to
sample that library so if you go to the
sample data library you can see packages
that config has been added and it has
actually added two packages s because
Elma package is actually depending on
another package called alma core library
so NuGet package is smart enough to
actually bring down the dependency is
related to whatever the package you are
asking for so if your package is
depending on other packages it is smart
enough to include those other packages
which are all dependents to be also
included as part of the same
installation and once it has done that
you can see that references Elma has
been already added and if you open the
folder inside the packages you should be
seeing both of those particular packages
listed right there so that is how I can
install a particular package but imagine
I would like to have that particular
package to be uninstalled from the
command line so the easiest way I can do
that is uninstall package and the
package name is Elmer there is one
important point I would like to mention
here so again whenever you say uninstall
package it is going to inner uninstall
Elmer package or it's a typo here
Elmer package but again from this
particular posit whatever you have
chosen so the moment I say remove that
you can see it says it has been
successfully removed so let me press yes
and you can see it has removed Alma but
it did not remove the other dependencies
so in order to remove the other one also
so it
say LM r dot core library and you can
see when that one is removed and you can
see packages that config is also removed
and no more references to Elma and if
you switch back you can see there is no
packages folder at all even that has
been removed so in that way I can
uninstall the package which has been
already installed earlier okay now let
us consider I would like to install
jQuery and that tour into the project
web application so we already knew the
command like install package and now I
can say I would like to install jQuery
and whenever I would like to do that
I had to switch to this particular patch
at lab application if you don't want to
do that there is another option called
project so you can specifically say that
this particular pack is jQuery needs to
be installed in this project
so the precedence are the priority is
going to be based on whatever the option
you might be specifying here and it
overrides whatever the option is which
is available here so in this case it
will be actually installing jQuery to
this particular project web application
then now you can see within this
particular project I have packaged this
config and it has not created anything
else here and as part of this one now
you can see it has installed the latest
version of jQuery here and if you switch
back to this folder you can see jQuery
with all the packages and the necessary
information or the other files which may
be necessary for that particular package
so similarly let me uninstall jQuery
package from the project application one
web application
and now you can see it has removed all
of those particular jQuery related
references from here and let us quickly
check and there are no packages folder
anymore here okay so we have seen
install package and an install package
but there is one particular convenience
as part of the command line or the
console whenever you would like to have
a particular version to be installed so
for example if I say install package
jQuery so let me go to the default as
web application for now so whenever you
do this it goes to the jQuery source and
always gets the latest no matter what
but imagine I would like to install
version 1.5 I don't need 2.1 so for that
purpose you have the option version so
you can provide a version and I can say
1.5 this facility is not directly
available from the GUI or you have to
search for 1.5 ocean which may or may
not be listed sometimes but instead of
searching through and through and
through
it is quite easier for us if you know
the version name just to install
straightaway right from the package
console itself package manager console
so I can say which 1.5 and now you can
see it actually installed 1.5 version so
if you open the scripts you can see
jQuery 1.5 is available and inside the
package as you can see this one okay and
yes I already have that particular
jQuery installed I can also list out all
the packages installed in my solution by
just typing get package and now you can
see as part of my particular solution it
says jQuery has been installed and now
there is another command which
essentially gives me
all the updates which can be made to my
solution with respect to the versioning
of the packages so the moment I type
this it says like I already have a
jQuery version however it could be
upgraded to the latest version 2.1 point
4 so that is the suggestion it can give
us the moment we type in this it does
not do any update it just lists out what
are all the updates we can do for the
respective packages we might have been
already downloaded and using it so that
is another advantage of get package here
so how to install or update it so the
easiest command is update package and
jQuery so that is one particular danger
of using update package command this
particular command essentially does
update that particular package in every
project of the current solution and it
doesn't honor the current default
project it is very much important so let
us consider I would like to have okay I
will build that one later so let us
consider I would like to say update
package jQuery so in this case I have
only in one location so let me consider
even inside another test I would like to
have the jQuery reference which may not
make sense here but just I would like to
simply add or install jQuery
into the tests so as I again I'm
mentioning this may not make sense but
just for understanding on how to install
and update so in this case I would like
to say a version 1.5 so I am installing
geocoding into this particular project
of version 1.5 and you can see I got the
scripts along so in the scripts you can
see I have 1.5 so let me clear
everything and now I would like to say
update package jQuery so the default
project is web application tasks and let
us see what this one is doing right now
so I am saying that please upgrade the
package jQuery to the latest version and
just click OK ok now let us see this and
see now you can see this update package
command essentially went through every
project in the solution and upgraded my
existing jQuery to 2.1 so earlier I was
having 1.4 here and 1.4 here but the
moment I say update package jQuery it
did not honor this default project but
instead it did for everything or say
every particular project available in
the solution so we should be very
careful whenever we're using update
package and next so let us consider I
would like to have jQuery back to 1.5
version for web application one but
still 2.1 alone for tests so I would
like to leave this one as it is but I
would like to downgrade the version of
jQuery here for web application one
which was done by mistake
so yes update package does not honor
this I need to specify my own project so
I am saying
please update the package jQuery to
version 1.5 and only for the project web
application 1 and the moment I press
Enter you can see this is still 2 point
1 point 4 but if you switch back it is
back to 1 point 5 so in order to
downgrade you can still update the
package so update package command works
for both upgrading or downgrading
the versions of the respective packages
you might be working on so imagine I am
actually doing one more ok let me
install unity into this particular
project so install package unities web
application 1 cycling and now you can
see I got the differences of all the
unity stuff for some reason for an
unknown reason just imagine I remove
this and again I try to install this it
says it has already installed but
instead you can see my particular
references are not getting updated it
updated only once during the
installation but after that it did not
update anything even though I have
removed it by mistake so how to fix
those kind of errors clear the screen
and I have the reinstall so which is
supposed to be an option here so package
reinstall and then I can specify unity
for the project web application 1
and now you can see that particular
reference whatever I removed earlier
array I could get it back again so in
that way whenever you delete any kind of
references you can still get back to the
previous mode by just reinstalling that
package alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
