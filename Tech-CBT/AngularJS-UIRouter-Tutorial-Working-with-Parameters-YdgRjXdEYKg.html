about your outer it's advantageous and
how to configure basic states or routes
using your router in this video we are
going to see and how to work with you a
router parameters in various ways so
what are the various ways we can really
send parameters to our application
whenever we are working with you our
outer the first thing is that we can
have something to set up as part of the
routing URL itself so which means you
can send some kind of parameter values
as part of the URL itself or you can
also use the UI FF in order to send a
few of the values as whatever you are
out of configuration there is a state
configuration the next way is just use
only you is left but those particular
parameters or values will not be
available through uro
so which means even though you send the
values through URL those would not be
recognized but if and only if you send
through you iff those are going to be
working the next way is actually using
query parameters and this is pretty
straightforward like we are going to
have a question mark ampersand and so on
where we can send key and value related
sets as part of your career string and
that - as part of your routing URL so
this is just another way as well so we
typically do as a routing URL or core
image parameters but on top of it if
your particular application really
demands are not having routing the URL
but just only work with you is rough
still there are chances to work with
that one - okay what are the various
features supported in order to have
those parameters are values to be sent
first of all either you use routing URL
way or you is ref or query parameters or
whatever those parameters can be marked
optional so which means you have the
flexibility of a they are sending the
value or not sending the value at all
for the respective parameter
and default values so if those
parameters are already configured but
the user did not provide any value or
your application did not provide any
value for the respective parameter in
your URL or query parameter there could
be situations where those need to be
automatically falling back to some
default values if such is the case you
can still configure your state to
actually work with default values as
well in case if those particular
parameter values are not really sent as
part of your URL or your query
parameters or you ifgf a regular
expression support so there is a special
syntax if you really wanted to work with
regular expression support so which
means those parameter related values can
be automatically sent based on your
parameter names which actually go with
regular expressions so we are going to
see these examples British whole UAS of
support so this is pretty important yes
because every ui-router the later state
or the configuration in one way or
another directly or indirectly supports
the URL configuration with you is for
not just head stuff so if you are not
familiar with the you is ref you might
want to check my previous video address
support so you can have your router
parameters to be actually having all the
values to be taken into one single
variable in the form of an array so you
can have one array accepting multiple
values of parameters which can be reused
later as part of your controller or
scope squashing so this is a bit of a
confusing subject but in simple you can
just say how to represent your current
value in the URL if it is the same as
the default value so I'm not going to
touch more on this one but we are going
to see this concept as part of our
conceptual demonstration and this is one
more concept called state parameters
that is dollar state parameters so why
do we need it and how do we use it first
of all it comes with you are out of more
which means if you included you a router
related JavaScript in your application
we are already having dollar state
parameters are readily available for
consumption that is the easiest way to
actually access your parameters or
parameter values whatever you configured
as part of your state in your
application so which means if your
applications tries to switch to a
different state and that state involves
a particular route with various
parameters and values you can literally
get hold of all of those parameters and
values in your application or in your
code using dollar state parameters and
as I mentioned this dollar state
parameters is usually used in control or
scope or service related code and state
parameters and needs to be injected so
which means if you are working with or
if you would like to work with state
parameters or dollar state params that
needs to be injected as part of your
controller or service so let us jump on
to a couple of examples here so I have a
simple example already so this is just a
home page you can see if I am on home it
just says you are at route click
something else or some link or whatever
so in this case I have two links which
are actually saying the same concept
like MSG one MSG one so both actually go
to the same URL if you think so so if I
click on this you can see it actually
goes to first message which actually
brings some message for that particular
template and it actually binds to a and
B which are actually configured as part
of your scope 10 and 20 similarly that
exists one more link which also works in
the same fashion as the previous one so
the only difference between these two is
how we are actually trying to get the
route so this is using the route URL
using a Chara and this is using the
state specification as part of you is
draft so if you switch back to my code
you can see this is the first link which
actually specifies hash first message
and this is the second one which
actually goes through the state name
being called in the form of function so
how did I configure these two so if you
go back to my JavaScript here
you can see this is the route so
whatever I'm specifying right here in
the form of Petrov but if you would like
to work with first message which is
nothing but the name of the state then
you are going to work with you is Rev so
this is a typically on how you can
really work with stage or route using h0
for you is slow but our goal in this
video is really working with parameters
so we did not confer any routing
parameters here so let us add a couple
more parameters here so in this case I
am saying that I would like to have two
values to be sent and needs to be
automatically stored in the form of a
and B so whenever you would like to have
any kind of parameters to be sent those
particular parameters or means need to
be preceded with column so it says that
if I write something like slash first
message slash 10 slash 2010 will be
stored in a and 20 will be stored in B
respectively and we can always get that
information or get those variables
related information using dollar state
parameters as I mentioned earlier so in
the previous case we are actually hard
coding the values 10 and 22 a and B and
those are automatically displayed in
this fashion but now I would like to
jump away from this hard coding but
instead get those values straight from
the router URL and assign to a and B and
finally get directly as part of our
template which actually displays the
values AF of a and B automatically from
the scope itself so in order to
accomplish that the first thing is that
I need to inject dollar state parameters
so I'm going to say dollar stage
parameters and I would like to use the
same name as part of the function as
well and instead of using 10 here I am
going to say please go to the parameters
of the current route and have the value
available in a to be accessed and get
that value out and assign to a local
variable a which is going to be stored
as part of scope so you can say this
name a should match with this a so which
means whatever the value you provide for
this a
is going to be retrieved from state
parameters and finally assigned to any
scope related variable so similarly just
like a I'm going to get B as well so if
you have more number of parameters here
or more parameters here you are going to
access all those parameter names here in
order to get the values out and you can
assign to scope and use it in your
template so just save this and I need to
modify my routing URL as part of my
setup here
so in order to get through head stuff I
need to send some values as part of the
routing parameters so in this case I'm
going to say something like 20 and 30 so
which means this 20 will be
automatically assigned to a and that a
is going to be retrieved through state
parameters finally assigned to the scope
similarly 30 is going to be stored in be
accessible through state parameters
assigned to B so let us see if this is
working fine so I'm not going to work
with this one yet so I'm going to just
comment on this one I go back here go to
hole just refresh this and you can see
message 1 right here so let me clear
everything the moment I click on message
work and now you can see I have 20 and
30 which are automatically displayed
here so you can also say something like
40 and 50 and it is smart enough to
actually figure out that it has to
display 40 and 50 using the template so
you can provide any values here and it
is going to take those two values right
as part of a and B so this is pretty
much the way on how you can use H stuff
but let us consider the about you is Rev
so this is also important and as part of
you is ref this particular first message
is the name of this particular state
name we need to send some kind of
information to this state saying that
you are actually sending the values
values of a and B so you can send all
the parameters in the form of one single
JSON object to this state name using the
state name method so you are already
using the state name in the form of a
method the only difference now is that
you should be able to send
all the parameter names and values in
the form of one single JSON object so
I'm going to create a new JSON object
here and I would like to send those both
values 20 and 30 in the form of a and B
parameter names and that is exactly what
I'm going to accomplish here so the
first one is a and the second one is B
so you can see this is just a JSON
object which will be sent to this state
name and will be executed in the form of
the function so now I go back here go
home refresh this and now you can see I
have the second link and if I click on
that you can see it automatically knows
that this particular UI is revenues to
be transformed to the C routing URL so
let us quickly go to this inspect and
see what's going on you can see even
though the UI a set of releases that
first message e and B and so on it has
automatically added a hedge of attribute
and it has been done by angular JS
framework automatically if you go back
to my code here you can see there is no
H stuff attribute here but angular JS
whenever it has compiled and trying to
render it has added H ref automatically
to our anchor tag based on the
translation whatever it could do from
our UI a self expression into new H
refer later routing URL which will be
finally used as part of your browser
related URL so that is pretty much how
you can accomplish the simple parameters
on how you can do I can also do just
another way instead of using column here
I can also use braces so even this is
valid so I can use either of these two
ways so even this should work with no
issues so I go home I just press ctrl f5
and open this and it should still work
with no issues in both of those
scenarios so this is just another syntax
okay now I would like to have some kind
of regular expressions to be provided so
let me start a new state
so I'm going to call this on a second
message and now I'm going to say so let
me remove this one so I'm going to say
this a can have any kind of value in the
form of dessert so I'm going to say
something like zero to nine and from
blue plus so that is nothing but hollow
so now a can have any kind of value in
the form of desserts and be it just
normal B so there is no validation or no
regular expression here so here I'm
saying that expression whatever you
provide here has to be matched for a in
order to take that one into the account
and this kind of syntax is available if
and only if you are using places as part
of your parameter names okay so let us
see on how I can test this if I go back
here and in this case I am going to use
second message so that is more so let me
see if I modified this so I did not I
need to modify this one to second
message and now I'm going to provide
something like two hundred and three
hand it and I'm going to call this one
as message two and I also would like to
have another you is rough way of
accomplishing the same thing and let us
make sure that I'm using the same name
as of the stake name and I need to
provide the value so in this case I also
would like to pretend like two hundred
and three hundred and I would like to
call this one as message two so I go in
here I click on this I click refresh so
now I have message 1 and message too
and the moment I click on this you can
see it has automatically review 200 and
300 and it should work in the same
fashion even for the second one so let
me go home refresh this and I click on
this and it is going to work even with
the UI a sort of as
okay now I go back here let us modify
this a bit the a value is something like
demo so let's see what's going on so I
go back here and I go home and refresh
this now I click on this and now you can
see whenever I said demo and 300 it is
no route available because whatever the
value you provided is not really being
added as part of your regular expression
so I'm not providing any digits here
which could be taken into the account
for a so this value whatever you
provided as part of the parameter did
not match with your regular expression
which is actually expecting only the
digits so this route is valid if and
only if this expression is also valid or
matched in this case our particular now
did not match with this one and does
this route itself is not found and it
actually falls back to our particular
state which is no route available so
that kind of support is available
whenever you would like to have some
kind of matching or validating your
particular parameter values to be
configured as part of your state okay
so let us see on how I can support
optional values so let me create a new
state and this one I am going to call
the third message and as part of the
third message so just a so whenever I
suggest a the most important thing I
have to explain here is that it is
optional by default so unlike ng route
you don't need to specify any special
character here to make it optional
so whatever the specification you
provide as part of your URL parameter is
actually optional by default but it
doesn't need to be optional whenever you
provide something like this now I can
say B parameter or parameter B is
optional but not a so which means if you
provide a then only B becomes optional
so if you don't provide a and provide
only for B then that value actually goes
back to a so that is pretty important
okay so let me take this one off I just
wanted to make sure that only a is made
available and this is considered third
message which is fine so I go back here
and for the third message I need to
create one more length so I'm going to
call this one a third message and in
this case I'm going to say the third
message with low values at all so I just
remove everything here and message three
here as one and I go in here and create
the same thing similar to our previous
you is left and in this case I'm going
to call this an S third message and in
this third message yes I do not want to
send any values I just send null so
which means literally no object or say
no parameter values so that is an
explicit way of saying that I'm not
going to send any parameter values for
this state that is explicit way of
sending it okay so let me say this one
as message three with no parameters so
that will have a better understanding on
how we are having those links so message
three with no parameters and this is
also message three with no parameters so
I go back here go home refresh this now
I click on this one and you can see this
is first message template and you know
values of a and B are available and at
the same time if I click on this it
should also give the same kind of result
so I go back here and you can see
there's no result for this one tool and
now let us try to provide some kind of
value to this one so I'm going to say
something like 10 and I'm going to say
it is just one parameter for now and
similarly I would like to create one
more you is left by sending the value
for a in the form of 10 and at the same
time let us be more specific saying that
I'm not going to send any value for B at
all so which means B is going to be now
however is going to be having a value of
10 so you can send in that way so let us
see if this is working fine so I go back
here
click home refresh this and now I have
no parameters and one parameter the
moment I click on one you can see 10 is
automatically taken into a and B is not
available yet similarly if I go home and
replace this of course this needs to be
modified as a typo and currently this
actually goes to still one parameter it
works fine even with our U is less so
this needs to be modified to one
parameter okay so this is a typical way
on how we can actually configure small
values for your parameters so which
means those are optional by default okay
so let us take this to the next level
now I'm going to say something like that
third message - so this is going to be
different state and of course I'm going
to have B as well
so here the most important thing is that
goes here if both are provided so if
your route URL has both of the values
then actually it goes to this state if
your route has got one or no parameters
it is going to go to this route so this
is pretty important so this is optional
however it doesn't mean that it this is
optional in this scenario this is not
optional at all so in this case only
qualen B is optional but not column ei
so if you provide some values to call
them be thinking that column ei is
actually optional not really that will
it goes back here so that is pretty
important so let us test this one too so
I go back here and okay I need to modify
my markup so I am going to say with two
parameters
and I'm going to send a couple more
parameters to this one and similarly I
am going to have two parameters here and
I am going to send 20 as well so I go
back here go home
/ this and now you can see I have two
parameters so if I click on there it is
actually getting both values with the
same route and it's no parameters and
with one parameter so same route with no
values and one value and two values are
automatically being configured and
accomplished as part of your state
configuration so similarly let me
refresh this it should work in the same
fashion if for a one you is lab so no
parameters one parameter and two
parameters so the third one is missing
because this is supposed to be message
to so because the name of my state is
actually modified the third message too
so I need to provide that here in order
to take that into the consideration so I
go home here i refresh this and the
moment I click on message to now it
should work with no issues and even for
one and even with man as well and no
parameter is not working it actually
tries to merge the existing state with
the previous state and if it has already
got those values it is going to display
those values so to be very clear and to
be very explicit saying that you are not
sending any values it is just another
way of sending something like this a
with Mal and B with null as well so in
that way you're specifying that you are
not really sending any values to any of
those so let us still see if it is
working so I go with two parameters is
working fine one parameter working fine
and no parameters working fine too so
this is just another way of doing things
so sometimes that may not work based on
how you are trying to navigate because
it tries to merge the existing state
with the new state and if it has already
got those values in the previous state
those values will be reused as part of
the angular UI router design itself so
if you are coming across those kind of
scenarios it is pretty important that
you nullify those parameters
individually and sometimes it can also
work in a different way using this
so that is so that is you is ref options
so in the options whenever you specify
inherit to false it clearly says that
you do not really merge based on
existing states you might be already
having it so let us see if this is
working so I go back here and refresh
this and let us go to the two parameters
one parameter and no parameter now it is
working fine so in order to consider
this you should really be aware that you
are not really trying to merge with the
existing state if you still need merging
then you would not need this one to be
provided however you will be nullifying
explicitly using the where I have shown
right here okay so this is pretty much
about on how you can really have your
optional parameters to be specified so
let us take this to the next level that
is using the params so let me create
another state and this time I would like
to have fourth message and the fourth
message I do not want to provide
anything in the URL so I just wanted to
keep it with low parameters there so
still I am going to work with the same
template same controller however I would
like to introduce something new called
params
so this is just another way to actually
provide the values or specifying your
parameters names and values together and
also some defaults if necessary so in
this case I can specify a as a new
parameter with a default value as 1 I
can provide something like this so
similarly I can also say I would like to
have another parameter called B and the
default value of this one is going to be
2 so this is just another way of
providing the parameters but there is
one important thing
as you did not specify anything in the
URL this is not going to work as part of
your heads off so if you would like to
have this one to be working you have to
use through your UI Esref alone so let
us see how you can really make use of
these parameters so I go back here into
the e01 so let us start with another
thing called fourth message as I
mentioned here so I just take the fourth
message here I go in here and I am going
to say something like twenty and thirty
as usual and this is going to be message
for and that's also it's two parameters
which should be fine so I go in here and
get the fourth message so this is the
name of the state I am going to use that
here and I'm going to send the values 20
and even 30 here okay so this is going
to be message four and two parameters
yes so let us see what is working and
what is not so I go back here let us go
home and refresh this and once I depress
this you can see I'm having this I go in
here and it still says no route
available but if you go back to our Java
Script and see you have the route and
you have specified the parameters the
only thing is that this routing URL do
not have the specification of the
respective routing parameters here and
does this one cannot be used as part of
routing Ryu ro so this is not going to
work however this is going to work if
and only if you are actually using Q is
left that is important so if you would
like to work with only you is rough but
not really with hydrops but still you
would like to have the parameters then
this is the way to go
so let us see if this one is working so
I go in here so the URL doesn't have the
values 20 and 30 but still it is not
enough to figure out a and B directly
from the state whatever you configured
so let me go to the inspector of this
one you can see even in the inspect even
though you are providing forth message
the
object with the respective parameter
names and values the hf is still without
the parameter names or values so it is
just a plain routing URL but internally
angularjs mechanism works to really work
with States whatever you are already
configured earlier okay I did not
actually demonstrate the default values
of 1 &amp;amp; 2 so let me demonstrate those as
well so I go back here so as part of
this it is already having two parameters
so now I am going to say I am providing
only the value of B and I am going to
set this only one parameter so and at
the same time I do not want to send
anything but whenever you are not
providing anything as I mentioned let us
be explicit so I am going to say the
wave value of a is going to be null and
in this case a is going to have the
value of 30 by the B is going to be null
and this is also one parameter and that
too for the value of B and this is one
parameter and the 2 for the value of a
and at the same time I would like to
have one more link with literally no
values for both a and B so let us see on
how this is working so I go back here I
go home or to flash this and we are
going to say ton of things here so the
first thing is that okay this is
different
the last one is supposed to be no
parameters so go back here let's refresh
and now let us see how this is working
for you we have still on message for now
I am trying to provide the value for B
and B values taken with 30 however as
you did not provide a the default value
of 1 is automatically taken from your
configuration so you provided B and as
you did not provide a the value of 1 is
taken by default so these are actually
the default values
so if you are not providing the values
these values will be automatically taken
into the consideration for the
respective parameter so again I go back
here and now I click on parameter this
one and you can see you provided EE and
you did not provide B and as it has
taken the default value 2 similarly we
did not provide any other value then you
can see it is actually taking the
defaults of a and B respectively so that
is how you can actually configure the
default using the params object okay so
let us take this to the next level by
actually adding the same configuration
but with Colony and Collin be right here
so I'm going to say and this is going to
be fifth message so just want it to be
pretty clear on what we are trying to
accomplish here so this is going to be
fifth message and I am going to say it
is still supposed to work with one and
one and however I would like to have
both of these values to be still
providers so which means as part of URL
so what I'm saying is that yes a and B
values can be still be provided as part
of the routing URL so what let us see
what is going up and now I remove this
and defaults are still default no matter
what because I go back to our a and just
like fourth message I am going to have
the fifth message so I am going to have
the fifth message so let me remove
everything here so this is fifth message
and that with no parameters and now I am
going to create another for you iff and
this is going to be system message too
this is first message
and let us send nothing to the fifth
message so this is message five and with
no parameters so let us see what's going
on so I go back to my application I
press home with a flash it and now we
should be able to say message five with
no parameters and message five with no
parameters
and if you see properly the moment I
click on this it knows that it has to
automatically translate our particular
URL with one and two defaults because
you did not provide the value so if you
go to inspect you can see I did not
provide a and B values and ui-router is
actually smart enough to actually create
a new head of attribute for our anchor
tag in such a way that it actually goes
to the fifth message with the default
values one and two so this worked with
no issues at all so let us go to this
one I click on this and now it says no
route available but that is not how it
is supposed to work I am saying that I
am providing the default values as part
of my state configuration so you can see
in my first message I provided the
default but even though I am not
providing the values of these two the
HIV routing URL is not working if no
values are provided so let us fix that
the easiest fix in this case is a slash
at the very end so whether I so imagine
I just have one to one slash at the
moment so I go home I just refresh this
and the moment I click on this you can
see there is a slash here so whether or
not you have the slash at the end it
still behaves in the same fashion but if
you provide another slash it is going to
work mysteriously so I go home here i
refresh this and the moment I click on
this one now you can see it is working
with the default values that is a
strange way on how it has been defined
and in order to overcome this one that
is where we have the squash so we are
going to get to that squash pretty soon
but just wanted to let you know if you
are trying to use the params object for
providing the default values and also
use those
parameter names as part of your URL then
the trailing slash is always necessary
in order to differentiate the difference
between your routing URL and the default
parameters as well so the trailing slash
is essential again so let us modify with
one parameter now so that is one value
so now we go back here in the fifth
message I am going to save this file and
with no trailing slash here no flash at
the end and I am going to set this one
as one parameter so this is going to
work no issue so I am NOT going to
concentrate on this one but this one is
important so I'm saying that now it is
going to be only one value five which is
supposed to be automatically taken into
a according to my configuration and B is
supposed to be taken s2 there is a
default so let us see this is working
fine so I have message five with one
parameter and I clicked and again it
says no route available so even though
we configure the default values it
doesn't accept it but again if I put a
slash here it is going to work fine with
no issues so I go home in a fresh list
and if I click on this now you can see
the value five is automatically taken
into a and B is coming up with its own
default value so this trailing slash is
going to be making huge difference
whenever you are configuring the
parameters as default values and trying
to use those values or parameters as
part of your URL as well so that is
pretty important to consider okay
slashes only in routing URL so that that
is one thing we would like to worry
about okay so now let me try to create
another state saying that gated this is
going to be six message
and all the default values as usual
however I am going to introduce a new
property called as square show and this
one also square to true so let us see
how it works so I go back to a 0 1 I
just copy and paste the same tool
previous links I call this una sixth
message and sixth message and I am going
to call this one as message 6 and
message 6 but now the only difference is
that I am going to remove these trailing
banks
I mean trailing slashes so once I remove
those I go back here and now I go home
and refresh this and now I have this one
see now it works even without a slash at
the very end and even with the one
parameter you can see there is no end at
the very last but still it works by
taking a in the proper way and B with
the default value so this crash is going
to really be working very good whenever
you would like to remove the trailing
slashes in this scenario so this square
as I mentioned in my previous
presentation here so the square actually
represents how the default values in the
URL are supposed to behave when they
have the same as the current value so
let us think about this question a
different way so let me create another
state so I am going to call this one a
7th message
and now instead of squash equal to true
I'm going to say something like squash
equal to - here and similarly square is
equal to some tilde character so what
does this mean so I am saying that
whenever this particular you are a lot
of the routing you are receives - as a
value for a please take the default
value as 1 instead of - similarly you
can provide till the character for be in
order to take - into the consideration
so let us see how it works so I go back
here and that is the 7th message so I go
in here so let me create a couple more
or just one so in this case I just
wanted to call this one excellent
message and I'm going to say the first
one is going to be - which is nothing
but the value of a and next the value of
B so in this case the value of B I would
like to take it as 13 and this is going
to be 7 and I am going to say two
parameters and a square so the moment I
have that select miho go home and
refresh this and once I click on this
you can see the value of a is supposed
to be the - or - but this has been
automatically translated to the default
value 1 and B is as usual working with
no issues so let me modify this with
another link and I want to call this one
s something like 24 very bully a however
till the character for B which is
nothing but we are scratching the B so I
do this I go here and go home
refresh this and now I have message to
parameters with the B being squares and
now you can see the B is actually
provided in the form of tilde and that
has been translated
into the default value which is - okay
now that we have various ways on
actually working with parameters we need
to work with query parameters as well so
let us have a couple more examples so I
would like to create a new state and I
would like to call this one as eight
state so that is eight message and this
is going to be eight message as well and
in this case okay let me let me clear
all the parameters whatever I have in
place here okay so I would like to
provide some query parameters here so
what I'm saying is that I'm expecting a
and B to be provided so as you know the
key string usually will have a kind of
the question mark I don't need a flashy
Oh a kind is a question mark and then
the name of the parameter and the value
immediately after that so this is the
routing URL and I'm expecting the values
of a and B to be provided as part of my
routing you are also I go back to my
eight message link here so I'm going to
say eight message and the eighth message
as you know it has to work with a and B
so in this case I am going to say a
value is ten and at the same time B
value is 20 and I'm going to say this is
message eight with two parameters and
the same thing should work even with our
you is ref as well so I go in here and
instead of seventh message a sort of
first message I am going to say eight
message and of course this has to match
with whatever the state semi provided
here so I provide this - and the eighth
message in this case I would like to
have a values 10 to be maintained and B
value to be counting
and this is going to be message eight
with two parameters
let us go back here go home but reflect
this okay I have two parameters and that
is if that is working so now you can see
it is smart enough to extract the
parameter values or the quarry string
values a and B to the scope and finally
bind it to a template so let us go home
as a fresh dish and let us go through
our UI extra so the moment I click on
this guy you can see it is already made
available as part of our H rough so if
you go and inspect this you are going to
see our particular u is ref has already
been translated into the respect to
routing URL with the same kind of Cora
string parameter as specified and
configured as part of your state and
these quarry parameters would work based
on your values you provide so for
example if I am NOT providing both
values so imagine I'm just providing
only ten and this is one parameter and
similarly with no parameters at all so I
am going to remove this one too and this
one is no parameter and similarly I
would like to have even the estrus as
well so this is going to be the first
values 10 the second value is going to
be now and let us be specific even for
the next one as well and this is going
to be one parameter and this is going to
be no parameters so I go back here and
go home
and press the flash and let us click on
message 1 parameter you can see 1 the a
is considered and B is taken off into
the consideration and similarly no
parameters it doesn't work similarly one
parameter you have the one value and
even from the you is left low parameter
gives us no values so still works which
means those are optional by default as
part of your configuration so whether or
not you provide a and B values those are
optional
so how about providing default values
for those parameters again you are going
to go with the parameters so I am going
to create one more state and devil state
that one too so so I'm going to say this
one has a ninth message and this is
going to be nine the message as well so
I'm going to leave this one as usual and
however I am going to work with param as
because I would like to provide some
default values to this one and I can
also define the characteristics of those
particular parameters so in this case I
would like to say a value has to be
defaulted to one so let us see if this
is working fine so let me actually
quickly comment all of this so that
we'll be concentrating on whatever is
really necessary for us so now I need to
work with ninth message so I'm going to
have the same kind of ninth message
whatever I have in place so this is
going to be ninth message as well this
is going to be ninth message my into
message and mine and this is going to be
nine and this is going to be nine - okay
so I am sending and trying to send all
the parameters two parameters one
parameter or no parameters and similarly
I would like to have even for you is
rough so I copy all of this and let me
get the name of the state use the same
state here and I am going to call this
one as message 9 which is 9 and message
9 so that is pretty much it so let me go
here and refresh this and we should be
able to see only the ninth I go with two
parameters and now you can see 10 and 20
of course as you provided those have
been taken so one parameter that is 10
and B there is no value because the
default value is provided only for a but
not B
so if I go to the no parameters now you
can see is taken as 1 and B is not and
in the same fashion we should be having
our us of parameters to be also working
with 1 2 and even no parameters as well
okay so this is pretty much on how you
can provide the default values for your
kodi string parameters and the last one
is going to be an added support so how
can you provide array so let us actually
modify this a bit the specification of B
is something like array equals to 0 so
whenever I say this the URL considers
that whatever the values you provide
with the name B which means with the
parameter name B will always be actually
presented in the form of an array so B
is going to be an array by default so
let us see how this one works so I would
like to have more values to be provided
to B along with whatever we already have
in place
so I am going to say so not this one so
let me get this care so the B is already
there so I'm going to add one more
so that is B with another value 30 and
probably be with another value for T so
I am sending three values for B and I am
going to call message nine with multiple
probably array that is easy okay so
similarly I would like to use the same
thing here as well so B value is 20 and
instead of sending multiple beasts here
you will be sending array so that is
important when we are trying to send as
part of your yes rough so I am going to
say 20 30 40 and this is array so let us
see how this is working so I go back
here I go home and press the flash and
the moment I click on this guy you can
see the value of a is actually 10 as
expected and all the values of B are
actually put inside one particular
arrey and it is nothing but a string era
in this case and we contains the string
area basically and even if you go to
your UI FF it is going to be the same
thing and you can observe that as part
of your inspect even in the inspect you
can see B value is actually considers 20
30 40 being sent in the form of routing
URL so if you would like to see whether
it is really an area or not you can just
put a debugger in your scope right
before your B and see how it is really
working so I go refresh here and the
moment I click on this guy it is
supposed to stop there and let us see in
the state parameters so it says open
state parameters here and the moment you
open it you can see I have a and B P is
actually treated as an array with 3
values 0 1 and 2 respectively so these
are all the various ways on how you can
really work with you a router related
parameter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
