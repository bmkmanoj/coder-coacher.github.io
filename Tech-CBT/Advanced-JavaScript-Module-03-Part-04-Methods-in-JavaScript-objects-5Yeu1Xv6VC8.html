how to create instantiate and work with
various kinds of JavaScript objects and
that too using construction functions
solid constructor functions in this
video we are going to look into methods
in objects so what exactly are methods
in objects first of all a method is
nothing but a function so if you are
familiar with functions you already know
what exactly are methods so object can
have methods so which means whenever you
write a function inside an object it is
nothing but a method methods have access
to any member in the object so which
means if you have an object with three
or four properties all of those
particular properties are automatically
accessible as part of the method you are
going to write inside that particular
object so how do we define methods in an
object first of all you can have any
kind of external function to be made
available as part of a object and
convert that into a method by just a
sign of that will member so for example
here you are having a particular
function called get annual salary
so that particular get annual salary is
an external function however you are
saying that the definition of that
particular annual salary get annual
salary is going to be assigned to a
member of the proud member of the object
called annual salary so this object
OMP one has got three two properties or
three members so two of those but if the
properties are just value-based
properties however the third member is
nothing but a kind of a function
definition is being assigned so which
means this is automatically converted to
a method or called as method in general
so you will be accessing any of those
particular methods by just the same
and how you are going to access the
other members or properties so in this
case you can see we MP 1 dot e name
nothing but you're accessing a name
similarly you can access salary as well
and if you'd like to execute any of
those members you have to say EMP one
dot which is nothing but object dot
annual salary and you can see I am
trying to execute that particular
function by providing the paranthesis
but here I did not provide any of the
parentheses that is important if you
don't provide parentheses you are just
assigning the definition to the other
variable so in this case I am NOT
assigning it but instead asking it to
execute on the spot so in this case it
is going to execute this guy in fact
this is the function which is going to
be executed however internally I am
using this so whenever we said this this
automatically tries to find the current
object so in this case if get annual
salary is going to be executed as part
of this object this bird the word this
actually resembles EMP yes this
particular function is going to be
executed within the context of this
particular object the word this is
actually resembling the same context you
were using which is nothing but we MP so
om p dot sal is what behind the scenes
it is going to execute so as part of
that particular execution it is going to
fetch the value valuable inside that
particular property which is nothing but
5400 inter 12 is going to be returned
back and finally will be displayed here
so in that way you can have external
functions to be assigned as methods to
existing objects you can also have
functions to be made available in within
the same object or you can also use
anonymous functions to directly have
them inside the object so you can have
directly function annual salary or you
can have annual salary equal to function
either of those two will behave in the
same fashion so instead of using
external functions you better have those
particular methods to be directly made
as part of the respective object so that
it is quite readable
we need not jump here and there to just
try to understand where that particular
function is and how it is going to be
executed rather if everything is made
available as part of the same object we
can easily figure out or we can easily
understand where that particular
function is going to be executed and how
it is going to access the respective
members and if you're using constructor
functions which I already covered as
part of my previous class so if you are
using constructor functions still you
can have any of those methods to be
defined in this way so just like the
other members you define you also define
those particular methods just like the
other members except that all the
members inside the constructor function
should always be preceded with the word
this so let us have a demonstration of
the same methods and methods in
constructor functions so let me start
with a new HTML file here and I would
like to call this one or something like
zero for the first one let me start with
an external function first so I would
like to say get annual salary so in this
case I would like to say that it is
going to access a member called salaries
when the same context where it is going
to be used multiplied with 12 and
finally return the value of 12 sorry
return the value which is nothing but
salary into 12 and imagine I am going to
have an object or the OMP which is
essentially going to have a couple of
members also proper T's like email it is
going to be nothing but dragger and I
might have Southwark here which is 5000
or hundred and on top of that I would
like to have the method to be declared
as something like this get your celery
and carrot be taken so the care should
be taken in such a way that whenever you
are having the respective method being
assigned to a particular member here you
should ensure that you are not providing
paranthesis so if you do provide
parenthesis you are executing the
function on the spot we do not want that
we want the definition of the function
to be retrieved and get it assigned to
another variable so in order to do that
you should not have the parentheses here
so once I have this particular object
now you can have each of those
particular members to be directly
accessible by just using object dot
member notation so now I can say alert
OMP one dot any concatenated with some
message and I can say oh MP one dot
annuals and in this case I would like to
have that particular function to be
executed so that is the reason I can say
parenthesis here and on top of that I
would like to have one more
concatenation something like this so let
us see this is working
and there we go we have that particular
value automatically returns back so let
me comment all of this for now and let
me go with another sample where I would
like to have a new object called OMP to
be declared and that particular object
is going to have the same kind of
members whatever I defined earlier and
now I would like to have a couple more
anonymous functions to be defined as
methods so in this case I would like to
say I know server is going to be an
anonymous function and a comma I know
you would like to have another anonymous
method to be added so in this case I
would like to say something like this so
you can have multiple methods in such a
fashion but I'm sure that the last one
will not have it last member will not
have a comma but the rest of the other
members are going to have commas so in
this case I would like to just say
return this dot celery star call so in
this case I would like to return this
dot celery star 3 so once everything is
defined now I can get it executed using
the same syntax what I used earlier by
just saying oh MP dot plus yes and I can
say oh yeah meet our annual salary or so
this needs to become a calculator so it
just or and so one more or mp2 dot
quater salary which needs to be executed
immediately or
so let me execute and test this or not
so there we go we have the same
particular value which is returned with
respect to per annum and per quarter by
teok so in that way we can have the
methods to be directly made available as
part of objects if you have objects but
let us consider you would like to have
the methods to be declared inside
constructor functions so let me create a
new file altogether so in this case I
would like to call this on a 0 file so I
start with the script and now I would
like to define a constructor function
which is nothing but a class so I would
like to have the default parameters as
employee mean salary so as this is
constructor functions all the members
should be preceded with this name and
similarly I would like to have one more
member salary
please Hilary so this syntax is pretty
much to what I covered in my previous
video the constructor functions so if
you are not familiar with that make sure
that you completed the previous video
and then all you are going to understand
what exactly is constructor function and
how to instantiate objects in the
constructor functions so now that we
have both of this remember both of these
members we need to have a couple more
methods so let me copy whatever I have
in here so I would just like to copy
whatever I have in here into here except
that this needs to be called something
like so this could be calls until I get
annual salary so which makes it easier
to understand what exactly is that and I
don't know this so I can just say this
one sorry I
to write a total function so this is
going to be an anonymous function as
such and similarly I would like to have
this dot get Auto salary equal to
function so this is just another way of
achieving the same thing
so now EMP is a class which is going to
have four numbers so whenever I create
an instance of this class all of these
four members will be automatically made
available for the new instance so the
easiest way to accomplish is just create
an instance and name it as we EMP in
order to create an instance form the
constructor function you are going to
use a new operator with the respect to
constructor function name so in here I
can provide initial values for those two
parameters something like this so once I
have those two now I can just display my
alert something like this so just would
like to have direct execution or MP dot
get annual salary and similarly I can
have a more alert which would be
displaying something like part of salary
I can say get quarter salary so in that
way I can have both of those two methods
to be executed straight from the object
and that particular object even though
is getting instantiated using the
constructor function so let us see if
this is working fine and now I have a
new salary and quadruple salary as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
