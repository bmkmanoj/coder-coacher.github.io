look at UI router in angularjs this is
the famous module being used by
developers in order to work with routing
capabilities there are several features
available as part of you a router and in
this video we are just going to get
started on your router we are going to
have more advanced videos to be covered
pretty soon so let us start with what
exactly is routing so in my previous
video of routings we already covered
what exactly is routing here and this is
pretty much the same kind of slide that
is routing does three simple things it
actually goes to a particular location
which means whatever the URL you specify
download some HTML content and that
content is going to be injected right
inside your web page it is mainly used
as part of SPS implementation that is
single page applications so whenever I
mention single page applications
essentially your web page is going to
look something like this
always so which means you are going to
have a header left panel probably a
footer and a body where the left panel
content or the body content change is
very frequently based on the
communication on how the user really
wants he or his application to be
navigated across and all of your content
in a single page application is going to
be divided into several kinds of views
so your body view here alone can be
divided into say 3 columns or 4 columns
or 2 rows and each of those particular
rows might be displaying their own views
making it quite so complicated to manage
one single page having too many number
of views nested in whatever the
hierarchy the user really wants and in
order to manage all of those views and
loading them individually and
independently and communicating across
all of those views we really need some
kind of system for that and that is
where is routing realities and there is
a particular note here which says that
routing is available at both server and
client
yes there is routing capabilities which
can be implemented at both the server
level and even at the client level and
what we are focusing in this video is
really about angularjs which is going to
bed the client-side routing so what is
UI router in angularjs so before even
jumping on to UI router we have to see
like what are the options we have as
part of client side routing the two in
angularjs so the top two or ng route
under you are outer so which means you
can have routing implementation to be
made available as part of your angular
just by using any of these two modules
that is angular route or simply NZ route
or you are outer most of the developers
really lean to the UI router because of
its flexibility and having more
information and more features and more
comprehensive functionality then NZ
route so that is the reason we are going
to learn here outer today which is going
to cover almost all the aspects
available as part of n0 out in its own
way of implementation and on top of that
we are going to see very specific
implementations of you are out or which
are not really made available as part of
NZ route and you are router is actually
built by angular UI team it is not
angular team it is angular UI TM this is
a separate team out of your angular it
fully replaces NZ route so whenever I
said fully replaces ng doubt you don't
need to use NZ route if you start using
your route all because all of the
features available in NZ route are
already made available as part of your
outer and on top of that you have more
powerful features than NZ route right
inside your router in ng route if you
are familiar we actually concentrate and
work around the concept called routes
but as part of your router we actually
work around the concept of States so we
don't really call routes here in your
router but we call them as States so we
should always talk in the words of
States rather than routes so what is the
state and how is it differ and means how
is it different from
what exactly state it is bit more than
drought so in simple a state includes
all the routing configuration and bit
more so which means all the navigation
criteria better behavioral aspects and
so on so just consider whenever you are
working with state you are already
working with Route but you are providing
more information surrounding the routing
routing itself and as I mentioned state
includes more comprehensive information
especially for your navigation criteria
it holds all the routes related
configuration and their related
behaviors state describes how the UI
should look like whenever the user
navigates from one route to another or
one state to another so whenever we are
switching from one router another how
the US should look like at once
including all the views and nested views
and a related review with siblings all
of that information we can configure as
part of a state and you can have
multiple states as part of your
application configuration every state is
identified with its own unique name and
in order to switch to a particular state
you can go either using the routing URL
or just using the state name alone so
you can use both or out URL which might
be configured as part of the state or
you can just go through using the state
name alone and if you are familiar with
NZ route in order to configure routes
you will be using dollar route provider
but in the case of you are out or you
always work with States so if you are
working with you a router you are
working with States and does you have to
work with the dollar state provider
which comes along with the JavaScript
file which you are going to include as
part of your UI router so dollar state
provider is automatically included the
moment you include you are out a related
functional JavaScript file what are the
top advantages of using you are out or
when compared with NZ route the first
thing is multiple views so there is no
support for multiple views in NZ
you will always work with only one NGO
which you need to keep on replacing
forever and nesting of ng views is quite
so complicated if not impossible but in
the case of your router it is just like
a berets you can have multiple views
sitting together in parallel or you can
also nest them to any number of levels
so you have the flexibility of defining
the view hierarchy which can be
displayed in whatever the way the user
wants it and all those descriptions and
the configurations is usually made as
part of the state alone you can also
have nested States so which means
whenever you are defining a state you
are not limited to just that state you
can further enhance that state or you
can extend that state to the children as
well called as nested States and the
third one is Association of the
controllers and the scope related
information between the states and the
views so you can have the scope and the
controller support along with the parent
state and the child state and use and
nested views as well
so these three are just the main or top
advantages alone but beyond these three
we have quite a few as well and how do
we work with UI router what are all the
steps the first thing is that you need
to include UI router module and in order
to include your router module you can
directly include that from this content
delivery network that is the CDN URL
here or you can download that file and
include as part of your project or you
can use the client-side packages like
Bower or node packages or NPM manager
whatever you would like to use but all
we really need is just this javascript
file to be made available as part of
your application and once that is made
available you have to create and
obviously you will be creating your
angular module instance and in this case
I am calling it as app and while you are
creating that module you have to make
sure that that particular module is
always going to be dependent on UI
router so you have to include the
dependency injection for this module
I am going to say that my app module is
depending on this UI router in order to
leverage its functionality and the next
thing is that configure your states so
whenever I am calling about states you
are little configuring your routing URLs
a routing mechanism how the content
needs to be downloaded which controller
it isn't it supposed to be associated
and if necessary any nested views and
views and so on this is very similar to
your dollar route provider if you have
seen in NZ route but if not no problem
you are still working with the dollar
state provider in order to mention all
the routing related information in the
form of states so even here you can see
once your app module is ready you can
configure your app module with dollar
state provider which is being injected
into this function and you are using the
same variable dot that is dollar state
provider and configure your state here
and this is the name of the state you
can provide your own name of the state
followed by the configuration
information with all the necessary
options so in this case I am configuring
the routing URL to be something like
this and it has to download this content
associated with the respective
controller and you will be defining the
controller bit later and finally once we
are actually switching to that state we
are actually downloading that
information that is the template which
will be turned into a view and that view
needs to be injected into a certain
location as part of your HTML page so in
this case I might be defining an HTML
element called do which is having a
particular attribute called a UI view
this is very similar to ng router
related ng view so in the case of ng
router you are going to use ng view but
in the case of your router you are going
to use UI Bo and you can have multiple
UI views are even nested UI views we are
going to cover all those advanced search
scenarios bit later so let us jump into
our project okay this is my app and
currently you can see it has got nothing
other than just only an angular JS file
and my a 0 1 dot J's which is something
like this which is totally empty
and you can say it has just instantiated
our angular module with no dependencies
at the moment so the first thing is that
we need to have our UI router related
javascript file to be included as part
of my application so for that I am going
to quickly jump on to angularjs you are
outer CDN and most likely you should be
able to find as part of the first hit
itself and here you go I get this so I
just select this copy it and go back
here and create a new script tag and as
far as this script I am going to specify
source equals that particular file right
there so in that way you are going to
include angularjs related UI router so
make sure that you have to have you our
outer but not really the ng route which
we have discussed earlier and the next
thing is that we need to jump to our
application that is our JavaScript file
here and as I mentioned we need to have
the module dependency to be based on our
you are outer that's the first thing we
will have to do and now you can start
configuring our application regarding
the various states nothing but the
routes in general and we are going to
start with AB dat config here and as
part of this app dat config I am going
to specify state provider to be used as
mentioned so that is the first thing I
will be including and we are going to
include few more bit later but we will
start with state provider for now so as
part of this state provider the first
thing is that I would like to define a
state so I am going to say dollar state
provider dot state which means you are
going to create a new state and the
first thing you will have to provide as
part of the state is the state name so
in this case I am going to say something
like first message that is the state
name and all the options for your state
so in this case I do not have any
options but if you have any options
those need to be provided in the form of
an object and in this case I would like
to provide the options and the option in
this case is URL so that is the route
you
specifying the route as part of your
state so in this case I am saying that
if we actually go to this route that is
in the URL
there's the hash the URL so what should
happen I'm going to say whenever we are
trying to switch or activate this state
which is going to be in the form of this
URL it has to download some kind of
template so I'm going to say template
and provide some information here
something like strong you can provide hi
this is first message or something so
that is the simplest state configuration
at the moment and now in order to work
with this state I really need to switch
to the seawater that is to this state so
in order to switch to that one the first
thing is that we will have to have our
own anchor tag here that is important as
because we need to switch to that state
right so I am going to specify some
anchor tag and provide our has D wattles
that is first message so this slash
first message has to be in sync with
whatever you are defined here so I am
saying that whenever the user clicks on
this anchor tag this will go to this URL
and that URL will be actually displaying
this template or this information or
that is the content which is going to be
downloaded from the server if necessary
or from the client in order to get that
particular content into whatever the
specification you do as part of your
ng-view sorry UI view so as mentioned
this is the URL this is the content
which needs to be injected right in here
so let us see this is what k and of
course I need to provide some kind of a
message here so I am going to say first
message okay so I save everything and I
go back to my application and I am going
to specify a 0 1 so let me
plus f5 here f12 so I just wanted to
make sure that no errors are coming up
here and the moment I click on first
message we are now you can see the URL
has turned to hash slash first msg and
automatically it is trying to display
the template whatever we have provided
so let me remove this again put a
central under flash it let me clear
everything whatever I have in place go
to the elements and now you can see the
UI view currently is empty but the
moment I click on first message you are
going to see the same UI view element is
actually having the content which has
been downloaded from that respected
template and turned into the view and
injected right into our UI view related
element so that is the simplest state in
general so let us go to the next level
that is I would like to have some kind
of controllers and everything to be
associated with that and download some
content which is available in some
external file so in this case I would
like to go to some external file called
MSG 1 dot HTML which I am going to
create now and as part of this msg HTML
I am going to say some kind of message
like this is from M message 1 template
and I am going to as a display some kind
of values which are going to be coming
from our scope so a value and the value
of B we are supposed to be automatically
coming from the scope and now I have to
say like template URL so I am done with
that the next thing is that I will be
associating my controller so in this
case the controller name itself is MSG 1
you can provide any controller here and
now I have to create a controller
accordingly so I am going to specify AB
dat controller and the name of the
controller is going to be message 1 and
I would like to use scope as part of my
controller so I am going to inject my
scope into the function scope so as part
of this scope I am going to create a new
two new variables a
and be and these two are the variables
which are available in the scope need to
be automatically bound or data bound to
this view which is nothing but the
template URL you are specifying here so
you are saying that whenever the user
goes to this URL get the content from
this HTML page and go to this controller
create the scope and bind our particular
template with whatever the scope we have
in place so let us see if everything is
working fine so I go back here and I
just go to the root i refresh this just
in case and now I click on the message
and now you can see I have everything
downloaded that is a 10 and 20 so let us
go back here and also let us examine the
network so you can see we have
downloaded a 0 1 dot HTML and a 0
hundred GS and all the relative jQuery
bootstrap angular and everything else
but if you see clearly we have MS g1 dot
HTML which is not currently downloaded
at the moment so let me clear everything
here the moment I click on this you can
see angularjs is smart enough to know
that it has to actually download msg 1
dot HTML down the line and then get the
content out of it get it bound using the
controller and the scope and then render
it in the form of view by injecting that
right inside our UI view so now you can
say our UI view is actually having
whatever the content we download it
there and let us go back to network and
clear everything and if I click on first
message again without really refreshing
anything else you can see it is not
really downloading anything else because
that template as it has been downloaded
it has been cast by angularjs and is not
going to read download again so that is
the smartest enough angularjs in this
case ok let us take this to the next
level so that is imagine I would like to
have another state to be defined and in
this case I would like to have a
different route with a different
template and different controller
yes for that purpose I am going to have
one more state to be defined I just copy
this in this case and create another
state right here so just to keep things
in sync I just wanted to go to the next
line here so you can specify something
like second message and this is going to
be second message as well so that is the
URL and I would like to have a new
template to be created so in this case I
would like to duplicate this file and
call this one as message two and the
message two is going to have message to
template and I would like to have
different variables like C and D here
and this is going to be D and this is
going to be D as well so I close this
and this is message 1 I don't need this
so similarly it has to go to the
controller called message tool so I am
going to create one more controller just
like message 1 and call this one as
message 2 and I'm going to create two
different variables C and T and this is
going to be 30 and 40 so I created
another state called second message that
is important and in order to switch to
this state obviously I need to have one
more anchor tag and I am going to call
this on a second message in this case
and this is going to be called a second
message as well so just for our
understanding I just wanted to separate
that using some kind of pipe symbol here
just to make sure that these two anchor
tags are separated so you are going to
work with still only one uiview which is
going to hold only the content either
from this route or from this route so at
any one moment we are going to be on
only one route not both routes at the
moment now I go back to my application
here just plus refresh this and we are
going to say first message and second
message as well so you can also say we
are not downloading all the templates so
we just clear all of this I go in here
and click on first message you can see
it has downloaded at MSG one dot HTML
template and the moment I click on
second message you can see it is
actually downloading MSG to dot HTML and
which is nothing but C and D here and if
you go back to your elements and if you
see the
and of the uiview it has got the view
turned from the scope variables here so
again if I click on first message you
are going to see the UI view is
dynamically replacing whatever the
previous contact it has from second
message with the first message so again
you can click on second message which
actually replaces the message for in the
first by having from the second okay so
this is a simple example whatever we
have in place for the two states so let
us configure one more state for the
route so which means it's going to be
problematic for me to always replace
this and remove this and pressing enter
so I would like to have something like
route or home to be defined for that
purpose I am going to open one more
state and I am going to call this one as
route and whenever it comes to route I
would like to say it has to always
follow this route for the route so which
means if you go with just only slash it
is nothing but the route and in this
case I do not want any separate template
to be downloaded but instead I just
would like to have a simple message to
be displayed just like whatever we did
earlier and I am going to say you are at
route and I am going to say click
something else this is just a simple
message and I would like to have one
more URL sorry
anchor for that one and I am going to
say something like this for this one so
this is going to be just only hash and
slash and I'm going to call this one as
home in this case let's say this and the
moment I could click on this home it has
to automatically go to this route and
show this message so let us see if that
is working fine so I just press f5 here
and let me remove this whole thing and
let me refresh this so now you can say
have home first message and second
message so the moment I click on home
you can see it is actually going to hash
slash which
is going to have you are at the root so
that is the message we are going to see
in our UI view so you can see that is
the message and the moment I click on
first message you can see it is actually
replacing the content available in UI
view with our new messages so in that
way I can have some kind of route to be
provided there okay
so let us take this to the next level so
what happens if I actually provided some
route which is not available at all
so for example instead of second message
I would like to say some message and
like this and that route is not
available in our configurations I
provided some route something like this
and that information or that routing
configuration is not available in our
application so the user might be
confusing like if it is going to some
route but not really displaying any
message saying that it is invalid
content or 404s some kind of message
needs to be made available to the client
so in order to do that we really need to
have our particular configuration to be
supporting only the routes we specify
and it has to fall back to some other
route whenever the route is not found so
for that purpose you can define one more
state and we can call this state as
anything something like otherwise in
this case so if not loadout whatever the
name you would like to specify here so
in this case I can specify URL as any
other path which can be specified using
this predefined criteria so if there is
any other path which is not supporting
any of the top three then it has to
display a different message so I can say
something like this
so route not found of something like
that so no route available by clicking
on links something like this so let us
see if this is working so you can
provide any name here this is just the
state name and I go back here click home
just refresh and refresh and I am going
to go to some route which is not about
double and you can see it says no route
available try clicking on the links so I
can go back here and if I say something
else here and press ENTER you can see it
is still displaying the same message so
this is one way of configuring the state
for no route path but there are other
ways to do those as well so for example
you have URL route provider to be
included as well so that will be handy
whenever you would like to redirect to
an existing route where no route is
found so in this case let us imagine I
would like to include URL router
provider so this also comes as part of
UI dot router here so I am going to say
let me double check the spelling URL
router provider ok so I go in here I as
I injected I would like to make use of
it and of course I do not need this
anymore as because I am going to
configure it a different one so I just
wanted to close this and I am going to
say URL route provider dot otherwise so
this is a built-in method which says
that if no route is found then please go
to whatever the route you specify here
there is a routing URL so in this case
if no route is found whenever the user
is trying to switch then it actually
goes to this route and in this case this
route is nothing but this URL so which
means you are indirectly saying that
please switch to this route or to this
state so this is also possible so in
this case you are not going to get this
message but it will be automatically
redirecting to the route or home page if
no route is really found so let us go
back to home and refresh this I go to
second message and I provide something
here in press center and now you can see
that is automatically removed from the
URL and you are redirected to the route
route so that is one way of doing things
so you have both ways like you can
specify whatever the message you would
like to display whenever no route is
found or you can redirect to a
particular route whenever the route is
not found there is one more thing which
we need to introduce here that is you is
so till now we have been working with
just this routing mechanism that is I
just provide some anchor tag and have
some kind of routing to be provided here
and based on the route whatever you
specify here that is the hash D URL it
actually tries to get the respective
state it figures it out and finally gets
the template but let us imagine I would
like to directly use the name of the
state right inside the markup so which
means I am NOT going to be working with
the URL or the routing URL but instead
with the name of the state rather than
just the routing URL so in order to
achieve that I just wanted to comment
these two for now so I'm going to create
a new H off here and as part of this
anchor tag instead of H Raph there is a
new directive based attribute available
that is UI s so I can use this
particular attribute to actually provide
the name of the state in the form of a
function so in this case the first
message actually should go to this route
so let us go to that route there so you
can see this is the URL and the name of
the state is first message so all I have
to do is get that particular name here
and use it as a function now I can say
first message so let me save this I go
back here to refresh this and you can
see I still have first message here at
the moment I click on that it
automatically knows that once the state
name is provided it actually translates
that state name to the URL whatever you
have specified and that functionality is
available using UI s stuff and you is
ref is automatically made available
whenever you are including angular UI
router so you can use either of those
two ways either you can use the route
specification or you can just use you is
left with the name of the state followed
in the form of a function so you can use
either of these two so let me go even
with the second one that is going to be
second message here so in this case I am
going to have second message so I just
copy this and then I'm going to have
this one
this I'm going to change the second
message and probably a pipe character
here so that there will be some kind of
difference so I go back to home press f5
now you can see our first message and
second message so the moment I click on
first message it is jumping to the route
first msg and the moment I click on
second message it is actually jumping to
second message so you can a use either
of those two options either a chav or
you is rough but there are some better
advantages whenever you use you is stuff
which we are going to cover as part of
my next video ok now let us modify our
markup in such a way that it looks
something similar to a typical s.p.a
that is single page application and the
two with a header and probably a Left
panel and right panel and so on so I am
just going to comment all this stuff and
once I'm here I am going to start with a
new one altogether so let me start
completely with the new markup here
so the first thing I would like to have
a new row to be divided to be provided
in the form of the header so I just
maintain the first row as a header which
actually takes all the columns and this
is going to be column SM 12 and on top
of that I would like to call this one as
well and I just would like to call this
one as a header and I would like to have
something like home to be actually made
available as part of the header right
here and similarly I would like to have
one more row which actually contains my
body with both left panel and the right
panel together and from here I would
like to have something like first 3 to
be actually be part of left panel and I
am going to have one more day Oh
exclusively for the bottom sorry not the
bottom that is going to be the body so
this body actually takes the rest of the
space and that is where I would like
nine so that is it takes most of the
space that is two-thirds and at the same
time I would like to have DUI to be made
available as part of my body right here
so the body will be typically having my
uiview and as part of here the left
panel this is where is the left panel
where I would like to have these two
first message and second message links
to be made available and for that I am
going to start with the UL and the first
one is going to be Li and I can use this
one as my first link and similarly I am
going to have the second one as the
second message link and I go home and
press f5 and now you can see it has got
home and it has got URL
route click something else or whatever
and the moment I click on this first
message you can see I actually have that
message to be automatically brought to
the right side pad and immediately if I
click on second you can see even though
the route specifies that it is moving to
a different URL but instead it is
updating only this body as you know we
are not actually if you look into our
network let me clear everything so if I
click on first message or the second
message we are actually doing some kind
of modification to our UI but none of
those modifications are really going
across the network because everything is
happening at the client side here so if
I actually get for the first flash page
and if I click on first message you can
see you are actually downloading only
the template which contains your a and B
and which gets bound to your controller
and the scope and finally displays as
part of your body here so your whole
page is not going to refresh but only
that particular part whatever you asked
it to refer and modify is going to be
reflected so similarly if I click on
second you can see the second template
is downloaded and modified only in that
area but not the whole web page so those
are the typical ways on how you can
really try to configure States and at
the same time on how you can use your
you is r FR h raff in order to go to the
respect to route or state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
