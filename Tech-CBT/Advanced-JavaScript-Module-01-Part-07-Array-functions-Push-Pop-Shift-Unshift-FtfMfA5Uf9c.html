look into a couple of most useful Eric
functions and those are push pop shift
and end shift so let us look at each of
these so imagine I have an array and I
have all of the respective values stored
in the respective numeric indexes and
there exists a function called push
which can be associated to work with any
of the areas also which means if you
have an array by default you already
have a method called push associated
with respect to that particular area so
you can always use this method as long
as that particular variable is of type
array and what this particular push
really does is something like it will be
adding an element and so which means
whenever you type a particular new value
here and calls push to the array all it
does is it is going to add a new memory
location here and in this example I can
say it is going to be add a one of four
that is going to be the next successive
location from the previous and that is
going to be the next index so that is
four and that four will be assigned with
this particular value all new value
which is going to be sitting in here so
similarly I also have another thing
called pop so pop essential will be
removing the last index related location
so which means the last index of that
particular array along with the value
will be removed from the memory so again
pop always removes the element from the
hand so which means only the last
element will be removed and none of the
others will be shifted or none of the
others will be touched so the next one
is shift so this is very similar to pop
except that this will be removing the
elements from the top so which means the
first location
will be removed and once this gets re
more that the rest of those particular
indexes will be adjusted to 0 1 2 so in
this case yes zero is going to be
removed the 1 becomes 0 2 becomes 1 &amp;amp; 3
becomes 2 so which means all of the
shuffling will be automatically
happening all of the shuffling will be
automatically happening that the moment
we actually shift so which means all of
those particular era locations will be
shift to the top once the main one is
been removed and similarly I have
unshipped
so unshipped is quite opposite to shift
and it is similar to pause so which
means it literally adds that particular
new element to the very top of that
particular area which means it always
adds a new element to the zeroth
location so whenever I say 0 the
location the rest need to be
automatically pushed down so which means
all the elements will be pushed down to
the new location so in this case the 0th
one will be pushed to 1 1 to 2 2 to 3
and 3 to 4 and as RF 0 becomes free
after pushing all of those down the new
location 0 will be having this new value
ok so let us have a demo for this one so
I'm going to add a new element a new
file here and they're going to call this
one a 0 7 and let us come up with some
UI first so I would like to start at the
table and instead of the table I would
like to have a TR and I would like to
have it TD and inside that either the
first one is nothing but a simple text a
central value
and on top of that I would like to have
another table do which will essentially
have an input and I'm going to call this
one has add a value for now so that is
the name of the input that is just a
textbox so I have to mention this
applies text so I have that and on top
of that I would like to have a couple of
buttons here to actually work with the
respective functions so in this case I
would like to start with button a dad
and a type equal to button and value
equal to something like push the text
value so this is just the caption and
have all up and clicking it I would like
to execute a function called do array
push so this is the function which needs
to be executed whenever I click on that
particular battle so similarly let me
have a couple more buttons so I would
like to have one more button and I would
like to call this one a something like
pop and let us call it as pop for now
and I don't need this it doesn't make
sense and I would like to have a
function with do added pop to be
executed similarly let me have another
button here and in this case I would
like to focus on us but an array and
shift and I think you've this one as a
stock is and this is going to test the
ants shift so which means I am going to
insert an element at the very top of the
array so I would like to say unsafe by
inserting this value and I would like to
execute and shift function so to add a
and shift function so similarly I am
going to have one more button
exclusively for shifting it so which
means I would like to remove from the
top
so this is going to be shift and it
doesn't make sense to include any of the
things here so I go in here and I would
like to call this honest shift for now
and okay so there ends our table so I
would like to have a HR tag then I'm
going to have a deal essentially to show
all the results on the count so in this
case I would like to show the count of
the area another break tag and another
deal which should contain array of items
so that is all I'm going to have for now
a UI so let us quickly check out the UI
to ensure that it is properly written
and there you go so I have the test box
here I can provide some value and the
moment I click on push it has to be me
all the elements available in the array
along with the counts right at this
location and similarly the respective
buttons need to be working so let us
start typing some scripts so the first
thing is that I need to start with
script here okay so I have the script
and I would like to define a simple
array here something like 10 and with
various types of values check 30 40 and
another string and a boolean so I can
have any kind of value inside an arrow
and now I would like to have a function
called display results so this is
responsible to display the count and all
the listing of elements available in the
array to be displayed inside these two
so that is the function so let me first
get the count so I can just add a turtle
and so in this case I get the array
learnt to be made available inside
and then I can get get element by ID and
I need to get the reference of this air
account so I'm going to use the same
thing here in order to get hold of that
element and then I'm going to say enough
HTML the number of items and so which
means I'm going to have the number of
elements of the added to be counted and
posted to an and the same n along with
this message is going to be made part of
that particular div so once that is done
the next one is I need to have all the
array elements to be made available as
part of air items so I just wanted to
list all of the error items into that
deal so let us get hold of that so into
a variable called error items and I
would like to say these get element by
ID and do that so in that way I hold the
reference of air that do so let us
remove everything available inside the
div so let us clear out the deal first
so I'm going to use the same variable
error items and as long as it has any of
the child nodes I would like to remove
each of them from the very bottom so I
can say remove child and the same do dot
last child so you can use first child or
last child here it doesn't matter as
long as you are removing a particular
shade from that particular array item
this is the one so I get hold of the any
of the nodes here in this case it is the
last node and just removing that one and
as long as the address has got any kind
of nodes all of those are going to be
removed so in that way I am clearing out
all of the nodes first prior to adding
new nodes to the same do and now I'm
going to have a new variable I and which
will be going through n
just nothing with the number of elements
available in the area so this is the
loop which is going to be responsible to
add all of the elements to this deal so
but that work was let us start creating
new do and I can use document create
element and I can say do in this case so
get the two I hold the difference of
Mewtwo into this new do and now I can
say new do the content which is nothing
but in our HTML and I would like this by
each and every thing the first thing is
I would like to display the position on
which I am working so that is nothing
but the index the index of the area so
essentially the index is going to be
available in I and I am showing the
index first and next I would like to
show the item so in this case I can say
item players so I can say in I plus one
to string so index is actually static
with 0 but the item position are say the
position starts with index but it is
index 0 so which means the first item is
going to be index 0 but in theory that
is the first item so I would like to
display item number which is essentially
nothing but the position plus 1 so we
treat the first position as 0
technically but when the user sees it
the 0th one is nothing but the first one
so after that I would like to have more
things to be added I turn something like
1 of N or something so that 10 is going
to be number of elements available so I
can say this item one of 10 elements is
nothing but I so nothing but air one
I get the complete information about
that particular element in one way or
another so after that I need to add that
for Tudor era items so I need to add
this new do as a child to this any any
other items so I can say dark happen
child and the new do whatever I have
created is going to be added to this
deal which is nothing but our main div
so new do is going to be added as a
child to the manger and this is all
about the displaying of error results
and now we need to work on a hairy
post-op and so on sorry push pop and so
on so let us start with function
function do a array push so inside the
day our approach I can say document dot
get element by ID so I need to get hold
of this text box so I use that and then
I get the value out of it so once I get
the value available in there in the text
box I need to actually push that into
the array so I use an array that push
and the value which needs to be post is
nothing but V where V is nothing but
something from text box and now once it
is pushed all I had to say is please
refresh the results so that actually
adds everything to the results which
means refreshes the content so similarly
I can have it pop so I didn't have
another function to pop so inside this
again I am going to get the reference
out of the text box
so they flood the popping up I don't
need it icebox all I have to do is just
pop it so I can say something like
peridot pop and I can say this platter
deserves that's it so which means I'm
going to remove an element from the
bottom and then just display the results
similarly I can have something like do
array and shift and this is similar to
push except that that will be added from
the very front that is at the very top
of the array so instead of push I'm
going to say and shift so after that I
would like to actually display all the
results so this is going to be a small
case later so I have the unchipped
working fine so next I need to have the
shift which is going to be very similar
to pop and I am going to say this on us
sure
and this is going to be shift 2 and in
that way I have display our results so
that should be taking care of everything
and ok let us see whether it is working
or not
so let me collapse this for a second so
let us go in here okay by default it
doesn't show any of the elements so we
need to fix that but on top of that if I
add a new element called 4 5 6 7 and
pushed to the IRA and now you can see
these are all the existing elements in
the array and the new value has been
pushed as the last item so we have 7
elements and the index starts from 0 but
the first element of 7 elements is 10
the second element of the 7 elements is
jag and so on so now let us add one more
and click push and now you can see it
has been turned to 8 all aides and the
new value right at the bottom so let us
fix the 1 whenever I go to the page I
need
to how all the aerial must be displayed
so for that purpose I can just add one
more line or window dot onload
so during window load I mean once
everything has been loaded just execute
this function so in that way I can
ensure that this particular function
gets executed the moment the entire HTML
and JavaScript has been loaded so entire
DOM is loaded so which will essentially
bring us the list of all the errors
sorry all the array elements to be
displayed so let us work to achieve that
okay I did a mistake so that is not and
this is here so I am saying that onload
go to this function and then execute it
so you are actually passing the function
rather than asking it to execute then
and there itself so this is like you are
handing over this function to onload so
you are not asking the function to be
executed than earlier itself so that is
important so I go in here I'll check it
and there we go you have all of those
elements to be automatically displayed
and now again the moment I add something
that will be added at the bottom and the
more elements we add the more will be
added at the bottom and let us see if
pop is working so pop is supposed to be
removing from the bottom so I click on
that and now you can see the list is
being automatically updated accordingly
and if I wanted to test out something
unshipped unshifted something like it is
inserting at the very top again
adjusting each of those so I click on
there and now you can see this new item
has been added at this zeroth location
and the rest have been pushed it down so
similarly I go in here and I click on
shift and you can see that is being
added but still pop should be working to
be removing from the bottom but shift is
supposed to be removing from the top so
let us see if it is working and now
can say those particular elements are
being removed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
