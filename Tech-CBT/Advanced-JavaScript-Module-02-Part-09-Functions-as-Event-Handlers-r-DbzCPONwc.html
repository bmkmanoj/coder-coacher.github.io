to attach functions as event handlers so
let us start with the script so as part
of this script and the first thing I
would like to have is any function with
any name so in this case I would like to
call this one as attach event so before
attaching any kind of he won't let me
have a couple of UI elements so I would
like to call this a nice button Tammie
and type equal to button so I have the
button right there and I can have some
value something like you know this is
Tammy button click on the following
button to make it functional
so this is a particular button it has
some kind of beer caption but currently
I don't have any on click event no on
click event has been made available for
this so let me have another button in
the same fashion but I would like to
call this one
something like button 2 or whatever you
can just give any name and in this case
I would like to provide something like
attach an even now and on click I would
like to execute this particular function
called a taxi event so this function
name could be anything so it doesn't
need to be attached event it could be
just anything so what I'm saying here is
that so I am going to have two buttons
the first one is just as common button
which doesn't have any event associated
with that no one click but the second
button is already having an onclick
event here so which means the moment I
click on that particular button it is
going to execute this function and this
function is going to make this
particular button automatically enabled
with the respect to click event so I did
not provide a click event here but it is
going to be added dynamically at runtime
the moment I click on this button so let
us see how I can do that first of all I
need to get hold of this guy so button
time so what I would do varible button
down equal to the document dot get
element by ID and I can say button
timing for now so I got hold of this
particular button right in here and now
I am going to say button time
dot on click the occult of an anonymous
function so what I'm saying is that I
need to execute this anonymous function
the moment I click on this particular
button on this button so on click is the
event and this is the event handled
function so this is the handle of this
function is going to be the handler for
this event for this button so now I can
say alert hey functioning that's it
and now I can say button timing that
value which is nothing but this one this
is the dummy button or whatever I would
like to replace this caption the moment
I attach then event handler so for that
purpose I'm not me anymore so that is
just a very simple caption I have and
let us see how all of this works
together so I click on this so right now
the moment I click on this button it is
not going to work as because no event
handler is made available but the moment
I click on attach event now you can see
first of all the caption has been
changed that is I am NOT dummy anymore
but at the moment I click on this button
now it says hey I'm functioning so which
means you can dynamically assign any
particular function as an event handler
for the respective event for that
respect to UI element</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
