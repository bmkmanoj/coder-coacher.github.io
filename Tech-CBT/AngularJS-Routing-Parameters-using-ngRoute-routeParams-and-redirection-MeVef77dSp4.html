replace content in an existing page we
can make the content more dynamic by
sending data in the form of parameters
to the routing content in simple the
content which gets loaded through
routing may change based on the
parameters we sent in order to send
parameters we are routing we need to
inject and use dollar route parameters
object okay let's work through a couple
of examples so I have a simple example
here so right now you can see my markup
is actually importing angular and
angular route so which is actually
injected right here so I am using the NZ
route and I am also using route provider
here and currently the route provider is
configured for the route and with any
other route which has been not
configured so we have two basic things
which has been already discussed earlier
and on top of that I have some kind of
layout which looks something very
similar to an SP a so if you go back
here you can see this is how it is going
to look like the moment I am at the
route route okay so now that we have
some basic things there I would like to
add a couple of links here and
demonstrate on how the routing
parameters are going to work okay I
would like to add a couple of links here
so the first thing I would like to have
something like some and I would like to
perform the sum using some URL based
approach so all I would like to say is I
would like to have some of values 10 and
20 so which means anytime I click on
this particular link that is some URL
which is going to be shown something
like some URL s caption so right now if
I go back here and press refresh you are
going to see that particular link so
this link would actually go to this
route so that is some URL with two
parameter values that is 10 and 20 right
now I hard-coded it like 10 and 20 we
can change them and we are going to see
that example which later
but for now let us consider from this
URL that is from this route some URL
I would like to extract these two values
out of those two and how those values to
be actually used as part of our angular
JS functionality and then calculate
something and return the content out as
part of our routing so now that we have
10 a 20 right here we need to modify our
routing so that it actually accepts this
route so I go in here and add a new
route so probably I can add at the very
top and I would like to call this one as
some URL it has to be the same name so I
am going to use copy and paste here and
next on top of that I have two values 10
and 20 right here so I would like to
have these two to be automatically
captured into two different variables
like a and B or M and n P and Q whatever
you would like to have there so I would
like to take this ten into a variable a
and this value 20 into a BB so I go in
here and I just say a and B so this is
the convention so whenever you have the
prefix as : it says that it is really
available which should actually extract
that particular value out of the URL and
assign to itself so now a is going to
have 10 and B is going to have 20
automatically so once we are there so
that is we are trying to still configure
this route so I am going to have the
route options to be provided here so in
this case I would like to go with a
different template so that the template
I am going to call it as some URL dot
HTML and and I would like to have that
template to be actually bound to a
particular controller so I would like to
call that one as some URL s 1 so let us
make sure this is the same thing here
and now I would like to have the some
URL to be actually created so for that I
need to create simple
some URL dot HTML file so in this HTML
file I am going to have a new deal with
the values a and B and at the same time
I would like to have B as well so I just
would like to display what are the
values of a and B which might have been
captured as part of the routing so this
is just the template we still need to
actually place these two values like a
and B to the scope variable so in order
to achieve that we actually need to
declare a controller and that particular
controller as mentioned earlier it has
to be with the same name as the some URL
so I am going to define a new controller
so the name of the controller is going
to be some URL and I need to specify all
the necessary parameters so in this case
I would like to inject scope first why
because I would like to use scope and
here is the main thing in order to
extract those particular parameters
whatever you are going to provide as
part of your route URL we will be using
route params so this this is the service
which actually gives us the current
route related parameters so now I can
use my function definition and as part
of my function definition I can use
those two objects dollar scope and
dollar route parameters okay
so as part of this one what can I do
first of all we should understand like
this route parameters is an object which
contains each of those route related
parameters so in this case we have a and
B so a and B will be automatically made
available as members as part of this
object by angularjs framework so
whenever you say dollar route parameters
you have two members dot a dot B because
those two are our route related
parameters so you can access them
directly by just writing route params
dot a so you can just actually assign to
something like variable a or something
so similarly you can also do something
like this so in order to access this a
and B you are using route parameters
data a route parameters dot B and those
two values we are assigning to a and B
respectively and of course yes I would
like to use a and B directly inside our
template I would like to use the scope
variable instead so I am creating two
new members called scope dot a and scope
dot B so a and B are two new scope
members which will have the values of
those route parameters respectively and
we have the controller we have the
template and we have the routing setup
and let us see if this is working fine
so I go back here and let's refresh this
and click on this one so there you go so
we have the some URL you can see our URL
which has got 10 and 20 and those have
been extracted and automatically
displayed here so if I change this one
to something like 30 and say 40 press
ENTER you can see we are actually having
30 and 40 automatically displayed so
based on the Robie you are or whatever
you are going to specify here we are
able to extract those values out of the
URL and use in our scope and in our
controller and finally in our own
template so let us make it a bit more
functional so in this case I would like
to add something like
so I would like to say something like I
would like to have some to be calculator
for both of those so I would like to
hear how a and B so I just would like to
have a plus B so in this case yes those
are treated as strings by default we
might be having a concatenation so let
us see if that is the case I plus f5 and
now you can see it has actually
concatenated 30 and 40 so I need to
convert that those variables to parse
int or whatever but the other easiest
way is actually using something like
this which means we are doing some of
the medic operation and it knows that it
has to convert those two values
implicitly so let me refresh this now
you can see it has automatically
calculated 70 so if I delete or modify
those values now you can see it is
actually doing the sum based on whatever
the URL parameters we are providing here
okay so this is pretty much in simple
word about our routing parameters so let
us go to the next level of example that
is imagine I would like to provide two
different values in two different text
boxes so this might not be really very
ideal in every situation so we there are
quite a few situations where we would
like to provide the values from the user
interaction like the user provides a
couple of values and those values needs
to be captured and accepted from the
user and then go to the respect to route
URL and calculate based on those new
values so if such is the case the
important thing is that we need to get
the values from the user and go to the
route or change the URL with the new
value so how can we achieve that so let
me create a new sample for that one so
which means I am going to have a new URL
so in this case instead of calling it as
some URL just for our understanding I
would like to call this one as some
input so I am NOT going to specify what
this one is so it is just some input at
the moment with no route parameters so
which means I am NOT specifying
year out parameters at the moment so
instead of this URL I would like to have
this caption like some input so I'm
going to see a new one here that is just
some input okay so let me go home here
so this is how it is going to look like
okay now I have to define what is some
input so I go back to my JavaScript here
so inside with JavaScript I need to
specify cost of all the route so it will
be very similar to this one so the first
thing is that it will be some input so
let me copy and paste so this is going
to be my URL so that is the routing URL
and as I mentioned I am NOT going to use
any kind of routing parameters for this
case however I would like to have a new
HTML file to be defined and new
controller to be defined so this is
nothing but the template so I would like
to have a new template file to be
created and I would like to call this
one as some input as well and inside
this do I would like to have two
different text boxes to be created so I
would like to say a to be actually
having the value for member a so this is
the simplest way on how I can actually
get the information right from the user
in the form of a text box so once the
user types anything instance in this
text box it will be automatically
assigned to the scope member called a
using the two-way data binding and this
scope EI is automatically made available
throughout the current scope and the
current controller so I am going to have
another one to be declared just like a I
would like to call something like B here
and I am going to take B here as well
and I would like to have a new button to
be clicked by the user so that
the sum can be calculated once I hit
this button so I'm going to say ng-click
Abdul some so I'm going to call this
particular function called do sum which
is supposed to actually take back to our
sum URL which is already equipped with
those two values in the form of routing
URL so what I'm going to do is I am
going to take these two values from
these two text boxes and reroute to a
new route that is some URL which can
accept those two values so for that
purpose of course I need to have a new
controller to be defined in my
JavaScript so I would like to have the
same name as I mentioned earlier so I am
going to call it as same input
controller so that is going to be the
name and I need to define my function
here so I don't really need to use the
route parameters here I can just forget
this okay so initially if I would like
to have any kind of values to be
provided for a and B respectively I can
just provide something like 0 and 0 so
what this one does is it will have the
default values of a and B to be
initialized with zeros and those zeros
will be automatically appearing as part
of our text boxes so now let us consider
I am actually pressing f5 here and go to
some input now you can see a and B are
available with through text boxes with
the default values 0 and 0 and of course
I did not write any code for this one
yet but the goal is whenever I click on
some I need to pick these two values out
and go to this some URL route
automatically by placing those two
values and get the new result out so
that is my goal so in order to
accomplish that first of all we need to
change the URL of the browser which
means currently it is showing some input
it has to go back to our previous thing
something like some you are
so I need to change the browsers related
location that is the URL for that
purpose I need to inject another service
called location so I am going to use
this one and in order to have some kind
of string interpolation I would like to
use interpolate as well
so and again I need to use those two in
my function okay so now I need to define
the function so what is the function I
am actually supposed to invoke that is
do some so I'm going to define at the
scope level that is do some equal to
function so in this function I am going
to specify the URL first so that is I
have to switch to a new URL so we need
to specify the URL so for that purpose I
am going to calculate the URL here using
the string interpolation so that is I
have the interpolate here so I am going
to use the same variable and I need to
provide the route so in this case my
route is some URL so you can see I would
like to go to this some URL so that's
the same route and on top of that I
would like to have the values of a and B
to be automatically made available here
so in that way I can use my H string
interpolation to actually replace the
existing brace related is within value
of the a itself and similarly I can say
B as well okay and this interpolate it
has to work with the current scope so
that is what I am going to use you so
that is the URL so let us see if the URL
itself is correctly calculated or parsed
I mean interpolated so all I'm doing is
just would like to write URL to the
console.log and see if it is the way to
go so I just press f5 here okay so I'm
missing something so let us check add a
comma here
so I go I go home I place a five and now
I click on some input I provide
something like 44 55 and click calculate
sum now you can see how it has written a
order that is some URL 44 45 so this is
the one which needs to be placed right
here and that actually goes to that
route and brings the new content based
on the new parameters we already have so
the functionality is already existing
all we have to do is that we need to
redirect to that inter out so in order
to achieve that we will be using the
location so you can use something like
the location dot path to our URL so this
is the you are available I am using the
same variable here so the moment we do
this it actually replaces our particular
URL of the browser with this new URL so
let me go back here let us go home press
f5 and go to input let us provide
something like 67 78 and the moment I
click on click let's um you can see it
has automatically switched to this new
URL placing those new values and you can
also see how it has calculated the sum
based on the new values it has greatly
or similarly I can still go back to
input provide new values and like 55 and
66 and click on calculate sum which
actually returns the new content based
on the new parameters okay so this is
pretty much about how we can reroute to
an existing route based on some values
whatever we can capture from the user
and let us go to the next level that is
we can have some kinds of optional
parameters so let us see how we can
define optional parameters so in this
case whenever we define this a and B we
are saying that this a and B are
essential if you miss any of these two
it will be just simply thinking like it
has to go to otherwise because it does
not match with the routing whatever we
specify here and if any URL are the
route doesn't match it just simply goes
to this otherwise
this case so let us try without
providing 54 I'm in second parameter and
press ENTER now you can see it did not
do anything all it did was it just went
to our otherwise thing and said no
content available here click something
blah blah blah okay so what can I do now
in order to have some kind of default
well not the default values optional
values to be specified so in order to
specify the optional values all we
really need to use is a question mark
symbol so let me create another route so
that it can demonstrate so in this case
I would like to create a new route I'm a
new link in this case and I would like
to call something like some optionals
and this one I would like to call
something like some four so that is like
I am trying to provide four values in
order to do some so I would like to
provide all the values here so that is
like all the four values but I would
like to make a couple of those
particular parameters to be optional so
that is what I'm going to deal with so
for that I actually go back to my
JavaScript and add new route and the new
route is going to be some four and I
would like to have a new template new
controller to be created but for the
some four I would like to have four
parameters to be specified and out of
those four I would like to have two to
be optional so for that I would like to
say go with the a go with B C as the
third one and D as the last one so if
you specify like this you are saying
that all four are mandatory but the
moment I say question mark here those
particular parameters will be
automatically made optional so which
means you may or may not provide those
two values at all if you provide three
values the third will always be C it
doesn't go to D at all so if you need to
provide D you need to provide C as well
okay so in this case as mentioned
it has to have the some for to be
created so in order to have the some for
I would like to use whatever I already
have in place that is some you are also
I would like to duplicate this guy and
call it as some for dot html' and as
part of this I will be having couple
more values like C and D so I would like
to have C and D as well and I would like
to use the same kind of trick in order
to actually modify or say implicitly
convert our strings to numeric values so
this is supposed to be D okay so now
that we have everything in place no not
yet I miss the controller so I need to
have the controller to be defined so I
will be writing the curves very similar
to what we have in place that is some
URL so I just wanted to copy this and
this is going to be some four and just
like a and B I am going to have C and D
as well so this is going to be C this is
going to be C as well this is D and this
is D okay so this is how I'm actually
having ABCD defined with all the four
parameters where the last two are going
to be optional okay so I go back here so
let me go home and refresh it and we are
going to see some optionals and i click
on that and now you can see it has
actually calculated the sum of all of
those four values but imagine I am NOT
going to provide one value that is a
remor 30 now in this case the first is
treated is a B and the third is always
going to be C so press Enter and you can
see the D is somewhat nullified because
we did not provide that and 40 is
actually treated as a value for C and
still we can see that the sum is working
as usual and you can also remove the
last one because we said at least two or
necessary
and the moment you provided both of
those two you can see it was still able
to calculate based on the optional
parameters okay so those are the
optional parameters for the routing in
general and there is one important thing
which we need to learn about routing
parameters that is redirection so as
part of the redirection which we already
covered a bit in my previous video I
would like to add a new route so for
that route I would like to add in the
link and I would like to call this link
as actually we don't need a link so let
me let me remove this let me go back to
JavaScript and I would like to have a
new route to be defined so this route I
would like to call as calculate so all I
am going to call is calculate
however this calculate is going to be
having an option to be provided in the
form of a parameter so I would like to
call something like oh and two optional
values that is a and B so I have three
parameters which will be acceptable in
this case so I have three parameters
Oh a and B so let let us be a bit more
descriptive so I would like to call this
NS option so the goal is that if I
provide the option as sum then it has to
automatically redirect it to something
like some URL if I provide the option as
input then it has to go to this one so
how can we achieve that so which means
you are redirecting from one route to
another route based on the routing
parameters so this is not going to do
any functional part all it will be doing
is based on the parameters you send to
this route it is going to reroute to
some other existing route based on the
condition you specify here and for that
we are going to use redirect to
so I can say redirected function and
this function is going to receive the
parameters called params pad and search
so these three are automatically
provided by angularjs so before even
going for the functional part let us see
what are all those three and how we can
make use of those so I would like to
display all of those so the first one is
parameters so let us see what it is
doing in this case so I say this I go
back here press refresh okay I go home I
just refresh this so that the calculates
loaded so all I'm going to do is
calculate and in this case the first
option I would like to say is some and
some with 20 and 30 let us consider I
provided all those values and press
ENTER and now you can see it has given
an object which contains three members
and those three members are nothing but
our route parameters so if you go back
here you can see I have three route
parameters option a B so all those
theorem eaters have been made available
in the form of parameters object here so
those three values are immediately
available to your parameters so let us
see what is path and I think I can
simply click refresh here as because it
directly goes to the same route and now
you can see it is actually giving the
current route path so that is current
router URL which includes all the
parameters and all the routes
I mean route specification and we have
search so let us see what is search so
just press refresh here
there is nothing at the moment the
object is empty with no members
literally but let us consider if we
would like to provide some value simply
like P equal to 30 you can actually get
your particular object so let me do
something like this I would like to say
something like PQ equal to 40 for
example so this is usually called as
quarry string right so that particular
query string related information can be
easily extracted using this ODS
so this object contains all those query
string related parameters and for some
reason instead of calling it as coded
string they call it as search I don't
know the reason we can just follow that
so those are the three specifications we
can actually extract the information
directly from the parameters or using
the quarry string or you can directly
extract your self if you are very good
at string sub strings or whatever you
can use path as well but in this case I
am quite flexible with parameters so I
just use parameters for this one so I am
going to say if the parameters dot
option because I am using this
particular option I am just asking if
that option whatever the user is going
to provide it is equal to sum then I am
going to say please go to that
particular URL so that is returned to my
some URL so this is what I am going to
specify so let me go to this one so this
is the route I am going to specify that
is some URL however it needs two values
because you can say I have a and B so I
need to provide those two values and
those two values are anyway available
here through a and B which can be
retrieved using parameters so I am going
to say that I am start a - 0 so in this
case I do not need this but just to be
safe side in case if the users are not
providing the values in such is the case
I would like to mention that one as 0
and similarly I would like to have
another value which will be treated as B
in this case and I have to get a B for
that one right from a parameters so this
is going to be B so this B is extracted
and placed here and this a is extracted
and placed here finally this is the
route I am going to redirect whenever I
have the option to be specified as some
if not I can specify another route that
is if it is something like this so if
the user says input then all I'm going
to do is I am going to redirect to this
some input so I am going to say
a return to some input nothing much so
this some input doesn't have any route
parameter so I need to worry about
sending those two values so in fact the
user himself doesn't need to send those
two values the moment you we provide
input and if neither of those options
are the ones provided by the user then I
would like to simply redirect to the
root so this is a simple redirection
route whatever I have specified there is
no functional part here there is nothing
which is going to be displayed no
template no controller all it does is
simply it redirects to some other route
based on some condition and that
condition is also based on some kind of
route parameter you specify there so go
back here and now I don't need this so I
just put a center here okay let me click
home and let me refresh this so now I am
going to say calculate sum and let us
say some twenty and thirty the moment I
say that you can see it has immediately
redirected to some URL with those new
values so let us try again with
something different so instead of twenty
and thirty I go for some two hundred
three now you can see it has
automatically switched to the new route
URL by providing the values so if not I
can just say input so the moment I say
input you can see it actually switched
to some input directly from calculate so
now I can provide thirty four and forty
five and this will be working as usual
there is no functional difference here
so again I can just say calculate and if
you provide something which is not
available anywhere then it actually goes
back to the road sorry route route so
that is how you can actually use a
redirection and take advantage of the
route parameters as well so we have seen
various ways of providing the route
parameters that is directly from the URL
also in the form of optionals and even
in the redirections and on top of that
we can also access those particular
parameters right inside the controller
or inside the redirect as well
