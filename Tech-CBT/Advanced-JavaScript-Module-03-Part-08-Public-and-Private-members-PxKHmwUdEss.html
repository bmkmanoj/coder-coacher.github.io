members in JavaScript objects so
whenever you have any member proceeded
with this you are actually specifying
that that particular member is
accessible anywhere
which means beyond the object so those
particular members which are having this
which means whenever you specify this
just before the member those are
considered as public members so if you
see this constructor function I have
three members a name annual salary and
this method calculate annual salary as
well so these three are considered as
public members so whenever I say public
members these three members are
accessible and can be executed or
accessed by any particular environment
whenever I say environment as long as
you are on the same HTML document or on
the web document you are able to access
those three so which means these
particular members are not only
available and accessible here but also
available outside this particular scope
so that is called public member so those
numbers proceeded with this are
considered as public members and can be
accessed anywhere and we can have other
members like in this case a salary so
this is not preceded with this but
instead this is just declared with where
where means available available so
members with var are accessible only
within the object so which means this
particular variable salary is accessible
only within this scope so you can see
currently the salary is being accessed
as part of another member
so this member is already declared
inside this particular scope and that is
the reason this particular member can
access
those particular private variables
called seller in this case so in this
case this particular salary is preceded
with where instead of this so those
particular variables which are having
the preceding or the declaration with
var are considered as private members so
you essentially have two kinds of
members public and private members in
general so of course if with respect to
object-oriented stuff we can also have
the protected and so on but in this case
based on the Java scripts the defaults
interpretation we can consider that as
long as you have those members proceeded
with this they can be called as public
members and those members which are
declared the VAR inside the constructor
function only are considered as private
members so let us have a quick
demonstration on this one so let me take
to another file so let me create a new
file called 10 so in this case I would
like to have new script file a new
script to be added so in this case I
would like to have a construct function
EMP to be created so which will be
accepting two parameters employee name
and salary so this is going to have a
public member called a name which will
be initialized based on the value
provided here and similarly I can have
we are salary equal to V so in this case
this is private member as because this
is the variable which is having
proceeding with var so any variable
inside the construct function proceeded
with var is private so now I would like
to have one other thing called that this
annual salary for example equal to zero
point zero so for example in this case I
am saying that my member annual salary
is accessible everywhere and now let me
have a public method called calculate
salary calculate annual salary so it is
better to have all the methods starting
with small case according to the java
scripts naming conventions so this dot
annual salary equal to salary under 12
so you can see that this particular
private member is directly accessible
without specifying this at all I need
not specify this for this private
variable however for this one annual
salary this is actually preceded with
this and I need to use that so once I
have the respective constructor function
declared let us try to create an
instance out of that particular
constructor function so I would like to
say new EMP and I would like to say jag
with five thousand four hundred and now
I can say om P 1 dot calculate okay
start calculate self annual salary so
this is the method I am trying to
execute so once these two values are
assigned to these two those two are
going to be assigned to these two so
which means one public memory name will
have the name the private member will
have the salary but once I call
calculate annual salary this salary is
going to be multiplied and put into the
public variable called annual salary so
in this case this has to be kept on
later so let me change that to capital
letter and now let us just this the
directly writing way MP 1 dot annual
salary so that is a public member so you
can access it so before even calling
this let me call
even before executing the calculator
syllabic so in this case after creating
this which means after instantiating
this the annual seller is going to be
0.0 as because I am NOT executing
calculate annual salary whenever this
alert is being executed so it is
executed after this so which means this
has to display 0.0 but after calculating
annual salary the value of annual salary
becomes the value of salary whatever I
have provided here multiplied by 12 so
let us say this is working
okay so initially the annual salary is 0
and immediately the same annual salary
becomes 60 for 800 so that is how it is
but we are able to access a name annual
salary calculate annual salary so you
can see I am able to access annual
Celtic Here I am able to access
calculate annual self-refer let us try
to access salary directly from the
object so I would like to say Oh MP 1
dot salary so just let us see if this is
working fine for us so let me convert
these two for a second and all I'm
trying to accomplish here is I would
like to get the value of the value
available inside this member and that
particular member is the one I am trying
to access from that particular object so
I save this and I secure this and now
you can see it returns undefined as
because that is not supposed to be
accessible outside the scope but the
same thing if I modify this one with a
name which is a public member that is
going to give the value so you can see
the public member is returning the value
however the private member salary is not
giving the value or not accessible
outside of the scope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
