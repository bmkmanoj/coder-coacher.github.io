lecture series on machine learning on a
cloud services so till now we have
created one experiment on a micro
suppose you're a machine learning
platform so let's start our first step
for machine learning system design so
very first step will be a we require a
data so for databar pers Asura is
providing lot of different options like
you can enter data manually you can
import those data you can import the
unpack Gipp data
Plus apart from that there are lot of Cu
sample data set available for your
experiment and per purpose so let's try
to seize couple of one actually let's
see about simple breast cancer data so
creatures double click it will come here
ok so once you imported those data you
just need to run it or you need to
visualize it so it will automatically
download those data and it will create a
visualization for us ok so it has
downloaded the data for us so it has
given a very nice visualization for us
almost it has a three and eight total
columns the first one is actually class
weather 0 maybe for a mulignan or one is
for the benign class actually for the
breast cancer the second one is the age
let's try to see some more feature about
it so once you click any of the column
you will get the statistics related to
date particular features like a mean of
that particular column is 4.4 for in
that case median min max value deviation
or is there any missing value out of
that you can immediately get the
histogram even you can compare those
particular column with another column to
find the correlation that how much
correlated of one feature with another
feature it may have one that one feature
is completely dependent on another
feature so it won't contribute much in
your machine learning system design so
in that case you can even ignore
also
so in this way it has given a very nice
visualization stuff whatever data we
have important so this is the data which
already available inside the platform
let's try to input one more like a movie
to it let's try to visualize it okay it
is downloading okay it has given us like
a scrapping time when it has been
scrapped through which Twitter ID it has
tweeted which user idea of that twitter
has you tweeted this thing and about
Busan which movie it has to do it and
after that there is a rating part and
how many of that - it has been retweeted
so this is all about whatever the data's
were available inside the machine
learning let's try to see whether we can
import data externally or not so there
is one more module like enter data
manually okay
so if you just drag and drop it here or
you can double click here so see on the
right side there is a big text box it
has given and if they are telling us
that you can enter data manually like a
1 comma 2 comma 3 let's try to put very
random data some hypothetical data ok so
we have and after that we just need to
run it ok so it will generate the
visualization for us
okay see whatever the manual data we
have imported it has taken into account
the first column is always mean is one
and I have to put it very uniform kind
of data okay so this is all about
whatever the data's were available as a
sample data set inside the machine
learning goes to the platform P out data
entered data manually also let's try to
see what are the other ways like a1 is
one more is import data so you can do
the import data and if you double-click
on it
then a hell lot of options are available
on the right then something like if you
see you can import data from web URL so
it will be in HTTP place you can data
import data from your high o query so
once you click the ohio query it will
ask for very is your high servers or
Apache high o has been installed you
need to provide the user account and a
password so this will all situated on a
zero is another set of service only or a
SQL data set also from there you can
just simply write a database query
username password you can import it the
same way as your a table as your a blob
storage data freight provider and now
this all still they are telling that
it's a preview feature on promises SQL
visual let's try to do this web URL HTTP
n let's try to import some data from so
I already written one iris dataset URL
inter summary of this machine learning
experiment over so if you select this
web URL in this import data you can
provide this URL and make it like and
just Suren it so what it will do it will
download this data from this URL so once
you get this correct data has been
successfully imported and then we can go
for the actual
visualization of this data okay
it has successfully imported let's
visualize it okay so it has shown us
some number of columns like a total PI
column the fifth one is actual class
iris setosa and they are telling that
iris setosa is total 4p era course IDs
what is which one versatile versicolor
and the last one is virginica though all
the class having a total 50 different
samples so that is a call dear one given
this column 1 column 2 or name actually
it might be like a sample length sepal
written by talent and a title with we
may get this thing but before that let's
just visualize it so if you click on a
very first column you will get all
statistical information regarding to
that particular feature so if you
consider is a sample with the mean value
is 5 point 84 the median value is 5
point 8 the same base apple land is just
the 3.0 54 centimeter so this is all
about the different way you can import
those data inside the machine learning
Asura platform and you can visualize
those data in the next lecture we will
see how you can clean this data how you
can still plate tip design data and you
can apply different machine learning
algorithm for evaluation of this model
so that's it for this lecture friends I
