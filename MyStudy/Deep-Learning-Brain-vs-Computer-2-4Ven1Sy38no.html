similarity and the differences between
the brain and a computer so we are
trying to find from the last the one of
the lecture that are as a human we are
smarter than a computer or a computers
are faster than you and we have seen a
couple of difference in terms of memory
or even a multitasking capability how
brain and computers are made up of
different fundamental units so in this
lecture we are going to see about some
more differences and a similarity
between the brain and a computer so
let's try to compare in terms of logic
and analysis capability of brain and a
computer so if you see brain brains are
very slow in performing logical
calculation why does it so if you give
suppose brain of some kind of logical or
mathematical operation to perform any
our brain is much more smarter but it
will take huge amount of time if we if
you give supposed computer or same
amount same problem it will do it in a
very fast manner so suppose or if you
give brain a very long 100 digit number
cross hundred digit number for the
multiplication operation it will take a
huge amount of time anyhow human will
perform there is an erroneous result
also or will come but computers are very
fast and very based in terms of logical
analysis any kind of mathematical
operation ability now let's see about
the physical environment now what is the
physical environment mean so if we are
staying in this three dimension while
continuously we are acquiring new images
new speech signal or we get some kind of
touch signal lot of five sensors we ever
have so continuously we are acquiring to
signal inside our body and from our body
it will go to the brain so brains are
very good at examining or interpretation
of those signals but computers if you
give same signal to the computer
computers are very bad so
you so suppose some images or a speech
computer do not understand it will just
take it and it will store it but
computers are very bad at analysis of
those signals now in terms of energy
requirement brain always needs oxygen
sugar those kind of nutrition stuff to
keep the brain keep running but in case
of computer we have made computer which
require electricity to get it run let's
see in terms of information transmission
so every place are in a brain which is
called V as a special kind of cell
neuron which transmit information from
one place to another place the same way
in a computer we transmit information
for one place to another place through
the transistor so how that information
transfer transmission works through
which medium it will pass from once
geography to another geography in a
brain and a computer so in brain it just
transmitted through lot of different
kind of chemical signal and is so
complex until now we haven't decode
those what kind of signal and how this
intelligence has been emerged through
those kind of chemical transmission from
one place of the into another place of
it but in case of computer it transfers
through electricity so electron transfer
from one place to another place and
eventually it stores the data in a
memory and our soft reference on the top
of death and it will keep created
complexity and we have almost reached
from this electricity transmission from
one place to another place we have
almost created the self-driving car in
your Android or Windows the biggest
softer on a operating system on the
planet now let's the in terms of image
speech and touch signal if you provide
brain same signal to the brain and a
computer how both of this behaves so
brains are very excellent in analysis of
this image speech and test signal why
does this so suppose if we showed some
image to the very any human it will
automatically identify which person is
it or if you see
here suppose some other humans or some
other kind of sound it will
automatically identify which kind of
signals that exists so brains are very
excellent in analysis of email speech
and touch kind of signal but computers
are very bad if you view them it won't
identify anything it is difficult for
computer to recognize what is actually
there inside the that signal so if you
see give them speech or image signal it
won't tell that what are the persons are
involved in particular signal what kind
of environment in which this speech has
been spoken so it is very difficult for
a computer to get it interpret but right
now this deep learning technology has
come into picture and it is trying to
slowly slowly overcome this problem and
trying to put those kind of intelligence
into computer so if you see a google
photos or a google speech recognition
kind of software android speech
recognition it is trying to identify
what you are speaking of what is there
inside the image so slowly slowly in
computer also brain kind of imagination
or interpretation ability is trying to
image so this is all about the kind of
difference and kind of similarity
between brain and computer where brains
are there and slowly slowly computers
are approaching brain still we are a
million step far away from the brain
analysis capability with respect to
computer what we have right now so in
our last lecture in a very first light
of last lecture we asked one questions
about are we actually a smarter than the
computer are as a human we are smarter
than a computer computers are faster
than us so for me actually both of the
questions are almost right we are always
water than computer because we keep
analyzing data continuously at a very
anomalous and a ready
good way so that our survival become a
possible on this planet but in case of
computer computers are very faster but
they are actually kind of dumb machine
but slowly slowly computers are also
approaching those human-level
capabilities still very far so for me at
least computers are always much much
more part faster and it will remain
faster but humans are always smarter
than a computer I hope human will always
remain a smarter than a computer even
you computer becomes smartest will
become even more smartest in a computer
so I hope you enjoy listening this video
guys thank you guys for watching and if
you don't understand anything if you
want to me to explain some more thing
