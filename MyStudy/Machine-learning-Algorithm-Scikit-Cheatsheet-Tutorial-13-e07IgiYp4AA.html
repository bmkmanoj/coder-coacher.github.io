on machine learning video series so in
this tutorial we are going to see about
what are the different machine learning
algorithms are there so before diving
into what are the actual machine
learning algorithm has been implemented
inside this scikit-learn library we will
see about in designing the full machine
learning system where we have rich so
till now what we have seen is we have
seen the different data set available
inside the scikit-learn library
how did data has been organized what are
the different characteristics of those
data set we have imported those data set
with the help of scikit-learn like
library after that we learn we learned
about the numerical Python library which
is nothing but the area and matrix
manipulation library we did a couple of
tutorials on pandas that is a advance
data analysis library for the data
scientists so we have just imported this
data and we did some kind of small
pre-processing steps on the top of this
data now the actual interesting part
comes dead after this data how you will
apply this learning algorithm on the top
of this data so based on this data you
need to decide that what category of
machine learning system machine learning
algorithm you need to apply on this data
so this is the general practice that if
you have a kind of labels available for
the data you can apply some kind of
clustering you regression or
classification kind of algorithm so that
is a supervised way of learning in the
machine learning system if you have if
you have not available the data a label
it as the output of your individual
records
you can use any clustering on
unsupervised way of learning algorithm
if you our data available in a very high
dimensional space you can use kind of
dimensionality reduction related any
kind of algorithm and you can apply
machine learning algorithm our after
that so this as scale and library has
given some small cheat sheet that how
you should decide this algorithm so
let's try to understand this thing based
on whatever the input data set we have
available so what they are saying that
whole class of algorithm which is been
implemented inside this scale and
library they have divided into total
four categories one is the
classification algorithm other is the
regression algorithm there is one
clustering algorithm and dimensional
little reduction algorithm so this
classification and regression kind of
algorithm lies into supervised way of
learning the system clustering is lying
inside the unsupervised way of learning
the system and dimensionality reduction
is useful for if you have a data which
is a very very high dimensional space so
you can reduce those dimension of
individual records and you then you can
apply machine learning algorithm on the
top of it so let's begin what they are
saying that if you have a label data
available you can use this regression or
a classification kind of algorithm so
you want suppose the output value as a
continuous value you can use any kind of
regression algorithm which has been
implemented inside this a scale and
library like this linear regression or
non-linear regression as GD regression
as so regression and symbol regressions
are there there is SCR there Ridge
regression available so there is a whole
set of families of regression related
algorithm has been implemented inside
this SK learn library suppose if you
have however data and labels are
available the labels are very discreet
it is not continuous
then in that case you can use this new
based classification or kernel
approximation classification K nearest
neighbor classification algorithm or
linear SVC or this STD clasificado
this the name just doesn't make sense to
you but once we go through individual
algorithm and we apply those algorithm
on the top of data you will realize the
MN or potential of individual algorithm
suppose you have a data available but
you don't have a label associated with
any kind of data so in that case you can
how to go towards the unsupervised way
of learning
so this k-means clustering spectral
consume clustering GMM clustering means
if clustering mini-batch k-means
clustering kind of algorithm has been
implemented inside this SK learn library
and suppose you have the data which is a
very high dimensional space then we have
a Desai so map kernel approximation
spectral embedding and randomized PCA
this is the principal component analysis
technique you can apply on the top of
this data so that dimension of this data
has been reduced but the quality of data
still preserve on so this is a very
vague idea about how you should decide
about the machine learning algorithm
which are all implemented inside this
scikit-learn library we will see
individually all this algorithm and will
apply one by one to any different
different data set and we will see what
kind of accuracy and everything will let
you so apart from this whole class of
this algorithm there is a one very
famous class of algorithm which is not
implemented inside this scikit-learn
library and for that we we are going to
use Google's open source very famous
library tensorflow so another class of
very famous machine learning algorithm
is a neural network algorithm this is
another
class of families of machine learning
algorithm so neural network algorithm
has been implemented in a tensor flow so
we will go with this tensor for low
library once we came across this neural
network algorithm in the recent time
neural network become too much even hype
actually and in neural network algorithm
even out space the
current state-of-the-art technology into
any different machine learning algorithm
and among the neural net algorithm there
are a lot of like a hopeful Network
convolution neural network long
short-term convert noodle network and
there are whole families of algorithm
and which are very famous and all
current real world products they are
using this machine learning algorithm so
from now onwards I am dividing I will
start about the actual coding and I am
dividing whole families of algorithm
inside this five categories either
regression classification clustering
dimensionality reduction and neural
network algorithm so for each section we
will see at least three to four
different different algorithms and for
each algorithm we will apply the
different data set suitable data set
associated to apply on the top of that
algorithm on the top of this data so
this is all about the neural network
algorithm so we have seen about the we
have imported this data of you then the
pre-processing on the top of this data
if required now we know about this
algorithm we have done all
pre-processing steps programming related
which is bare minimum requirement for
this machine learning designing system
insert we have all the kind of resource
available to add our first machine
learning algorithm with the help of this
scikit-learn library so that's it for
this lecture from next lecture onwards
we will see about a 1-1 set of families
of algorithm I hope you enjoy listening
