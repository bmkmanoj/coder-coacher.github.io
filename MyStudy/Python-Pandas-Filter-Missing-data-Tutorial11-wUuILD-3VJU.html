series on data analysis with the help of
Python so in our last couple of videos
we have seen about how this data frame
object and a series object behaves
inside the find us Python library so in
this tutorial we are going to see about
them when you load huge amount of data
there may be a possibility that there is
a couple of or couple of percentage of
data may be a missing and those missing
data is something like a span while you
do for while you do further for further
analysis or you go for any kind of
machine learning algorithm
implementation on the top of data so it
is much for you to filter out those data
so in this tutorial we are going to see
about how you can filter this data which
is missing so for that purpose I have
already created this sample data set
framework does some of the dummy data's
I have created and will apply this
filtering process on the top of this
data so let's start with the very first
data set which is nothing but the series
data structure I have used before that
let's just import the pointers library
we will rename it to the PD so we can
reference every function in a panda's as
a PD and there are a lot of plays I have
written actually and an NP dot n end it
is nothing but the not a number or a
missing value so this is the special
symbols are it is available inside this
numerical Python library numpy so we'll
import that library also so we can
reference n P dot n n has a not a number
value just to signify a special symbol
to signify that it's not a number
so we'll import numpy as an MP u okay so
we have imported this pandas library and
a number now let's create this dataset
and let's sprint so this is the series
data structure where Hyoyeon of value
like a first one is a one then not a
number and then four by another number
and a six
so let's print it okay so it has printed
this D type it is a floating value and
this is based on that in different
instants of time these values are
occurring this series data structure we
will see more into our future lecture so
basic common example of this series data
structure is nothing but the data you
are observing at various instants of
time about the weather condition or
various instants of time about the stock
market whether individuals talk going up
or down based on the different instants
of time so you can analog those data
with this kind of example now let's see
we have seen that out of this total six
values in this in this series data
structure there are two values which is
not a number that's why we have saved
racially defined this n n with the help
of this numpy library now suppose we
want to drop this two number which is
not a number because that is something
like a spam for us actually it's a
missing value how we can drop this value
so inside this CDs data structure we can
apply the drop any value so drop any is
nothing but drop not a number value
which all you just drop it so let's
apply this so it has given us the four
values only the first value is 1 the
first index value which is not a number
so it has dropped indexing is still
preserved so 0 2 3 and a 5 so first
value first indexing first and a 4th
indexing is not a number so it has
dropped it so this is about how you can
drop
this row level dropping in a series data
structure now let's see how you can do
the same thing in a they repeated data
frame object so I have created a sample
dummy data in a data frame object so
let's just import it and let's visualize
it how is that data so I have created
data which is having a total for records
an individual record is having a three
feature values so first row has all
three numeric value the second row has
of the first column is numeric value
remaining two values are missing it's
missing means not a number in a third
row all values are missing in a fourth
row first values missing then second is
and third is numerical value now suppose
we want to apply this drop and a
function on the top of it and let's see
what happens this drop any what it will
do okay so it has given as output only
one column a one row sorry the first row
which is five two point nine and eight
all remaining three column it are three
rows it has dropped so why it is well
white is doing all three rows it has
dropped because this drop and a function
works like if any of the at least one
value is missing across the whole record
it will just drop it but suppose we want
to apply some kind of argument on the
top of it
that you drop this if and only if all
values are not a number so in case of
this third record all values are none so
it will drop just those value only
remaining all record which is having at
least one value which is a numeric value
even if all remaining values are missing
it won't drop so let's see how we can do
it so we can apply
this data same of same function data one
drop any and we'll apply how is equal to
all so it will tell that you drop only
those record which is having a halt
value which are missing so let's see
what result it has given okay so it has
just dropped this record which is having
an index two so third row which is
having all value which is missing so it
has dropped remaining all value even if
it has a missing value it has not
dropped because we have given this as an
argument so this is all about the row
level dropping that individual on a row
we applied this decent drop not a number
function now let's try to apply this on
a column value so if you want to suppose
drops first column or a second column if
there are missing data how we can do it
so for that purpose I have already
created this data one object so let's
just bring this okay so data one till
now you are looking this data 1 data
frame object from the row point of view
now let's try to visualize from the
column point of view so across the
column every column has at least one
value is not a number so let's apply
this with respect to column now to apply
with respect to column you can use the
same functionality but you need to apply
one more argument which is nothing but
the axis axis is equal to 1 so X is
equal to 1 is this a it will drop the
data with respect to the column if you
don't give this argument by default its
row wise dropping so let's see what it
will result so it has dropped all the
column because in all the column it has
found it at least one
value is nothing now let's see we'll
apply this how wall with column so for
the column we'll write this X is equal
to 1 and how is equal to 1
so what it will do across all column it
will search for those column only which
is having all value will be not a number
or a missing value and it will drop in
but in our case all there is no column
which is having an all value will is
missing so it should not drop any value
okay so it has shown as all value that
means no value has been dropped so this
way just by providing one more argument
based on the axis is equal to 1 you can
drop the data at a column level if you
don't apply this argument by default
it's a row level and then axis will be
equal to 0 you can drop data at a row
level so this is all about how
you're filtering data across the all
rows or all column now suppose we if you
want to filter some of the cells based
on some threshold only so very subgroup
of rows and out of that subgroup also
there are a couple of columns only you
need to filter then how you can do it
based on some filter because in this
case we have seen that either is just
this cut the full rows based on our all
records or all arguments that if every
record is missing uses this cut off old
rows or in if you don't provide any kind
of argument we have seen in our row
level stuff even if at least one value
is not a number it will just discard it
so in this case it has discarded all the
rows which is having at least one value
is missing now in this filter base
matter what we can do we can apply some
kind of threshold that at least if one
value is available you keep it if at
least two values are available you just
keep it or if all three values are
available at the row level you just keep
it otherwise just drop it so let's just
apply this which same we have a data one
and we'll apply threshold so it's a tres
so Trust is equal to one let's apply one
and let's see what result it will come
so if you haven't provided the X is
equal to 1 or 0 so by default it's 0 so
it's the row level filtering it will do
and I sold is equal to 1 so we have
provided threshold is equal to 1 so it
has filtered it has kept all those
column which is having at least one
value is a numerical value which is
available so first record has all three
value the second record has at least one
value the third record has also two
values which is available so all those
record it has written which record has
at least one value it is available at a
row level now let's apply the same one
with different okay so it has filtered
another one more record from us so it
has written all those record which is
having at least two values are available
so the first record has all three values
are available and this last record is a
- value the intermediate two record has
a only one record is having one value so
it we has discarded it and one record
which is having all values are missing
so it has discarded
so in this way you can filter based on
rows or column or individual cell level
once you discard or a filter all those
data you can go for a further processing
which is nothing but the clean data so
in this tutorial we have seen that how
we can discard this data how can can
filter this data in a future lecture
future video tutorial we'll see if
suppose want to fill this data with some
of the value these data's are missing
suppose we want to provide some default
value we'll see into next lecture so
thank you guys for watching I hope you
