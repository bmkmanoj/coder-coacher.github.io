important question what is collaborative
filtering and what is contained based
filtering so first of all these two type
of technique filtering information
filtering system so this is related to
one kind of a recommendation system
technical so let us try to understand
both the things let us try to understand
first information filtering then we will
go towards the individually how the
collaborative filtering will be
different from the tenth in based
filtering so this is one kind of
recommendation system technique let's
see about the Google search first Google
has a index already of millions of web
page but when we are typing any
particular query it will just give you a
top ten results or a top ten best result
with respect to whatever the query has
been given so it is trying to filter
that particular put top ten result or
top 10 web page based on your query out
of millions or even billions of web
pages corresponding to your theory so
that is nothing but Google is trying to
filtering those information which is
needed by the user let's see another one
more example like a Amazon Amazon
product recommendation system on Amazon
many of you might have shopping number
of times so when you search for a
particular query manager already have a
millions of products on the catalogue
but based on your carry it will just
give you very best product which is
suitable to your particular query or it
will just suggest you only those
products which are might be interesting
or even if you are searching for
particular products on a sidebar it will
give you recommendation that if you are
searching for this product you might
like this product also so
this way Amazon is trying to filtering
all those product catalogs out of the
millions of our product so it is nothing
but a information filtering system now
let's see individually that what is
collaborative filtering and contained
based filtering so let's see first the
collaborative filtering and another is a
content-based now
for giving this recommendation there are
two type of technique one can use and
that one is the collaborative filtering
and one is the other is a pentane based
filtering one can use even a hybrid
combination of partially collaborative
and a content-based so let's try to
understand the very basic differences
between the collaborative Hilden what is
the collaboration collaboration means
you are not individually just taking
decision every single person's disease
and combined it will take decision for
someone else in this way the
collaboration happen and collaboration
eventually generate the intelligence so
that is nothing but intelligent system
will be emerged so collaboration let's
say for on amazon.com every single
person has bought Amazon already have a
data of the inner user that what are the
products or that particular user like
what are the product the other user like
based on that Amazon will create such a
matrix like user to user correlation
matrix user to user or relation metal
chain matrix now what is user to user
correlation matrix will do that
how much particular user is match with
another set of user so let's say person
1 or user 1 is highly related in terms
of their buying
habit other Phi user so Amazon can
recommend that particular user those
item which other five user has already
bought but that particular person one
has not bought so this way collaboration
happens based on the user liking pattern
Amazon will try to create how much one
particular user is related or how much
one particular users buying habit is
closely related to other user and based
on what other user has already bought in
their past your Amazon will give you a
recommendation to the our earlier the
user one that you haven't bought this
thing you might like this thing so this
way the collaboration between the
particular user will happen intelligence
will emerge and Amazon will give your
recommendation
so that is a user to user collaboration
that is nothing but the collaborative
base the filtering now this in this case
collaborative filtering we have seen
that we did this color position is the
user liking or user buying raw habit
based on the different products now in
case of content or we will make a matrix
of product to product matrix that how
much product to product how much
particular product is related to another
product let's say or if you like some
book then you might like some other
books also so if you have what this
product Amazon has already a matrix of
how much particular product is
correlated to different other products
so if you have like one product Amazon
will give you a product recommendation
for another product which are very
closely related to that particular
product which you already also Amazon
can give you a recommendation that this
product you might like so contain based
filtering means how much particular
product is related to another product
based on that this ecommerce site is
giving your recommendation whereas the
collaborative filtering means how much
particular
user is related to another user and
based on those matrix this ecommerce
site will give your recommendation so
that's it for this lecture friends so I
