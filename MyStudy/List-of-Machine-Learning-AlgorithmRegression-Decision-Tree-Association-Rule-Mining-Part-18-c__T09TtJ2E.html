tutorial inside the video lecture series
on machine learning so in the last
lecture we have seen about couple of
lists of machine learning algorithm so
we have divided this machine learning
algorithm with the help of two ways we
have seen learning style ways of machine
learning algorithm and a similarity
business in machine learning algorithm
so if we discuss about these two
supervised and unsupervised learning
algorithm that is nothing but a learning
style way of or you can divide whole
class of machine learning algorithm into
this two category now from this lecture
on what we are going to discuss this
individual similarity based algorithm so
in this lecture we are going to learn
about this decision tree algorithm
regression kind of algorithm or
Association rule mining algorithm and
now remaining all others similarity
based algorithm we are going to see into
the subsequent lecture so let's start
with the individual regression algorithm
so this is a supervised learning
algorithm unsupervised learning
algorithm in we have seen in the last
lecture so this is the regression
algorithm so the regression is a one
kind of similarity kind of group of
algorithm that is called the regression
so regression is nothing but it set one
type of supervised B of learning so
supervised B of learning means you have
been given a data plus you have been
given a label associated with individual
data also and you need to model those
data so this regression kind of
algorithm predictive continuous value
output or you can even predict the
probability of occurrence of individual
labels so let's take of an example like
a house price prediction so you have
been given this data set based on some
feature on a house and your job is to
find if you are given suppose the new
house data so your job is to predict
this value so that is nothing but the
raishin kind of linear regression kind
of algorithm this linear regression can
be a nonlinear form also so you can
model this data in a very straight line
format or either you can model it in a
curve format also that's up to you how
you want to model so this is kind of
linear or non-linear or kind of
regression so this family of algorithm
regression is helpful for the predicting
the continuous value there is an ax and
it can be helpful for from finding the
particular class also based on the
probability so it will tell us that
individual class this record is
occurring in individual class with this
much amount of probability so you can
decide that how much confidence score
for individual record is there for
individual classes so this type of
regression is called logistic regression
so this is about the regression kind of
algorithm so this linear regression
logistic regression or even non-linear
equation we are going to see into our
future lecture with machine learning
coding inside this scikit-learn library
and what are the available another
famous library of machine learning so
now let's move further this is entry
kind of algorithm so this is another
sets of algorithm which are helpful for
especially the classification kind of
phenomena occurring in machine learning
system so clap for the classification it
can classify either class inside the
binary classification or a multi class
even a classification so this kind of
decision three kind of algorithm will be
basically based on the decision taken
for classifying individual features so
something like you have been given a
huge set of feature and for the based on
the first feature so so let us take this
is the first feature so for first
feature you take some decision whether
you have to go into the left side or the
right side of this tree so there is none
that decision you classify another
effort oh and maybe have a tree
so whatever the decision you have been
taken and a half one side you again
further go for the classification based
on another feature I have to again you
decide what are the values of these f2
features and based on the classification
on the top on the basis of f2 feature
again you decide what are the possible
classes for them if you are decided
after E something value which is greater
than something or based on some
threshold you all land up into some of
this tree then you will follow this suit
once you reach to the very end of the
motherhood you will eventually get what
class the individual record belongs to
so this kind of algorithms are the
decision trees so based on individual
features one by one at individual
feature you take the decision and
eventually you are going towards the
landing what are the possible or what is
the possible class this testing sample
belongs to so for that I only stood some
couple of algorithm like God is id3
algorithm or C for point these are both
the variant of each other based on some
computational complexity of the features
based this is nothing at the training
and testing kind of so if you have been
given a training data this our model is
nothing but it will create this decision
tree that based on some feature you
decide where to go again based on some
other features you decide where to go
eventually pasted on this number of
decision you're taken at the very last
step you will reach to the conclusion
that this sample belongs to this
particular class so this type of
decision tree kind of algorithm will be
mainly useful for the classification
this three I have shown based on the two
classes either it can land of left or
right but it can be a multi-class
classification also so these are all the
decision tree
now another set of family of poor
algorithm based on the similarities the
Association rule learning so this kind
of algorithm free silly extract some
kind of rule out of your data so let's
concentrate on e-commerce kind of
website so in e-commerce website people
usually buy the products so in a one
transaction it may buy item 1 item 2 or
in another transaction some other user
will buy item 2 and 3 so this
association rule kind of algorithm will
be much more helpful for predicting or
modeling the you ecommerce users buyer
behave buying behavior that what kind of
buying behavior it is so this
concentrate on this part actually
suppose you are given individual
transactions and for each transaction
suppose user is buying item 1 and 2
together suppose some users buy item 2
and 4 together some are buying four and
five six together so what this
association rule kind of algorithm will
do
based on this data available it will try
to predict that if user buys one and two
it will try to predict it user all by
huge user is most likely to buy this
item three or so if user buys two and
four user is most likely to buy item two
also so this way all kind of rules will
be extracted based on the data available
or what are the transaction happens by
the individual customer on this
ecommerce website so for the Amazon or
any other e-commerce website they track
continuously date for individual
transaction what are the products I'm
buying and for each of this transaction
next time this ecommerce company kind of
company will try to predict with based
on this kind of Association rule kind of
algorithm that if you buy this
so product in a one transaction it is
more likely that you will buy these
another set of product also so this kind
of rule can be extracted with the help
of this priori algorithm or a clad
algorithms it both are the kind of
variants of each other both goals are
trying to achieve or extract this rule
out of this our training data set so
this family of algorithms are generally
called the Association rule learning and
e-commerce website generally use this
kind of learning so that's it for this
lecture friends in a future lecture we
will see about another similarity kind
of algorithm like a neural network
algorithm or unsupervised view of
learning algorithm like a clustering
algorithm or a deep learning algorithm
regularization based algorithm and all
those families of algorithm I hope you
