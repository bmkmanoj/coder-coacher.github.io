lecture series Anna ladies so in this
tutorial we are going to see about how
to install the Redis database
installation on a Linux Ubuntu so let's
start it if you have want to install the
Linux on the top of Linux this readies
database then we have a total two
different choice either you can download
the whole source code in this way and
then you can compile it locally and it
will create the binary and you can
install it on your Linux system there is
a one more option on your Ubuntu system
also available like you can directly use
this AB get functionality and install
ready server like this because it is by
default pre-configured right now I have
already installed is ready server so it
is saying that the ready server is
already installing its has a newest
version available on my machine so this
is one of the command you can use it for
your reduce installation and another one
way you can use it like compile in
source code so let's see how we can go
with compiling source code this thing so
on a ready site it is already given in a
QuickStart page how we can go ahead so
first one is the W gate and they have
given as this URL so it will just
download the complete source code in ur
target gzr file so let's just download
it okay so it has started downloading
after that will extract it with tar dot
xvj up command so it will just extra get
okay it has download it is just costing
around 1.5 megabytes okay so it has
successfully created the extracted file
and we have everything available in red
is stable folder so if you see this
ready stable folder whole source codes
are available after that they are
telling to use this make command so it
will actually compile the full source
code it will take little time and it
will create the binary for us after it
will create the binary we'll just move
those binary to the proper location and
sudo make install command will work for
us in that case
okay it's still running
you're still going on
okay it has successfully compiled as no
error till now so we can directly use
this sudo make install which will do
nothing but it will just copy your
generated binary throat is after this
compilation of this source code of
Tory's Reddy's database to the proper
location in a Linux so that while
running the ready server we can easily
use it okay so it has just cooperating
so we have successfully installed the
ready server now how we can check it
ready server is in store let's go to
another cell and there's a start
ready before that I want to show you
that how many of the executable starting
file this Redis has created in user
local okay so after installation Redis
is created almost this many startup file
for us the first one is the radix server
so if you want to start this Redis
server you can use this ready server
after that a readies benchmark is there
ready CLI ready CLI is nothing but you
want to connect your very thin client to
the ready server you can use it and
there are other also for the performance
related stuff and where the server is
running or not do you want to check for
different different purpose there are a
lot of other commands are let's just
start this ready server first of all
let's see whether we have successfully
install or not
ready okay so it is giving indication
that Redis is running on this three
point two point five or 64-bit its part
number is six three seven nine so on the
six three seven nine put it's running
and process ID is eight nine nine
so our ready server is successfully
running this is the logo of this Redis
Redis lab actually that is now how we
can fire the query to the Redis so we
can use this Redis CLI command let's go
to another window and let's fire this so
it will create a pop-up to small command
line for us okay so it is saying that we
are listening on this local oz 127 0 dot
0 dot 1 is localhost and on the port 6 3
7 9 Redis is running now you start
firing command and this is the server
which will start accepting the come on
so very first the ping command is
available which will tell us which will
tell where the server is connected to
the client or not so it is written as
form that means server is running so we
have successfully created this red is
servin installation and Ready's klein so
in the next tutorial we are going to see
about how we can store this key value
storage data set how we can retry you
what are the different command between
used to storage purpose you know that is
that has it so thank you guys for
watching I hope you enjoy listening this
