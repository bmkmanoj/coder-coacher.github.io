tutorial inside the video lecture series
on web scrapping with Python and a
beautiful soft library so in this
lecture we are going to see about the
regular expression uses inside how to
extract the individual tags so for
getting the individual tag there may be
a some common pattern associated with
many group of tags and there are some of
the parts will be a common and some of
the parts may be a variable so in this
lecture we are going to see about how we
can use this regular expression
functionality inside this beautiful surf
library to extract a similar kind of
element which may have a partial part
which is common and partial maybe a
variable based on some pattern so let's
start okay so we are going to use this
URL I have listed here so this is what
URL I have page now let's see the source
code of it so if you concentrate on this
IMG tag here all IMG tag I'll just
search it so it will display all the
text for you so you can visualize it
very well so there is a first IMG tag
second IMG third fourth IMG so you can
find there is a one common pattern
inside there so suppose we want to see
the source of this IMG tag which is
having this kind of pattern which is
having a source is equal to one step
back which is nothing but a dot dot in
your directory structure then IMG gives
an IMG one dot jpg so if you consider
all source there is only till IMG
everything is common just after that the
image name I am G one two three four is
just changing after that against dot jpg
is common so with the help of regular
expression how you can extract this
particular
back or particular attribute of this tag
let's see so let's first import our URL
Lib and beautiful shop library will just
import from star okay
next input beautiful
okay so we have imported these two
library now let's pitch this our web
page first
so I have listed here the page URL then
we'll use the beautiful
and we will supply the HTML string and
the parser the parser we will use here
Alexson l parsers and we will assign it
to the DSL so till now all the process
we have done in earlier lecture also now
the task is to grab this individual
source attribute of all IMG tag which is
having some common pattern so in this
lecture we want extract all elements
based on the tag name or a class name or
attribute name but based on is some a
regular expression base pattern of this
source attribute of IMG
thank you okay so as usual we'll use the
find all function so we'll supply the
tag name so we'll tell that inside this
IMG tag whatever the source attribute is
available I will supply the common
pattern or the regular expression for
you so for all IMG tag which is having
this pattern pattern we will supply it
here right this is what pattern will
supply here so for pattern we'll use the
regular expression and regular
expression we need to import the library
so we'll important
and Ari has one matter compiled here we
can supply in this regular expression
now let's just copy paste this common
pattern which we need to extract okay
now what are the parts are common so
this many parts are common this much and
after one this much part is cool so
we'll keep it as it is the only thing we
need to do is this dot is nothing but
the special character so we have to ask
a bit and for escape we need to use this
backs lists but that this forward slash
is also special characters so we need to
use this backwards less before that IMG
is a common English character so this is
another backwards less gives is a green
common then this forward slash is again
will escape characters so we have to
obtain this backwards less before that I
am G is a common so till I am G
everything is common now instead of this
part we need to keep some variable stuff
so what we will do we will put the or 10
star so any number or any value any
string character it will accept inside
this 1 2 3 4 5 6 or whatever number of
IMG 1 IMG - I am z3m g4 and g5 texts are
they after that there is a one door so
we have to again escape it then jpg
remains the same so this way what this
function will do this function will find
all IMG tag which is having a source
attribute pattern which matches this
regular expression output so find just
all IMG element which is having
this pattern only have source attribute
pattern is this much it has to match
this pattern and let's assign it to
images okay now we got all element we
tell of this find all function of BS
reference Mia's is nothing but the
beautiful soap object
now let's iterate it and print it so it
will all I am image is tagged let's
print IMG either full tag or just the
source attribute okay
we haven't applied here the source
attribute on which we need to apply this
regular expression so we have to go with
that way the same way we were are
applying and those ID tags or based on
ID we were selecting all based on class
we were selecting all those thing so SRC
in a curly braces we need to supply this
okay so what we did actually for all IMG
tag you just first search for all the
sources of data in detail the IMG tag
which matches this regular expression
and this regular expression will return
all the value which is having this match
common tags and this part only variable
dot star okay so everything is I think
over let's try to print again let's see
what happens
okay so we got it successfully so it has
printed all source attribute or IMG tag
which matches this regular expression so
that is all matches with our source code
of HTML or so okay so in this way we can
use this regular expression inside to
get the similar kind of pattern for
individual element you cannot you should
not do it one by one every
my means every element so this way you
can take advantage of regular expression
so it has printing ng1 ng2 ng3 four and
six okay so this is also matching with
our results okay thank you guys for the
watching I hope you enjoy listening to
