lecture series on data analysis with
help of Python so in this tutorial we
are going to see about how you can
perform different arithmetic operation
on a data frame object Anna sees objects
so first we'll see about how you can add
different a CDS data then we'll see for
how data frame object you can add and
then we'll perform an addition on a one
data frame object and one is on a series
object so for all of this example I have
already created a sample data set in all
the three cases so let's start with the
series data addition that how you can
add two different series with different
index value so I have done unnecessary
imports for us import pandas is a PD so
I have created the two data series s1
and s2 each is having one is having a
four values another is a five value all
values are of float value between minus
10 to 10 range and but that indexing
value in a both the cases is different
so our objective is to see when you add
this two data series or check what is
the possible output so let's just
execute this as 1 and s2 first and let's
print it okay I haven't executed this
import statement that's why it has given
error okay so it has successfully
executed this s1 and s2 let's just print
s 1 and s Q okay so we have a DC AE
so that is nothing but the indexing of
s1 series one point two minus six point
seven two point four one point 59 and
all values are floating point 64 bit
value let's just printer as two also
okay now suppose we want to perform the
arithmetic or addition of these two
series what is the possible output that
we need to officer so how to find us
series or any kind of arithmetic
operation
who works based on the indexing value it
just add or whatever the performs we
give commands to do it actually so let's
just put s 1 plus s 2 and let's observe
the output so it has given a one point
to the indexing value a so it will
search for indexing a in s 1 and
indexing value index with a minus one
point two in s 2 I so so in our first
case two point for any the SEC s 2 it is
a value is minus one point to having
indexing well indexing is equal to a so
we just perform addition on the basis of
indexing so for the a it is a one point
two because two point four minus one
point two is equal to one point two in
case of C also it does the same thing
minus six point seven plus minus two
point three so it's a nine point zero
but in case of this D indexing so these
B data I mean the indexing having a
value B it is available in s1 which is
one point two
but in case of s2 there is no D is
available so it has the written as n n
which is a special number it is a not a
number so whenever there is no value is
available it just compute not a number
or remove it one computer
edition for that particular indexing
value now suppose we want forcefully
this for D also to compute the addition
or we can supply if there is no DS
available in case of this s2 so we can
fill the missing value also so how you
can perform this missing value let's see
so for that we can perform addition
operation on the top of s1 and we can
supplied our human as two with one more
argument is fill value so wherever there
is no value is available it just append
a value 0 and it will perform the
addition so
for all of the indexing value like a a
cdefg
we will get at least one value there is
no not a number possibility in this case
okay so it has the returners almost all
value let's just observe for the D which
is not a number in our earlier case but
in this case we have got the one point
two now let's see how this one point two
has arrived so in case of s1 the Bell
indexing having a deal the value is one
point two but in case of s2 there is no
D available so it has upended the value
0 so 1 point 2 plus 0 is nothing but 1
point 2 so that's why it has given us 1
point 2 so that's how this Addison and
say similar way you can apply the
subtraction multiplication in a division
operation point by point or a number by
number element by element you can
perform it based on the indexing so this
is the add addition we have perform on
series data structure now let's perform
this addition on a data frame object so
I have created the two data frame object
I have taken a number series a range
function and I have reshaped to the 3
comma tree matrix in a first data frame
object and given column name ABC in a
second case there are 212 values I have
generated and it has reshaped to the 4
comma 3 matrix but in the second case
the column name is ect now let's see how
arithmetic we can perform on top of
return ok I have successfully executed
this one now let's see how this DF 1
plus DF 2 will come okay before DF 1 to
DF 2 let's just print DF 1
okay but the things together doesn't
look fine
so let's print it one by one so now
let's apply the addition of DF 1 + DF 2
so you can observe that a lot of number
which is an N so there is not a number
available so if you observe
let's take any one element like a a
column and third row so a column and a
third row it is nothing but six value in
the first case a column in a third row
this is 6 6 plus 6 is equal to 10 so
based on the similar indexing across the
row and across a column if the data is
available in a proper manner or a proper
value is available it will just add it
if the data is missing it will just it
won't calculate any addition or any
subscription operation on the top of it
and it will just throw the not a number
let's observe further mean deck Slough
widest hole bees not a number because b
is completely absent in a case of DF -
so whole B column is not a number in
similar way the d is not a number
because D is available in bf - but it is
not available in a DF one similar way
you can observe the fourth row hole
fourth row is an auto number because
fourth row is available in DF - but it
is not available in a DF one so that way
you can perform the addition now the
same way fill the missing value be
applied in a series data structure the
same thing we can apply on a data frame
data structure also so let's apply the
f1 dot
and will fill the missing value let's
fill this with zero so now we have got
almost all value still there is a one
value is a not a number so let's try to
observe that white is b3 so four through
and a beat column B column and a third
fourth go row so there is no fourth row
exists bit column even if X is so in a
first case it is Sal doesn't exist in a
second case beta itself doesn't exist so
there is no question of the fourth row
even so this is the only element which
doesn't exist in DF one definition also
in a DF to definition also that's why it
has given us not a number remaining all
value it has fill up with zero wherever
there is no value XE exists and it has
calculated the addition based on the
indexing and row number so that is how
the addition we have perform on a two
different data frame object now let's
see one more case and one more example
now will supply a will create one data
frame object and when a series object
that I have already created and then
will apply to addition on one data frame
of Jegan one sees object so let me just
execute this frame data frame object so
I have created for cross 3 matrix but
the value range from 0 to 12 I'm in 0 to
11 and all column has been given name
bde one more CD's object I have created
was value 0 1 2 and indexing is B D and
E though indexing remains same in a both
the keys the way I have created it so
let's just execute it and print it
so we'll get a better idea okay
so BD is the indexing and 0 to 11 values
are there
now series me de and zero one two okay
now let's perform addition on this frame
plus series okay so what should actually
happen in this case so for B we have a
value zero be having a value one so E is
having a value 2 and this is a one
dimensional object but this frame data
frame is a two dimensional object so
what it will do it will do this
calculation based on a row wise so for
the first row whose value is zero one
and two it will add zero one two if as
there is a indexing ulta same in a both
the keys for the second role so it will
perform the same addison because
individual row of this data frame object
you can consider as a one-dimensional
series object so let's see what will
happen okay so in each and every row it
has added 0 1 2 so 0 1 if you add 1 here
it will become 2 &amp;amp; 2 so it will remain
as a 4 same way for the second row it
has added 0 1 2 so 0 means 3 1 means 4
plus 1 5 &amp;amp; 2 mins 5 + 2 7 so we have got
the correct result so that is a row wise
addition it has been now suppose we want
to perform the addition on a column wise
so how we can do it so let's just
okay so same kind of results we have
observed with the help of this add
functionality also so that's it for this
