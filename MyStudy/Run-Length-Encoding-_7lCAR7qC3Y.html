lecture series on a computer science and
engineering related concepts so in this
tutorial we are going to see about the
run length encoding schema so run length
encoding is a kind of lossless
compression so let us first see what is
the lossless compression thing so in
lossless compression screen if you
provide suppose the input and two talk
encoding or encoder it will create some
kind of compress bit that is what our
desired data is and after that if you
pass this decoding it will exactly
produce the output which is same as
exactly input not even a single bit of
difference will occur so output is
exactly same as an input so there is no
single bit of data has been lost that is
why this this is called a lossless
compression in this tutorial run Lane
encoding is also one kind of lossless
compression so let us try to understand
that how this Run Lane encoding works
and how its decoding part will version
so let us try to observe our daily live
scenario suppose you have kept on some
website one password which is a 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 origin 0 0 0 or somewhere
around all are 0 online so suppose you
want to transfer this data to another
person but you will never tell that I
will do I have written a password like a
0 0 0 0 0
you always tell data I have my password
is something like a 18 0 or 20 0 if
already made all values are the almost
same so you are trying to extract the
redundancy available in a data so rather
than telling 0 0 0 0 almost 20 times you
just tell that my password is 20 times 0
and another person would just extract
those information from you or encoded
information from you it will decode it
and it will write is 0 20 times so
indirectly from actual 2002 have
compressed data to the 2
t0 only so that's how this comparison
work less like to see another example
suppose your mobile number like a four
six five four four four four one five
five so majority time we try to do
reduction while telling the number to
someone something like my phone number
is four six five then four times four
then one maybe double Phi or Phi 5 or 55
whatever but here actually majority
chunk of part or a substring which is
quite repeating in a nature so you
always try to avoid telling that four
four four four you always try to tell
that four times four that will be a
cleaner and much easier way you can
encode the information on a opposite
person so let's try to understand with
more example let's say we have a
something like our somewhere around this
squares and a oils triangles and again
oh now suppose we want to encode this
information with alpha brendlin encoding
so you transmit the first square then
the second square the third square
fourth fifth square then one over second
old first triangle second trainer rather
than that while are transferring you
encounter that the first square via
validity and code in or I have already
transmitted on other part where I need
to transmit them so rather than
transmitting the second one exactly same
as this one
I'll just tell that you use whatever I
have first transmitted and you recreate
after it or you can copy after in so
rather than transmitting this Phi square
differently what we can do that we can
transmit just the Phi square so for here
we have total fourteen symbol so
indirectly for transmitting or a storage
purpose we require fourteen different
places while encoding or a storage by it
is just the representation so rather
than that we can do one thing we can
instead of five different square we can
just store as a Phi n square in case of
all also two and a whole then four
triangle then a3 again old so you can
see that there is only one number which
is nothing but the run how many times
you are running ok sorry actually that
is a that is a number that is actually
run and this is actually length so this
is a length length is five first in
first case actually should be like a
square and then Phi I should have kept
it then o land square then the triangle
and four then hole entry but I have made
it rivers round so it becomes like a
lantern and coding but let us try to
understand this run length encoding so
this is a run total so run is nothing
but your Square and length is nothing
but the Phi again ran is o and length is
again two so for storage of this much
stuff you just require eight pieces of
information so almost out of fourteen
bit you just or eight bit and you almost
saved the six byte or six places of
information so that is how run line
encoding works now at a decoding time
when someone encounters that there is a
Phi and then square it at a decoding
time it will just recreate those Phi
exactly this same as this one so you do
not need to transfer the information or
the storage the information five
different times this square the one time
you said or one time you store this
information about the square and you
just tell that recreate it five times at
a decoding place that's how you are
saving the information let us try to
understand with another example
okay let's see we have suppose this much
big length of zeros and ones so first
one is somewhere around five zeroes and
then the six ones and again seven zeroes
a remaining or so total 30 bits of
informations are there so instead of
this 30 bit we can transfer it like a
Phi 0 's and then then a 7 ones then 8
zeros and a 10-1 times so all mod 8 p or
8 pieces of information only you're
storing or you are transmitting and from
these eight pieces of information you re
creating this 30 bits of information
like five zeros so instead of saving or
instead of storing this zero five times
you just tell that five times this zeros
are occurring so that is how the
compression system works so that's it
