important question what is symbolic here
and what is non symbolic AI so let us
try to understand this thing with one
very famous example of Chinese Searle
experiments a Searles Chinese room
experiment sorry so sir Searle is one of
the professor at I think UC Berkeley
University of California Berkeley Searle
Chinese room experiment so what is the
Chinese Searles Chinese room experiment
so Chinese room experiment is that there
is a one agent is sitting behind the
wall behind inside the room and from
that room inside the dead room either
machine will exist or either one human
use exists and the task is let's define
the task first of all and with respect
to this example we will try to
understand what is symbolic here and
what is non symbolic AI and we will try
to differentiate that what is the
different fundamental approaches behind
this symbolic way and a non symbol here
so task is to translate text from
English to Chinese so what is that
experiment is that all this is one of
the thought experiment the idea is that
you have one room and inside that one
room either machine exists or any human
is sitting we don't know what is that
and there is a one window from that you
supply the English textile statement and
that machine program which exists inside
that room or either human exists inside
that room it will translate this
sentence of English into a Chinese now
inside that room there might exist a lot
of knowledge related to English
statement and
lot of knowledge related to English
language and a Chinese language and
there is a mapping between individual
word which we say in English mapping to
corresponding word in a Chinese so the
idea is that it will just translate it
and a give give to us so that is nothing
but the symbology I so let us try to
differentiate with respect to this
example one is SIM symbolically I and
another is non symbolic I so let's say
we want to translate this tax from
English to Chinese with respect to
symbolically I approach so what we have
available we have a full room inside
that one machine program or a human
sorry actually it's disconnecting
okay we can continue when whom is there
and inside that one room one machine
program or a human exist we don't know
what is that actually and there is a
huge bunch of data related to English
language and a Chinese language is
available and a mapping from individual
word of English to Chinese is available
now we supply the English statement for
English tax to this room and inside that
whatever this machine program or humans
are available it will continuously scan
hold those taxes available in English
and corresponding tax is available in a
Chinese it will translate it and give us
so that is what the idea bi does
symbolic AI that you are trying to
represent everything in a symbolic form
all English language sentence all
English I knees language sentence and
it's mapping from corresponding word in
a English to the corresponding word in a
Chinese so you are trying to represent
everything a symbolic way and it will
just translate it but while translating
it has to scan through every single
English statement whatever the tax video
supplied based on that once it finds the
English statement it will try to find
the corresponding Chinese statement or a
Chinese word it will Club it and it will
give us but there is a might be
possibility of erroneous for translation
also might exist because it doesn't know
the context behind it what is the
intention behind this particular
sentence it is something like a lookup
table that is symbolic AI system
has a huge bunch of predetermined lookup
tables are available from English
divorce to the Chinese word and it will
just translate it now let's say we want
to solve this problem with the non
symbolic e I so we are not trying to
represent any particular English English
word to the Chinese word mapping or kind
of but the same way we have available
room we have another machine program
which will behave like a non symbolic e
I way or either human will exist so in
non symbolic e I what we try to do we
have all those English texts as an input
data or a Chinese text as the input
training data for us and a mapping
between English and Chinese we are
trying to lis present or we are trying
to model this system so when we supply
the new English statement to this
machine or to this non symbolic AI
system it just do not need to search or
scan through every single word or n will
be singles like liquid available in
English it just straight away translator
we just great away translate it and give
us so for that it's like a training plus
testing system that machine is trying to
or non symbology I kind of system is
trying to understand that what English
statement is world Chinese statement E
and it is trying to understand the
differences between English and a
Chinese so whenever the new English
statement is available it just straight
away class let ik and it will give us so
that is nothing but a non symbolic AI
system neural network regression
classification kind of algorithm and
then the regression kind of machine
learning algorithm lives in a non
symbolic AI kind of system that it will
try to take the input data as a training
it will build the model and when the new
data will come it will apply those new
data on to this particular model and it
just straight of it translated while in
case of symbolically it has a huge
knowledge base and it just tries to map
from one English word to the another
English word and it will form the
translation so we are not trying to
represent anything in a symbolic way in
a non symbolic key I whereas in a
symbolic it is just kind of a lookup
table so that's the basic difference
between a symbolic here in a non
symbolic AI system I hope you understand
about the symbolic here and a non
symbolic height differences if you have
known any more example just write down
into comment and we'll try to explore
more about how you can look at the same
system or you can approach the
artificial intelligence system from the
symbolic key I approach on a non
symbolic key I approach I hope you enjoy
