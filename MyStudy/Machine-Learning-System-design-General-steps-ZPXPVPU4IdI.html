lecture series on machine learning
inside the cloud how we can you deploy
the machine learning service in a cloud
so before starting how we can use this
module Microsoft Azure machine learning
platform let's try to understand what
are the general steps are involved in
designing the machine learning system so
in this tutorial we are going to learn
about those abstract stuff and in a
future lecture we all try to connect
this all step and how we can perform
this all step on a microscope Azure a
machine learning studio platform and we
can accomplish our machine learning
system design to us so very first one is
like a collect data how we can collect
data either you have a collect data in a
number of different way either it is
available in your local try you or it
will be available somewhere it is hosted
on a some other domain or it will be
available in some big data format kind
of Hadoop or SQL level or database or
MongoDB level file system so in this way
you can collect data let's see next step
then you require this some kind of
pre-processing kind of set so it may
happen that there are some of the
attributes or some of the things
associated with data which is not going
to be very useful for your purpose so
you require some kind of pre-processing
because normally those data is
uncomplete lis unclaimed so this is a
pre-processing kind of steps then you
require some kind of cleaning of data so
it may happen that there are some of the
attributes or some of the records of
this data are missing our some of the
attributes are not very meaningful in
machine learning system design so you
can discard those attribute completely
or you can discard some of the missing
record inside the data that is what the
cleaning of data for each of those step
what I am describing here a lot of
different algorithms and lot of
different small modules are available in
this as a platform of machine learning
then you require to splitting this data
while you are doing those experiments so
you what
splitting of data is randomly you can
divide those data in some 60/40 or 7525
format so some of the part you can use
for the training purpose and later part
you can use for the testing purpose
those kind of models are also available
in a machine learning platform then you
decide about the machine learning actual
algorithm so whatever the clean data
you've got after the splitting you
decide the machine learning algorithm
and you apply on the top of it so it
depends on your data and what kind of
output you want what kind of result you
you are trying to accomplish either you
can decide whether it's supervised or
unsupervised learning kind of
functionality then you can decide on
whether you want to apply a regression
or a classification kind of algorithm so
it's all depend on deciding which kind
of your sole objective of this problem
in a future I'll create one problem
video that will decide that how you can
select the machine learning algorithm
based on your objective and based on
whatever the data czar available once
you apply this machine learning
algorithm you can start the training and
you can get those training model that is
what your the representation of your
input data after that you have already
split this training model training data
and testing data
so whatever the trade model you have got
you can evaluate this model and you can
get this accuracy once you've got
execution you are satisfied with those
accuracy you can finish your
experimentation and you can deploy it or
service in a cloud for deploying those
services on a cloud also we have one
module available in Microsoft Azure
machine learning platform once you are
not satisfied you can apply for the
multiple model or you can ensamble
multiple model and you can get the best
result out of it so those way you can
keep doing those kind of experiment till
you are not satisfied once you're
satisfied you can deploy it as a web
service or another way of service and
what are the parameter as the input is
required so these are all the general
steps
required for designing the machine
learning system and those step will
actually correlate with how we can have
completes in a Azure machine learning
platform so that's it for this lecture
