see about one more important question
and one of the more most important
measuring criteria for the machine
learning system that is nothing but what
is bias and a variance thread of so let
us try to understand both things
individually and let after that we will
try to compare both of this thing now we
know that this machine learning system
is like a training plus testing system
training plus testing system so what
happens that in a training you provide
lot of data to the machine learning
system and it will come up with the
model and eventually you apply those
model on a testing data or testing data
on the top of those model and it will do
those kind of intelligent prediction for
us so let's try to understand this
machine learning system design and it's
measuring criteria with respect to this
bias and variance so let us take a
training part first of all let's say in
a training part we will assume lot of
things so lot of assumption so that
means we are building a less complex
model
so once the model is less complex model
I'm in a very much easy model so it will
go towards the under fitting it's one
perform very well on a training data so
under fitting and one perform very well
on a training data or I will write it
like a training data training data it
will perform I will make it as a red
color again so it won't perform well on
a training data that's why I make it a
red color not good but on a tree sting
data it will perform very well so I will
make it as a green color okay so that is
the high bias model so you are applying
lot of biasing to your system you are
making lot of assumption as there is a
lot of assumption the output or
objective function whatever you define
that will be a very less complex that
will be a very easy one so it will be
under fitting kind of situation we occur
because all training data one be fully
satisfied whatever the equation or a
model or objective function you define
but it will generalize well so it will
do well on a testing but it won't
perform very well on a training for that
kind of situation you can call it as a
high bias
let's Lovera
okay high bias low variance situation
now let's see the other side of the
system let's say instead of taking lot
of assumption you take L almost null
assumption no example or very lazy
assumption in this case you build a very
complex model as you are trying to flip
the model with respect to all those
training data so this model is moving
towards the overfitting kind of
situation so all training data will be
accommodated with respect to our model
or a complex model whatever we have
defined so here it will perform very
well on a training data so I made it as
a green color but the tasting part it
won't perform well now why that is the
situation because whenever some kind of
data in a tasting or even in a training
it will change as the model is very
complex know something about the model
it is overfitting those kind of model
its model behavior will immediately
change once the training data is little
bit chain or anyhow the testing data
will be different than our training data
so it won't perform very well or not or
any kind of data so this kind of model
whenever there is a very complex model
it won't generalize very well so this
kind of situation you can tell it like a
low bias because you are taking a very
laser solution about the system or a
data but very high variance
very high variance so now we will
compare both of these things in the
first case we are putting lot of high
bias it is of one side of the system so
lot of Assumption we are we are
particularly bias about the system that
I want to make objective function like
this and I will make it like this only
so even even if it won't perform well on
the training data it will generalize
well or not testing data but you are
putting low variance so whenever the
input data or a training data change its
model behavior won't change very much if
you see on other side you are putting
lot of high variance but very low bias
so you are taking very lazy assumption
but you are putting a very complex model
you are trying to fit every single
training data or majority of training
data to the model you have defined so
that is a high variance situation but if
you see in a machine learning system
we don't want both of the situation we
want machine learning systems should be
like it should perform well on a
training data also it should generalize
well it should work on a validation data
or even our testing data so both of this
situation is not in a favor of ideal or
a very good practical machine learning
system design which will perform very
well on a in a generalized way so we
have to go somewhere in between so that
is nothing but X thread of thread of
between these bias and a variance
measuring criteria of the machine
learning system so between bias and
where is somewhere between where there
is no even high bias so you won't take
lot of assumption about the system and
you even you want make a very complex
model also somewhere around the little
simple model and somewhere around a
little bit about the assumption of the
training data or assumption of
the system you are trying to design that
is how you can bend the system like it
will perform enough well on a training
data or even a very good on a training
data and it will generalize well on a
testing data also so that's it for the
dis lecture friends so I hope you enjoy
