inside the data visualization series in
a Python so in this tutorial we are
going to see about what is the legend
what is the title of the graph how you
can put the labels along the horizontal
and vertical axis inside that plotting
let's see how we'll do it
so let's first see and what is this
legend and title then write simple a
basic graph okay you can see this figure
so this in graph has a age versus weight
graph so they have given this age in
terms of months so this is nothing but
the X label and weight in terms of
pounds though that is a while a balloon
and this is the title of the plot so
let's see how we can do with the help of
math plot live library okay so let's
take this x and y's as a ready-made
value
now let's plot it
P and P dot plot will supply
xn while as a input to the our plot
function and we'll give additional
argument label it will display because
it's a line plot so will give us a line
let's assign
the title
we have one method like okay correct we
are one metal title basic line plotting
now we learn xlabel
we'll let the landline Exadata very
simple one same way we can give the why
level
so we have added the title this is the
legend is xlabel and a while able to
describe this scrub so while visualizing
relation time one can understand that
what are the values are there what is
the significance of each value along the
both the dimension so let's visualize it
so for visualization
so functions are okay okay great working
fine so it has printed this basic line
plotting as a title of our plot this is
a wide data as a wine label what we you
supplied and X theta is a X label be
supplied so in this way we can add
titles and label across both the
dimension in a matrix plot library so
that's it for this lecture I hope you
enjoy listening this video we will see
in a subsequent lecture the different
plotting of bar graph istagram
scatter plot and all other kind of plot
keep like comment and subscribe the
