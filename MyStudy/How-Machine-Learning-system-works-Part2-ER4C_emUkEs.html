into video lecture series on machine
learning so you know first lecture we
have seen that what is machine learning
and what are the different applications
of machine learning in the real why so
exactly machine learnings definition so
in this video we'll see about how this
machine learning system works what are
the different stages of that machine
learning system in a general way
independent of whatever the machine
learning algorithm you are using and
we'll compare it with the one real
example that how different stages of
machine learning will fit to the or that
that example so let us see how my seal
running actually works so machine
learning is basically the two step
process of one is the training process
and another is a testing process so a
combination of these two or combinely
will create the total machine learning
system this training process usually
done in to offline mode and testing is
in online world now what does this
offline and online mean the offline are
here in the same sense that once you
have a huge amount of data you train on
it and you create a sub model out of it
and whenever you have a testing data
available you've read that testing data
into the model and in a runtime you
decide what are your predicted output or
what are your labels of associated you
once you know how basic building blocks
of that machine learning system you will
understand what is the offline process
and what is the online process but
generally this training happens into
offline mode and testing happens into
online model now let us see individual
system that training system that how
training system
books let's say we have a huge amount of
data in either image speech data or text
data so what we do into training sister
aning system first it is a kind of small
pre-processing steps or a feature
extractor kind of step which will
eventually come up with the or lot of
feature extracted from that or raw data
now why this step is necessary because
whatever the data available into the
real world
that is not a in a purist form so you
have to do some kind of pre-processing
pre-processing in the sense let's the
example of image data so image now it
requires some kind of resizing of to the
particular size and if image is blurred
you need to a little bit enhance it and
so this kind of pre-processing and you
extract the features out of it and he
will get extracted feature so in a
training system the first step is you go
through this pre-processing and a
feature extractor step now of you have a
label associated with each and every
examples in your training and data so
combinely as a input to the system you
have a huge amount of data and label
associated with each data now you put
those both of the things into this
machine learning all a machine learning
algorithm which is nothing but you this
is the kind of iterative process so once
you feed it into the machine learning
algorithm you will come up with the
model or the representation of that data
that is nothing but the end of your
training system
this model is nothing but how you data
has been correlated how your data
is the representation in your abstract
form so what is the abstract level
representation of your data is nothing
but the your model so this is how
training system generally works so if
you observe this machine learning
algorithm so this is not a kind of
simple basic building blocks it's a kind
of very much iterative process so let's
see how this actual learning happens
provided if you have a input data and
tax and label associated with that okay
so how this learning happens it's a kind
of iterative process so you have an
image speech or either text data
associated with that and you have actual
output label you have pity each and
every record of images so suppose there
is a one carrot image and you have a
label associated with that is like a cat
you have suppose some sentence and that
sentence is kind of you know happy
sentence or very bad sentence this way
now what will you do you apply this day
time to the machine learning algorithm
and you will get you will come up with
some kind of output but dead out mode
may not be exactly same as actual output
what do you need so you need some kind
of comparator so what this comparator
will do it will compare your actual
output which is predefined in your
actual training data set and you compare
it with the expected output which we opt
into the machine learning algorithm you
compare it now suppose after comparison
if you get the different set you update
this parameter of this machine learning
algorithm if you find it smooth like
expected output and actual output is you
kind of don't update it if you find it
difference you
they did again machine learning well
algorithm will work on that
actual training data it will get some
kind of expected output again you
compare it and you update it so it's a
kind of iterative process in these three
blocks which will continuously over
Erika so till you do not get the
satisfaction you keep iterating this
process generally people do like a
hundred times or even 500 times or
thousand times this process works till
you do not get a sufficient amount of
accuracy which is desired to you so this
is how the training system works and
this whole process then Zana offline
mode once you complete this you have a
more model available with you which is
nothing but the representation of the
data now well let us see how the tasting
system works so tasting system this
model is kind of you already got from
the the training of what you done now
you apply this stage data into the model
which you obtained into while training
and you will get some kind of predicted
label so and this predicted level you
will compare with whatever you define
predicted label and you can get accuracy
something like out of 100 example how
many's are correct that will define
ultimately your accuracy and this is all
done into online model because in a real
time you are getting the data and you
are nothing but you are classifying
those data into particular class or you
are predicting some kind of integer
values we'll see here in two different
algorithms how's machine learning system
works then you will come to know about
that what
kind of miss labels are that how you put
the data into models and everything so
this is how training and testing system
are will work but this is a very
abstract level representation at the
block diagram level yeah let us see how
the one of the example will fit into
this training and testing system so this
machine learning is nothing but about
nothing but it's automation but it's not
just automation it's a one little level
above the automation it's automating
your automation tasks so you might be
using either this in Microsoft Outlook
or Gmail or yahoo mail so if you have
observed one thing they have created as
some kind of rule system inside that
that rule is nothing but a kind of
automation stuff so if you want to
categorize your email like suppose some
email contains this kind of word then
you put those email into a specific
folder suppose if you get a email from
this many person and you put in it to
some some other folder so in this way
you are classifying awhile by creating
lot of rules inside rules inside that
Microsoft Outlook but those rule you are
hard-coded you are yourself creating
based on your email based on your emails
and what are the your requirement so
that we call as just an automation tasks
now how machine learning is going one
step ahead with help of training and
testing system and it it itself
automating your automation tasks so
let's see what is going on here into
training and it winds going one step
beyond the automation so this rule
creation process what we did that is a
completely by ourself that is a human
created based on there
requirement but what machine learning
system stays in the training process
this rule creation process can be
automated in a training phase with a
machine learning algorithm so you supply
your huge huge amount of data and in
unsupervised the data is nothing but
here you're lots of emails and each
email is associated with some kind of
tag or either in unsupervised algorithm
you do not require even that tag and it
will cluster your email into particular
kind of whom category birthday and that
is nothing but the rules it has
automatically created for you and then
in the testing system the testing system
can be classified open then email you
can classify with the help of those
those rule so in a runtime whatever the
new email comes based on whatever the
training happens you you fit that email
into this model and it will classify
that that what action you should take
based on the training rules we have
generated so this way we are automating
even the rule creation part that's why
machine learning is the one step beyond
automation that is automating your
automation tasks so that's it further
today's lecture into subsequent lecture
we will see about what are the different
types of machine learning systems are
there and what are the different
algorithms and we'll see how to
implement into famous Python library
