tutorial inside the video lecture series
web scrapping icon and beautiful soap so
in this tutorial we are going to see
about how you can select the descendant
of individual tag inside the HTML source
code so let's see what does this
descendant means so for our tutorial we
are going to use this webpage is our
reference web page we will fetch this
web page and we will find the descendant
of individual tags so let's see first
what is the source code of this web page
so you can just use right click and view
page source so it will create the source
it will source the so you can see that
there are all HTML different elements
are there either development or table
element or and each is have element
having a couple of or one or more than
one descendants so like the development
has an image tag inside it has a
h1 tag it has a diva tag again inside
that the razón table tag is there and
inside the table tag there is a lot of
other tags are there so these are the
tags which are inside this table tags
are the descendant of this table tags so
it will span from here to here so till
the table tag end what are the elements
available inside that that is nothing
but the descendant of this table now
let's see how we can extract this
particular descendant element of
individual tag inside the HTML source
code with the help of beautiful soap
library so let's first import our URL
Lib library which is used for URL
fetching
star so I'm using URL to library because
I am using the Python version 2.7 if you
are using the Python family version
3x you can use URL Lib only because the
real community has renamed rows you are
only to name just URL ok so this we have
imported so we imported two important
library one is for fetching and one is
the extraction of data after whatever
the data we have fridge
now let's fetch the data so for fetching
purpose we are going to use URL open
function and we will supply this our
reference web page what we are going to
use it so it will fetch the source code
of this HTML page and we will put it
inside HTML reference ok now we have
received the data inside the HTML string
now
let's extract the data so for extraction
purpose we need to use beautiful soap
function from the bs4 library and we'll
be in supply HTML which strip and then
we'll use the l XML parser between which
will the one kind of parser
this beautiful soap library will do for
the parsing of this HTML bit string and
we will put it inside the two des
function ok so we have got the extracted
data from HTML page string to the PS
reference which is nothing but the
hierarchical way it will store
individual elements so that it can be
easily extracted now we got all data
inside this be a subject now our task is
to find what are the descent
top this table tag which is having ID
giftless so in the last lecture we have
seen about how to get individual element
based on ID or based on a class or based
on the tag name
so let's first find table tag so a BS
has a one fine function so we will
supply table and we will supply the ID
ID is nothing but the give list and we
will put now till now we have got the
table tag but our task is to find the
descendant of that table deck is to find
a descended we have one attribute
children and all those children we will
put it inside the children variable so
we got all descendant from the table tag
whatever the descendant of that table
tank which is having a high D give place
we got all descendant with the help of
this children attribute now we got all
those descendant let's try to print it
now there are lot of so we'll use the
for loop so child
children and let's print it so before
running this program let's see what we
are expecting from this program so we
have find this table tag and we applied
the children attribute on the top of it
so it will find all children inside this
table tag for us and we have iterated
loop so it will print all the element so
let's subtract it
okay so we got to successfully all the
descendant of tag table so which is
having a TR th item title description
cost image so we can verify with the
source code which is exactly same item
title description cost image and
everything so this way with the help of
children attribute we used it here we
can find the descendant of individual
tag with the help of beautiful soap
library that's it for this lecture
