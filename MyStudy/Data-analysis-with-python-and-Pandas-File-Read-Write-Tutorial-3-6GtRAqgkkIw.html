tutorial inside the fight on pandas
video series so in a last lecture we
have seen about how we have created a
data frame object of this pandas
framework we have done it with help of
two-way either we have fetch data from
the internet from the external sources
or we have fetched we have created our
Python dictionary data object and we
have fetch those data structure of
dictionary object and put it into data
frames member so we can go for further
manipulation on the top of data now in
this lecture we are going to see about
python io a python io means how python
library deals with the input/output
means how it can read the data and write
the data so suppose you have data
available in some CSV format or an HTML
format or any kind of kind of hdf or SQL
or JSON kind of format and you want to
put a read it inside the Python library
and then you want to transform it to
somewhere else so let's see what other
functions are available inside this - I
already searched okay so you can see
that for the reading purpose by pandas
is already provided this many function
like it can read a CSV file or Excel hdf
is another file format SQL ease can read
it can read our JSON and hell lot of
other format it can read it and put it
into data frame the standard data frame
object of the pandas library now suppose
you got the some data inside any from
any kind of format to the data frame
object name you want to convert into
some other format for the reporting
purpose or there are a lot of other
purpose based on the different
environment your client is using your
data so you want to convert into CSV or
excel HDFS
well so any kind of format you can
convert it so let's do will the will
reading with some external source this I
hope downloaded from the CSV file will
read that CSV file we'll do some small
manipulation on the top of it and we'll
convert into so any kind of format like
Excel or SQL or JSON and even HTML
format okay so this is one side from
where I have downloaded this a CSV data
so you can see this quand elle comm it
has a lot of government related data or
geography demographic related it as some
are free some are you can't use for a
commercial purpose some for some you
have to be also so i have downloaded one
free one i will show you that is afraid
and GT post so this is a data about the
gdp let's see first about this data so
it has a total two column actually one
is the date and one is the value so for
individual day what is the value
associated with this value is nothing
but I think most probably it's a GDP but
for our data frame or related object we
don't care for right now so we have a
total around three hundred and thirteen
rows are there and total two column now
let's see how we can read this thing in
with the help of Python CSV reading
function already so let's import Python
first pandas - sorry
now PD dot we have one functional light
a read CSV so I will write and we will
supply our file name so it will read the
file which I have shown you just now in
a CSV format and we it will create the
data frame object for us so we will
assign it to some DF reference okay so
it has successfully created the DF now
let's visualize some couple of PI
records from the head ok so we got this
date and value of first fire calls of
this
CSV file so we have successfully
imported this CSV file now suppose we
want to change the index of this data
frame objects so currently the index is
just like a 0 1 2 3 4 because it's a
default index it has created for us in
the last lecture we have seen that how
we can do a change in an index chilli so
let's just say English because this data
makes lot of sense for the index purpose
so sad thing that is nothing but
your date then in place will be true
that is for whatever the object it will
return it will return inside this DF
reference only
okay now let's display some okay so date
is now our index now and a value will be
of one of the column now suppose we want
to change the individual columns of our
individual column you name we want to
rename it so how we can do it so this
data frame has a one property which is
columns and here we can supply the
individual names so suppose that date we
want to view like in a camel case just
the same name but how we can rename and
well you will will put it like a gdb so
that is
okay this is actually index so we can't
provide it like this actually we just
need to provide the gdb so that way you
can change the index so just gdb will
work okay so it has it will change this
column name value to the GDP now suppose
we want to change the index then that is
a different case we have supplied the
two arguments but in this case here and
that was only one column so that was not
possible
now let's display some first view
records okay so it has successfully
changed the column name to the GDP okay
so we have changed a little bit data and
everything we have imported data from
the CSV file now we have seen that or we
can store this data inside another CSV
file or even which is on file or HTML
file let's see how we can do it so we
have a D F dot suppose we want to store
it it to JSON
I just keep new dot JSON okay
and let's see whether it has created
this pile or Norton ok does create a
despite let's visualize it okay the
whole we have got this GDP also as our
column name so everything is there all
day today oh converted into JSON now let
us see how we can convert into let's say
HTML because HTML we can visualize it so
I decide to new dot HTML so it will
convert whatever data available in our
data frame object we can easily go for
it okay so it has converted now let's
visualize it okay Python browser okay so
this way we can visualize it so it has
converted the whole data frame objects
daytime itself in HTML format so this
way you can go back and forth between
our different formats
you can read the different any kind of
format in this pie pandas library and
you can convert it to any other kind of
format provided your successfully let's
read the input file so this is all
record it is transforming from one
format of the data to the another for me
to be del pop Python de spine desire
functionality okay so that's it for this
lecture friends in next lecture we will
see more about this find us how we can
do data manipulation on the top of this
data frame firma till now we have seen
about we have successfully read the data
from the different data source and if
you put it into standard pandas data
structure which is nothing but data
frame object so I hope you'll enjoy
