lecture series on machine learning
interview question and answer so in this
tutorial we are going to see about what
is the difference between generative and
a discriminative model of statistics
base or a machine learning base so to
understand this concept of generative
and discriminative model I have listed
couple of X Y pair value and from that X
Y pair value I have listed that we are
trying to find the joint probability
distribution of that particular data
probability of X comma Y and another is
the conditional probability P of Y given
X you have been given X which is nothing
but the input and you need to predict Y
so probability of Y given X so based on
the pair of values has been given let's
say we have a total for pair of value
has been given where X value varies from
at it has only two values not the
varying from range but it has only two
value X is equal to one and two so I
have already made one table and we are
trying to fill this missing value the
joint probability distribution of all
occurrence of all possible combination
of x and y so X values are possible like
possible X values for the given data set
is X is equal to 1 and X is equal to 2
while output value Y has a two possible
values Y is equal to 2 and Y is equal to
3 so let's try to fill it this table and
then we will try to understand what is
generative model and what is
discriminative model so let us take a
very first one let us say X is equal to
1 and Y is equal to 2 the joint
probability distribution of X is equal
to 1 and y is equal to 2 so out of
forethought total data set or for total
XY pair total 1 time it is occurring X
is equal to 1 and Y is equal to 2 for
the joint probability
distribution of P of X is equal to 1 and
y is equal to 2 which is nothing but 1
divided by 4 out of 4 combination
one-time-only it's occurring same way X
is equal to 2 and Y is equal to 2 so if
you see this graph or if XY pair there
is no combination of 2 comma 2 is
occurring so joint probability
distribution is 0 for X is equal to 2
and Y is equal to 2 X is equal to 1 and
Y is equal to 3 so X is 0 1 and Y is
equal to 3 so it is occurring one time
so again it's a 1 by 4 and X is equal to
2 and Y is equal to 3 X is equal to 2
and Y is equal to 3 so that is occurring
2 times out of four that is a 2 x so 2
divided by 4 which is nothing but 1/2
total half sign it is occurring so that
is what the joint probability
distribution of data we have achieved
same way let's try to find the
probability of Y given X so let us say Y
has iyx has been given to you there and
you need to find the probability of Y so
let us take X is equal to 1 so total
data set which is having X is equal to 1
so we have a total two data set 1 comma
2 1 comma 3 and what is the probability
that Y is equal to 2 so total two data
set 1 comma 2 and 1 comma 3 so there are
total two data set out of that 1 comma 2
occurs one time so 1 by 2 out of 2 times
1 times 1 comma 2 else occurs given that
X is equal to 1 so we need to consider
only those pair in this case where X is
equal to 1 now 2 comma 2 so there is no
combination of 2 comma 2 as already and
has been occurred anytime so it's anyhow
0 1 comma 3 so 1 comma 3 occurs one time
G 1 X is equal to 1 given X is equal to
1 for total
two out of two one time it's occurring
so 1 by 2 and 2 comma 3 so in X is equal
to 2 occurs two times total two times so
total is 2 times out of that how many
times y is equal to 3 so in a both the
case y is equal to 3 2 comma 3 2 comma 3
occurs two times so we need to give 2
comma 2 is equal to s divided by 2 is
equal to 1 so that is what the
conditional distribution of the given
data set Y is equal given X what is the
probability of Y and this is the Joint
Distribution of a data set X comma Y
pair so now let us can understand this
probability stuff so if you see this
first chart that is a joint distribution
that is nothing but our generative model
and it is trying to tell us that it
shall narrate you model it is trying to
tell us that how your data has been
generated and whenever you have a new
signals are available what is the
probability that that which combination
of that particular signal will occur
most likely that is nothing but our
generative model and were joint
probability distribution so let us take
if you see any of this combination like
a 2 comma 3 that is more likely occur
going to occur in our future example it
is trying to say it is not trying to
discriminate between the different data
but it just concentrate on data itself
and it is telling that what is the
probability that particular combination
of data occur most likely or less likely
so that is nothing but the generative
model how data has been generated joint
probability distribution will give us
how much data is generative easily now
let's see a conditional distribution
conditional distribution and that is
nothing but our discriminative model
this creamy discriminative model so
compared to this joint probability
distribution this conditional
distribution will straight away telling
us that if X is equal to or input is
something like this what is the
probability of occurrence of particular
output or any other particular output so
if you see here whenever based on the
data if X is equal to two Y is always
three in our data set so output is
always three that means the probability
of occurrence of classes Y is equal to
three whenever X is equal to two is
always high and it is almost it is
always 100% it's one only so it is
trying to discriminate data and it will
try to straightaway classify your sample
into particular output categories rather
than it is trying to learn both input
data so this conditional probability
will give us the discriminative model
and it is time it is very good at the
classification kind of task let's see
one more or very practical example that
now let us say you have been given one
sentence that sentence can be in a
English English or in a French now
French now let us say if we do not know
what is English we do not know what is
crying okay but we have been given one
sentence and that centers either in
English or it is in a prime and our task
is to detect that particular sentence is
done in which language so how we can go
with this both of these approach that
particular machine will recognize that
particular sentence is in English or
French which kind of model we can use
let's say we want to go with a
generative kind of model so in this case
we learn about the English first we
learn about the French first and then
whatever the sentence as a query
sentence has been given to us we
straight away throw to our knowledge
because we based on those data we have
generated the knowledge about what
English sentence looks like how English
sentence has been spoken how English
sentence has been written and same way
we have learned about the French how
English how French sentence has been
spoken what is their pronunciation how
it has been written what are the
spellings of individual words in a
French and then we will try to classify
that particular query language the query
sentence R is belongs to English
sentence or English language sentence or
a French language sentence so if you go
to the particular generative kind of
approach learn first English learn
French then classify
so this is the approach one needs to
follow while detecting the language
sentence
but suppose same problem you want to
tackle with discriminative model in that
case rather than learning individual
English language or a friend language
what we do we are trying to discriminate
between English sentence and a French
sentence or Finglas language and a
science language we are trying to find
the differences between English and a
French so differences between English
and French language we are trying to
find the differences between English
language and a French language
it's a Cremora sebuah while its
consonant what are the spellings
how does pronounce sessions are there
and straight away it will classify
classified so that is nothing but the
discriminative model so in a generative
model we individually learns about
different samples and then classify
while in case of discriminative model
you spreader will learn about the
differences between those classes and in
this case classes are english-language
enough science language and then
immediately classified so I hope you
understand about the generative and a
discriminative model and I hope you
