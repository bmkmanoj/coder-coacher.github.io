lecture series on a machine learning so
in this tutorial we are going to see
another family of a plotting
functionality which is nothing but the
lat
plot functionality so this led Balad
functionality generally used to find the
randomness in a data and this built-in
functionality is already available in a
fun might on pandas library so I have
already made some necessary imports of
pandas and from the numpy library and
from pandas I have specially imported
this pandas tooling plotting module and
out of that swine sub model is a led
plot so we are going to generate some
data or we'll supply some random data or
we explicitly give some very randomness
kind of data and let us try to visualize
that how this graph will be or plotting
functionality will be helpful to find
randomness in a data so I have just
created a simple series object of this
pandas and I was just supplied at one to
nine number and I have assign it to the
data reference so let's just apply this
series data structure to the let block
functionality so data okay now let's try
to see what is let flot is there let
plot is nothing but it's
Tory scatter graph or a plot
between
yt
and why
P plus one
okay so it is just the scatterplot
between the YT and YT plus one so what
is YT and YT plus 1 YT is the series
value at any given time T and the YT
plus 1 is the series value at a given
time T plus 1 so for anytime we have
just given a very simple data 1 to 9 so
if you look this carefully 1 is a YT
then why T plus 1 B comma 2 because that
is nothing YT plus 1 is nothing but the
future version of this YT basically so 1
comma 2 so it has generate displayed
this 1 comma 2
then again 2 then YT plus 1 become 3 so
2 comma 3 tells generative then 3 comma
4 4 comma 5 so this way it has just
displayed this scatter plot between YT
and YT plus 1 so if you observe that
there is nothing like a randomness here
it is closely following some kind of a
structure so it is following one line
structure in this case so this is how we
can visualize or we can find the
randomness in a data now let's try to
apply little random data inside I have
already written some small script for
generating this random series data
structure so I am just using this sign
functionality plus line space
functionality random functionality of
this numpy library we are going to join
this number around 100 point in a data
set and let's try to plot it ok so if
you see here actually there is a nothing
like a any kind of pattern or structure
this data is a following because we
don't know where this data is going or
in which region of this space this
particular data is approaching so let's
try to generate some worth more
thousand and let's see okay now I have
generated the more data so is actually
giving us some glimpses that it is
following some kind of structure his
luxuries the looks like an ellipsoidal
or ellipse structure in a two dimension
space so that's why we can find that
particular structure is exists in a data
or not so this is how we generated is a
random structure whether we can find the
structure exist or not in a data now I
have again created a very random but not
artificially generated data very
anything I have put inside this file
creating this series of data for 47 48
28 any numbers actually it's the
three-digit number sometimes a one digit
two digit even zero and let's put
anything actually so there is nothing
someone can say that it is a no
randomness axis and let's try to put
this in or let's try to give it to the
leg plot function and again let's
visualize it okay so you can see still
this data is a completely random so it
is not at all following any kind of
structure so for coma 47 somewhere
around here because still it is
following the visualization of whitie -
whitie plus 1 graph so every pair it
will take the first value it is a
horizontal axis direction and the second
value is nothing but vertical axis
dimension and it will just display the
scatter plot but there is no randomness
exist but if you see here one two nine
we got some random I mean it is closely
following some kind of structure the
more data we have added in our second
example we caught some kind of structure
the less data we heard there is no
structure because we don't know where it
is going but this is one of the very
useful to plot while deciding factor
data what next step for the data
processing we need to take so this is
one of the very useful of plotting
functionality
is there so that's it for this lecture
