tutorial inside the video lecture series
on machine learning so in our earlier
lecture we have seen about what is the
kind of data pre-processing required
before you start actually coding inside
the machine learning system we have seen
about what kind of descriptive
statistics also you can immediately
calculate with delve of some of the few
pandas function so in this lecture we
will see about how to do this feature
scaling inside this scikit-learn library
so let's start so why this feature
scaling is first of all required because
let's consider this very small and
hypothetical data set individual rows is
having one column so this is one column
this is unab this is the one column this
is an this is another record sorry this
is another record this is another record
then so there is a total for record
inside that and there is a total Phi
column so Phi column is nothing but the
PI feature so this is the first feature
is the second feature this is the third
this is a fourth is a fifth feature so
if you consider the very first feature
or second feature so you can come to
know about that this data lies between
the range 14 and 56 somewhere if you
consider this second feature this data
lies between cell 4 and 7 somewhere ok
four and eight eighth maximum and
minimum value so there is a lot of
disparity between the range of
individual feature and if you supply
this a non normalized data not scale the
person of this data to the machine
learning algorithm it won't behave the
way we are expecting and it will mislead
to the result so why this pre-processing
is required because if you don't scale
it to the certain range it will mislead
to the different result
and our testing result will be very bad
so that's why this feature scaling is
must requirement now what does that
feature scaling means now individual
feature if you have consider every
feature has a different ring every
feature lies between if Allah around the
different average value the different
mean value and there is no common thing
where the all data is life common range
between all data's are lying so what we
do in the inside this feature scaling we
will try to put those data ins with a
very similar range plus similar kind of
mean or similar kind of standard
deviation on the top of this data so
let's see these are the different types
of scaling functionality so in this
tutorial we are going to see about this
min max scaler standard scaler norm how
we can normalize those data and how can
by an arrays a data so there are a lot
of other scalars are also available
inside this scikit-learn library but we
are going to see about this small scalar
functionality inside this scikit-learn
library so let's start about so I have
given this a small description about
this individual of this feature scaling
so we will come to know about that what
individual scaling will do so let's
start with this min max scalar okay so
what this mean max scalar will do it
will just subtract this minimum value
from this original data and divided by
the range range is nothing but the
maximum minus the minimum I have taken
this formula from directly from
scikit-learn library and there is a
scale version so whatever the
intermediate X you have got you multiply
with the range plus ad minimum so you
want to sift the ring by default the
range is 0 and 1 so G
minimum will be 0 and maximum will be 1
so s scale is nothing but s underscore
STD so this way this mean scale Mac
scaler work let's see how or we can
apply those thing with the help of
scikit-learn library so we are not going
to use some actual data because to
understand that principle will take a
very small matrix kind of three records
and a three feature and we will apply
this min/max scaler of the scikit-learn
library on the top of this data and
we'll come to know about how it behaves
and what is the meaning of it so why a
mimic scalar is useful when you want to
sift all of your feature to the
particular range basically when default
range is 0 and 0 to 1 for the mimic
scalar functionality
so let's first importer numpy library
because we are going to create the array
with the help of numpy library and we
will import the pre-processing module of
this
Ascalon library so from a scale and
infor
pre-processing okay
okay there is a typo here
okay we got it so we have successfully
imported this numpy library and ask
Ellen so let's create a very simple data
segment with the NP dot array function
so we create the matrix of 3 cross 3
size I'll just put 1 2 3 4 5 6 ok ok so
let us understand this data set because
for the understanding purpose I have
taken a generated this data set it is a
very small matrix so it is having a
three rows and T columns which is
nothing but the total three records are
there an individual record has a tree
feature so if you take this 1 comma 2
comma 3 it is nothing but the first
record 4 5 6 is an another record and 7
8 9 is a third record and if you
consider the first of sure of individual
record is is nothing but 1 4 7 second
feature is 2 5 8 &amp;amp; a third feature is 3
6 9 so we have got this data to
demonstrate the principle this is a very
small data on a very small data set we
will apply this min max Keller okay so
let's start about it inside this
pre-processing module there is a huge
amount of this all scalars are exist so
from the pre-processing step let's apply
this min max scalar okay
and we have I told you already that if
you do not supply any kind of argument
the default range is 0 to 1 so let's
apply 0 to 1 for timing then we will
change and we'll manipulate it and
min/max okay so what we did here
actually we have created one object of
this mimic scalar class which is having
the feature range 0 to 1 so what we are
trying to tell this function that we
want to create a mother scale version of
X which is a scale version of input data
which is having a 0 to 1 now we will
apply this min max to the fit fit
function which what it will do it will
just calculate the minimum and a maximum
value and then we will apply the
transform on the top of it so it will
actually transform this all input data
with the help of this equation between
the range 0 to 1
so individual feature will come down to
the 0 to 1 right now all values all
features are ranging in the different
different range so if you consider this
first feature is ranging from 1 to 7 the
second is between 2 to 8 third is 3 to 9
so we want to shift it to the all
features between the range 0 and 1 so
this transform function will transform
this value from 0 to 1 and this split
function which nothing but the calculate
minimum and maximum for individual
feature with the help of this min Max
object when min Max object is nothing
but the class of this min max scalar
class okay so let's see what it will do
okay so it has generated all feature
range between 0 to 1 all data is a kind
of uniform we have taken that's why all
values are kind of similar across though
all three features 0 0.5 and 1 now let
us see how or with the help of this
formula we have calculated this feature
so you will get actual idea that how min
max
Seiler works internally okay so our for
the first feature
for the first feature let's find what is
the minimum value first of all minimum
will be one maximum will be maybe seven
so if you can see that the first column
is netting with the first feature so for
the first feature we are going to
calculate so you get to know about
actual functionality of min/max scaler
now let's calculate this X STD so if you
apply for the first value one
1-1 because minimum is 1 divided by the
range range is nothing but plus 7 minus
1 so if you calculate this this will
become a zero so for the first for the
first value of the first feature the
range is down to the zero so what it
does actually whatever the minimum and
maximum range it has scaled down to the
zero to one so minimum value become a
zero and a maximum value become one
whatever the intermediate values are
there that lies between the minimum and
maximum it will scale down echo reading
loop accordingly uniform way between
zero to one so let's see for the fourth
how it works so this will become a zero
let's see how it goes for four so just
instead of same function input is 4
minus minimum divided by the range which
is nothing but seven minus one so if you
think this 3 by 6 which is nothing but
zero point 5 the same way 7 you can
calculate so 7 minus 1 7 minus minimum
divided by range
so it is six by six one so this way
individual feature with the help of
min/max scaler we have scaled-down
individual features tutor
okay it is not making any sense okay 0
to 1 it has scaled down now we have seen
that how this formula for the min max
scalar function is working but the
second equation we haven't applied
because the maximum value is 1 which is
nothing with a feature rate now we have
scaled down all feature to 0 to 1 now
suppose we want to scale down those
suppose 10 and value so let's see how it
will behave okay so all values will lie
between 10 to 12 all features value and
whatever the intermediate value it has
gained now suppose we want to put
between 10 to 11 okay so between 10 to
11 all data's are uniform so 10 10.5 11
4 so 1 4 and 7 has been transformed to
10 10 point 5 and 11 and if you if you
consider range between 0 to 1 1 4 &amp;amp; 7
has been transformed to 0 0 point 5 in 1
so all data's are kind of normalized for
us in this case now we can supply this
data to individual machine learning
algorithm so this is about the min max
scaler now let's see about the second
one is nothing but the standard scalar
let me save it first standard scalar so
in a last like last data what we have
used if you consider this data 1 4 &amp;amp; 7
for the first feature so for the first
feature there is a if you find suppose
the mean so 7 plus 4 plus 1 is 12 12
divided by 3 is nothing but the 4 so all
data's are unifor
mean is 4 in this case mean is 5 in this
case
mini 6 so all data's are lying around
different different mean all features
are lying around different different me
so suppose we tell you want to put those
data with a very similar mean which is
nothing but a 0 mean and unit variance
across this
data so how we can go ahead so we see
with Dell pop the standard scaler so
let's first import this standard scaler
so we have a pre-processing and standard
scaler so we have created object of this
non-standard scaler
and we will fit it to the X and those X
let's assign it to the stander so what
it has done actually it has created the
standard scalar function of ject of the
standard scalar class and apply the fit
matter on the top of it which nothing
but it just calculate this standard
scaler now how this kinder scalar is
working so it will calculate the mean
across the all feature and it will
subtract those mean from the original
data and it just divided by the standard
deviation of that feature now with the
help of this more standard scalar class
let's see what kind of data it will
generate and empirically also we will
see okay we need to apply this transform
function also on the top of it which
nothing but it will transpose so fit
will find the mean value and of variance
across individual feature and transform
will actually transform your input data
X and it will transform with the help of
this formula this scale Morrison okay so
we got it so if you consider this data
for the very first feature all data's
are very uniformly distributed hi-oh
taken so you know mean is nothing but
the 4 so from the second feature let's
print here the original data also
okay so or from the second value of the
first feature it has subtracted the mean
so that's why it is zero so all data has
been around the zero so mean is zero and
variance become one so how this has been
calculated with the help of our formula
for the first feature let's calculate it
how it is minus one point 22 game so
what it has then for the first first
value as TD I will apply hash htd
underscore 0 so mean is we know already
about 1 minus the mean is foreign and we
need to divide it with the help of
standard deviation of the full feature
so for full feature is 1 for 7 so to get
the standard deviation we have STD
function inside the numpy array library
and we will supply this one for either
you can write this one for 7 or you can
slice it with the help of a slicing
functionality of this array inside the
numpy level so we need to go over all
rows of the first column so it is
nothing but 1 4 and 7 we are supplying
here so let's see what it will generate
okay we haven't displayed it
okay it has generated exactly same value
minus one point twenty two let us
independently see what this NP dot
standard deviation means so if you apply
this thing here it has generated this
two point forty four so if you divide
minus three divided by two point forty
four we will get this value and it is
nothing but it is same as n P dot STD
the first column also you can supply
this way
107 okay the very first value will
comment it okay so we got almost same
value so this way it will calculate the
individual value so in a first case
first scaler functionality we have seen
that it just scaled on the value between
0 to 1 and it is eligible to apply the
machine learning algorithm especially
for the learning part of the machine
learning a system this kind of scaling
is immerse it will definitely boost your
system and in this standard scaler for
the different feature the ranges are
very different so we have scale down
those ranges to the very exactly same
mean across all feature and you need to
pair ions across the region and we have
seen how with the help of formula we can
calculate it and how with the help of
the standard scaler functionality we
have seen so there is a two more left
which is a binary scaler in a normalized
so this tutorial that's it for this
lecture in a next lecture we will see
about this normalized how you can
normalize this data and how you can
binarize those data I hope you enjoy
