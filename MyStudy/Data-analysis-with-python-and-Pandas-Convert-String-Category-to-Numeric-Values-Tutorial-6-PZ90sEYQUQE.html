tutorial inside the video lecture series
on data analysis with a pandas so in
this tutorial we are going to see about
how you can convert the individual
string value of individual column which
is nothing but it is organized into
different categories of the string how
you can convert those value into
numerical value now before starting that
let's look at some data and let's see
why this is required actually already we
have a data available inside this thing
why we want to convert into inside with
numerical values so let's see okay so
first of all I have already listed some
data so let's just create a dictionary
data structure of the Python so before
that flush is important to find us
in this variable okay now with the help
of data frame object let's import this
data and let's analyze that how we can
convert it into numerical value we can
supply this data inside this data frame
and we will assign it to the D F and we
will display that F so we'll analyze
okay so we have a data about the student
so the first column will be a high D of
the student I have kept it very simple 1
2 3 4 up to n 10 H children and for
individual student there is a match
score but a match score is a not given
in terms of a numerical value it is
either that student is strong or a weak
so these are all the string later on the
second column max score is nothing but
the string little now our task is to
convert the string literal into
numerical value first of all why it is
required because if you see about any
kind of learning algorithm or artificial
intelligence or machine learning
algorithm if you want to fit those data
in a future to the any kind of learning
algorithm you cannot fit the string
literal or any kind of string value so
in those cases you need to supply some
kind of numerical value so what you can
do you can equal integrity of total
amount of category of maximum possible
unique value along that column you can
convert it into equivalent some numbers
so one the way you can do it with the
help of you can iterate individual rows
and for each row you update this value
so for strong there are total two
possible values in our case that is a
strong and weak so but if there is a
huge amount of data you need to apply
some unique function on the top of it
and you will grab that what are the
unique
values inside that function and for each
of these unique value you assign to some
number so let's assign strong is equal
to 1 and in P is equal to 0
okay so our task is to convert all those
strong into one and weak into zero so we
can feed it for the further analysis on
or we can feed it these data for any
kind of on a machine learning or any
other learning algorithm because that
requires all numerical data so let's see
how with the very easily we can do or we
can achieve this stack with the help of
function inside this data frame object
so what we can do we can define so first
of all one function like a try prance or
transformation of this mats code which
is nothing but the strong to one and a
weak to zero so x max core and we will
take X as an input argument so if X is
equal to strong perfect and one now why
we are defining this function when you
go for will go ahead will you will come
to know about it how we will use that
function inside this one of the
properties of data frame object so our
tasks become very easy rather than
iterating individual rows of this full
data frame object if X is equal to week
we will return
zero okay so we have defined this
function let's compile it okay it's
working successfully so now apply this
function on a top of this column let's
see how we can do it so on a data frame
bf we have one column which is match
score
on the top of this we can apply this to
apply this matter so there is one apply
function is there and in this apply
function you can give the argument trans
underscore max for home so what it will
do for this column which is having a
value match score inside this in DF
object you apply this function so for
individual record inside this match
score column if you will apply this
function and whatever value written it
will paste it here so or this way it
will do the transformation now let's
assign it to some new column like a
trance mat school means transform it in
match school and let's print a term p.m.
okay there is some
typos most probably
there is some key error most probably
let me copy then I will paste it here
okay so ass was actually small I took
actually and I have taken it up bigger
value okay so it's work fine let's print
it be F okay so we got in there is the
typo
so what it does actually it has created
a brand new column which is having a
name transfer mated trans underscore
match score and whose value has been
defined by this trans underscore math
core function which OVA already earlier
defined so for all strong value it has
kept one for all week value it has
created zero for strong one strong one
week is equal to zero so either you can
assign this match score itself to the
match score and you can display so all
strong value will be replaced by one or
for the confirmation or for the
comparison value you can create a new
column and you can assign those values
so in this way you can convert all kind
of string literal to the any kind of
numerical value with this apply function
rather than iterating over each rows of
this data frame object so that's it for
this lecture friends I hope you enjoy
