video lecture series on machine learning
inside the cloud so today I am starting
another video lecture series which is
how you can use different online machine
learning services which is available
inside the cloud so before starting
actually how you can use those services
in a cloud let's take a very small
introduction of what is machine learning
so I have already created the full video
lecture series on a machine learning so
in a description I have already
literally you can go through and you can
watch a lot of videos on a machine
learning but for the small introduction
of machine learning I just want to
introduce you what is machine learning
what the machine learning is kind of one
of the training first testing kind of
system so training turns in offline mode
and testing turns in real-time mode what
kind of problem machine learning can
solve so machine learning can solve
problems like a face detection and a
face recognition even your speech
recognition object recognition
whatever the Google has created the
self-driving in car Google photos or
even Android speech recognition system
these are all kind of machine learning
system so in this playlist series we are
going to see that how this kind of
machine learning system you can deployed
in a cloud and lot of online machine
learning services are available how you
can use it so first of all why this
machine learning system in a cloud first
of all it is a huge amount of data sizer
available when you are going to play
with machine learning kind of system so
rather than doing in offline mode or in
your local machine infrastructure it is
always better to go on online in a cloud
infrastructure where instantly lot of
machines are available lot of your hard
disk capacities are available so you can
play bit or you can process with
millions of millions of records and even
thousands of GBS or data you can process
then one more interesting thing about
the cloud is instant availability so you
might have here
about Google Cloud compute engine or
Amazon ec2 elastic cloud computing
engine
so suppose instantly you want like a
hundred or even a thousand different
node or thousand different servers
instantly within a half an hour or maybe
within a short few short span of time it
will be instantly available very fast
prototype why it is fast prototype
suppose you want to play with very small
amount of data so you can immediately
deploy it and you can see result if
distance is not good you can keep doing
those kind of prototyping way once you
are satisfied with those prototype you
can go for actual bigger plan of this
online service and you can deploy your
services it is very difficult to do or
in your local infrastructure those kind
of things so very fast prototypes become
very easily possible due to cloud
infrastructure there is one biggest
reason why we are going to the cloud
base machine learning system is the lake
of professional of different data
scientists so if you are already machine
learning or another intelligent
algorithm which do the processing on the
data already available in a different
online machine learning system in a
cloud so in that case you do not require
a very high professional data scientist
even if you have a mediocre level of
programmer who knows about how to do
programming they can easily use this
online machine learning services that's
why this cloud is very useful in that
case no local infrastructure is required
suppose you want to do the experiment on
a thousand different machine it is very
difficult instantaneously you need to
set up those kind of infrastructure in
your local level but if you go to the
cloud instantly thousand even a millions
of machines are available to you so
these are all one of the very big and
high reason why we are going to the
cloud for doing those machine learning
processing system now let's see what are
the online services for machine learning
are available
first of all Google cloud platform so
Google has already had a lot of
different services available one of them
is a machine learning service they were
deployed so lot of machine learning
related algorithm they are deployed in
the cloud platform another one is the
Amazon AWS cloud computing engine so
there are lot of different products
available on Amazon Cloud Computing
engine one of them is Amazon machine
learning so inside the machine learning
they are deployed all those machine
learning related algorithms so you can
directly use it Microsoft has already
created their asura cloud computing
platform and inside the Azzurri they are
deployed one most important services is
machine learning related algorithm apart
from that there are some of the small
players are also available like a big ml
they even if they are a very small
player they came in to market our very
first so in this playlist series we are
going to start learning about how you
can use this as ur a machine learning
platform of Microsoft and how you can
start gathering data and how you can put
those data into practice how you can
apply to us machine learning algorithm
on the top of it and how you can
evaluate those kind of model so that's
it for this lecture friends I hope you
enjoy listening this video if you don't
understand anything please write
anything in a comment then if you
haven't subscribe it please do subscribe
see you in lakhs lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
