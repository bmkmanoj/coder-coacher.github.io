tutorial inside the birria lecture
series on our artificial neural network
and a deep learning so I have started
the brand-new lecture series on our deep
learning so deep learning is like a one
of the state-of-the-art of Technology
are currently in a machine learning and
artificial intelligence community so for
deep learning related algorithm and
neural network related algorithms for
prototyping of those algorithms we are
going to use this tensorflow
first of all what is tensor flow tensor
flow is the one of the open source
library has been released by the or
Google a year back and we are going to
lose those kinds of load there other
open source libraries also available for
the deep learning that is a Keano and a
piping but as there is a huge community
are involved inside this tensorflow and
it's based on a Python programming
language so we are going to use this
tensor flow for our rest of the whole
whole series of lecture and we will
install individual neural network and
deep learning related algorithm inside
this tensor flow so in this tutorial we
are going to see about how to install
this tensor flow inside your Linux
machine or a Mac machine it is not
supported till now on a Windows machine
so if you are installing on our Windows
machine you can use the Virtual Box kind
of environment you install the Linux on
the top of it and then you can in go
ahead I'm anyhow using the windows so
let's see how to install this tens of
loaner Ubuntu on a Linux machine
so this tensorflow is based on a Python
programming language so there is a one
good people installer is there which
provides all those are installation
package so if you are open to you can
use this command the whole instruction
for installing has been given on a
tensorflow website also and I will
describe in are very easy steps
inside the below description okay so
let's start it so this is for the open
to if you are on our Mac machine you can
use this easy install pipe or if you are
an open to you can use this app gate
manager for the Python peep and Python
development environment so just copy
paste those apart here okay so I have
already installed this pipe and I have
the newest version of people so PP is
nothing with the package manager for
installing this stencil from and for a
children's upload installation let's go
through the net and times flow so there
is a first link download and setup our
tents alone so for the tensorflow
it's good amount of instruction has been
given under tensorflow website so there
are a couple of ways you can install you
can go with the pipe installed way or
either you can install in a virtual
environment install an account at
distribution docker installation or you
can go with directly from the source
code you can download the source code
you can compile it and you can install
it so in this tutorial we are going will
go through this people install wait
that's why initially only we have
installed this app it if you are on
Ubuntu you can use this one and if you
are on a Mac you can use this one okay
so let's see with the pipe installation
see it is I already been given for the
Ubuntu and Linux machine which is a go
for 64-bit yeah one more clarity that it
has to have a 64-bit machine it may not
work on a 32-bit machine also only so
are open to for the Ubuntu distribution
on there are a couple of things has been
given for the binary so these are four
five 12.7 version or Python 3.4 version
whatever you are using based on the
Linux and Mac OS distribution or if you
want to install for a CP or GPU for our
video lecture series we will restate it
to the CPU version only so for the mic
is here in
now open to 64-bit I will use this one
and it has a newest version of 0.10
version so let's do it actually
so just append your URL to the pipe
install upgrade and it will start
working so like this way I'll make it
bigger for you so pip install upgrade
and you need to provide this URL so I
have listed here 0.10 version and a
Linux 64-bit you can choose based on
your configuration or environment setup
different binary URL has been given here
from the google ok so this is all about
the people with the installation of
tensorflow
it is already been installed on my
machine so I am NOT going it again so
let's go ahead so there are the
libraries also available for alternative
or Tiano in raw piping and a couple of
others also but we are going to use this
new tensorflow from the for the list
rest of this video lecture sees and for
the development environment I am using
this Jupiter not pokken so this will be
very helpful you can use any other based
on your interest and busy on your like
so it's all up to you now let's start
with how to import this tensorflow or
library first of all so there are useful
convention that you use import
tensorflow
as a TF the very short version of this
TF and just run it
okay so it has successfully run now you
can refer every command or every
function or every method inside this
tensor flow library with Delft of sort
from TF because we have renamed this
tensor flow to the TF now let's see
whatever the version we have are
installed inside this tensor flow so
tensor flow we can address it reference
it later
TF variable and there is one person
friend is there one or two here okay so
it has soon as the 0.10.0 are c0
so that's what I have installed here
0.10 0 RC 0 Linux 64-bit version based
on your configuration you might get
version maybe same but whatever the
offenders are their version it might be
different so that's it for this lecture
friends I hope you enjoy listening
within this video we have installed
successfully the tensor flow if you get
any kind of problems or error just
comment in the video in a next lecture
we are going to see about how to define
this constant variables or a constant as
an array or a placeholder concept inside
this tensor flow how that tensor flow
works and will write a very basic
program inside the tensor flow thank you
guys for watching I hope you enjoyed
listening this video please do like
