science from a lot of different
perspective one of the way to look at
the science as a finding the
relationship between the different
quantity so since we started the
systematic study to understand nature
universe and its behavior which we call
as a science scientists observing a
different quantity gather data find the
relationship between the data and
present it into a mathematical form Sir
Isaac Newton observe force acting on an
object acceleration applied on object
mass of an object and found out that
they are related quantity relationship
exist between this all quantity so
Newton put that into mathematical form
which is nothing but the famous Newton's
second law of motion force is equal to
mass into acceleration so force depends
on a mass and acceleration applied on
object dr. albert einstein showed that
mass can be converted into energy and
energy can be converted into mass these
are the related quantities so he came up
with a famous mass energy equation which
is nothing but e is equal to MC square
in our daily life also unconsciously or
consciously we do find the relationship
between the different event and based on
this relationship we act upon a new
situation so science is all about
finding the relationship between the
data the relation at this I've driven
more relation we expecting better we
will understand the situation all nature
hidden secret liner relationship exists
between the different quantity
so can machine find this type of
relationship between the different
quantity can machine learn understand
this quantity and become a next Newton
or Einstein I hope not
but if you want to go far into universe
want to know the deep secrets of the
universe we need to teach machine of
screen like mathematician or physicist
answer is just still as a small scale
but machine can find the relationship
between the data which is nothing but
the machine learning technology let us
understand with one example let's say we
want to find the price of the house in a
town and we have a data available with
us for 10,000 different houses like
number of bedrooms in house total square
foot of the house and apprise of the
individual house so can machine find the
relationship between the data using
machine learning algorithms that how
much weight individual feature has on
the price of the house yes the
regression one of the supervised machine
learning technique we can use it we will
feed all 10,000 house data honors
regression algorithm and it will come up
with a model and that model is nothing
but the relationships in with the input
observations so for a new house data
when we fit it to the relationship it
will tell us the new house price it will
predict the new house price for us let's
say we have a millions of email of
different users and we want to find
whether particular email is spam or how
does any relationship exists between
email content and whether is spam or ham
we can fit all those email to the
machine learning algorithm and it will
even those relationships between email
content and whether particular email is
spam or ham so machine learning is all
about finding the relationship between
the data so that's it for this video
then please like video and comment your
views on a machine learning if you want
me to make more video on a different
computer science technology please write
it in to comment and please share with
your friends and subscribe my channel
for the more video at last thank you for
