lecture series on a machine learning
interview question and answer so in this
tutorial we are going to see about one
very basic statistical measuring
technique and error associated with
these questions what is the difference
between type 1 and type 2 error so let's
try to understand first of all what this
kind of error and then what are the
differences between them so before that
let's define a confusion matrix this is
the confusion matrix I have already
created for you confusion matrix I'll
make it bold okay matrix so this is a 2
class very simple phenomenon I have
observed I have listed here so the very
horizontal line this positive and
negative is like our aced has predicted
particular samples are positive and
negative and this positive negatives are
kind of particular sample is actually
positive or a negative so we have a
total 4 possibility first is it true
positive then a false negative false
positive and a true negative so let's
try to understand all fours behavior
let's see first the true positive
through positive means our that samples
are already positive and our test or
algorithm has predicted it as a positive
so very good case let's take another one
true negative so our samples are
negative and our test is also predicted
as a negative so these are two coming in
a very good case but our task is to
define type 1 and type 2 error so dose
type 1 and type 2 error is defined by
this false positive and a false negative
correspondingly so what is false
positive false positive is nothing but
our samples are negative but our tails
has predicted it as a positive so that
is nothing but a false positive and that
false positive is nothing but the type 1
error in a statistics type 1 error so
this is the type 1 I'll make it with
some different color
okay now let's see another one false
negative so false negative is nothing
but our samples are positive but our
taste has predicted it as a negative so
I'll make it with another color and that
false negative is nothing but a type 2
error in statistics okay so we have
defined a type 1 and type 2 error type 1
error is nothing but false positive that
samples are negative but our test has
predicted it as a positive so that is
the erroneous thing and that is nothing
but a type 1 error and false negative is
samples are positive but our test has
predicted it as a negative and that is
nothing but a type 2 error
let's see couple of example so you can
correlate much better way let's say if
we tell some of some man that he is a
pregnant so he is a pregnant now let's
try to understand this thing with false
positive stuff so men cannot become a
pregnant we cannot get pregnant we
already know so this is the negative
sample but if we are telling men based
on some test some experiment or with
some task we have conducted and we are
telling that he is a pregnant so this is
like a we have predicted the
positiveness but our samples are
actually negative because he cannot
become a pregnant but sample is detected
or test has detected that this
particular sample that man is pregnant
so that is lying into false positive
error false positive type 1 error this
kind of things now the same thing we can
tell to the woman that she can not
carrying her
child see care not caring child so that
means he cannot get a pregnancy cannot
become a mother so let's try to focus on
a disposer negative part that actually
mother or a/c can become a pregnant so
actually that is a positive example but
we have predicted our test has predicted
it as a negative
let's see cannot carrying a child so
this lies in two type two kind of error
so that is nothing but the false
negative type two error so this is one
example to understand what is type 1 and
type 2 let's see one more example let's
say one cancer detection test cancer
detection cancer detection place okay
and same matrix we will apply in this
case also here so I will just make it
copy here okay cancer detection so
positive means found cancer so we will
take it as a found cancer
no cancer testers predicted negative no
cancer okay and he in this case these
positive means cancer is there a
negative means there is no cancer so
let's try to understand this false
positive type one error in this case
false positive type one so what this
false positive suppose some of the
patients has an O cancer so it is a no
cancer event this is all predicted found
cancer no cancer found based on taste
but in here no cancer digital yes cancer
so there is a positive case this is the
negative is so false positive means
nothing but patient do not have a cancer
Payson do not have a cancer I am not
writing everything patient do not have a
cancer but our taste has predicted is as
a there is a cancer found in the taste
or a blood sample or whatever the taste
they oh then for the cancer detection
cancer detection okay so that is nothing
but a type one error
let's see false negative so false
negative is type two error that patient
has a cancer but our taste has not
detected it as a cancer no cancer found
based on those kind of taste that is
nothing but a falsely negative example
and it will come under that type toe
category so this is the basic difference
between type 1 and type 2 error type 1
is associated with a false positive and
type 2 is associated with falsely
negative examples so that's it for this
