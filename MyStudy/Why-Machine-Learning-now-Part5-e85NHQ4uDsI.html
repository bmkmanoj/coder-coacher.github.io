tutorial into the video lecture series
on machine learning so till now in all
video lecture we have seen that what is
the machine learning system how in
general way the machine learning system
works plus what are the different kind
of machine learning system so in this
tutorial I am going to show you that why
machine learning suddenly become lot of
hype in today's time why you should
learn my machine learning now so let us
see what are the different main focus
reason right now in the current world
that's so that machine learning become
very much famous nowadays and it is
going to become a next generation
computer science so let's see first of
all there is a lots of data we going to
discuss in a more detail each and every
topic very high computation power we
will see about what are the real world
machine learning application how this
Google Microsoft even Facebook Apple are
using machine learning for their
internal products we will see about some
of the famous quotes by the people on to
the machine learning and then we will
see about what can be the possible
future about the machine learning ok so
first of all there is a lots of lots of
data available so this I they this is
about just give you the glimpses that
the scale at which the data is available
to us that is enormous
you can see that Google is already
processing 20 petabytes of data per day
so that is the time at 2008 Facebook is
already handling 40 billions of photos
from its user base Walmart has hand
1 million customer transaction every our
eBay is already a 50 terabytes of data
for the processing every day plus Suns
very large hadron collider laboratory
generates a 15 petabytes of data per
year so these numbers are just the give
you an overview data scale at which the
data is available to us that is the one
of the main reason that machine learning
is getting successful because to run the
machine learning system you require a
huge huge amount of data for the
training purpose and those data is
available in our time right now because
if you consider that today's time with
the at least if you go 30 or 20 years
even back that was not possible we have
this much amount of data we are
generating continuously the very huge
huge amount of data so this is a very
good first reason that we should learn
about the machine learning now let's see
there is one more is the high
computation power so if you consider
this Google and Facebook these guys are
already handling millions of servers
into the database for processing all of
their products and you know how to
background data processing works is keep
going
so in today's time we have a huge amount
of computation power we have moved from
our desktop or laptop computer to the
cloud computing era so if you want
suppose some machine at a rented way or
if you want to buy some of the servers
on to the cloud it's become very easy so
it's all at your fingertips so lot of
computation power available it suggests
that cell phone is already a million
times cheaper compared to the very first
cell phone available 20 or 30 years back
and it becomes even a million times
faster so you can think about the
friends that the number scale at which
the computation power is available at
your fingertips the huge amount of
computation power already available in
inside your pocket you know
cellphone let's see this diagram I have
taken this diagram from the one of the
famous the futurist who has predicted
that the rate at which this
computational power inside our different
types of system is going on that is at a
very exponential rate he is the Raymond
cross well he's one of the most famous
futurist
so what he suggests that if you consider
this error all 1960s and eighties the
amount of computation power we have
available it's going at a very much
rapid speed so it's almost approaching
to the expansion growth of computing so
they are telling that by at least 20 20
20 sorry
20 20 will be available at least one
mouse computation power of at least one
mouse brain and by 2040 we will achieve
the computational power of one human
brain so you can imagine that the amount
of computation power we have available
at very a number us and machine learning
system requires this much amount of
computation power for the processing
your huge huge of the amount of data the
different industries are generating so
this is a very good reason that why this
machine learning becomes suddenly so
much hype and why it was not in earlier
times they are even predicted by 2060 or
by around 70 will have a computational
power available which combines to all
human brain available on to the planets
okay so this is the another second
reason that why you should dive into the
machine learning now let's see some of
the real-world machine learning
application so if you see this many
Google application has a machine
learning component so if you consider
just the Google
newse the google is fetching the news
from the lot of different news website
and machine learning system will
automatically cater those clustering
similar kind of news putting into the
one place this all happens because of
machine learning and much different
machine learning algorithm Google Voice
Search it is almost at more than 80
percent accuracy and now now it nowadays
so they are using deep learning kind of
Technology disease or sub filled up the
machine learning system self-driving car
and many more so lot of Google's
products and almost other Silicon Valley
tech giant company are trying to put the
machine learning component inside every
their software system Facebook has their
photo tagging system it identifies the
face from the image automatically it
even recognize the face so these all
possible because of the machine learning
system there is one recommendation
system onto the Amazon on or the Netflix
so Amazon gives any kind of product
recommendation on Netflix any movie user
souls recommenders and is all possible
with the Elco machine learning system
apart from these all other single
company into Silicon Valley or any other
place trying to put this machine
learning component into their individual
system to make that system even more
intelligent so you can see that everyone
is moving towards the making test system
intelligent and machine learning can
help us that way so this is one of the
good reason that all application are
going to build on the top of machine
learning systems of machine learning
become another operate kind of another
operating system so we are entering into
the new era of Windows or Linux kind of
operating system so it is going to
become new operating system so this is a
very good reason that you should go
ahead and learn about that there I will
show you some of the famous quotes by
the people who stolen the machine
learning that what do you think about
the machine learning so this is just to
give you the inspiration that how these
big people are thinking about the
machine learning so Microsoft founder
the bill Gates once tell that a
breakthrough in a machine learning would
be of worth 10 Microsoft 10 Microsoft 10
Microsoft means they are telling that if
you can mix computer to think you can
build a company which is of worth 10
Microsoft that is a to to much so they
are thinking that machine learning has
such a kind of important at this scale
once the Bill Gates has been asked that
if you are a computer science student
then you what subject would you like to
learn at this moment he immediately told
that it's a machine learning because the
machine learning is the future one more
is the Toni tether he is the director of
the ARPANET he once told that machine
learning is going to become a next
Internet Steve Ballmer Steve Armour is
the former CEO of the Microsoft so he
once told that machine learning become a
hottest aspect of the computer science
so if you are building any computer
systems of the system you need to put a
machine learning opponent to make that
intelligence so it becomes one of the
hottest area of the computer science
right now we note ghost lies one of the
co founder of the Sun Microsystems he
once told that dr. can be replaced by
the software at least 80% of them so he
is trying to tell that 80% of dr. can be
replaced by the software system decks of
their system is nothing but the computer
science system so he told that I would
rather much have a good machine learning
system to diagnose his this is rather
than median dr. so he believes in a
machine learning system much more than
any one of the average doctor because
those machine learning system has a huge
huge amount of data compared to one
doctor has so you can imagine that what
the people are thinking about the
machine learning
and what is this kind of future machine
learning can help because everyone is
putting huge huge amount of money to
make their application more intelligent
and attract more and more user pays than
the new breakthrough of the machine
learning at the last we will see future
of machine learning so whole community
of this machine learning artificial
intelligence people from the
neuroscientists background about brain
science side people everyone has been
divided into two kind of come people
some are very optimistic some are very
pessimistic
so the pessimistic people what dears
saying that they have raised the biggest
concern of the tights will happen to the
humanity because of the machine learning
system the people like a Bill Gates or
even much the founder of SpaceX or Tesla
and Steven Hawkings one of the very
famous cosmology cosmologists top our
time here is the biggest concern because
the trade will happen to the because of
the machine learning system so these
guys are little pessimistic and they are
about to concern they are concerning
about the machine learning system
because they are telling that if
something goes into reproduction that
will end of the humanity but one thing
and there are optimistic people also
from the optimistic side of you people
are thinking that even though we'll lose
some of the job but anyhow we will
create some of the job so if you
consider this scenario with the at least
50 years or 70 years back when the
computer was first invented all the
people so from the different industry
they are telling that we lose our job
because anyhow computer is going to take
over anyhow computer will only do all
those work so why human will lead but
eventually that didn't happen and we
have created the different kind of job
and overall this machine learning system
is going to solve a lot of problems of
humanity so there is a very much
optimistic view and there are people
towards the path a mystic view I am one
more towards the optimistic view let's
be optimistic and last thing the very
great future is going ahead in front of
us because of the machine learning and
artificial intelligent kind of system so
these are all just two different view I
am telling about the machine machine
learning there is a lot of videos on
internet if you are interested for the
what can be the possible future of
machine learning and into the different
area of what are the technology it can
even disturb in the future you can see
about it so that's it for this lecture I
hope you enjoy this scenario the way I
am representing about the machine
learning system why should you learn
machine learning system now okay thank
you guys for watching in a subsequent
lecture we will see about the different
machine learning algorithm and will
implement it inside the Python and
scikit-learn what we have installed into
earlier lecture thank you guys for the
watching please do like comment and
