important concept of machine learning
what is regularization and why this
regularization is required what kind of
benefit this regularization technique
will give us while training the machine
learning system so let us try to
understand this regularization with one
fitting our graph so I will show you one
website I'll put that Levitt site link
into our description so this is nothing
but let us try to understand with
respect to some fitting curve or the
regression kind of curve fitting
functionality and then we will try to
associate this thing with regularization
and then we will come to know about that
why this regularization is required so
what this site will give is we have
given some data point and it will just
plot this data point for us so I have
listed some sample data site on this
website minus 1 comma 1 0 comma 3 simple
to dimension data point 1 comma 2 point
5 so it has scatter displayed in a
scatter plot format this minus 1 comma 1
kind of and 2 comma minus 2 comma 2
comma Phi it is a 2 comma Phi so this
way this has displayed all those data
points in a scatter plot forming now let
us apply the regression or a fitting
curve of polynomial 1 so I have they
have given a very nice control here so
polynomial 1 we have tried to fit a
simple straight line with respect to
with this data point we can even
increase is also so let us try to
observe that in a first degree of
polynomial when we try to fit to this
data point it is not nicely fitting it
is not trying to represent that our data
or it is not trying to capture those
underlying the relationship between this
data let us try to improve
or let's try to increase this degree by
two it is getting little better and it
is trying to reducing those kind of
error let's go for even three it is
little more better four five four let's
go for even six seven so seven is almost
nicely fitting every single point but
once you go or once you go down or a
decrease the polynomial or degree it is
not nicely fitting those curve if you
decrease it but once you increase it is
nicely fitting so if you go for a
polynomial of degree one it is not
representing or those data so our model
is very much less complex model but and
that training is also very simple kind
of way because it needs to capture very
less amount of a tidge a rating term for
us but once we increase the polynomial
degree we are trying to put more and
more complexity towards the our model so
we don't want a relation or we don't
want to create our data with respect to
even polynomial one also even polynomial
seven also because polynomial seven also
completely fitting those data so it
won't work well on a training date it
will it is working very fine on a
training data but it won't work very
good enough testing data because it is
not trying to capture the underlying
relationship between the in this input
data what we have given so let's but if
you see this a polynomial of degree 4 or
even a 5 it is somewhat trying to find
or capture the relationship between the
data so it is nicely fitting and it
should be good for a machine learning
system design also because it will work
very good on or a good owner training
data also and it will work good on a
testing data also so we have a three
scenario let us try to of list down this
please
naari oh and then we will see what this
regularization is related to you
so let's with respect to that plot I
just listed here the degree degree so
one example is degree one another is a
good example we find degree five and
another example is degree seven okay so
first degree it is not trying to
represent a data very good so a very
less data which is fitting to that
particular line so lot of lot of
training error error so it is trying to
under filter data under fitting
phenomenon is occurring in this case and
if you go to seven degree where almost
it is trying to fit the data so training
error is very bad training error is very
good almost zero almost zero but it is
trying to over fit data as it is trying
to very stick to the input data in case
of polynomial of degree seven it won't
work very good on a testing data so
phenomena like overfitting occur so in
case of machine learning system design
we don't want to design a system which
fits to this polynomial degree burn also
and b we need to fit the polynomial of
degree seven we need a solution which
lies somewhere in between which works
better on a training data also and it
will work better on a good on go detect
testing it also so we can stick to the
model like polynomial of degree 4 or
even 5 which will work better and it
won't stick to any kind of particular
data has been given to you as it happens
in overfitting phenomena of polynomial
of degree seven so we need some kind of
intermediate solution which will work
better on a training data and a testing
data also but this overfitting r is
always occurring in a
in learning system so with respect to
all these three different use cases of
different polynomial degree which we are
trying to fit to our input data how this
regularization is required so
regularization is nothing but it is
trying to avoid or remove this over
fitting because over fitting does not
work very good on a testing data so this
overfitting is not good for a machine
learning system design and we are trying
to avoid this overfitting and that's why
this regularization technique is used
now how this regularization technique
will be helpful so for every single
learning algorithm while learning we are
defining one hypothesis or our error
function our error function error
function is nothing but your expected
output - your actual output so expected
I just write is like an expected e -
actually so that is not a very vague way
of defining your error exists in your
training data but how this
regularization will be helpful to avoid
this overfitting phenomena so instead of
defining error function like expected -
actual one we are trying to introduce
one more word which is nothing but the
regularization term so what happened it
and
that is nothing but it is trying to
overcome this overfitting of phenomena
so while learning on an input data our
machine learning system it will try to
penalize this error so it won't converge
very fast to the zero because we are
introducing one more noisy tower you
can't see noisy term but one more extra
term and we are trying to penalize the
error so it will slowly slowly decrease
the error and that is nothing but the
regularization so that case it one just
completely over fit like happens in our
a polynomial of degree seven so we will
get our solution with respect to this or
regularization technique the
intermediate solution like a polynomial
of degree 4 or even 5 so mainly the
purpose behind the regularization term
is to penalize this error function or
error hypothesis function and if we
apply those things then overfitting
phenomenon we can avoid the basic
motivation basic idea and boesak
intention via the regularization is to
avoid this overfitting we don't want
this overfitting phenomenon to occur in
our machine learning system because as
we have seen in a polynomial of degree 7
it just sticks with the data it tries to
represent this input data very well but
it doesn't try to capture the underlying
relationship between the input data so
it works very well on our training data
because it has just stick to this input
training data but it won't work in a
testing data variable and that is very
bad for the machine learning system so
the final in summary regularization is
required to avoid the overfitting how we
can achieve it so we can introduce one
extra term to our error function so that
error will reduce or slowly-slowly and
we will get the intermediate solution of
polynomial of degree 4 and or 5 kind of
it so that's it for this lecture friend
so if you haven't understood anything
please write it into a comment if you
want to understand same phenomena with
respect to some other example please
