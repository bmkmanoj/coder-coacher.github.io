this is a first video lecture on the
series of machine learning this video is
for absolute beginner those who doesn't
know anything about machine learning so
we learn about machine learning in a
very much intuition we will compare with
existing computer science computing
system and we'll see how that system has
been evolved to the machine learning
what kind of problem
machine learning solves in the current
world plus what are the application what
are the big giants company using machine
learning for their application so let us
see first what is the traditional way of
programming currently so how the
traditional system of programming works
so in the traditional system of
programming you cube input the data and
you write the computer program so the
programmer writes the computer program
and you defeat the data into the current
computing system and it will give the
output so here in the example case we
have given very simple addition computer
program and we have supplied the two
argument two and three as a input and it
has given an output so this way the
current system of programming is working
so if you observe one thing here
programmer is hard coding what Edition
is what is the concept of a decent ear
hard coded feeding into the system they
are not explaining the nor they are
teaching to the computer they are just
telling computer you just do Addison
this way so computer doesn't have any
brain that what Addison is it just
computes the way programmer hat has
defined all instruction for the computer
now let us compare this thing with the
machine learning system that how machine
learning system solved this problem so
if you just swap this computer
programming and output part it becomes a
machine learning system so instead of
giving program by the programmer as a
input to the system what we do into
machine learning system we give the data
and we give the output associated with
those data not just a one pair but the
huge amount of pairs of data we give to
this system and eventually this machine
learning system will learn based on this
data itself and it just come up with
this program program is nothing but in
its kind of model the way data has been
distributed how data has been correlated
so instead of giving as a output this
machine learning system will eventually
give us the computer program like a
model of that data so this is the
difference between current system of
computing to the machine learning way of
computing so instead of just giving data
in a program we are giving huge amount
of data and its label means the output
associated with that and it come up with
the computer program so if you observe
one thing here the programmer do not
need to write the addition program it
just come up with based on the data we
provide the huge amount of data to the
system and machine learning system has
automatically figured out what the
correlation between the data what is the
concept of addition associated inside
the system that's how we learn if we as
a human learns the system and we are
trying to teach the computer based on
data that what Addison is so this is a
very simple example let's look at duck
another
sample is a very famous one that is a
spam email detection so if you are
observed in your Gmail inbox or even in
your Yahoo inbox there is a lot of
emails as spam or not so let us look at
how if you want to classify this email
with the help of current system of
computing so if if someone tells us to
write a program to classify the email
physically so there is no
straightforward way to write the program
we tells us that this is a spam or this
is not a spam so this is very
horrendously complicated for any
programmer or anyone to write a single
program we just read the tags of this
email and tells that this spam or not
spam so this kind of problem cannot be
solved by the current system of a
program programming so how this problem
can be solved with the help of machine
learning system let us see so instead of
giving just email what we are giving to
the machine learning system we are
giving lot of emails and each email is
associated with either spam or not spam
or ham either so and machine learning
system will automatically figure out
that what is the model associated with
this of with this system so instead of
just writing the program for what spam
is and what not spam is that is not at
all possible and there is no generic
rule for it we give huge amount of data
to the system and system will
automatically figure out what are the
rules for whether email is spam or not
so this machine learning system helps to
detect spam in the email or it's a ham
in the email
okay it is the one example let's see one
more example this is the CAD detector
into image it's the object recognition
related problem so let's see if we want
to know detect whether image contains a
cat photo or not so if someone gives us
to write the computer program that write
a program to classify whether image has
cat or not so there is no
straightforward way to write any program
that will tell us that whether image has
a cat or not because there are no
generic rule associated with this image
because the moment you give the next
image all pixel intensity and everything
has been changed even if you give the
same image slightly shifted by just the
one pixel horizontally then the whole
image pixels also position change so
programmer has a no way to cue any kind
of instruction to the computer that if I
give you this kind of data you classify
it as a cat or either Northgate so let's
see how machine learning system will
solve this problem
so instead of giving just a single cat
photo and computer program what we are
giving in the machine learning system is
we are giving hell lot of photos of
either cat or there are not catch so
it's just like this is not a cat photo
this is a cat photo this is not cat this
is cat this is a pair of photos so this
is not a cat and machine learning system
will automatically come up with some
kind of generic rule that will give us
eventually model that will tell that
whether the photo is cat or not
so this way machine learning system is
kind of training and a testing system
let's see how this real well machine
learning system big giant corporate
peoples are using first is the web
search engine so if you look at a Google
search or Bing search what they are
doing whatever the ten top links are
coming in front of you while searching
any keyword on to search engine they are
modeling hold those things with the help
of machine learning system there is a
recommendation system on Amazon on and
then product recommendation or even
Netflix movie recommendation or any kind
of TV series recommendation is that
happen through machine learning system
friends whatever these systems are I am
telling you this is just for
introduction when we go for the
subsequent lecture we will see what are
the different machine learning system
eventually solve this kind of problem
that is when google photo is there
Google has just launched so what Google
did is each with the help of a mail
system Google has tagged each and every
photo with some keywords so whenever you
search for something Google sees what is
inside your photo n that only possible
with the help of machine learning system
if you see the speech recognition and
wrote a speech recognition or even Apple
CDs speech recognition that is a
nowadays way highly accurate this is all
possible with the help of machine
learning system and a huge huge amount
of data ok so now let's see why machine
learning now actually machine learning
is already existing from lot many decays
but there is a lot of hype in current
time about the machine learning that all
possible with due to just these two
factors
currently available under internet one
is the lots of lots of amount of data so
that was not possible in two three
decades earlier and that is one more
thing is a high computation power so if
you see at least twenty thirty years
before we didn't have enough computation
power to compute on all those data of a
available so this is the two major
factor that why machine learning system
is growing at a rapid very fast I want
to show you with some quotes from the
famous personality so Bill Gates once
said that any breakthrough into machine
learning will be of 10 times Microsoft
so if you can make machine learning to
think it will become a 10 times the
total valuation of Microsoft so you can
imagine that how much machine learning
is important Tony Tedder he's the
director of DARPA and net he told that
machine learning is the next thing in
Internet so this is just to inspire you
friends what machine learning is what is
the good future machine learning can
hold and how big corporate giant people
are using machine learning for their
every application Google is not just a
search engine coming Google become
almost machine learning company so
machine learning has a very bright
future about it that's all for this
machine learning introduction let's
summarize what in general this machine
learning system is we have seen in a
it's a training and testing system we
have seen earlier that in a current
system we write a program and we saw
predict data to that program and will
eventually give output but machine
learning is kind of two-step process
first you need to give the data and
machine will
train itself insert machine we'll learn
from that data and it will eventually
come up with a model and there is a
testings that isn't nothing but the
training system and there is one next
phase of ML is the testing
insert the inference system when if you
need a new kind of input it will
eventually detecto based on that model
so it's the combination of training plus
testing system it's about automating the
automation so if you have might be come
across a lot of automation related tasks
in your daily routine work of computer
related programming but this is not just
automation it's about you are automating
your automation tark's itself it's
machine learning extracting knowledge
from the data there is a huge huge
amount of tags are available onto
Internet there are a lot of images are
available on the internet but for
computer it doesn't make sense so
machine learning system is all about
extracting that useful knowledge from
those data either image speech or text
finding the relation between the Reta so
suppose if you give huge huge amount of
data a computer doesn't make sense of
that data so machine learning field
system will find the correlation between
two two data that one kind of data is
depend on under the data or what are the
mathematical relation exists between
them so that it a very higher abstract
level inference we can find so that's
all for this machine learning interval
duction thank you guys for watching in
the subsequent lecture will come up with
more machine learning video for this
video lecture series and we'll learn
about what are the different types of
machine learning system or in a
subsequent lecture we will see what are
the different algorithms for it thank
