lecture series on a data analysis with
the help of Python so in a last video
tutorial we have seen about how to
select the individual columns of data
frame object or how to select individual
rows and how to select multiple or group
of rows or a group of column or even a
cell level selecting how to do inside
this data frame object we have seen so
for that we use the this Titanic data
set and we have read this whole data set
inside this data frame object now in
this tutorial after going through
individual selecting individual rows or
n columns we are going to select the
individual column based on the condition
in this tutorial so let's see how that
conditioning is working on the top of
individual column to selecting the sub
group of the data so let's first display
some data with delft of help function so
it will show first Phi records now if
you observe among all those features of
individual record let's take this
warefare is nothing but how much amount
you have spanned for the ticket for
individual passenger on a titanic boat
so suppose we want to find all those
passenger whose fare is greater than 10
so it is something like same in SQL
query the way we are writing on the top
of this table something like I select
some of the column from table where the
conditional we apply based on individual
columns so in our case this columns is
where it is nothing but the features of
individual passenger so suppose we want
to find the fare all those passengers
whose pair is greater than 10 now let us
see how we can apply this condition on
this data frame object so inside the
data frame only we will apply this
greater than 10 condition so we want to
apply this greater than 10
on the top of fair object so we will
apply DF fare greater than 10 so as
argument to DF will supply this part
that show me all record which satisfy
this condition and this condition is
nothing but show me all record which is
whose record means the individual
passenger whose ticket fare is greater
than 10 so let's see what it will give
okay so we got some of the records so it
has displayed all those record which is
having a fair is greater than 10 suppose
we want all those records which is
having rec fare is less than 10 so might
be very few records that's why it has
this played almost all mighty or very
high number of record setting yeah it's
a 336 total rows which is nothing but it
signifies the total 336 a code which is
having a they keep fare less than 10 so
it's all about the how you apply the
less than or greater than kind of
conditioning now let's see how that
equality will work so suppose we want to
find out how many a p class passenger
which is having a value 1 so P class is
nothing but the individual class has
been given to individual records
individual passenger so passenger 0 has
been seat seated inside this class 3
passenger 1 in a class 1 so suppose we
want to find all those passenger was P
class who travel by the classes which is
equal to 1 so we will apply this
condition
class is equal to one okay so it has
listed all those record which is having
a whose Espace which passenger has
travelled in this titanic boat with a p
class is equal to one now it's all about
less than greater than and we have
applied all everything into numeric data
now let's try to apply something on a
string related object so suppose let us
take this age or sex sex is female or a
male so suppose we want to find all
those female records only so we will
apply this condition inside the brackets
of this DF objects so DF where the sex
is equal to female
okay so it has listed all those records
for the female candidate a female
passenger so there are total 314 females
were there inside the Titanic data set
over now if you suppose want to negate
we want all those records which is male
or either which is not female so let us
see how we can do it
we will apply this nugget with this
explanation mark and we will apply the
same condition which we applied earlier
so it will negate the whole condition
some typos
okay it's not explanation Isaac killed
actually for the negative purpose okay
so it has displayed all those male
passenger so there are total 577 male
passengers are thinking so that's all
for this lecture in summary we have seen
that in this lecture we have seen how
you can select based on the condition
which is equivalent to the where
condition inside this SQL query language
the same you can apply on this data
frame object and this kind of analysis
will be very helpful while analyzing the
data to predict it what kind of further
analysis you require for what kind of
further machine learning algorithm or
any other kind of algorithm you want to
apply to extract some more useful and
meaningful knowledge it will be helpful
for our analyzed that whether some
features are useful or some feature may
not be even useful also so that's it for
this lecture I hope you enjoy listening
