tutorial on inside the video lecture
series on find us so in this tutorial we
are going to see about a couple of more
properties related to the data frame
object of Fonda's so let's begin it
let's first import the normal convention
way of importing the finders framework
okay so we have successfully imported
and find us now we can reference in
individual function with Delta pin now
to saw this more property in this
property you will go step by step
individual properties before that we
need some data so I have one data of
Titanic passenger so during the Titanic
saying what are the people's name in
individual people's who has survived
it's etiquette number or sex and related
data I have downloaded from the net so
let's try to import this file
okay so it in the file name is train dot
CSV so we will import it with the read
CSV function
and reveal a sign inside this NDF
dataframe Oh object so reference will be
dear from now on one and let's try to
print some of the couple of record so ok
so it has printed with help of had a
function of data frame object the 5 has
passenger list so it has the total 12
attributes like passenger ID of
individual passengers whether it has
survived or not its name sax and age of
individual passenger that ticket number
the fare and the cabinet has said taken
I mean while sitting inside the Titanic
so this is the small glimpse of data
about the Titanic data set now let's see
there are how many total records are
available inside this data frame object
so we'll use this described function of
on the top of this data frame objects so
let's see what it will give us so
describe function what it has given us
that for individual column it has
calculated this property for us like a
count what is the mean value of that
passenger ID what is the standard
deviation of individual features what is
the minimum value what is the maximum
value how much people's are coming in
the top 25 percent how much people are
coming in top 50 percent so let's take
like
any of this fair like so fair is like a
has been given for 891 total people's
fair is available inside this data
website what is the mean value of the
fair that is a $32 somewhere what is the
standard deviation 49 so just this
described function has calculated this
much amount of data instantaneously for
us now you can see that there are total
12 columns are there but it has created
these statistics for just 7 columns
because for the sax for the name these
are all the string objects and it
doesn't make sense so let's try to find
it or what is the data type of
individual columns okay so it has sonís
like a passenger ID has been storing
integers 64-bit integer objects survived
ID integer for 64-bit object sex is like
an object object is nothing but the
string class inside this Python age is a
64 bit of float value so in this way
individual and data's datatype also we
can see let's see about some more
property like info okay so info has
given us like a class so DF is nothing
but the pandas having a core module
which is having a sub core module frame
and having a data frame class so DF is
the object of this data frame closet is
saying that and it is referencing to
data frame class range index so this
info function has given us the range
index that how many
total values are there so there are
total 891 values or each one is ranging
from 0 to 890 there is a data column so
total 12 data columns are there and for
individual data problem it has sown as
that for some of the data columns there
is no all values are available for like
age then these are only 700 and fun 14
values only available out of 891 entry
so remaining are the null objects so
individual data types of each column
also mean reference it is saying that 4
out of this 12 object-- there is a two
column which is referencing to the data
type load 64-bit v for 64-bit integer
and remaining Phi is the object class
which is nothing but the string level
class and this whole data set object is
occupying 83 point 6 K kilobytes of
memory while storing inside this Ram so
just with the very few commands like I
described or B types or info function of
this data frame object we have got lot
of idea about how many how what kind of
data czar there what is the data types
how many entries are there for
individual or um how many are the null
values are there how much memory it
occupies inside this data set so that's
it for this lecture friends I hope you
