are coming up with the brand new video
series tutorial on our Python numpy
library it is a very famous library for
the multi-dimensional array related
processing so regarding to little bit
background on numpy library this is
mainly used for algebra matrix that
related all basic manipulation okay so
let's start dive into it so this is the
first video series tutorial for pi
library so in this tutorial you will
learn about how to create array or
basically with the help of different
function provided by the numpy package
of python there are a number of
different ways we can do it so let's
start it
so already numpy package has been
installed on my system and I am using
Jupiter as ipython notebook development
environment so let's start it I am
creating the new notebook
as a very first step of process we need
to import the numpy package as some of
the alias name and we use the alias name
like and B so in future we can access
every function matter even a class
inside the whole package of numpy we
tell the alias name and B okay now let
us see what are the different ways we
can create arrays inside numpy library
so
this is the first way of the creating
the arrays inside them numpy our library
person is a Python Lee so what we'll do
inside the Python list we will create
the Python list data structure and we'll
provide those full list as argument to
the function which creates the numpy
array into it so let's see how we do it
to create
okay I'll create a one simple Python
list in a one-dimensional mode this is a
Python list as a variable name now let
us create another variable V which will
eventually create numpy variable so MP
dot array here will provide the argument
a as a input which has created the numpy
array B now suppose we want to see the
content of variable V so let's print it
so this way you can create the Python
list and you can provide as a argument
to the array function of number package
and now you can create the numpy array
now suppose we want to see the size of
this array so V dot size so it has a
total 7 element associated with
numpy array b so this is a
one-dimensional array
suppose we want to create a
two-dimensional array then we have to
create a two-dimensional UV Python
and now we'll supply this
two-dimensional array and we have
created another variable of numpy array
in the variable D now let us print the
variable D so it has a two rows and
three columns
suppose we want to see the size of so it
has a total six element inside it
including rows and columns now suppose
we want to see the shape of this
variable D so it has a property C so it
is given a 2 comma 3 so 2 is suggesting
that we have a total number of 2 rows
and 3 columns are there in 2 D so this
is the first way we can create numpy
array let us see what are the other ways
we can take down to create numpy array
so another way is the arranger function
which numpy package will provide so let
us start creating numpy array with the
help of arrange function
so
okay so we'll use some others available
m1 then play range NP dot a range now
suppose we want to you know fill up the
array from zero to ten so we just need
to provide that tan as a argument and it
will display zero to nine value as a
part of this array so here the value all
starts from zero and all are incremented
by 1 tilde 10 but 10 is a excluded now
suppose we want to start the same thing
from 5 and we want to continue ting till
10 then it will go like this step 10 is
excluding everything is incremented by 1
suppose we want to print all value
between three
to 20 in a step of three in a snap of
two maybe so in both the buggers we have
incremented arrays value by the one step
but here in the case of this we are
incrementing value by two steps so it
has created the 3 5 7 so all the values
are incremented by a one step alright so
this is another way of creating numpy
array now let us see the other V's so
one more way is a line space function so
let's see how line space function will
works I'll make a heading of line space
now the same way our ranges of working
the line spaces a very small difference
between them so NP dot line space
function what it will do it will accept
the two value one is the starting value
and one is the stopping value and the
last it will tell that how many evenly
spaced parts I need to do between the
start value one and now stop value ten
so if I want to divide the number from
one to ten in two suppose the 100 values
then it will evenly divide the work
between one to ten 200 values so you can
look at this how many values it has
created between one to ten
now suppose we want only nine values
between 1 to 10 so this way it has
evenly divided between one to ten into
nine different parts the more number of
parts you will do the least necessary it
will parts become and they certainly sir
okay so this is the three ways we have
seen how to create numpy array Python
lists way and arrange and line space
bunks in which inbuilt Python numpy
package was providing to us there is a
one specific way also for generating the
numpy array there is a zeros and ones
and empty functions provide so name
itself suggests that zero will
eventually create the numpy array of all
values will be of zero and once we'll
create the all value will be of one we
just need to provide the dimension of
that array now empty function will prova
create the numpy array of any random
value which is already present inside
the memory so let us see how this zeros
one's an empty function will work
okay I'll make small hairy
Jiro's ones
okay so let us create zeros
matrix or two-dimensional matrix of
precise 3 comma 1 which all values has
been fill up by zeroes so see it has
created the total 15 elements and there
is a 3 rows are there and each row has a
5 columns so suppose same way if we want
to create the ones which has all values
will be 1 3 comma 5 so it has a 3 rows
and 5 columns which we each element is
having a value 1 the same way we can
even create 3-dimensional array also so
suppose we need a total 5 6 so it has a
total 3 blocks each block has a fidos
and each row has a 6 columns and all is
filip - so you can see how 3 dimensional
array structure there are 3 blocks are
there as we have provided with the help
of first dimension there is a file rows
in each block so this is the one block
you can consider and each block as a
fire rows this one
this one this one
this world
and this one so there is a total pyro
and if you see if Rio has a five columns
so this a six column each row has a one
two three four five six column so in
this way we can create a
multi-dimensional array of size three to
one in any number of dimensional array
we can create with help of an umpire
now suppose let's create an empty array
of size
to come up for so it has created a total
two rows and four columns for us but all
values are kind of junk and random value
but it's not a random value it looks
like a random but whenever the numpy
package or look at memory for this
variable while creating the array
whatever the value was already available
at the memory location we just accept it
so this way you can create the
specialized the matrices and even one
dimensional vector and even three
dimensional matrices also so that is
this is one more way we have seen how we
can represent or create numpy array let
us see one more way that is a random way
so suppose you want to create the one
numpy array with some random value all
our random value you just need to
provide what are the dimensional what
dimension of that matrix you want to
generate so let us see how it will works
random way
okay let's see NP dot but I don't know
so this numpy itself contains another
package called
a random and this random has a random
function here will provide the dimension
so suppose we want to create two arrays
of 3 comma 1 so it has a 3 row and one
column
sorry there's some mistake
okay that function name is not a random
it's around its around yeah correct
so see it has a created all values
between zero to one of size three rows
and one column so this is the one way
you can generate random array of num PI
type now these are all value it has
generated between 0 to 1 now suppose we
want to generate of all values between 0
to 10 we can just simply do
n
ten x
so what it will do actually whatever the
value generated by this expression what
we have seen in earlier steps it will
generate the two rows and four columns
armed matrix with a random value which
varies between 0 to 1 and it just
multiplied by the 10 and whatever the
values will output NP floor function
will just make a lower value of each of
them so this way we can create random
arrays and you can do some
multiplication plus some kind of offset
also you can output and it will generate
a value between something like this
between pop set plus whatever the
multiplier you have added so eventually
this will generate the value between 34
and 44 of matrix of size two rows and
four columns okay guys so these are the
different ways we have seen how we can
create the numpy array array and I hope
you enjoyed this video and now in the
next tutorial we'll see how this arrays
can be manipulated what are the
different operation we can perform why
linear algebra related function is
working very fast like a matrix product
and a dot product some of the matrix or
multi-dimensional arrays addition
subsection compared to our for loop
iterative way what we do into normal
Python lists I hope you enjoy this video
we'll see you in the next video series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
