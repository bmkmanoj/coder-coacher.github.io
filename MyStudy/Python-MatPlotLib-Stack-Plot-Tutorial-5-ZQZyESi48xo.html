tutorial inside the video lecture series
on data visualization with the Python so
in this tutorial this is a fifth lesson
so let's go straight to the fibrillation
so instead of fifth lesson we are going
to see about how to draw the stat plot
so let's see how this that plot looks
like so I have searched on internet how
that looks like so how the stacked plots
are useful for the visualizing data so
till now we have seen that for
individual x-value there is only one y
value is associated but suppose for each
x value if you have a more than y with
one y value you want to associate it
with that so in this case you can use
this stat plot so here in this case like
for each x value there are total five
different Y values are associated so
let's take example of our stock market
so stock market is running for the
mostly none of 5 days so and for each
days we'll try to display either Google
Facebook Yahoo Apple or Microsoft stock
prices ok for each so for each day there
are four or five companies are there
whose stock price we want to display so
in this case we can use this stat plot
functionality so let's try to generate
first day so we just simply you first a
second third fourth fifth we have total
5 days
Google share support first date was of
45 and a 50 10 34 then 78 these are all
hypothetical data you can take anything
for the visualization purpose we are
using it
let's take Microsoft
bacon apple well normally have a very
high stock price so we'll go with the
three figure this link data looks very
well but any Facebook so we just simple
right FB
so what we did here actually this is our
x-axis that for each day how much stock
price of individually these four company
has then we are trying to visualize this
with alpha stat plot so for each day
let's take a first day the Google stock
price is 45 Microsoft Apple is a 234 of
Facebook as a 10 so let's try to display
with the help of this stat plot or
functionality of matplotlib so we have a
PNP we just closed it last lectures
figure stack not here we will supply
days as our x-axis as an input and all
those four variable as our output value
so one by one we can supply it Google
Microsoft
have fun and Facebook so let's just for
this graph okay so you can see that term
very this big value that is the nearly
800 for each there is the first day this
is the second day this is a hard name
stock price is a fourth day and this is
a fifth day stock price so if you see
very first days occupies are a very
common some of them are forty five and
twelve so somewhere it will be here and
then also then there is a two hundred
and one is 234 so this way the four
different data series for each
individual x-axis or individual in that
time you can visualize with an of this
stat plot so that's it for this lecture
about stat plot in a subsequent lecture
we will see about what is the pipe lot
