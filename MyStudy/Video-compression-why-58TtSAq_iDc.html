lecture series on engineering and
computer science related concept so in
this tutorial we are going to see about
why this video compression is required
so rather than explaining about the
actual algorithm working on a video
compression or audio or any kind of data
compression or loss your lossless
compression let us try to understand why
that particular video compression is
required then in further lecture we are
going to see about what are the actual
algorithm running behind the compression
need actually why that compression is a
must requirement while transferring
video over the internet or while
transferring from one machine to the
another machine to some other medium
also so let us try to understand this
compression need so before we start let
us try to see what are how much space is
required to store one second of video if
that video is completely nuns compressed
format so let's do some kind of small
mathematics for that let's say for one
second video we have a total 30 frame 30
frame is nothing but the 30 total images
continuously back-to-back going in front
of our face while watching the video and
each frame is 720p progressive frame so
it has a duality excel in a width and
720 pixel in a height and each pixel is
being represented by one red one green
and one blue color so each of this color
occupy 11 bites so each pixel will be
encoded with dell pop3 byard information
so let's try to calculate and very small
mathematics will apply to calculate the
size of one second of uncompressed video
how much amount of space it will take so
we have total 30 frame each frame is
1280 cross 720 in a mega pixel and each
pixel is required three bite so if you
multiply all those things you will get
somewhere around 82 point 9 44 mb so
this is by taio converted into kb and
then i have converted into mb so you can
image in the complexity or the amount of
space require
for just the one second of video it
requires almost 82 mb or 82 megabytes of
information space let's go for more than
one second so for one second we have
calculated that we require 80 2.94 44 mb
so this is all approximate figure but
somewhere around for this kind of
uncompressed video with this much
resolution it must require this much
amount of space on your hard drive let's
just linearly interpolate or extrapolate
this information so for one second we
require 82 mb size 82 MBS over physical
high drive space 41 minutes almost 60
times it requires nearly 5 EV of hard
disk space so you can imagine that just
for one minute of video we require a 5gb
of space for five minute video we
require 25 gb and for a two-hour movie
600gb so hard drive space is required
and once you are watching this video on
an Internet you need to transfer this
much amount of megabytes or gigabytes of
information just to watch a very tiny
amount of time you want to watch the
video so now you can imagine that just
how much amount of huge amount of space
is required just for uncompressed video
storage now suppose we want to transfer
this video one of our fastest internet
connection of something like a 10 mbps
internet connection from one machine to
another machine or something like you to
build stream or nay even Netflix will
stream ghost video over internet to its
millions of you in a billions of
subscribers so let's see how much amount
of time the same parameter in a first
and second column one second duration 82
mb somewhere around so on a 10 Mbps pd-1
when the internet is going at a running
it sets a peak time or even a peak speed
so it recalls 65 second so
you can see that just for a one second
of video to watch it requires 65 second
to download those amount of data so that
is not at all feasible solution for one
minute it require more than one plus our
45 minute video it requires six hours
and 42 hours movie requires almost 144
hours which is nearly six to seven days
around somewhere around so you can think
about that just for watching one second
of video on a YouTube unicum you need to
buffer this video for the 65 second and
no user is going to stay there that's
why this compression is a must
requirement actually so if all those
videos are taking this much amount of
time and this YouTube Netflix and Hulu
all those are streaming those two video
this might not exist if this compression
technology is not available to us now
let's see how this compression
technology will reduce down this space
requirement on your hard drive or
transferring data from one machine to
another machine over internet so
compression rule so almost the
compression reduces the size by the 200
times so earlier we have seen that one
second of video is required 82 mb's of
data or eighty two Emmys of transfer
require but if you apply the video
compression on a topic it just requires
somewhere around 400 kb so if you have a
simple 500 kbps connection or 2 mbps
connection this kind of video works
completely fine if you have a 10 mbps
connection it will definitely works very
fine for one-minute video we have seen
uncompressed video takes almost around
five EV but once you compress it it just
required 25 mb that is a feasible size
on which the current internet video
compression standards are working for
five minutes movie we have seen earlier
that it requires a 25 gb but once you
compress it just 25 125 method is a very
small amount of data for the five
minutes video and it's a good enough to
see in a XD quality video for
movie it was earlier 600gb and it took
around six to seven days to download but
now we were just the 3g bees actually so
that is a very reasonable amount of
space requirement and due to less space
it require it requires a list I'm also
to transfer over internet from one
machine to the another machine so that's
it for this lecture friends I hope you
enjoy listening this video in a future
lecture we will going to see about a
different video compression algorithm
this lecture we have seen about wider
compression is required thank you guys i
hope you enjoy listening to BBC video
