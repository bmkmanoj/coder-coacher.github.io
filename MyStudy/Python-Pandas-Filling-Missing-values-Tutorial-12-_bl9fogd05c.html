lecture series on a data analysis with
help of Buyten so in a last tutorial we
have seen about how you can filter the
data how you can discard the data
whatever the data's are missing based on
your some rules now in this tutorial we
are going to see about how you can fill
those missing data so sometimes it may
happen that there are a few records
having to just few columns are missing
so you just do not want to discard that
data but you want to fill with some kind
of constant value or constant value
based on individual features or
individual call them all you want to put
this just a mean value of across the
that particular feature on the place of
method missing data so let's see how we
can do it with the help of this find us
library on the top of this data frame
object okay so I have already created
when a sample data frame which uses an
earlier tutorial so let's just import
this data frame before that is important
in pandas and we'll import this numpy
library
for describing this NN value not a
number value let's print this DF
the typo here
okay so it has printed there are four
rows and a three column and the first
row has all values second row has to
none value this third row has all three
bye loser missing value so in this way
there are couple of values are available
and couple of values are missing missing
means not a number now suppose in case
of this all those value if you want to
replace with some kind of constant value
let's see how we can do it ring so to
fill this constant value we can apply
fill function
and so freely not a number function we
can apply on the top of this data frame
option and we supply this constant value
by which you want to replace all the
missing value into currently data's
frame object so let's see we want to
replace it with a zero okay so wherever
there is a mission value it has replaced
by the zero and it has returned as the
new data frame object so it is all about
the constant value throughout the full
data frame object now suppose based on
individual columns we need to replace
different different value so something
like on a first column vivo wherever the
data's are missing we want to replace by
a minus bi this is the example I have
taken then our second column we want to
replace it by zero and a third column we
need to replace it by fine so how we can
do it so same function we can apply so
instead of passing just constant value
we can pass the dictionary or object
here so we can pass like on a gee road
column replace all value by minus five
now first column replace all value by
the zero and let's third column on us
index which is having a second all
values by the five now let's see what
will come okay so if you compare
original data frame object with this one
all value which is having the missing it
has filled up by minus y naught first
column in a second is zero and in a
third one it's a file okay so this way
column level filling you can do with
some kind of constant value suppose we
want to apply some kind of median or
averaging of full data wherever there is
a missing data so how we can do it
so same function we can apply it's all
about your creativity that how you want
to use this field function and inside
the field function you can put any kind
of mathematical logic based on rows or
bells don't column or paste on your
individual data so you can apply D F dot
mean so there are a hell lot of
statistical functionalities are
available inside this or the pandas
library so you can apply this means so
it will calculate the mean wherever for
those value for which this values are
available for cells for which these
values are available and it will
calculate the mean and it will put this
mean across wherever this there is a
missing value okay so mean is 3.25 so it
has capped it here well the well values
were missing here also 4.4 55 so across
the column it has calculated the mean
and it has put it inside this missing
okay this is all about how then put
constant value or you can find a mean
and you can plug it across the column
now suppose you want to interpolate the
value so whatever the values are
available with respect to that
particular column or something let's try
to understand with some example so let's
just consider first column so it has a
five point zero one point five and there
are two missing value across the first
feature or first column so what does
this Interpol it mean so interpolate is
a lot of matter we are going to see
couple of for one by one the third and a
fourth row has a missing value so
whatever the most immediate numbers are
available it will just in Interpol it so
in the case of first column one point
files the immediate number is available
so it will just replicate it 1.5 1.5
here
in case of second column 2.9 is the most
immediate so here it will replace 2.9
2.9 in case 8.0 and 8.0 so let's see how
we can do it we can use the same
function we learn and we can supply one
mattered in metal name is
okay so you know achieve the result one
point five is here two point nine in
this lesson eight point zero okay so
this way we can fill the missing value
if suppose you want you your data is
very much crucial with respect to those
particular record of particular feature
and you don't want to discard the data
this way you can fill up and you can go
for further processing of your data so
