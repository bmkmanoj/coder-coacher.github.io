video series on pandas pandas is nothing
but the one of the Python module for
special if used for the data science
data analysis kind of purpose so in this
video lecture C's we are going to see
about this pandas module so let's begin
with the very first tutorial and let's
see how this pandas will be helpful for
the different data analysis purpose so
in this first lesson we are going to see
about how we will install this pandas
library in your PC or open to machine
what are the normal naming convention or
importing convention for this pandas you
how you can create the pandas very basic
data structure of data frame and how you
can visualize this data so as far as
installation is concerned either on a
Windows or Linux you can use the pipe
installer and you can simply type this
command so this is the one way we can do
it let's try to do it on my machine sudo
we install and us so they are saying it
is already been installed so this way
you can install it either under your PC
or Windows or Linux machine this is one
way there is another way is a anaconda
distribution so either you can go with
Anna ponder so anaconda is a Aeterna
package distribution software which
provides almost more than a 200 around
different scientific manipulation
related the package inside this anaconda
so by default is finders will be
included as a part of distribution of
anaconda so this is all about
installation process either you can go
with this peak paper and there are a lot
of other ways also let's not walk down
deep into very much
detail of it now let's say about what
other general naming convention
importing convention for this pandas
library so for pandas we will use a
Lea's name P DS of unum find us as PD
okay so we have successfully imported
this panda so every function inside this
Panda library we are going to reference
it with the help of name just PD so that
is a sort name we have renamed from
pandas to PD now let's see how we can
create this data frame how does a pandas
library will be are helpful for the data
analysis so let's image in our data is
in a very tabular format like a SQL
table like a structure so let's create a
some hypothetical data or pandas V is
anyhow going to provide some web data
reader from where we can fetch some of
the data and let's see what are the
different manipulation our small or we
can visualize this data so for that
pandas is already one is the data reader
library let's go with a very good
finance API of either Google or Yahoo
from Google and Yahoo will features some
of the data and wheeler dish we will
display so we need a suppose some data
from the Google's API let's fetch the
stock price of Google itself from the
Google Finance API between some start
date and end it so we need to define
some date of start and end so let's
define start date so it is a date time
object so that day time object we need
to first import this date time input
date time okay we have imported in and
let's define our start date and end date
real time date love play time and we
will supply first is suppose or 2015 is
a year and then month and then data same
way we can define the end date on so
date time dot date time follow whole
year of 2015 let's define it 2015 1231
okay so we have successfully defined a
start date and end date
now let us what we need to do from
Google Finance API
data reader will page stop rise of
Google from start and end date so for
that we need to import some pandas io
data import module packets so let's
import it first here input find us dot
IO dot data so we will import it as a
like as we are fetching some at this
data as a web data so we will import
this convention as a web move so it is
just the warning that they are going to
sip this package from next one version
to some other places inside that code
structure so just ignore it for timing
now we have dis pandas dot input output
module inside that they have written
this data fetching module so we can
reference this our data reader bit
alphab wave function a web reference so
web dot de tar readers these capital
data reader and we will provide which
stock price you want to fetch suppose
Google so Google as a sort form of group
and from which Finance API you want to
face from Google itself will face the
Google stock price we tell of Google
Finance API so between start and end
date and we will store it into some
reference variable like a DF because it
is nothing but a data frame
data structure of this pipe panda's
library so let's run it and see okay so
we have got all those data inside this
DF variable now let's display what is
this DF so it might have a lot of amount
of data so just to display our very few
records from the earlier fire records or
a very large fire records we can use
this head function so it will just
display first PI records from this a
full data frame okay so it has a
displayed for us like in 2015 this is
the second general in January 5th gen
you Airy so deity is nothing but our
index actually for each date this is the
open price of in a morning time very
open price of Google stock price this is
a very high price so what is the maximum
value it has gone for that day same way
what is the minimum value of that stock
price of Google gone for the dead day
and what is the closest price so which
day the the ending price of death and
how much volumes of share has been
transacted in that day so this is all
about the first second January then the
second record contains the 50 January
record then a 6th January 7th and 8th
January so 3 &amp;amp; 4 January is not there
because it might have been holiday or
new weekends time so weekend time stock
price is always close that close so we
haven't got the data for 3rd and 4th
January so this way we have got all data
of the Google stock price based on a
Google Finance API between some date
range so we have got all data in our
Python or pandas data structure of data
frame now very few first PI records we
have to visualize suppose we want to
visualize first twenty records instead
of I just supply the argument and it has
displayed the twenty record for us total
so this is a about how you can generate
first few records with the help of head
function now let's see how we can do
suppose we want to see the last ten
records then same way we can instead of
head we can use the tail function which
is loss which will display the last 10
so whatever the date we have given 31st
December from the 31st December last 10
record it has displayed so in this way
we can visualize what are the data is
available first few records or last few
records suppose we want to visualize the
each and every record don't apply any
function just be F and DF as displays
almost every records which is available
so what it is saying that this is having
a Phi call on spy columns is nothing but
either open price of the stock o high
price of the stock for that day lowest
price of the stock for that day and what
is the closest price of the stock for
that day and the volume the amount of
this talk has been transacted on
particular way so display the five
column has been organized for there are
two hundred and fifty two records so you
can imagine that out of this 365 days
market has been open on the for the two
hundred and fifty two days so this way
we can see all the data inside this data
frame data structure data frame variable
now this is all about how we have seen
the death data what is the actual data
inside that in a numerical format so can
we visualize this visualize the data so
for visualization purposes all ready
create a one brand new video series on a
mat plot clip so we are going to use
this matplotlib library so let's just
important let's visualize
individual columns as a line chart or a
kind of bar chart way okay first let's
import this map plot lip dot pie plot
PLT so it has imported this pipe load
from matplotlib library and rename it to
the PLT and we will import some style
also so just for a good-looking purpose
click input style now there are a lot of
styles are available so let's just print
the style and select just any one of
them
Oh style dot available okay so it has
sewn as lot of different style let's
just take any one of them like Seaborn
not book and let's just apply it style
so while visualizing of disproving graph
it we'll use this kind of theme that's
nothing more than that
inside it okay so we have pasted in now
we have done all necessary import
statement for the visualization of our
data now all our data is available
inside this DF variable D of reference
so DF is nothing but the data frame
frame data frame data structure so
suppose we want to visualize the very
open a price of individuating dividual a
day of the date range what we have given
in as a line chart format so what we can
do we can just do open and we can apply
the plot so plot has been given as a
part of this matplotlib library but that
same function function you can apply on
the top of individual column and just
plot dot so for the actual visualization
purpose okay so it has sown as displayed
what is the open price for individual
day of during this whole year of 2050 so
this is just the single record we have
displayed now suppose we want to display
the close price the same way we can do
this is the all closing price of
individual days okay now suppose we want
to change this theme to some other name
it has okay it has little bit different
it had us on so this looks little nice
so we have displayed this closing of
price of individual day so if you
observe this full DF variable data so
whatever this closing price of
individual a five hundred and twenty
four point eighty one dollar five
hundred and thirteen point $87
so it has displayed a so this way you
can see that across the whole year how
much stock price has gone up and down
across the full year so this is all
about the individual column you can
display but suppose you want to display
the all Phi at the same time then don't
no need to apply individual columns you
just supply the plot function as a
reference to the DF variable so you can
see that it is difficult to visualize
but it has almost plot each and every
graph there must be some styling issue
might be okay so this way we can
visualize individual data of data frame
data structure which is in a tabular
format so that's it for this lecture
friends in the next tutorial we will see
how different manipulation in or you can
do on the top of this data frame and
what are the other kind of data
structures are available inside despite
turn pandas library I hope you enjoy
