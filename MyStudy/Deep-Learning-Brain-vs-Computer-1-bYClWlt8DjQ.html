lecture series on a neural network and
deep learning so before we dive into
actual different neural network related
algorithm or even artificial
intelligence related very advanced
algorithm before that let's try to
analog our digital computer what we hope
built till now based on the one now main
architecture let's try to compare it its
differences and a similarity with dal
pop brain so in next couple of video we
are trying to make a comparison between
our actual brain which is the created by
the creator and the computer which is
created by human as Earth so in this
tutorial we are going to find out the
differences and similarities between the
brains and a computer so we will try to
explore the question like are you or are
as a human being are smarter than a
computer or computers are faster than
you so we will try to explore with
differences and a similarity between a
computer and a brain we'll try to answer
this question okay so let's start with a
very first differences between a brain
and a computer so let's try to
understand that how this brain in
computer is made up of what are the
basic fundamental building blocks of
computer in a brain so let's see about
the brain so brain is made up of a huge
amount of mirror almost around as 100
billion neurons are available
approximately in our brain as a adult
who had all people brain and all neurons
are connected to the synapses so every
single piece here you are looking that
is a neuron this is another neuron and
both of these neurons are connected via
synapses and they are transferring or
exchanging the different chemical
element that's how the information flows
in our brain from the one neuron mm and
even to the another or neuron let's see
how this basic building blocks of
computer is different from the brain so
computer is made up of transistors so
transistor is nothing but the silicon
based different different
chips so this is the basic difference
between a brain and a computer that
computer is made up of transistor and a
brain is made up of a neuron in and each
and every neuron as are connected to the
synapses whereas the computers are made
up of either trunk CPU or central
processing unit or a memory or even a
secondary memory your hard disk all are
made up of transistor and a millions of
billions of transistors are connected in
a very small tiny chip let's like to see
another difference let's compare this
brain and computer with respect to
another one dimension of the memory so
with respect to memory we have seen in
last slide that individual neurons in
our brains are connected with the
synapses so in this synergies they are
exchanging via synapses individual
neurons are exchanging different
chemical and that is where the memories
are stored suppose something very bad or
something could happen in your past life
or a past lifetime of this life so
whatever that informations are there
whatever the information you collect
throughout your lifetime that is all
stores in a synapses where is in a
computer all memories are stored in a
transistor that is what the basic
building blocks of transistor and all
transistors works in a two different
state either in on state or off state or
equivalent to the 1 or 0 signal let's
see how we can add a more memory to the
brain and a computer so suppose we want
to add more memory to the brain we need
to make this synapses connection even
more stronger the more stronger the your
synapses connections are there there
will be a more memory available in your
brain either you keep generating or it's
implicit process the moment you acquire
this knowledge which is completely new
the new synergies connection will be
created and that synapses connection
will try to connect the individual to
different concepts are T to different
neurons Dorina brain so stronger the
synapses connection more memory will be
available but suppose we want to add
more memory to the computer how we can
add it so we can add more chips
there will be more memory available
suppose we have a 4 GB memory card in
your cell phone you add another 4 GB
card automatically your memory capacity
of your phone will be doubled so that
will become 8 gigabytes of memory so
that is how we can add more memory to
brain and how it is different from the
computer for adding the morning let's
see in terms of learning how computer
behaves and how our brain BM so brains
are very faster in learning and new
things suppose let's take one example
that you want to learn about the piano
and you don't know anything about the
piano except the very few minor things
or as object you're seen in your
childhood or now but now you think that
I want to learn about the piano so maybe
within a 2 or 3 months or even a 5
months depending on a different brain
but at least you grasp the basic concept
of how piano at list of works and how
you can make a different tune out of it
or we the very small small tunes out of
it but computers are very bad at
learning the new things why this is so
because we don't know how brain
represent information the way brain
represent information is fundamentally
completely different from the way
computer represent information in their
Hadees or even a secondary or a primary
memory so whenever we want computer to
do something explicit programmer like us
needs to sit and needs to set up the
whole of programming logic and we need
to tell and tell computer that you need
to do this thing that way you need to do
this thing in this another way so that's
how we need to keep teaching the
computer but that is not an actual
teaching it is something like we are
giving just an instruction to the
computer so that is what the basic
building our
or fundamental difference between brain
and a computer that computers are very
bad at learning new things but due to
advance in a neural network kind of
models of the brain we are incorporating
those models of brain into computer so
slowly slowly computers are also
becoming little more smarter and smarter
day by day so that is what the
difference now let's see another
difference in terms of multitasking
capability of the brain and a computer
so brain itself is a multitask but in
terms of memory processing or even a
brain level mental processing it does
then does only one task but along with
that brain controls all those breathing
and even heart rate blood pressure at
the same time so you can consider as the
man brain is also multitasking unit
whereas in case of computer computer
itself is a multitask because at the
same time you can perform hell lot of
operation like you can tell them better
that count backward very fast actually
computer will start doing it
intermediately you tell computer that
you you come multiply these two number
and give me so before it's reached to
the counting operation at the end it
will just come multiplies to number also
and before that only it might give also
so that how it shows that both things
are a kind of multitask personality but
in terms of mental processing if we give
instruction to the computer to to mean
to do two tasks it will not perform so
these are all implicit as brain
indirectly performance but as explicitly
if we view two mathematical or logical
problem to the computer come to the
brain brains are very bad at doing those
things brain can only handle one task at
the same time but these are all the
controlling the other parts of body
brain handles it very well that's why it
has a multi task a burden so that's it
for this lecture friends I hope you
enjoy listening this video in a future
lecture we will try to explore even more
differences and similarity between brain
and computer please do like command
