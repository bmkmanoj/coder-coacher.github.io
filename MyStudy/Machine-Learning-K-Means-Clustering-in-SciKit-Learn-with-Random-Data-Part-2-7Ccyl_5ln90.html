lecture series on a machine learning so
in a last tutorial we have seen about
the theory behind k-means clustering
algorithm and in this tutorial we are
going to see about how one can implement
this case means algorithm or we can use
the ready-made functions available
inside the scikit-learn library for
using the k-means clustering algorithm
so I have done all necessary inputs like
a binders library maybe we will use or
may not will use numpy library imploded
I am ported matplotlib library for
visualization of data and my problem in
line for displaying graph here only
actually in Jupiter not performed so let
me just print it or execute it too okay
I have successfully imported all three
library now will generate some random
data in a two dimensional space and then
we will apply this k-means clustering
algorithm on the top of this data with
help of ready-made function available in
a scikit-learn library so I have written
some small script to generate this
random data in a two dimensional space
there are total 100 data and each is
having a two dimensional ax and why it
will generate it so first 50 data I have
clustered into or I have form into
around a one group of flushed but in a
prior we don't know which data point
belongs to which group or which cluster
point and another 50 points I have
generated into another space or another
place in a two-dimensional space so
let's just generate this data and let me
just a display this data in a two
dimensional space which we have seen in
a last lecture okay so I have generated
this hundred data point almost this form
of data is coming into one group of
cluster and this form of data is forming
another group of clutched
now we don't know which data point
belongs to which group because this
k-means algorithm is unsupervised way of
learning algorithm so what task is to
group this data into number of cluster
so here we are defining the number of
cluster k is equal to two so before that
let's just make some necessary inputs so
from a scalar dot cluster we are going
to import the k-means k-means there are
lot of other clustering algorithms are
also available which we are going to see
in a future lecture but in this lecture
we are going to see the k-means
clustering algorithm so I am just
importing this k-means clustering
algorithm okay so I have successfully
imported this k-means algorithm now
let's create one object of this game in
cell
here we need to supply a number of
clusters so we are going to form this
whole data set point which we have
randomly generated we want to cluster
into two different group based on the
similarity of the data and we'll assign
it to them let's see came in very simple
reference came in children okay so we
have successfully created the came in
reference
now let's supply this came in with the
data so we have a one function fit on
the top of K mean reference and we'll
supply this data so whatever the data we
have generated randomly will supply it
to the k-means object okay so it has
written as lot of different parameters
beaching default it has assumed while
running the algorithm still we haven't
run any kind of algorithms so what it is
telling that initialization is k-means
plus plus so there is a little more
gradient version or optimized version of
the k-means algorithm also available
which displeasure came in circuit we'll
use total maximum amount of 300
iteration it will do number of clusters
we have already provided as input so it
has taken into two this way there are a
lot of other total default value it will
take you can change those default value
while creating the constructor for this
k-means class now we have already
supplied this data to the k-means
constructor we have created the k-means
object now let's find this our centroid
with help of scikit-learn built-in
functionality so k-means has
cluster scientists so what it will do
actually we have already supplied that
number of cluster is equal to two so it
will return us the total two values
which is nothing but the centroid or the
representative for the individual
cluster and then we can say that the
points which is much which is nearest to
this particular center is forming one
group of cluster and point which is
nearest to the another second centroid
which is forming the another group of
points which forms the another cluster
so let's just sprint it so we have got
the two points one is the minus 0.99 and
- 0.96 so you can visualize this - 0.99
somewhere it will be here and another
will be one point ninety one and a two
point thirteen based on the grade data
we have generated so it will form
somewhere here so let's just display it
with the help of plot functionality so I
have already created a small snippet of
fold for the visualization and let's
just put this data
as a center it and are the second point
also will display
okay so let me just run it okay so we
have successfully got the two very
nearest us centroid the point with
respect to one cluster and this is with
respect to the another cluster though
this form of data is forming the one
cluster in this set of data forming the
another cluster so this is how or we can
use the built in functionality available
in a cycling library this game is
clustering algorithm there lot of other
property is also associated with the
k-means clustering alone let's see about
that so with k-means there is one
property like a labels so what this
label will give us label will give us
the individual data point belongs to
which cluster okay so it has given
almost first 50 points belongs to the
cluster zero or you can say any name is
just the matter of convention it's in a
one cluster and remaining 50 are in
another cluster because the way I have
generated this data this 51st point I
have taken in this space in another 50
point into this space so they are
forming another cluster and this is
forming another cluster so this is all
about the k-means algorithm how you can
supply data and how you can form the
group suppose you have already supplied
this data and already algorithm has been
run at least once now suppose you have a
some testing point and you want to
predict that particular a testing point
belongs to which cluster whether it's in
a green cluster or in a red cluster so
let's define some sample data set so
let's see taste is equal to we'll use
the numpy library or a functionality
array
so let's define one point very farther
from here so we are expecting that it
should belongs to this red cluster so
let's define like 4 comma 4 that's okay
one thing that we need to reshape it
this 3 shape to the 1 comma minus 1
because we are supplying just the one
data set as a testing data set that's
why 1 row an arbitrary number of columns
let's assign it to another reference
test 1 now we'll supply this to the
Cayman predict functionalities so it
will predict for us that particular
point or a testing point 4 comma 4
belongs to whether its inner red cluster
or inner green cluster so let's just
give it a stir okay so it has given an
array 1 so this form of data 1 wherever
is there is a 1 in earlier command we
have seen it this form of data belongs
to that in this cluster 1 1 all 1 and we
have given also array value is equal to
1 so definitely it is signifies that 4
comma 4 belongs to cluster havinga this
point and this point has a
representative this red mark now let's
take suppose minus 3 comma 3 and let's
see what results we can get
okay now let's just run it again okay in
this case we have got a zero so minus
three comma three lies here and by
visualization we can easily predict that
it should belongs to this green cluster
so whatever point available inside the
creased green cluster it should contain
inside this in this cluster and this
cluster has been identified by the value
0 what we have seen in earlier command
k-means underscore label so that's why
it has given a value 0 so that's it for
this lecture friends we have almost
covered up how the k-means algorithm
k-means clustering algorithm works in a
scikit-learn library in a future lecture
we are going to apply this same
functionality same algorithm in a
scikit-learn library one is some
standard data set like mmm nice handling
handwriting character recognition data
set or a Ivy's data set or any other
standard data set to actually grasp the
concept how this game is learning
algorithm is working what kind of
parameter or hyper parameter are
associated with it you can keep changing
this number of cluster also and it will
form another kind of set of groups also
