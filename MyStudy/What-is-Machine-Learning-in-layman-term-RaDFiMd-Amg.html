shopping on Amazon Amazon will give you
a product recommendation so how Amazon
does this all those things how netflix
give you a movie edition how Google
knows whether your photo contains your
cat dog or your sweetheart at the beach
watching a beautiful sunset or how
Google Translate will translate one
language sentence into another language
centers or even wonders how Apple CD or
a Google speech recognition recognize
your voice and translate it into text
with such a high accuracy so we standing
behind all those intelligent systems
what kind of computer systems are
responsible for a machine learning
artificial intelligence deep learning
neural networks are the heart of all
those systems so let's try to understand
with one example let's say you like
fruit a mango one day you go for the
mango shopping but you don't know how to
choose a mango then you remember your
grandmother's one rule to choose the
mango your grandmother's ate three
bright yellow mango are very sweet so
you buy some mango from a market and you
taste them but they are not as sweet as
you would like your grandmother rule is
not 100 percent correct
so after tasting lot of mango you found
out that those mango which are big
bright yellows they are sweet but
remaining small price yellow mango are
not necessarily to be sweet so you
created another rule to choose the mango
next time you go for the shopping now
you know the rule to choose the mango
but this time vendor from whom you
bought the mango were not available so
you bought the mango from another vendor
who supply mango from another country so
you buy them and taste those mango but
found out that in this case small pail
mangoes are sweet to rule against you to
choose the mango
one day one of your cousin came to your
home and you want to feed her mangoes so
you apply all those rules and a
knowledge to choose the mango but your
cousin doesn't like the sweet mango see
like the juicy mango so you found out
that after tasting soft one are very
juicy so you keep adding new rule to
choose the mango let's say you go to
another country and watch mango but in
this country green mangoes are the
sweetest one so again rule updated to
select the sweet mango now you marry to
your sweetheart who doesn't like mango
but feel like slapping so all your
knowledge of gathering mango is useless
so you buy some apples for your
sweetheart and expect the rule to choose
the sweet apple so in every different
situation you change the rules to choose
the mango now with all rule to choose
the mango if you want to implement a
computer algorithm we can write lot of
decision making statements like if mango
is big variety elopes mangoes which keep
mangoes from a different countries and
if it is a tree mango is again sweet if
mango is soft it will be a juicy so
there is a never-ending process of
creating and updating that kind of rule
and no guarantee you can cover all
possible case this way of settling a
problem is too much complicated and one
cannot afford to write all those kind of
rules one by one so instead of creating
such a rule manually can machine create
all those rule automatically for you
that's where machine learning comes into
which a machine learning system will
create such a rule for us automatically
if we supply lot of training data of
mango to the machine learning algorithms
its training data contains mango
features like the color of mangoes the
size of mango the shape of the mango and
sold by beach vendor mango came from
which part of the world for an
individual mango and we have a data
about how much particular mango is sweet
juicy and write all those training data
fit to the machine learning algorithm
and eventually it will come up with the
model and that model is nothing but the
rules which we have manually extracted
so with machine learning system expected
all those rule automatically for us in
terms of models to choose the mango so
when you go for the mango shopping next
time you apply this new mango to our
model and it will tell us whether mango
is juicy sweet and ripe
so machine learning is all about finding
patterns finding rule from the
observation and a training data thank
you guys for watching please like video
and comment your views on a machine
learning and please share it with other
people and subscribe my channel for the
