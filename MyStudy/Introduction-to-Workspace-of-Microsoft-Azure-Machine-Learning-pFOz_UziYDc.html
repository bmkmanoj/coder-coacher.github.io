lecture on a video lecture series on
machine learning services in the cloud
so from this lecture on what we are
going to start about how we can use
those machine learning stabs directly
inside this her a machine learning
platform so let's begin about the very
first then what we can do very first
this I can start creating the completely
new project or a new module or a new
data set or even a new experiment will
start with the new experiment and we'll
let's name it as like a machine learning
tasting so either you can create this
blank experiment or there are a lot of
ready-made models are available in a
cloud so once you got a expert you can
directly use one of them for your
experiment purpose you can change the
different data set whatever the
ready-made functionalities are available
so for time being we are going to start
with this blank experimental it will
take little time so here you can change
this name so i am going to change tell
it like a machine learning experiment
okay so this is how you can rename it
now let's try to understand what are the
functionalities are available for us one
by one for doing those machine learning
experiment or machine learning system
design so if you see in this left column
there lot of options are available like
a save data set or a train model data
format conversion so let us try to
understand one by one we have seen in
earlier lecture that what are the
minimum and generic steps are required
for designing this machine learning
system out of that the very first step
was the selecting the data set either
you have a data set or for the prototype
purpose you can use some of the data set
so this as you're a machine learning
platform is already provide layout of it
will small data set like a desire put
code data set place
answer dataset stand these are all the
very standard data site so rather than
importing from somewhere as you can
start using those data set like Emily's
digit recognition data said movie rating
data set so you can directly use those
kind of data set and you can apply
machine learning algorithm on the top of
it so this is about the save data rate
if you don't have a save data said you
can use another module which you will
allow you to import those data set from
other database like a SQL server or
Apache high or even a Hadoop platform or
if it is a hosted on somewhere else next
is a train model so whatever the model
you have already plane it will come here
so you can directly use this as a black
box system one more next is data format
conversion so whatever the data you have
got it suppose if you do some kind of
processing on the top of it and whatever
the results you got it after that you
want to store it as a suppose CSV format
or a rff format or PS reform it you can
directly use this kind of blocks is
there and this is what our full
workspace are there so if you want to do
it just double click on it and it will
come here and once you run it and that
it will start doing its work that we are
going to see in the next lecture once we
start actually doing our experiments so
for timing i am just deleting this after
that there is a data input in date
output so one is a enter data manually
so every block has its own functionality
so either you can give it like a manual
data in a CSV format or even SVM light
format or even at PR FF 40s reform it
you can export even data you can import
those kind of data for importing their
lot of other options are available you
can import those data promise your blob
storage kind of data set you can use
this storage account of whatever
Microsoft's given us apart from that
there is a jury table as you're a SQL
database how you query you can use it
and suppose your SQL data set is
available somewhere in a remote location
you can give authentication for that and
hosting them and you can directly import
with the simple SQL query those
functionality suppose your data set is
situated somewhere in a remote location
in on some web URL you can directly use
those functionality so in this way from
the multiple location you can import
those data that's why this blogger's
given data input and a data output after
there is a data transformation suppose
you got this data you want to do some
kind of operation you want to apply some
filter or median filter these are all
image processing related filter a fire
this is a signal processing related
filter after that the lord of
mathematics and statistics related
calculation you want to put you can do
it you want to add a column to your
existing data said you are not happy
with your current it has it you want to
perform the join on those data set for
did all those modules say has been given
you want to scale those data set so
that's why this data transformation
blocks are very useful for you after
that once you are satisfied with your
data before applying this machine
learning algorithm there is a very good
things that how you can select the
feature which is nothing with a feature
selection for that there are three
different permutation feature then a
feature feature discriminate
discriminant analysis functionality and
a filter base feature selection
Microsoft has provided so suppose some
features are very useful and
contributing more for designing your
machine learning system it may happen
some features are not very useful so in
depth case
you can use those block and you can
select a useful feature after that very
important part which is nothing but the
machine learning part so for that we
have a valued model you can use this
cross validate model or a valued model
you can initialize model for that layer
a lot of regression models has been
given like a bayesian regression boosted
decision tree neural network of poisson
equation for questioning us a lot of
different algorithms like k-means
clustering for classification hell lot
of different algorithm microsoft has
already provided so you can use it those
algorithm in a cloud as a black box
system you applied those data directly
and free to your data directly your
machine learning algorithm in you can
use it after that there are number of
different models of other library like
open CV libraries has been given Python
language module suppose in some case
some staff of your designing of machine
learning system it may happen that
whatever your custom stuff you want to
perform and that is not been given
inside this ready-made module you can
directly write this python scrape and I
are more our model also you can write in
in between then you can execute those
Python script and you can get those
decide result for that you can use this
module of execute pythons creeper
execute a script the lot of statistics
functionality has been also given text
analytics platforms are there so you can
use it like a black box like you apply
some language and it will detect this
language to output will be a detection
of those language except the P plays
from this thing so these are all things
you can use it like a black box system
there is a web service once you are
satisfied with your model you can use it
like a web service model so
once you train your model you save those
model and after that whenever the new
requests come it will work it will it
has deployed as a web service so you can
call your service as a simple HTTP
requests and you will get the reason in
a real time so these are all lot of
different functionality regarding to the
machine learning experiment design given
by Microsoft Azure machine learning
platform so from next lecture on were we
are going to see this individual proxxon
we are trying to work with a very simple
one data set and then we'll slowly
slowly move towards the even higher
level steps of machine learning system
design like a selecting data and then a
cleaning data splitting data machine
learning algorithm application on the
top of it then you evaluate model what
we have seen in a last lecture so that's
it for this lecture friends I hope you
