analysis so what is univariate uni means
one variate means variable so one
variable analysis act of one time same
way we have a bivariate analysis where
we are trying to understand the
relationship between the two variable
and we have a multivariate analysis
where we are trying to find the
relationship between more than a two
variable or more than a three variable
sometimes so in this lecture we are
going to understand what are the way we
can analyze one single variable in our
data set so variable can be either
continuous let's say I will name it as a
feature one and it can be categorical so
and I will name it as an f2
so what are the matters in statistics
are available to analyze one variable at
a time and what kind of information we
can get from this analysis technique let
me draw some random data point first of
all for continuous I'll make like any
random okay
and for categorical we'll use like a e
let's say we want to classify the school
student into three three category
height is small/medium
or even you can consider like a tall
taller or it's a tallest so some is tall
I'll randomly put data somewhere taller
and one other parody tallest
now let's say we have a continuous data
how one can analyze so in statistics
there are number of things are available
measure of central tendency
so in measure of central tendency one
can use like a max mean average means
median mode kind of analysis technique
one can apply on this continuous data
and we have another measure of
depression dispersion this person also
available so techniques like a standard
deviation I'll write s as the variance
range kind of techniques are available
in a dispersion so we can use this kind
of parameter when we have a continuous
data variable we can use this type of
technique to analyze data let's say we
have a categorical variable for
categorical variable we can use a
frequency distribution chart so what
this frequency distribution table is
that for each of those class we have a
total three class available here so for
tall taller and tallest so for tall here
taller and tallest how many students
lies in two category of tall let's say
we have written any number I am writing
is for taller let's say 10 tallest let's
say three people and we can take a
percentage of those thing also so we can
use a frequency table it's nothing but
the histogram table which gives the
indication that how much percentage of
people how much percentage of a data
point lies in to one particular class
how much percentage lies in to second
particular class and how much percentage
lies in to third particular class or it
will give you an absolute value also
we can use other another way also to
visualize this categorical data like we
can use a bar chart so in bar chart or
even a pie chart we can use it pie chart
will give you indication you know round
graphics permit death how much
percentage particular class data lies
like a thirty five percentage of data
point lies in a class one but another
thirty percent line in the class two and
a remaining might be twenty five percent
lies in two or a 35 percent lies in two
class three same way one can use a bar
chart in a horizontal axis we can put
like a three category like a class one
class two class three here in this case
this is a tall taller and a tallest and
in a vertical bar we can represent how
many peoples or how many data point lies
in to that particular class how many
lies in to another class so this way we
can analyze this categorical data and
this measure of central tendency and
measure of dispersion there is one more
I think called quadrille also one can
use in this person we can use standard
deviation variation variance how much
data has been speared how because
variance is very used to remove you and
outliers also so when we want to analyze
any data set single feature one can go
with this kind of technique if data can
be continuous or data can be categorical
also if data is a continuous one can use
this technique if data is a categorical
one can use this kind of frequency table
arrangement or one can use the
visualization technique like a bar chart
pie chart even the same way we can use
the histogram chart also
so that is all about the univariate
analysis in a further lecture we'll see
about what are the techniques for a
bivariate analysis and a multivariate
analysis so if you know about some more
technique please please please write it
into comment and if you haven't
subscribed my channel please please
