unto the video lecture series on rap
scrapping and web scrapping with del pop
Python so now we'll start begin with a
very basic example of how to use the
Python library for the web spray
scrapping okay this is the first
tutorial so we'll see what we'll learn
in this tutorial first of all is the
what is the web speaking what is the
basic definition of web scrapping
software installation and how what are
the software's you require for the that
scrape scrapping we'll use generally the
Python for this and we'll the face of an
HTML page as a basic example and display
the content of written ok let's start
with what is the web scrapping we're
scrapping means scrapping means the
extracting the data in our web's
scrapping means you are extracting data
from the different different website let
us try to find this with the help of one
example let's go to google.com
now if you right click and see view page
source you will see the content whatever
the google has sent while we request to
the google.com web page it has hell lot
of contents of JavaScript EML and the
CSS now you want to extract some element
out of this full content like lot of
developments are there styles are the
lot of classes of CSS styles are there
that what the web scrapping is it but
the Google content is very clumsy and
lot of contents are there so let us try
with a very simple URL I have one very
simple one I have taken from the Python
scrapping website and they have kept it
okay this is the very simple one so if
you right click and see view page source
then you will see that it has a whole
HTML content so it has a one HTML tag
inside that there is a header is there
inside the header there is a title of
the page and after that the body
actually starts inside the body we have
a one tag h1 and now another is the
development
so web scrapping is nothing but you are
getting this data remote from the remote
computer and you are extracting the
individual
it as per your the requirement now let
us see what are the software
installation required for this so
generally I use the Python for it so you
can install the Python and if you are
already working on Ubuntu or a Linux
based system so you have already a
Python in the Python there is one
built-in module of URL Lib which is by
default came inside Python installation
so those package will use further
fetching the different webpage I'm using
on my system the Jupiter die Python or
not book you can as a development
environment you can use any other as
well to come your comforts but this is a
very good one and you can easily start
with and last one is the beautiful soap
which is another Python module willing
will install that what this beautiful
soap will actually do whatever the HTML
contained you get after the stretching
from the remote II you URL suppose
whatever the manipulation and processing
XML level HTML level you want to do you
can get it you can do it different
different elements you hope that HTML
you can extract it that's why we use
beautiful so now on to install the
beautiful soap there is a simple command
into application get manager of the
Ubuntu I have already installed so I am
NOT typing this command again this is
already installed fridges paste it on
your console it will work okay so these
are those minimum amount of software
required for the web scrapping with the
help of Beauty Python plus and beautiful
soap okay so last and hard in this tutor
we'll see about how to fetch just the
simple page the first task is import the
required Python module inside your
development environment so let us see I
have one already
Jupiter is not book available inside it
so first we will import the Python model
which are the required for URL fetching
so it has a I already our URL Lib so we
import URL
okay sorry actually you from URL live in
port you are in open so this will load
the you URL open function from the
module move inside the Python you are in
URL live now suppose we want to fetch
this webpage and want to see the content
of it
so the second task is we will use this
URL open function from it and built a
display the content of this HTML page
okay so we will use URL open and we'll
supply this URL as a argument to this
function and we will put every HTML
content inside the HTML variable so
right now we have got whole content
inside the HTML now suppose we want to
display it into HTML so HTML contains
one matter read so it will display every
element inside the HTML content what we
got from the now you can see this
element is exactly same as what we have
seen here this is exactly same so that
what that's why we have read how to read
the content from the remote URL with the
help of URL Lib library of the Python
that's all for this lecture in the
subsequent lecture we will see how to
extract this data from this URL and what
are the different manipulation you can
do how to extract the links how to
extract particular kind of element based
on classes and I tribute everything
