tutorial on a deep learning video
lecture series so in this tutorial we
are going to see about what is the
fundamental limitation of the
traditional computer programming is for
that purpose first let's see what this
traditional computer programming are
designed for which are the purposes
traditional computer programming are
very good at doing all mathematical and
logical calculation very fast but it
just explicitly follows those blind set
of instruction given by individual
computer programmer so if you want to do
very heavy mathematical calculation or a
logical calculation traditional computer
programming is the best way to go ahead
but let's see another problem let's see
about how about automatically detecting
human handwriting every human rights the
handwriting different way or detecting
or recognizing whether particular image
contains a dog or a cat look at this
picture it contains all handwritten 0 to
9 number in lot of different way the
first row represent 0 the second row
represent all 1 but there is no common
rule associated with either of 0 to 9
number everyone writes 0 differently
some write with full close ring or some
write with some little open thing so
there is no common rule how about rule 4
the 4 &amp;amp; 8 still it's very difficult to
put into computer so there is no common
rule so if you want to program a
computer which automatically detect this
0 to 9 from this image pixel it will be
very difficult for a computer program to
define this set of rule in terms of
instruction of the computer so even if
somehow be able to write those rules it
will become a too much complicated and
will keep building the complexity on a
top of it so there is no single and
simple rule to detect and recognize
either zero to nine so our traditional
computer programming are not made to
solve such a kind of problem there are
lot of other problems like object
recognition speech synthesis automatic
translation from one human language to
the another human language speech
recognition system allies in this kind
of problem which computer cannot solve
with the traditional way of computer
programming all those cannot be
represented with a simple set of
instruction traditional computer
programming are not made to solve this
kind of problem so we need completely
different way of computer programming to
solve such a kind of problem and this is
what the fundamental limits of computer
programming is so we need to go towards
the different way like artificial
intelligence machine learning deep
learning kind of parody grammar and that
is what we are seeing in this video
lecture series so I hope you enjoy
listening this video and if you haven't

guys bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
