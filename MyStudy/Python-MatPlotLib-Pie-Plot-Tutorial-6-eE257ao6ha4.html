tutorial inside the video lecture series
on data visualization with the help of
Python so in this lecture we are going
to see about this is the lesson number
six we are going to see about the pie
plot so let's begin
how'd the pie chart how we can display
the pie chart so I have searched on
internet then how that pie chart looks
like what is the useful and
visualization V of this pie chart so you
can take a very good analogy of this pie
chart whatever Domino's or results B's
actually so what this pie chart is
useful for the visualization purpose
that individual data point across the
full enter and data series how much
individual data point contributes has
been displaced by the individual areas
of the full length area of this circle
so individual angled or in represent the
individual data point which we supply so
let's take it with the example and let's
display with Al for matplotlib library
so let's take example of our daily
routine 24 hours activity suppose out of
this 24 hours some activity some house
we do sleeping so let's take 8 hours
will do sleeping tours we do have a
heating time 10 hours may be working
time so we have a total 4 hours left
maybe 4 hours we can put it into plane
journey and will supply this to the pie
chart
data let's plot it so you will get idea
let's so there is a so function for the
displaying okay
so of what it has done is out of this 24
hours how much this individual data has
been contributed based on that it has
find a different angle then for each of
this angle it has provided this data
contribution out of this full-length
series data so you can see there's the
tan is the highest one so the red part
is contributing this 10 this is the 2 so
2 hours you are taking for eating
purpose 10 hours for your working
purpose these 8 hours you're sleeping is
indicated by blue this all colors and
the radius of this circle everything you
can customize once you go through the
documentation of the pie chart let's try
to see very equal proportion of data
like
suppose six ARS you are doing one
activity another six are done adults
another six cells another so ultimately
you can visualize that what kind of
graph it will generate so you have equal
amount of proportion of individual
activity you are trying to do in this 24
hours so out of this 360 degree angle
each 90 degree angle will contribute to
the six six hours
so let's display it okay that's correct
so each activity one you are taking this
much amount of time at 82 so insert this
pie chart is trying to convince us that
how individual data point is contribute
or beauty based on the angle of
individual area sector okay that's it
for this lecture I hope you enjoy
