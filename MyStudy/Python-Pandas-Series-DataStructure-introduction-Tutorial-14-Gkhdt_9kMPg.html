lecture series on data analysis with the
help of Python so in this tutorial we
are going to see about what is the
series data structure inside the finders
library so what is the series data
series data is a one kind of one
dimensional data which changes with
respect to different instants of time
you can consider the stock price data or
a weather data so in case of stock price
every day or you can consider every day
as a one instance of time and every day
the stock price change so you can
consider as a one dimensional data in
case of weather also for particular city
or particular area wise the weather
change condition change across the time
that you can consider as a series kind
of data structure so in this tutorial we
are going to see about how you can take
those series data inside the pipe
pythons Panda library and then you can
perform many operation on the top of it
so let's make some necessary imports for
series data so we'll import find us as
PD ok so we have successfully imported
these pandas
now let's create first a very simple
series structure so what we what we can
do on the top of 3d we can supply simple
one dimensional array to the series
function of this pandas so let's say 2
comma minus 3 7 and we'll assign it to
some object reference obj ok so it has
created obj reference per us let's just
print it obj okay so we haven't provided
any kind of indexing so it has created
the series data structure for us with a
value 2 minus 3 1 and 7 each of these
values are integers 64-bit way
representation and you can access
individual value with the index 0 1 2 3
but we haven't provided the custom index
later we'll see how we can provide even
a custom
index so suppose we want to see just the
values how we can see the values of okay
so it has written as all the values
associated with particular series so 2
minus 3 1 and 7 so this is a very simple
way you can create a series now let's
create the series with providing some
index value associated with that so what
we'll do we'll Pro we'll use the same
function series we'll assign it to
reference obj one but externally we will
supply the index something like d1 array
of indexing was really
okay so you can supply data as a array
of object and you can supply explicitly
the index as a array of objects so here
we have given index it be a CB so these
associated with the first value - who is
associated with - 3 3 our C's indexing C
has a value 1 and index B has a 7 now
let's see how it looks like let's just
print it home obj one object okay so DS
look - a - 3 C is equal to 1 and B is
equal to 7 now suppose we want to access
the individual element based on the
indexing value so
let's say obj1 okay I should have
written it here actually because I have
already given a title let's access this
value based on index or based on a
condition so I'll use this seller obj1
let's say we want to find a value whose
index is C okay so you can internally
supply this C as an index value and it
will return as one so that is the value
associated with that you can even supply
the condition inside that also so
suppose we want all the positive values
only so you can supply condition like
obj1 greater than zero so give me all
values of object one whose value is
greater than zero only so this way it
will evaluate this condition and it will
return only those element which satisfy
this condition so in our case one only
my element only is negative remaining
are all positive so it should return all
those three value with even indexing is
please also D is associated with two E's
has been removed because it's the
negative value C is equal to 1 and B is
equal to 7
okay now suppose we want to do any kind
of mathematical operation on the top of
it so pj 1 let's say each and every
component or each and every value of
this data structure we want to multiply
by 2 so we can just write star by 2
multiplied by 2 so each and every
element has been multiplied by 2 so that
way you can perform any kind of
mathematical operations suppose we want
to generate the square of each and every
so double star and 2 so it will generate
a square of individual element of whole
series data structure so this is how you
can create a very simple series data
structure how you can access the
individual element based on some
condition or based on some index value
how you can perform some mathematical
operation on the top of it but majority
time we have see this data's are
available inside the file or even a
built-in data structure of Python so
either you can read it and you can
externally supply and you can create the
array and then array you can supply to
series data structure or suppose you
have a data available inside the Python
dictionary data structure suppose you
have a data available in a Python
dictionary data structure then how we
can convert into series data structure
and you can generate or you can
manipulate all kind of possible
operation on the top of this series data
structure so let's create a very simple
data reference which is having a
dictionary objects so something like
okay let's take a very hypothetical data
like London every city is associated
with some number there is no meaning of
any number in this case London is equal
to 10 Tok you're like 72
New York I have taken all 100 and let's
say Mumbai is only 50 so this is a
series data structure so if you display
this something London 10 Mumbai is equal
15 so this way now suppose we want to
import those data inside the series data
structure the same way what we have the
way we have created the simple series
data structure you can externally supply
this dictionary object directly to the
series data structure now let's see how
we can do it series and as argument you
can directly supply this data data is
nothing but the series dictionary object
so it will return as some series data
structure which we have assigned to obj
to reference now let's print of each
item okay so it has created London near
Mumbai New York and Tokyo as an indexing
value indexing and ten fifteen hundred
and seventy-two as a value the way we
have supplied inside the dictionary
object so that way you can create the
series data structure and all kind of
operation which is possible on the
series data structure you can perform on
it so thank you guys for watching that's
it for this lecture friend I hope you
