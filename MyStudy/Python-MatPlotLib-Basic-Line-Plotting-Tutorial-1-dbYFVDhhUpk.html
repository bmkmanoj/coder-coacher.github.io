series I am starting on data
visualization inside this Python so for
the visualization of different data
inside the Python we are going to use
this mat prot live library this is one
of the very famous one okay so this
relation one in this relation we are
going to see about how we will install
this matplotlib live library or what are
the import convention of the matplotlib
library and in the first lecture we will
see well how is the basic line plotting
works inside this library so let's start
about it first of all the installation
so as far as installation is concerned
there are multiple ways to install this
library if provided your Python is
already installed so if you go for a
anaconda distribution either you are on
a Windows Linux or Mac already this
package is available among that 200 or
more package which provided by this
anaconda distribution so you do not need
to worry about it matplotlib is already
installed provided you have already
installed the anaconda distribution
suppose you aren't install that and you
want to explicitly install this thing
inside this a Linux or Windows then with
the help of easy distribution you just
type this command beep install MyPlate
lord matplotlib library and it will
install this matplotlib library inside
your Linux or Windows system so let's
see about what are the import convention
what are the what is the usual way of
people importing this matplotlib library
while using into system so for that
important
Matt plot lead what PI plot and we will
rename it to the PLP so from next time
onwards will refer every function with
the help of this PLT name that's a very
short form for this pi plot package
inside this matplotlib module ok now
let's see what how this basic plotting
will works inside this matt blood line
so whatever the plot we are going to
display that is either in the to'
dimension or in a later videos it will
be in a three dimension so first of all
it will be on a two dimension basis on
so we need to provide the one dimension
value as a horizontal axis dimension and
one is the vertical axis dimension value
none which is nothing but the X values
and a Y values which you can provide
with the help of Python list data
structure so let's define a to Python
list data structure like X is a
horizontal one like 1 comma 2 comma 3
comma 5 comma 6 which is nothing but our
horizontal values and Y is give any
value like 2 comma 6 comma 0 comma
- 1 comma 5 comma 7 okay so we have
define add to our list data structure
inside this Python now we can refer this
plot functionality inside this
matplotlib library with the help of this
PLT convention so they have plot
functions is there and here you supply
first the horizontal axis data and then
vertical axis data very simple way so
this way you have supplied this data
which you want to visualize in your
module then you just put the show
function that will actually display what
are the data you have supplied in a two
series in a one of the windows so you
can see that it has generated one basic
line plotting graph which is nothing but
x and y values are there x values are 1
2 3 4 5 6 what we have supplied here and
y values are 2 so for 1 it is it is
printed - 4 - it has printed a 6 so it
has joined all those value for 3 it will
it is 0 so it is correct this is 0 for 4
it is minus 1 so 4 it is a minus 1 so in
this way it has plotted a different
point and as it is a line plotting it
has a join all the values of that dotted
part but this is a very simple basic
line plotting in a subsequent lecture we
will see about how to put a legend or
even a title or the labeling of this
plotting plus different kind of another
graph loading system okay so
our that's it for this lecture we will
see about the more of graph plotting
inside the future lecture I hope you
