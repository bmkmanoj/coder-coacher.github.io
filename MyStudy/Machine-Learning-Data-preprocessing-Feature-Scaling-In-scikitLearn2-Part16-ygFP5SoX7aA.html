tutorial inside the video lecture series
on a machine learning so in a last
lecture we have seen about the different
types of scaling so we discuss about the
min/max scalar and the standard scalar
so in this lecture we are going to see
about this normalize scalar and a binary
scalar how you can normalize data with
the help of scikit-learn IPD and how you
can finalize those data in cyclic
language so let's start so in the last
tutorial we have seen we have just taken
a very simple data set 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
3 in a 3 cross 3 matrix we apply this
mean max scalar and we apply this
standard scalar and we have seen there
isn't with the help of this free 10
transform of function and we have with
help of formula also pio calculated that
how we are arriving as that same result
and how so exactly the scikit-learn
library will do with this way now let's
start so if you haven't gone through the
very first two scalar functionality you
can watch the last video tutorial so in
this tutorial we are going to see about
the binary search in how we can binarize
the data so let's first print the X what
is our X X is nothing but 1 to 9 value
in a 3 cross 3 matrix so there is total
3 rows and 3 columns each row is
indicating individual record in each
column is indicating individual feature
so first feature is 1 4 7 second is 2 5
8 3 6 9
now what this binarize will do I have
written just the threshold so this
binary binary scaling functionality the
pre-processing functionality what it
will do will apply some threshold value
and what it will do whatever the value
about that threshold value it will put
it into 1 it will transform it into 1
and whatever the value which is below
this threshold value
like it will be less than it will be
zero whatever the value lays the interns
or so let's apply it
so in our pre-processing step we have a
binarize err by analyzer is the
pre-processing scaling class and we will
supply any threshold so suppose our data
is ranging between 1 to 9 so let's
supply suppose 5.0 ok and we will fit it
to the X okay we need to ok so it has
generated the all value between 0 to 1
it always not even between 0 to 1 it
just generates 0 and 1 because it's a
binary data either 0 or either 1 so I
have kept the threshold 5 so whatever
the value above I like a 6 7 8 9
it has put it to 1 and remaining all
value will be 0 let's try to change the
trace on like a 3 let's see ok so
whatever the value about 3 it has
generated it has put 1 value and
whatever the below 3 has generated the 0
so it has transformed 1 2 3 into 0 and
remaining all value will be 1 so this
way this binarized thresholding thing
the works inside the scikit-learn
library and this is very straightforward
there is this simple offense kind of
classifier nothing like any kind of
formula we can verify it's very
straightforward
now let's see about this how we can
normalize data how the normalizer you
can use inside this scikit-learn library
so what is normalizer will do it will
take in each and individual each and
every row and it is
/ the norm value of individual row now
let's see how it's working
so let's first display over X so we can
immediately compare it with a rare cell
very fast now this in processing module
or a sub module of this s scale and
library we have a normalizer so by
default if you don't supply any argument
it will take L to normal
- no means nothing between a two
dimensional space or multi dimensional
space the distance of any point from the
origin which is nothing but the norm of
individual vectors or records and we
will supply to fit X to the frit
function and then transform it okay so
what it has done here we have done we
have created the object of this
normalizer class and we have applied the
fit function on the top of it with our
human X so this fit function will do
nothing but it will find the norm value
of individual records and this transform
will actually transform the data with
the help of this formula so this formula
is saying that for individual rows it
will take the original records which is
nothing but each row original record and
it will divide by the norm value of each
record so let's see what it is
generating and with the help of formulas
we leave a little okay so it has
generated his zero point two six seven
two six one two five
for the first record so it has
transformed one to this value so this is
the overall normalized value because we
have divided individual record by the
norm of individual record so let's for
the very first one we will calculate so
exile just skip xgo x0 is suppose one it
is nothing but our first menu okay now
how we can find the norms of norm value
of first record then we will divide this
x0 by that norm and we will tallied it
whether it is in 0.26 326 72 or not so
the norm of first record or the zeroth
record let's see so norm of zero record
is nothing but the square root of the
sum of the square of individual values
so we can go it like mad dot sqi
definition so square of the first fungal
will be 1 plus 2 square is nothing but
the 4 plus 9 okay okay
so what it will do actually for first
very first record it will take 2 then l2
norm which is nothing but the square
root of the sum of the square of
individual values so the square root of
1 square plus 2 square plus 3 square
okay so we got this norm 0 and let's now
divide this x0 by norm 0 okay problem ok
Matt is not defined so we need to import
this Matt model of this Python room okay
so we got it
so X 0 will be 1 norm will be a square
root of 1 4 1 plus 4 plus 9 and we have
divided this X 0 as per our formula each
row each track each value of each row
will be divided by the norm of
individual row so we have divided the
very first raffle divided by the norm of
0 now suppose we divide the
instead of x0 let's go for this - so x1
baby suppose to nom zero will remain the
same because fault for the first record
the norm will be one plus four plus nine
square root of that and we will divide
this second value we divide by norm okay
so it has generated zero point five
three four five which is televi tower
the data which transformed by this
normalized surplus of this scikit-learn
so this way we have seen in this large
tutorial and this tutorial how we can
scale individual data with delft of
scikit-learn functionality basically and
a pre-processing module ok so that's it
for this lecture friends I hope you
