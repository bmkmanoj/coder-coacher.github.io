lecture series ona explaining the
different concept of engineering and a
programming and a computer science
related different concept so in this
tutorial we are going to see about the
looping concept of the programming so
let's start our journey so let's try to
understand looping with some of the
natural phenomenon so you can see the
very half-filled son I have drawn here
so one is look like an in sunset and one
is a sunrise phenomena that we daily
observe and it doesn't change even so
after every period after 24 hours this
phenomena is repeating something like a
first this sunrise and sunset again the
sunrise sunset sunrise sunset so this
type of to even daily occurring in a
birthday on the planet Earth so this is
one kind of natural phenomena which is
occur keep upper occurring after every
one one day of interval so this is the
one of the first example of the looping
system you can consider like our solar
system also we just keep rotating every
planet after every certain interval of
time around the Sun so there is no
change so till Creator wants the creator
of our universe creator of our solar
system wants it will just keep rotating
our son so there is no change and it
just goes around the Sun in a looping
kind of mechanism so this is one or two
the natural phenomenon which is
occurring in a look let's try to see one
more with our daily routine activity
something like we back up we get up and
then we take this our brush and go into
school dress and all those kind of
phenomena and finally we go to the slip
at the end of the day so the phenomenal
like this will keep up occurring daily
in our daily activity so this type of
things also occurs in a
look so very first day we did actually
backups our just for example I all
listed only five we do actually lot
different kind of activity something
like I'll back up showering going to
school then up playing and as again
going back to school the moment this
cycle is finished again the next cycle
starts and we again started performing
all those activities again so have you
observed the out of this to example what
is the common thing the common thing is
that list of tasks which keep we will
keep performing after certain period of
time or if the first class our first
cycle of or the set of tasks in a first
cycle finish we immediately went for the
again repeating those cycle so this is
the kind of phenomena which is called as
a looping now we will see about how we
can go and perform or we can implement
this kind of looping mechanism inside
the machine so let's define some of the
or looping definition in a formal
language so this is something like a set
of tasks in a reputation based on some
condition or without condition so do you
keep performing some set of tasks which
keep repeating after certain interval of
time so humans are kind of bored by some
kind of repeating task but computers are
very smart so in this tutorial we are
going to see how is looping mechanism
which keep repeating tasks same way
based on some condition or some without
any kind of condition how it just keep
repeating those cars at the numbers
speed actually so let's try to see how
we can implement this set of task inside
the machine
so how we can put this looping mechanism
in a system so we can go with the
hardware way or a software way so if you
have seen about a different hardware
system inside which the cycle skip
repeating something like the harmonic
motion of your pendulum in your clock so
we just keep repeating so one cycle
finish again it just do the another
cycle another cycle so it is running in
a look till it has an energy so based on
the condition will become something like
it just have a energy so we were we are
not going to get into much more detail
into hardware level implementation of
the looping but we'll see about how we
can implement in a software this looking
mechanic so majority of this programming
language in a software while they are
providing them mostly minimum this to
mechanism for looping system in a while
looping system will not go into detail
of this for and while loop mechanism
there are many video lecture we will
find about that but let's see whatever
the two example we have seen earlier to
understand the basic to mechanism and a
concept behind the or looping mechanism
how we can implement those thing inside
this for or the while loop so let's
start with a softer loop will implement
for our solar system or a sunset sunrise
example so we'll use this while loop and
inside the while loop we have listed the
two tasks something like a sunrise
sunset and then increase the one day
then here in a green point it has been
written the condition till the Creator
won the moment created doesn't want this
sunrise and sunset on the planet it will
just terminate this look and it will go
out so this may the whole mechanism of
the looping works in our natural
phenomena sunrise sunset increase they
increase at least one day in our
lifetime then again sunrise sunset
increased one day again sunrise sunset
increase one day every time we just
check that whether tilt Creator wants
to get it happen or not so this is just
the dummy condition I have listed there
it may be any other condition also
possible let's try to put this another
example in a softer loop so we have
given like a pie sample activity we took
like a backup showering school play and
then sleep and again increase one day
and again we repeat this activity and in
this green point i will aesthetic and he
said something like a till one died so
it doesn't mean that the moment someone
starts or someone bonds they started
performing all those activity the
activity might change based on the
different condition or different
parameter we pass through this looping
mechanism but after the performing this
activity again we increase the one day
and again this sort of all those
activity will be repeating so this way
we can implement this natural phenomenon
or any other kind of phenomena inside
the for loop or a while loop with help
of softer looping mechanism same way all
kind of arithmetic and everything also
you can perform with Dell before and
while loop that is the basic fundamental
blocks of the computer science the
moment you find something repeating or
some tasks which is keeps repeating you
put it into looping mechanism so your
burden or or a task or your burden will
be immediately reduce
there are lot many video you will get on
a for loop and a while loop you can
search around on the internet or you
youtube video that is all mechanism they
will provide it how you can use a for
loop and a while loop but for this
lecture my intention was to give you the
actual clampus of what is the looping
mechanism how that looping mechanism is
working for the arithmetic kind of
looping mechanism you want to perform
actually on a computer you can go around
the YouTube and you can find hell lot of
video so that's it for this lecture
friends I hope you enjoy listening this
