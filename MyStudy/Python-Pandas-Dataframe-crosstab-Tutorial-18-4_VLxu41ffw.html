lecture series on a data analysis with
Delta Python so in this tutorial we are
going to see about the very small
functionality which we apply on the
table of data frame object if it is
nothing but a cross step example so
let's try to understand this cost of
example with the help of one example so
what it does actually cross step example
cross step functionality it will just
calculate the frequency and will apply
the percentage functionality on the top
of teeth to analyze the data for the
pre-processing then we can actually
decide what kind of matters we need to
apply what kind of data distribution
exists between the two different column
so let's try to understand it we tell
for one example let me import it pandas
okay now I have already of premise data
set titanic data set which is available
in one of the csv file so let's just
read it and we need to see a su p d dot
and file name i will give as input and
I'll assign output at DF which is
nothing but the data frame object okay
let's just display some of the data
first view okay so we have already seen
in earlier example also so these are all
the passenger ID and I survived people
but that is if it is a zero then it
doesn't survive it is the one they got
survived after Titanic sink and P class
is nothing but the class through which
they have entered so it is a class 3
class 1 and class 2 kind of people so
let's try to apply this cross step
example on any of this two column let's
take this survived enough P class so and
it will give us the frequency for the
unique combination of this two column
so we have a core a step function
available you know find us so we'll just
apply this cross step and we'll supplied
argument as a two column one is the
survived column and one is the pre-class
column once we got the raziel I'll
explain you what is that actually okay
we have got the result so what it does
actually in a pea class there are total
three unique combinations of values are
available 1 2 3 so this is a ticket
class of class 1 class 2 and class 3 in
case of survival to unique values either
0 and 1 0 is for not survived and one is
for survive so while applying any kind
of data processing technique there might
be some pre-processing required to
analyze the data so this cross step is
one of the very helpful to analyze the
frequency for the different combination
of the two values occur so what this
table will indicate actually if you see
the first row first row is nothing but
all gives the frequency of frequency
distribution of all passenger who didn't
survive so class 1 passenger is having
total ET passenger who didn't survive
class 2 passenger 92 total class 2
passenger didn't survive but 87 does
survive 372 didn't survive of class 3
people class 3 passenger but 119 people
which is how is having the ticket class
3 which got to survive so this way to
different combinations of column 1 and
column 2 which we supplied as a hard
human to the cross web example it has
given a frequency distribution suppose
we want the same distribution in a
percentage format that will give you
even little better idea that for the
survived class 0 how much distribution
are there out of this and
percent distribution so let's just do
the percentage functionality on the top
of it so we use the apply function
and lambda
and we'll do the percentage
functionality along the rows so will
supply axis is equal to one so what we
have done here whatever this part will
exactly give the table earlier and we'll
apply the dysfunction so what this
function will go every value it will
take it as it is and it will divide by
the sum of that row so will give will
get the frequency distribution in a
percentage format in axis one is further
along the row okay so earlier we have 80
97 and a 372 for the three different
class one two three whose which
passenger didn't survive but here it
will tell us that almost 14 percent of
people in case of this with eighty
people 17 percent this 97 has been
converted into 17 percent and this 372
people in is 67 percent so the people
would didn't survive having a 14 percent
people having a class one ticket 17
percent point 66 having the class 2
ticket and 67 point 75 in the class 3 so
this way we can analyze the data with
the help of cross step example so this
is that's it for this lecture friends I
