video lecture on a machine learning
services inside the cloud so in this
tutorial we are going to see Microsoft
is already providing one cloud computing
engine which is a name is Asura it's a
search on google or jury cloud services
so micro sepa already provided the
zurich cloud services and one of the
cloud services out of that is machine
learning cloud services so let us try to
understand what is this cloud services
are there so microscope is providing lot
of product inside this merger a cloud
computing platform if you see these
products then you can see the in a
compute part you can completely by full
virtual machine or even as some of the
app service bad service in case of
networking dns server you can buy load
balancer you can buy so in this way the
Lord of online products are available
from the Microsoft but if you go inside
this intelligent and analysis black
analytics there is a one product which
is a machine learning so we are going to
focus on this machine learning platform
that how you can use our data and will
fit to some of the machine learning
algorithm which microservers you
provided in built in their cloud
platform and we can prototype under
tobor small amount of data and how we
can scale it to the millions of even a
billions of record on this cloud
platform so let's see about how we can
go ahead on this cloud computing
platform of Microsoft so if you see the
pricing plan of this machine learning to
do my grocery styling is micro servers
you're a machine learning story other
three different plans are available is a
ghast work space there is a free
workspace and this is standard works
page which is costing nine point ninety
nine dollar per month so i am going to
use this zero dollar per month but for
that you require when signing machine so
i have already created a one account of
the microsoft i am using my hotmail
account honest microsoft so if you use
that hotmail account
you and login with that you will be
redirected to the workspace created by
you for the Microsoft so if you see in
this workspace the number of menus on a
left planner has come like you can
create number of projects and you can
have multiple experiments also whatever
the experiment is successful you can
deploy it as a web service anyway in the
real time whenever the new requests come
it will served it you can you know
create number of notebooks also for
notebook Microsoft is already providing
to programming language support one is
the Python notebook in a Jupiter twill
create an are not book also it can
create their lot of different data sets
are available for the prototype purpose
and you can use your external data set
which is available on some other hosting
domain also once you create those model
you can train those model and you can
see those your train model also so in
this way there are lot of different
functionality microservers array are is
providing so in a future lecture we are
going to see about how you can create
those experiments in a step by step what
are the steps are involved for doing
those machine learning experiment on
this Microsoft Azure machine learning
studio platform and inside the works
workspace and then you can deploy it as
a part of the service those things we
are going to see in the future but
before seeing that we are going to see
about what are the comments that's
involved in designing this machine
learning system so that's it for this
lecture friends I hope you enjoy
listening this video and if you haven't
