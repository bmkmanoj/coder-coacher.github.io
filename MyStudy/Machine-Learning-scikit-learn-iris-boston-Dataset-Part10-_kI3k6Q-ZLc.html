tutorial into the video lecture series
on a machine learning so last lecture we
have seen about the different database
what other data is already available for
the experiment purpose on to this
insider a scikit-learn library so in
this tutorial we are going to see about
the two database that is a washstand a
house database and iris flower data set
how that data has been organized what
are the feature associated with inside
each and every data set what are the
output labels and what are the class
associated with this data set will
import with the help of this
scikit-learn library so let's begin so
there is a one washstand database
so let's first import the scikit-learn
so first dot data sets import star so
already this Escalon library has four or
five data set inbuilt available inside
the data data set we are importing it
and there is one more panda library
which will be helpful for us to
visualizing this data that what are the
features are available what is the
output in a very tabular format so we'll
insert import this to find us also will
give naming convention speedy so we'll
access every function with the help of
PD okay so we have imported the two
things from the SQL and we have imported
the data set and from the Panda we use
for data science purpose so pandas
library we have imported now let's
import this Boston databases from Boston
so we have a load and the score Boston
command Sal there so it has a loaded all
the boy Boston database inside the
Boston variable now let's see what are
the keys available for this Boston great
outset so this data set of Boston has
four keys one is the data one is the
feature name one is the description of
that data and one is the target what is
the output for individual record now
let's see one by one each and every
features which is available for this
Boston data sector so let's print first
the description so we'll get idea we
will put Boston so this is the
description of this database so what
they are saying is that there are number
of instances 506 so total records are
506 inside this database so total number
of attributes is 13 so 13 is the total
features and a 14th is the output value
so there are 14 columns for each row
available these are the description of
the individual features like CRI M that
is a sort form given for per capital
crime rate by the towns so based on the
time rate they are given they assign one
feature associated with that in this way
there are a lot of the full tax property
tax rate per ten thousand dollar index a
semi accessibility to the radial
highways and the proportion of a
residental and Jones for lots of over
25,000 square feet so in Boston data set
they are given this 13 feature for each
house and they have given the other
final output value which is nothing but
the
price of that house in a thousands of
dollar that is the output value so this
way this data well set has been
described this Boston and they have
given some reference also from where
there it has been taken who has created
this data set and all those things so
this is all about the description of the
Boston data segment now let's see what
are the different feature name feature
name is already been given but let's
just print it and see what is there so
these are all sort forms of descriptive
feature names now let's see what is the
data so it has a total this 506 instance
of this let's first print the shape of
this data so it has a 506 rose and a
thirteen columns thirteen columns is
nothing but the total number of feature
for each record and 506 is the total
number of rows for the data and this is
the target so that is the final output
of data for each record so this target
is having another finder and six value
for each house they are given what is
the price of that house okay so this is
all about the different aspect of this
Boston data set what I'm trying to see
that this all data has been arranged in
a very or a kind of format so let us use
this pandas library so which will put
all of our data into very good tabular
format so let's start it so we have in a
Panda
there is a one we'll put it into boss
rather than Boston now
so PD dot 1 is dataframe name we will
supply this Boston data inside this data
frame so we will get whole data of the
Boston which is having a 506 rows and a
thirteen columns inside this Boston boss
variable now we'll add one more column
which is nothing but a target target is
our nothing with a price
then we'll assign this price is equal to
Boston target target so we'll add one
more column to this tabular format sub
data okay before writing anything let's
just print boss so we'll get idea of how
data looks like we just write print is
not required so it has printed the first
five rows and it is all having a
thirteen columns but all having nobody
has having a name which has been given
inside this Boston data set so let's add
this 14 column as a price which is we
are assigning to the Boston target that
is nothing but the output value then
boss dot columns
is equal to whatever the our feature
name so that is Boston dot so what we
did here that every column of this
emboss variable which will given a value
which is nothing but the individual
feature name so we will analyze
individual feature name and whatever the
will price price is nothing but the
actual output of the individual house
data set which we have assigned to the
another column which is having a name
price now we are printing with the first
file ok it has some error
okay let's leave it first and let's
print Boston
Boston dot
it is a feature names not a feature so
that's an small typo okay so we got all
our data into tabular format so we can
visualize it very well
so whatever the first feature we had us
here that is nothing but I think crime
rate so for first record all these 13
features are available and we have put
all our target value into price column
so in this way we can see this data set
and generally in this machine learning
what is our task is that these are all
our training data set so either you can
divide this data set into either
training and tasting in a somewhat
proportion way like 60/40 or 70/30 8220
or these are all the training data set
and in a tasting side we have been given
another data which is having all 13 for
feature and our task is to predict this
price of that house based on this 13
feature so this is all about Boston
house data said that how that has been
distributed every lecture what why I
have discussed too much about this data
set because before learning any machine
learning algorithm or dive into actually
machine learning coding or just directly
using any kind of functions matter
inside this Escalon library we should
have a clear-cut understanding of that
how that data looks like what is the
feature how it has been organized inside
this matrix library that's why I am keep
discussing too much about this data set
so this is all about the Boston data set
let's see about this iris data set so
let's load this iris iris so it will
load whole dataset and we'll just print
the all keys okay so it has also the
target names the data even target target
also having a name because this kind of
data asset has been used for the for the
classification purpose so let's print a
one by one everything is dot first
description what this data set is all
about so this is actually the flower
data set so it has a total one hundred
and fifty instance and there are total
three class so of all 150 instance of a
record has been divided into three class
and for each class there are 50 records
we'll see all three class one by one and
number of attributes is the four numeric
values so it has a total for feature
whatever feature so individual fala for
individual flower we have been given
this sample length all data's are in a
centimeters there is a sample weight
also petal length and a petal of it and
whatever these three class are there so
all Flowers has been categorized or a
classified into three different class
that is a iris setosa forgive me for my
pronunciation actually this is very bad
for me actually to pronounce iris
versicolor and our iris virginica
so this way actually are we how three
different classes are there in our
output variable and our total for
features are there this is all about the
description of this data and there are
reference also given for this let's
print about
now feature name we have already seen
one
so therefore feature one is a sepal
length sepal with pattern length battle
bit so this we have already seen so
let's see what is the target names now
so target name is setosa versicolor and
VG Mika is that a tree different kind of
of flowers has been categorized based on
this four feature with high with length
with length of based on sample and petal
bit okay so this is all about the data
let's print actual data okay so we have
been told that there are total 150
instance so each record is having four
features there is a sample with land
battle bit and length and there are 150
different instance of like this let's
spin the size safe so we'll get how it
has been organized into two dimension
metals so it is having of 150 records
you know four features for each record
so this is all about the iris dataset
and we can use the color any kind of
classification algorithm of machine
learning side to classify if we have
been given a new flowers which is having
a and different sepal width and length
and petal width and a length so our task
is to identify or put it into three
different classification category now
let's put it into panda's data frame of
framework so let's see how it will look
like so we will get a more idea about it
so we'll put them we describe this
pandas as a earliest named PD
and pandas dataframe function will
supply whole iris dot data print I okay
so first fie records it has printed
which is all having the four for feature
now let let's assign this column name to
the weight and length kind of name so we
it will be better to visualizes so we
are assigning all column names of I our
variable to the iris not what is our
feature name
okay it has not
displayed
okay yeah that's a typo actually in the
column spelling was typos wrong
so the first feature is having a sample
and 5.1 sepal width is 3.5 pattern
length is one point four centimeter and
pattern fit is zero point 2 centimeter
now let's assign even our target also
target is nothing but the class target
and they have given a target name also
so this is a class and we will put the
class name also it'll last just for our
visualization purpose name target names
so what we did here actually we have
created two different column but one is
having a class which is the numeric
value either is lies into one category
or second category or third category and
for our understanding in a plain English
language we have been assigned this each
and every category to one one name and
let's display those thing
let's read it one by one
okay I will add it later on let's see
see this we have just displayed the
first five record out of it so all
records are lying into one class only
because all values are I mean zero to
class
so let's print all the data almost we
have a 150 dataset so it will display us
almost every data three there are some
of the records has been lying into zero
to class and there are some of the
records into second class so in this way
so they have already told that first 50
records in a class 1 the second 15 a
class 2 and third a 50 class 3 so in
this way we can
okay this is the wrong actually be kind
of sign name we have to write iterative
loop kind of way so it is wrong but we
have seen the tabular way of visualizing
this heidi's data set and now our task
is that see they have given even 150
rows and a five column the fifth column
is our target output then first four
column is nothing but the total for
feature for individual flowers
individual instance or individual
records now the task is that we have
been given another of flower which is
having this four feature and our task is
to categorize this into out of this
three class where it lies so that's it
for this two data set of whatever is
available inside this as skill and
library for our experiment purpose so
this is the introduction of data set in
the next lecture we will see about
diabetic database and there is one more
digit data set also available we will
see about even more huge data set which
is available on to Internet and that
will be the actual introduction of data
set because before dive into machine
learning coding you should have her
understanding of what this data set is
what is your problem then we apply those
data set into different machine learning
algorithm so thank you guys for watching
