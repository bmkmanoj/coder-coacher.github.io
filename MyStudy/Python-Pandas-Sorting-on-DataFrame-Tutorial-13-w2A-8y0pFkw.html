series on a data analysis with help of
Python so in this tutorial we are going
to see about how you can do the sorting
on this series in a data frame object
how you can apply this sorting on a
particular indexing or how you can apply
this sorting on a particular values of
the data frame and a series object so I
have created some couple of data frame
and a series object that will take into
consideration for our sorting
functionality so let's just run and
let's display this series object which
created okay so it has a indexing dcae B
and each is having a value 0 1 2 3 4 5
because I have given this range function
of built-in Python data structure and
indexing are given by this array which
is having all characters value now let's
apply this sorting mechanism on the top
of this series object so if you see that
whatever the values are there these are
all already in a sorting order so we
will apply this sorting on the basis of
this index so for applying sorting on
index we have one function sort
underscore index
so it will apply this sorting on this
indexing dcae B so what we can expect
from here it should be in a ABCDE okay
so it has sorted this ABCD but
corresponding value is still preserved
so for a values well - and here also it
is 2 for B it was a 4 so here is also 4
so this way you can apply this sorting
based on the indexing of this CG subject
now I have created and one more object
on a data frame object so it's a two
dimensional object now let's see how we
can apply this sorting here so I just
printed so we have total two rows the
first row is indexed by the value 7 and
the second row is indexed by 3 an
individual column has been indexed by be
a PC so same sorting mechanism we can
apply it here also so the F dot spot
index but if you don't give any kind of
argument to the system by default it
will sort at the row level so 3 &amp;amp; 7 at
the row level
it has sorted so for 7 the values were 0
1 2 3 so it has came into second row and
a 3 as a 4 5 6 7 so it has come into say
first row so this is the sorting with
respect to the row now suppose we want
to sorting with respect to the column
the same function we can use it only we
need to supply the argument that you do
the same operation with respect to
column for that axis is equal to 1 we
have seen those thing into earlier
tutorial
so okay so seven and three is still on
the same site but on a column level it
has all ordered or sorted this ABCDE but
still data is preserved for a it was one
and five so it's one and five
so this way you can apply this sorting
based on whether it's a row or based on
a column on a data frame object now
let's see how you can apply this sorting
on a value because still now we have
seen the sorting based on individual
index only in case of data frame object
it will be based on a row or a column so
on let's just print this I have created
one more series object so it has a total
six value indexing are 0 to 6 but we are
going to apply this sorting on
individual values of this series object
so there are a couple of values are
available and couple of values are not a
number in our case so let's just apply
this sorting based on value so we used
earlier the function sort underscore
index so in case of sorting the value we
have a function sort values so ok so it
has a generated output - 7 - 1 3 so it
has sorted wherever the all values are
available in remaining all not a number
value it has just put it at the very
last
so all indexing are still preserve and
data value has been sorted so in this
way you can put the sorting on indexing
level or at the individual values level
on this data frame object and as CDs
object so that's it for this lecture
friends I hope you enjoyed listening
this video please do like combined ends
