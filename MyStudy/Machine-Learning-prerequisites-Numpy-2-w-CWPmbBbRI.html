tutorial into video lecture series on a
machine learning so in our earlier
lecture we have seen about very basic
prerequisite required for the machine
learning programming so we have started
the lecture on a numerical Python
library so in our last lecture we have
seen about how to create the array how
you can index those array and how you
can extract data from that array so from
the same library let's see today what we
are going to see we are going to see
about how you can do small operation on
the top of this array what are the
different data manipulation you can do
on the top of this array there are a lot
of statistical aspects of it also so
let's start it
so deserter topic I have decided for the
today's lecture like we will see about
the basic operation on our a array
multiplication another matrix
multiplication sorting and now how to
find some how to compute the minimum and
maximum out of the array so let's begin
with one by one so first of all let's
import numpy library
okay we have successfully imported it
now basic operation means how you can
add a two arrays so let's define binary
we have seen in last lecture how to
create the array manually like 2 comma 5
comma 3 oh my
so this is a basic array now suppose if
we want to add just PI into each and
every element of this array so just
check we have already added the 2 plus 5
7 5 Plus 5 is 10 so just add if I will
take care of everything and each and
every element it will add PI suppose we
want to subtract 2 out of each and every
element of this array so it has deleted
at least subtracted 2 out of each and
every element of the array so this way
you can do a basic operation on the top
of array let's see how our a
manipulation you can do so array
manipulation and there is a matrix
multiplication so our my multiplication
in matrix multivision there is a one
difference array multiplication is
nothing but element by element
multiplication of each element and
matrix multiplication is our linear
algebra way
multiplication what you can do so let's
see about array multiplication so
suppose you have one more array like
will create
- comma 6 comma - now we want to
multiply each every element of a with
every element of being so - x - 4 5 x 6
is 13 so that's correct
now let's see this is all element by
element multiplication let's see about
the matrix multiplication so matrix
multiplication let's define one area we
have you study seen how to construct
which is having all values will be same
and let's print it when there is a one
more presses are required okay so it has
generated a 3 cross 3 array which is
having all values 1 now suppose we want
to do element by element multiplication
of C with C then it should produce
exactly the same array because one is
multiplying with one it is a way but now
suppose we want to see matrix
multiplication so numpy has one matter
dot so you can apply the dot method on
to C array and you multiply it with C
itself so let's see what it will
generate it has generated 333 so this is
nothing but the matrix multiplication
and this is nothing at the array
multiplication so array multiplication
is a element by element multiplication
okay
so let's see about the comparison
operation so we have already generated
one
let's compare this array a and array B
so it has just a one element common
inside it all elements are different
differ so only one element is common so
ideally it should when we compare it it
is has given the first element is it
true because it is a common in remaining
all elements of the false element okay
that's correct that's working very fine
so let's go for the computing the sum
you can find even a minimum or a maximum
out of it also so let's define one we
have already ate now suppose we want to
find the sum of all element inside there
so what you can do we have one matter
like so it has generated eighteen for us
and we'll painter will cross verify also
so two plus five plus three plus eight
that's correct
eighteen now suppose we want to see the
minimum of this array so we have NP dot
min functions are their minimum so
minimum value is two so it should print
to correct so it has printed two now
suppose we want to find a maximum out of
this array it is eight so correct so
this way you can find some summation of
all elements inside the array you can
find a minimum or a maximum of this
array let's go ahead and let's see there
is one more is argument minimum and
argument maximum so suppose rather than
maximum
minimum element you want to find the
place at which the maximum and minimum
occurs so let's print and be arc max are
minimum so the minimum element occur is
2 n 2 is occurring at a 0 to index so it
should frame 0 that's correct
now suppose we want to find the maximum
so maximum is a yes
SiC 8 here and it is occurring at index
0 1 2 3 so it should be 3 okay that's
fine that's so far so good let's see
about the statistical computation so
there are a lot of statistical function
already inbuilt inside this numpy
library so let's do with our famous
array which we have generated now
suppose we want to find a minimum of
mean the average value of all elements
inside this array so what we can do it
is a 4.5 let's cause verify so we have a
2 + 5 18 18 divided by 4 it's correct
4.5 now suppose we want to find the
standard deviation of this a that is a
2.29 so so far so good it's working we
find so this way you can do a lot of
statistical manipulation also now let's
see what is flattening and the reshaping
of the array so for the flattening we
need to create some array like to
dimension array and flattening is
nothing but you are scanning each and
every element of this multi-dimensional
array and put it into a single dimension
so let's create a 1/2 dimension area 1
comma 2 comma 3 into first row 4 comma 5
comma 6 into 2nd row let's print it okay
correct so far so good
now suppose we want to flatten this
array so there is one matter robble
robble is there which is nothing but it
will flatten the full array so it has
flattened the array and it has put it
into the one dimensional array from the
two dimensional for a circuit now
suppose we'll store it into some
variable e array variable and we want to
reshape this array so this is 6 element
arts their total and original array v
which we have it is a the two rows and a
three column let's resize it to three
rows and two columns so let's apply this
shape too
okay so we have that is nothing but the
reshaping we have already reshape the
array from 2 cross 3 2 we have Ravel it
and from that flattened area we applied
this 3 saving function and we have
converted into 3 rows to columns matrix
okay so this is flattening and V saving
let's see about the starting we have
already daddy we have created now let's
supply the sorting mechanism on the top
of it so numpy has a sort function out
of it so sort this data is already
sorted so I don't think we'll get any
idea so let us create some different
variable which is having data in a non
sorted order so let's see I'll put it
like
- comma zero
okay let's print it to move so we have a
four rows two rows and a four column
sorry now suppose we want to apply this
in P dot sort into RA
okay so it has a sorted array across the
full element so we have a total eight
element and all eight element it has
sorted and it has again distributed into
two rows and four columns matrix now
this is along the non any direction but
suppose we want to sort the array along
just the columns only so we need to
provide X is zero so along the first
dimension so what it will do actually we
have this original along the column only
it will sort so if we see this array
compared with this array with our
current output so 2 &amp;amp; 3 it has sorted 0
&amp;amp; 1 then 3 &amp;amp; 6 it has no relation with
the row but now the same thing suppose
we want to do with row so we will need
to supply the axis 1 so along the road I
mentioned so you can see this this row
II it has sorted and then I put it into
the same row minus 1 1 3 6 and the same
way the second row 0 1 2 3 it has put it
into same row so these are all some of
the basic data matrix and array related
manipulation you can do on the top of
this numpy very fantastic array it's a
very fast and memory efficient way so
that's it for this lecture we will see
about more prerequisite required for the
our machine learning coding stuff into
subsequent lecture I hope you enjoyed
