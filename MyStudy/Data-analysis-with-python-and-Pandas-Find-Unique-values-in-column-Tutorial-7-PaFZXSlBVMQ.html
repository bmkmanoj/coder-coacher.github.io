tutorial inside the video lecture series
on data analysis with the Python web so
in this tutorial we are going to see
about how we can find the unique value
inside the whole column across the whole
column so why that is important because
in the last lecture only we have seen
about that to get the string literal
into numerical later you should have
know about beforehand that how much
unique value how many unique value
across the columns are available if
data's are too much small you can
visualize it very fast or you can use
iterate or scan it manually but if the
data size is very much large like a
10,000 or 20,000 you are a million
records are that so it is difficult to
find unique value across the column
manually so how in with the help of
pandas function you can use it to get
the unique value across the column so
let's see
so in a last lecture we use this data
set and we transform this match score
literal string literal into this
numerical data so why that was possible
because we had only two values were
available strong and we can it's easily
visible and manually we can detect that
there are two possible values are there
but suppose for in a programmatic way we
want to find that thing so there are two
ways we can do it there is a one data
structure available inside this Python
is nothing but a set set always contains
a unique value no values in a set can be
repeated so we can apply this this data
frames match score to column to the side
function so let's apply and let's see
whether it will find it will be able to
find a unique value or not so inside
this side function we will apply this in
the air for image Cobra so this will
what it will do actually it will take
whole value whole column of this name
match score and it will apply the set
functionality on the top of it and side
contents on the unique
okay so we got only to value these are
nothing but the unique so it has created
a strong and a weak you can apply list
on the top of this so it will be a array
like structure okay so we got it strong
anyway so this way we can get the unique
value but pandas are also provided it's
one unique matter which we can apply on
the top of individual column to get the
unique value let's see how we can do
with the Panda
so let's first select the match score
max score and we will apply the unique
function on the top of it so we have
selected this match score column and we
will apply the unique function on the
top of it okay so same result it has
been given strong and weak so total two
possible values are available inside
this column so in this two possible way
we can extract the unique values
available across the column so thank you
guys for the watching I hope you enjoy
