lecture series on a machine learning so
in this tutorial we are going to apply
this k-means clustering algorithm the
built-in functionality of scikit-learn
library on a iris data set so let's
start I have done some necessary imports
and I have imported pandas library and
might plot leap for visualization
purpose I even kept this add option
display Max rose is equal to 2200 so it
will display almost all data for the our
visualization purpose after did I
written some small script to load desire
is data set this how to load this iris
or of whatever the built-in data set
available in a recycling library we have
already seen earlier lecture so I have
written death hole script and I have
imported this whole data into X variable
and that whole X variable I have assign
it to the pandas dataframe object so
let's just execute it and let's just
displayed the iris dataset okay I
haven't executed the import statement
okay
so we have this iris dataset which is
having a total four dimension or four
feature values per individual record and
the last column I have assigned it to
the target where in which cluster this
individual record or individual flower
family belongs to so if you carefully
observe this whole data you can see
there are total first 50 records belongs
to one class another 50 record belongs
to class 1 or class 1 is just the naming
convention its inner another cluster and
a third 50 records which is lying into
another cluster so first 50 records
second 50 record and third 50 record
belongs to three different individual
cluster so this is what data we have
this is just the available inside the
iris dataset that's why I have displayed
it in reality you know unsupervised way
of learning and for the k-means
clustering we are not at all going to
use this target column we are just going
to supply all feature values directly to
the k-means clustering algorithm and
we'll tell algorithm to group this
dataset into three different cluster
this is just for the comparison purpose
at the last moment I have displayed this
target column so let's try to throw this
dataset to the scikit-learn built-in
function available so for that let me
just do the some necessary input as
scale learn dot cluster
import k-means okay now let us create a
very small three three clusters will
give as input came in
and number of cluster will provide as a
three so while creating the object
further or the constructor for the
k-means class will provide number of
cluster is equal to three and a max
iteration remaining all value let's keep
it leaf also I am keeping max iteration
let's make it a thousand by default it
will be a it was around three hundred or
somewhere oh okay so we have
successfully created the key reference
which is the k-means object now let's
apply this km to the our input data
which is lying in X variable which is
having a dimension one hundred and fifty
rows and total four columns so let's
just supply it okay so it has written as
the full k-means object with all lot of
default value and whatever the value we
have chained like a number of cluster is
equal to three and a max iteration is
thousand remaining all values is almost
same okay now uh let's try to see what
are the clusters are it has calculated
ok so we have some tell to calculate
total three clusters so this is the plus
cluster centroid this is the second
cluster centroid and this is the third
cluster centroid okay but it is
difficult to visualize for us so in
terms of cluster because it's in a four
dimension space so let's try to display
the labels okay so before assigning
anything to the label we are trying to
compare anything with the label we just
first see that this number doesn't
signify anything this one number
whatever the output which km means
algorithm inner scikit-learn library has
predicted it is just the representation
of that
our cluster this one has no relation
with actual target output which is
available here because the way the
number are this is just a string which
is the representation of individual
value so if you observe this original
data set you can see that there are
first 50 record lies in of one group and
that one group original in data set it
is called as a value 0
but whatever the output has come it is
telling as a value 1 so rather than
making ourself confuse with this number
we should try to understand this in a
such a way that the first 50 record lies
in a 1 group so in our cave means
predicted value also all almost nearly
about the 50 records we are getting into
one cluster after that it is starting
another cluster and then so these are
some of the misclassified value this 2
this 2 or might be this 2 also so
whatever the in between 50 values are
the desease that is a misinterpreted or
putting into different cluster as per
the dis built-in function available in a
scikit-learn library whatever the last
value are there they are all also in
another cluster only thing is that some
of the value some of the data set in
another clusters that that is a
misclassified so let us try to put it
into data frame variable so we will
actually calculate it so we'll add one
more column to the data frame object
like a came in predicted level
and we will assign it to the p.m.
dot label and let's just print it okay
here we can actually do the comparison
so it has displayed all 150 records here
the very first 150 record lies into one
cluster
don't try to get confused with this 0 &amp;amp;
1
actually this zeros all signifies that
it is lying into one cluster and our
output also signifies that these are all
lies into one cluster if any of the
value in a 1 first 50 records chain that
means we can try to understand that
there is something has seen but we have
seen that almost all first 50 records I
are assigned a value 1 so they are into
one cluster
so our first 50 record has been
classified into one group or they are
forming one group that's absolutely fine
and it says given a correct output now
let's try to observe another 50 records
like 53 course start from 51 record
start from and it has assigned it to one
class which is having a name 0 0 n again
- so this is kind of wrong thing it has
a it has predicted because this cluster
should lie into this group or this data
should lie into this group which is
having a value 0 but it has predicted
the value 2 so these are all some of the
misclassified err or misinterpreted the
data set again some 7730
it's actually it's a 78 number record
because indexing is starting from 0 so
it has classified or it has put it into
another cluster that is a somewhat wrong
but apart from all almost all record
more than almost 95% of records are
grouped into correct cluster I think our
last 450 are almost in a group - so
group 2 as this record 0 this 101 record
they are grouped into another
that might be longer this is another
record which is wrong actually it has
interpreted the another two records in
it has put it into another cluster
okay so almost the out of 150 records we
can see that we can put even a
mathematical comparison between this
target column and k-means predicted
column because whatever the key means
predicted label it has generated that is
just the number for the representing one
group of cluster so our thank you guys
for the watching that's it for this
lecture friends I hope you enjoy
