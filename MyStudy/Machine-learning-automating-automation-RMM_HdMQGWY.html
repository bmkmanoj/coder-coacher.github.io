how we as a human being rich in a such a
high comfort state while with a full
lock machine how we are the most
comfortable generation ever lived on a
planet machines have completely changed
a human life we created a machine and
replace every possible task with a
machine we use aeroplane and a bullet
train to make our life even more easier
this way we try to save a lot of our
tasks to a machine which is nothing but
the automation so we entered into
machine era a task automated with
machine but machine learning is not just
automation it's a one step ahead of
automation so let's try to understand
with one example of electronic mail
system we created an email system like
Microsoft Outlook Google Mail which has
almost replaced offline mailing system
for communication lot of tasks we can do
easily like receive or send email we can
even create a rule like Eve email
contains this word it should go to some
predefined folder if he main comes from
this person it should directly go to the
trash if email body contains this set of
keywords this email is not very
important this way we can keep giving
instruction to the Machine and it will
behave the way we want this is a very
good example of automation but can we go
one step ahead of it can machine
automate this automation task for us can
machine create such a rule automatically
based on our previous email behavior can
machine take decision to reply some of
our email on behalf of us can machine
categorize this email into some
particular category the answer is yes
instead of manually creating this such a
kind of rule machine will create such a
rule automatically for us we are trying
to apply automation on automation
machine learning is the solution for
this kind of problem and it will do all
those intelligent tasks for us in the
future so machine learning is not just
automation machine learning is all about
automating our automation that's it for
this video friends please like video and
comment your views on a much
in learning automation if you want me to
make more video and such a technology
please write it into comment at least
share with your friends and subscribe my
channel for the more video and at last
thank you for the watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
