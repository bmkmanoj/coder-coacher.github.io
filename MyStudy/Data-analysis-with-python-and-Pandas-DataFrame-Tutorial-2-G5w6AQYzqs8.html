tutorial inside the Python Panda video
series so last lecture we have seen
about how we have created the data frame
Python pandas data structure but that is
with the help of external data source
from the Google Finance API we have
extracted the data a via fridge the date
of Google stock price with between some
start date and a range range now suppose
we want to create a data frame with the
help perform in just our one our data
which is a hard code available inside
the variable so how we can do it we are
going to see inside this lecture and
will show how to display it and the same
function which we use in our last
lecture we'll put it into plot format
those things so can we can visualize it
so let's first import find us
okay vo successfully imported pandas
librarian via rhenium it took PD so
we'll reference all functions of pandas
we tell pop beauty variable now now
suppose we have some data available in a
Python dictionary data structure so how
that data structure we can directly use
it inside this data frame framework and
now we can create data frame object out
of it so let's take one example of our
daily routine activity for some period
of like Monday Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday and Friday
so for each day there are some of the
routine tasks we normally do and for
each day how much hours of time we are
going to span for each activity we'll
try to put it inside this Python
dictionary data structure and from that
data structure we'll create this data
frame so we'll get whole data inside
this by a panda's data frame object so
let's create some more variable daily
stats
so let's define our index first sort B
is suppose Monday Tuesday
now let's define some of the activities
so like a sleeping hours of our daily
activity this looks like a very
hypothetical data because sleeping hours
are mostly same for individual purpose
on a day to day basis would be the very
minor exception but just for the
creating some data let's do it sleeping
suppose on Monday you sleep ten hours
then seven hours and then five hours
seven hours or nine hours let's take
another activity like exercising so
exercise is suppose in terms of minutes
we'll put those data the sleeping we
have put in terms of hours actually
so suppose 30 minutes you did on a first
date and 40 minutes 45 minutes in 70
minutes and suppose 35 minutes let's
take your working hours for daily for
your routine work working hours first do
you work for six hours then suppose four
hours two hours 10 hours seven hours
okay so we have successfully created
this daily stats daily stats Python
dictionary data structures that for each
individual day how much hours you are
spending in this different activity like
sleeping exercise timing or of working
so let's execute it and let's just print
it this variable okay so it has created
this variable for us the working is a
one key another is the exercise and a
sleeping time now let's see how we can
put this python dictionary data
structure inside this pandas dataframe
framework so we can use it for the
further in evolution we tell pup another
set of function inside these pandas so
fine
PD so yesterday we have given some VA
user data reader function of that pandas
we're inside this pandas input-output
library so in this case we will use this
data frame function of pandas and we
will supply this a daily stats which is
nothing but a dictionary object of
Python you will put inside this D s so
that is the daily stats now what we will
do it will take this daily statistics
dictionary object inside this data frame
function of the pandas and it will
create the data frame object for us
which is nothing but the daily stats
okay so we have successfully imported
the data from our dictionary object to
the panda's data frame object now let's
just print it okay so we got it so we
have a days for each day how much our
sleeping exercise and our working hours
you are spending but you can notice one
thing that the index part is still 0 1 2
3 4 suppose we want to make this a day
as an index because for each day how
much hours you are spending in a
exercise sleeping or working that is
your key value so in pandas we have
something like a Sat index so d s dot
you can set the index now we want to
make this day as index so what it will
do it will return another data frame
object which is having a day column as
index of our data frame object and
remaining are the columns actually so
rather than storing into another
variable they are providing one more
options like in place proof so what it
will do whatever the return object it
will return it will
against or inside this D s reference
only okay and now let's print this a TS
okay so he got this leg day as our index
and exercise sleeping and a working will
be our individual column yesterday we
have seen that some of the header and
tyler function so suppose we want to see
just the first two records same we can
do it just mundane to use the record
suppose we want to see the last two
record so we can use tail function that
is a thursday enough riding so far so
good so it's working fine now let's try
to visualize the way we did yesterday so
we use the matplotlib the IPG to
visualize the individual our ax columns
of this data frame object
so let's import this matplotlib library
input matt plot five plot also int and
we need to import some style also for
the good-looking purpose input type
there lot of styles are there I will
discuss those things into yesterday's
lecture so we'll use this bond poster
okay so let we can reference it this PLT
now for the our visualization purpose of
individual column now let's see we want
to visualize just the exercise part of
this D s data frame object so we do not
need to do anything just will supply
this exercise as a key value inside this
IDs and we will just put plot and then D
s dot so actually PLT dot so actually
okay so we it has visualized for us that
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and
Friday for each of the day how much
hours you're spending how much minutes
actually exercise data we have taken in
terms of minutes so the 30 minutes and a
40 45 70 minutes and then might be it is
35 okay so this way we have visualized
now suppose we want to visualize the all
three activities on our overall file is
record so we do not need to supply
individual column we'll just supply the
plot function on a top of this da's data
frame object and we will
show it okay so it has displayed
everything almost horizontal axis days
and a vertical axis in terms of the
value for individual column so this is
the legend actually blue wrong ending
color indicates exercise graph this is a
sleeping this is a working red one is
indicating by working hours so this way
we can visualize we have the individual
column so this framework object now what
we have seen in this class that we have
taken some hard coded data inside this
dictionary data structure we who put it
into data frame objects so we can use
for the further processing and we have
visualized this data so that's it for
this lecture friends in the next
tutorial we are going to see we have
already created this data frame object
how we can go for any kind of further
processing or data wrangling or data
money right off stop on the top of this
data frame object I hope you enjoy
