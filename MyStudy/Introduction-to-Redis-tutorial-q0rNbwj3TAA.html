lecture series on a radius database so
in this tutorial we are going to see
about what is actually radius database
so let's see some of the characteristic
of Redis database why it is helpful
where it is helpful and how it is
accomplished some of the useful tasks in
our web application or either standalone
desktop application so first of all it's
in memory database so it just stores
everything in a in memory but there is a
functionality of persistent storage also
possible it is one of the very good
alternative of the man catch but man
catch just provides the key value kind
of storage
Ready's provides a much more than a man
catch like mam cake functionality plus
lot of different known data structure
also implemented it is one of the open
source software so you can use for your
commercial purpose also you can use it
freely it is been supported by VMware
it's a kind of key values where storage
but more than that it just supports it
just not support the key value kind of
storage in case of value it has a lot of
other different data types also that we
are going to see into future in one by
one lecture like a it just reports list
storage based on some key or even sat
sorted set plus if you store hash or all
operation most of the time you can
perform in constant time operation so
that is the one of the very good useful
functionality all operations are the
atomic operation now what it mean by
atomic operation suppose for some keys
or some variable two different clients
are trying to update at the same time it
will just allow one client to update it
at a second client will immediately get
the updated one updated value so it is
running on a single trade application it
has a messaging application
functionality also like a publicist and
a subscriber functionality so you can
use like a publisher and subscriber kind
of functionality also for the messaging
there is a tons of libraries available
client libraries like it is all famous
programming language like a Python C C++
Java - AHA scale for everyone PHP even
the Ruby pearl all language has a client
library available to connect with the
Redis data segment so these are all some
of the very useful things about the
Redis now where we can use this readies
itself in memory storage so majority
time
this Redis dataset is used as a
secondary data sector because we have
already available or a curl or your my
my sequel Microsoft SQL servers so these
are all used for a very heavy storage
application but this Redis is used
mostly as a secondary storage now what
does mean by secondary storage secondary
just like your main database will be
like any other relational database like
my sequel or even how Oracle kind of
thing but in case suppose you want to
store very sort loop data in your
application like a session storage even
a web hit count kind of our storage
which other users are currently logged
in based on the different session so
those things which keep getting updated
continuously and it is going to span for
a few minutes or a few hours then only
this Redis in-memory kind of data set is
very helpful let's take one hypothetical
or even err this is a real example that
Facebook has already a 1 more than 1
billion user
let's take 1 billion FB users out of
that let's see let's take only 10% that
are active so we have a hundred million
active user and let's assume that
Facebook is also using this kind of in
memory database so for this hundred
million users minimum profile
informations its session information are
immediately stored in this kind of in
memory database like either man catch or
even a Redis but Redis is giving much
more functionality than the man catch it
suppose much more a data type so Redis
is going to become very useful because
of its
read and write kind of operation
whenever we require to perform so that's
it for this lecture friends thank you
guys for watching I hope you enjoy this
ending this video in a future lecture we
are going to see about how you can
install this Redis and how you can
perform those key value storage kind of
operation on the top of ready server and
if you haven't subscribed my channel yet
please to to subscribe it and support my
channel thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
