tutorial inside the Buddha lecture
series on machine learning so in this
tutorial we are going to see about what
are the list of different machine
learning algorithm so in an earlier
lecture with respect to the scikit-learn
library we have seen there what are the
different machine learning algorithm
with the help of scikit-learn cheat
satan but that is with the perspective
of the what are the algorithm has been
implemented inside this SK learn or
scikit-learn
by python library in this tutorial in a
very general way we will see about how
you can group the different machine
learning algorithm and whole bunch of
families of different machine learning
algorithms so let's start so the group
of machine learning algorithm so one can
divide the whole class of machine
learning families with three with two
different ways one is the learning style
based doctor machine learning and one is
the similarity based machine learning
algorithm so you can classify any
algorithm with the either learning Way
or either similarity based now let's see
what are the learning style learning
style is the supervised way of learning
unsupervised way of learning there are
others also I haven't included that like
reinforcement learning or
semi-supervised learning in a subsequent
video once we finish all those algorithm
will go for those kind of learning
awesome and there is another way we can
group those all algorithm we tell pups
similar kind a similarity based
algorithm so all those similarity based
algorithm are like this instant based
algorithm regression algorithm
regularization neural network or
clustering Bayesian deep learning and
symbol algorithm or any specific data
related like for natural language
processing an LP related algorithm you
polish nary algorithm like genetics or
any kind of recommendation system on
Amazon or Netflix recommendation or even
YouTube video recommendation or any kind
of graphical model so how the similarity
based algorithms has been grouped like
for each and every category of the
similarity based algorithm they are
trying to achieve the same goal with the
help of different different algorithm
the technique will be different but the
goal is kind of similars that's why it
is called similarity based algorithm so
for similarity based all those algorithm
will discuss in two future lecture in
this lecture we are going to see about
supervised and unsupervised learning so
you know do you I think second or third
tutorial I have already gone through
this supervisor and unsupervised
learning
but let's recap it and let's revise it
and in a subsequent video we will go
with individual this instant based or
regression or regularization and this is
entry and all those algorithm one by one
so let's begin with this learning style
way of how we can group the learning
style way of individual machine learning
algorithm so in learning style way you
can divide all classes of algorithm
inside the two category either
supervised learning or it is an
unsupervised learning so let's start
with a supervised learning so let's
concentrate orders first of all this is
the supervised learning has been divided
into two part one is the training part
and one is the tasting part training
part is mostly offline or it can be
online also possible which streaming
data or most of the time it is offline
process and three steam part is a
completely online so what is happening
inside the supervised learning algorithm
we have been given a bunch of data and
we already know about that individual
data belongs to which kind of group
either it can be inner class one or it
can be a class two any kind of and based
on those knowledge we perform the
training with the help of this kind of
algorithm a it can be there are huge set
of algorithm for example I was listed
down this four or five rhythm like a
linear regression logistic regression
neural network algorithm deep learning
algorithm deep learning is nothing but a
subset of this neural network
algorithm so with the help of this
algorithm we applied those data and for
each of the data we already know
that individual data belongs to which
kind of group so based on those
knowledge we perform training and we
produce the model from this data set we
get this model from this data and in a
testing phase we provide any unknown
example so we don't know whether it be
long this example belongs to class 1 or
this example below to class 2 we fit
those data inside our model which is
generated while the training process and
our task is to classify those training
sample into different category or a
different class so this way the
supervised machine learning works a you
know about data you know about the
individual levels of data you perform
training and then apply unknown samples
or nothing but the your testing sample
on that model and you will get there is
a results is nothing but you classify
your testing sample into individual
classes whatever there so this is the
class of supervised learning and I will
restate this sample algorithm leash a
couple of set of algorithm so in a
future lecture will go through
individual this algorithm of all
supervised learning algorithm now let's
concentrate on unsupervised view of
learning so for how in contrast to
supervised learning in unsupervised
learning we just know all data we have
not been given any kind of label so for
us as a user or for the computer
perspective there is no data associated
with any kind of label it is just an
data and based on the similarity or any
kind of structure or how much near
individual data's are in terms of any
diamonds or with respect to any kind of
feature he just start forming some kind
of grouping that is nothing but a
cluster so there is no training and
testing phase individually you just
provide the data it finds the similarity
or it finds the structure between the
individual data and it forms the group
which based on the similarity of
individual data so in this example with
the help of this k-means algorithm or
hierarchy
calculating or a priority algorithm
these are just a few sets of machine
learning algorithm which is unsupervised
even we can go unsupervised with a class
of machine learning algorithm so we tell
what this algorithm this automatically
create this kind of cluster it is c1 and
c2 is nothing but the convention I have
given that for this data machine has
already generated this see this set of
data inside this C one group or see you
in class and this set of data inside
this c2 class so on a contrary to let's
compare this supervised view of learning
and unsupervised room there is no kind
of testing and training phase
individually inside mmm unsupervised
learning you just provide data you find
a structure of it in contrast to
supervised learning you provide a data
in level and in a training phase you
provide the unknown sample and you find
a class of all of it plus
there are whole lot of different
families of algorithm classify itself
into unsupervised way of learning also
so let's go back to our previous slide
so in this tutorial we have seen about
how any algorithm in a machine learning
you can classify either inside this
supervised way of learning or
unsupervised way of learning there are
other also way of learning but most of
the algorithm you can classify into this
category so in this tutorial we have
seen about supervised view of learning
and unsupervised learn in the next
tutorial we are going to see about how
similarity based individual algorithm
works and then we will go about the
implementation of individual algorithm I
