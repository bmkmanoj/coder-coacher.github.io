lecture series on a machine learning so
we're started our last lecture
discussion on how we can visualize this
machine learning data with the help of
this matplotlib in a find us library in
a Python so we have seen about what is
how we can visualize this individual
attribute with respect to this histogram
or with respect to this density plot now
today we are in this lecture we are
going to see about how one can display
plot with the box and whisker plot sort
of correlation plot between a two
different attributes this box and
whisker plot let style try to understand
this Wasson so in our last two plotting
functionality we have seen that it is
trying to tell us that for each
particular attribute how many records
lies in one particular range or what is
the density associated with that
particular range or for that particular
value of particular attribute but what
this boxer and whis plot is like for
each and every plot it is trying to put
that inner sorting order for each and
every attribute and it is trying to tell
us what is the median or the middle
value for that particular attribute and
it will brought a plot or a box what is
called a base box and of whisker plots
it will try to draw that box which
indicates that around this box or inside
that box almost 25 percentile to 75
percentile of all datas alike so it will
try to tell us that between which range
almost 25% almost 50% of datas are
aligned so let's try to draw a plot it
and understand how it goes so we have
our earlier also created the same
function like a data dot plot we are
going to use almost same function so I
am just copy pasting it so instead of
density we
going to use this box and share why also
will make it okay okay it has generated
this graph for us so if you see this box
and whisker plot let's try to understand
with the age only so this is the age
after boot so what this indicate that
this the red line indicates that that is
the middle value of this so if you put
all records which is available in our
database with respect to age if you
sorted those all those records then the
middle value is lying somewhere around
that 30 and almost 25 to 30 percent Isle
of people lies inside this box well it
is somewhere around somewhere around 25
- somewhere around 4045 so 43 years
somewhere around so all those people
which is the major population in terms
of statistics that lies between this
range so that range is indicated by this
blue square or rectangle or blocks and
this red line indicates that what is the
middle value with respect to that
particular attribute so that is for the
box and whisker or whisker plot now we
are going to see about this correlation
matrix or a correlation plot now we have
seen about the three different plotting
histogram density in a box and whisker
plot but there is a one thing common
about all this 3:1 and which is going to
become a different inner correlation
plotting or correlation matrix
functionality
first of all in earlier all three
plotting functionality
all plotting was done with respect to
individual attribute it is not trying to
make a correlation or a dependency
between one attribute on another
attribute or even on another attribute
every attribute is trying to display
individually it has a no relation with
the other attribute but this correlation
matrix is trying to give us the relation
between each and every attribute so if
you have us suppose and attribute it is
trying to give us the relation between
all remaining n minus one attribute how
it is related to one particular
attribute how one attribute is increased
then another attribute also increase so
a kind of positive correlation whether
exist or not or it has a if some one
attribute is increase then another
attribute is will decrease then kind of
negative correlation exists or not
so let's try to plot and try to
understand the same thing on the top of
this Indian guy ability Indian diabetes
patients database available so let's
first of all generate this correlation
matrix correlation is equal to so in on
the top of data we can we have a core
function which will create the
correlation between individual attribute
and it will generate the matrix for us
that how much one attribute is related
to another attribute or whether one
attribute is independent of another
attribute
okay now for the plotting functionality
I have already one small routine written
because ultimately we are trying to
display this correlation variable
in a scatter plot manner so this
correlation is same as this one okay
okay let's try to plot it okay it has
given some error
I think numb or we need to import this
numpy library
okay still shoo okay okay I haven't a
copy despite
who's alec let me copy w1n
the correlation is not defined okay it
has generated
okay this is what the correlation graph
is now in all our case for individual
attribute we are showing one one
different graph it has no relation with
the other activity but in this case it
has generated the plot like I am NOT
trying to explain this routine this is a
very simple it is trying to display that
one particular attribute is how much
related to any other attribute so it is
trying to display this correlation
matrix only so every correlation has
been indicated by this red over figure
and blue figures so red indicates very
highly correlated and blue is minus one
which is a completely negatively
correlated so let's try to understand
with individual attributes so in an
x-axis only on in your axis only all
those nine attribute has been plotted so
if you see it is a diagonal line all at
the red value which indicates that this
flag is highly correlated with another
facts which is the same so any two
object which is exactly similar
this is anyhow completely correlated so
this diagonal values are anyhow not any
useful or a completely meaningless
information the important things lies or
the remaining value now whatever values
are lies in this triangle this is
exactly like a shared of this one so if
you just transpose this matrix also you
will get almost similar value because
let's try to understand with the very
let's see brag beta age so one attribute
is the Prag and one is the age now if
you see this bragging age it is
somewhere around the orange color so it
mean lies somewhere here so correlation
somewhere exist around zero point uh and
0.6 now if you see this brag and eight
here also so this age and these
part is almost similar and so whether
you compare with drag with age or each
with a break the correlation always
remains the same that's why this
indicates almost similar color this blue
kind of color indicates that there is a
very small correlation or highly going
towards almost the negatively correlated
so screen and a brag hasn't know very
much related with each other but if you
see you ready spot somewhere so this
orange you sparked this part this class
with class is highly correlated so that
is how we can visualize this correlation
matrix with the help of this matplotlib
in a panda's library so that's it for
this lecture friends I hope you enjoy
listening this video I'll be coming up
with more and more machine learning and
a pointers related video you know my
upcoming session so if you haven't
subscribed my channel please please
please do subscribe my channel I really
need your support friends without your
suppose I won't be able to continue
maybe in the future but I will try to
continue ok so please please comment if
you haven't understood anything and if
you haven't subscribe my channel please
please please do subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
