lecture series on a data analysis with
Delta Python so in this tutorial we are
going to see about how you can concrete
or how you can merger with two different
data frame with the help of different
function inside the Python panda's
library
so first we'll see about how you can
concrete the to our different data frame
then we'll go for how you can merge two
data frame based on any common column
associated between two different data
frames so we'll see about how inner join
outer join laughs join in a right join
the way it works inside the SQL how the
same will behave inside the data frame
Python panda's library okay so for
starting I have already created the two
data frame and each of these two data
frame has her three columns like a
member ID first name last name and a
second also having a same so let's just
print both of the data frame okay so it
has a member ID associated with one two
five and each is having a first-name
lastname so for simplicity I have kept
all names starting with the a in case of
first-name also in case of lastname also
in data frame one let's just print a
second one also and let's figure out
what are the common things associated
with it so here also having a member ID
starting from 4 to 8 so 4 and fifth are
the common member ID between both of the
data frame and the first-name and
lastname all names are starting from B
so it will be easy to visualize that how
this concatenation task and merging task
is occurring so we have a two brand new
data frame and each of these having a 3
3 column member ID first name and last
name now let's see how you can conquer
this two different
data frame now first we'll see about how
along the row you can offend or you can
conquer the two different data frames so
in both the cases the columns are same
so appending row after row that means
right now we have a total Pyro's enough
be a pun and of Pyro's in a DF too so
once the row level operation for the
concatenation will happen this Pyro's
will be appended
at the end of the first eight data frame
but the same operation if you if you
want to perform at the column level then
what will happen that this all pile row
will recite along the side of DF one so
no another fire records will be added in
a first fire occur only it will add
three more column now let's see and
visualize that how that table will look
like so let's do the concatenation task
so we'll use the concrete function and
we will supply both the data frame now
suppose we want to do this at the row
level so we do not need to supply any
other argument like a exes exes is equal
to 0 by default axis is 0 in case of a
row level operation ok so what it has
done actually we have total 5 fire
records in both the cases both the data
frame so in a row level operation it has
upended this Phi records after the data
frame 1 objects Phi record so that is a
row level operation but let's try to
perform this at a column level so let's
see Phoebe
now in suppose we want to perform this
operation at the column level we need to
supply X is equal to 1 so it will
perform at a column level so it has not
created a five more record in a output
data frame but it has generated three
more extra column and it has put the d
vs d F to the data frame to records
along the side the data frame 1 records
so in this way we have got almost 6
columns ok so this is how the row level
concatenation and a column level
concatenation one can do now let's see
about how the same data frame you can
use for the merging task so before we
start let me just bring this DF 1 so it
will be easy to handle for the future
operation so we do not need to go back
up every time ok now let's see how this
inner join will work on a case of or how
this merging functionality will work
based on the operation of or based on
the parameter inner join
now how this inner join will work inner
join will just recite based on which
column you want to perform this inner
join so let's say there is a member ID
basis we want to perform the inner join
so based on the member ID what are the
rows or what are the records or
instances are the common it will just
return it and that will be performed
with the help of merge function so let's
see how this inner function will work so
PD dot in this case will use the merge
functionality because you are merging
two different data frame in earlier case
you're just concatenating one after
another or one along with another in
case of row level or column level
respectively
so let's just supply the f12 now it we
need to supply that on which called bail
on the basis of which column you need to
perform this merging task so let's just
you
member ID so member ID will be a common
task and how someone wants to perform
this so we'll supply inner okay let's
just display the results okay some
matters okay we need to be we do not
need to supply as array you can just
supply as many possible as data frame
based on which column you want to
perform this merging task so how this
inner join we'll take a inner join will
just return us all records which are
just common based on the member ID so in
based on the member ID to this record
the member ID is having a four member ID
is having a Phi which is common common
in both of the data frame the f1 and a
DF - so it has written us only those
records only so that is how this inner
join will work just the overlapping
result based on the column which you
provide now let's see how this outer
will work outer join
now outer join is you can treat it like
a union of all the records whereas in a
case of inner join we have treated it
like a intersection of all records based
on the member ID so based on a member ID
we have found only two record which is
the common in both DF 1 in and DF 2 but
in case of outer join it's a union of
all records so based on member ID there
are possible 8 IDs are there so based on
tis 8 ah IDs it should return the output
and four and fifth are the common even
then he should written a each and every
so wherever there is no records are
available it will and just put the nota
number so let's see how it okay again I
have done I have just copy-paste it so
okay so hard outer join has written as
all eight results so first I recur by
result for the data frame one is a very
common so it all starting with the a but
this member ID is having a four and
fifth value it has given us the another
two record which is from data frame tour
also but in case of member ID one two
and three we don't have any value in a
case of a data frame - so it has pasted
this not a number not a number not a
numbers almost six times in case of
first name I now all the columns name it
has upended x and y value you can even
change with the help of different
parameter as a passing of argument also
to the merge functionality so
this is how the outer join will work it
is nothing but the union of all the
record all possible record in case of
this member ID 4 &amp;amp; 5 it has the
returners all the records because in
both of the data frame 1 and data frame
two this member ID 4 and fifth both will
exist but in case of member ID 6 7 in it
only data frame 2 values only exist but
in data frame 1 there is no value exist
so it has written as not enough now
let's see how this laugh join will work
so we do about the left join left join
what left join will do whatever the
first argument we will supply I mean in
data frame argument so which is nothing
but the DF 1 it will written all the
results of decent DF 1 and it will
return only those result in DF 2 which
is matching with the DF 1 so it is
something like a you extra call or you
to try all results from the left data
frame and then only those record from
the second data frame which is matching
to the DF 1 based on the common column
which we are supplying which is nothing
but the member ID so let's see how it
will return the reason okay so in the
left join it has written all results
which is having a member ID 1 2 5 which
is available inside the data frame 1
object but from the data frame - it has
written only 2 results which is nothing
but a member ID 4 &amp;amp; 5 which is the
common in case of member ID first second
and third it is just giving a 0 or none
because that data itself doesn't exist
so that is how the left join will work
now let's see how the right join
we'll perform in the same case so what
right joint we'll do whatever the second
data frame object we have supplied it
will retrieve all result from that
second data frame and it will apply the
right joint on a top of this data frame
one object so based on the member ID off
it will return us all well all records
from the data frame - and it will return
all plus it will return only those
record from the data frame one object
which is common to the data frame -
based on the member ID okay so in case
of data frame - we have a member ID four
five six seven eight so all literally
return result it has written and in case
of data frame - all values starting from
B so it that also it has written
Benjamin black bar is Brandon brand
biker ball Bell or Barry blacks that is
a first name and last name associated
with data frame - but in case of data
from one data it has written only fifth
and fourth of only those two record
which is having a member ID 4 and fifth
which is the common so in case of write
it will just require all result from the
right data frame first and plus matches
with the first data frame or a left data
frame which is common based on the ID or
a column name be supplied so this is how
the outer inner join and even a left
join and right join was the same concept
which we have learnt inside the SQL
programming the same concept is apply in
case of data frame also so in this
tutorial we have seen about how you can
concrete the two different frames along
the row axis and along the y-axis or
column axis and we have seen how you can
merge data based on your inner join or
outer join laughs join or a right join
okay so I hope you enjoy listening this
