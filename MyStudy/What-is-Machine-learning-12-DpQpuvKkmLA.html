lecture series on machine learning in
Python and R so we have seen about in
our starting of machine learning series
why you should learn machine learning I
have given you plenty of reason to learn
machine learning so if you have got
convinced stay with me I'll show you the
full big world of machine learning if
you are a beginner or intermediate
programmer so we have seen why you
should learn machine learning now we
will move towards what is machine
learning
so let's suck do you know how child
learns every time which I'll see
something or hear something we have
pointed out to the child this is the
dock this is the cat this way we fitted
a hell lot of information into the
child's brain once the child is lot of
data lot of examples lot of voice Lord
of images lot of video lot of touch
related information it tries to come up
with some kind of modern or it will
generate those kind of models inside
that brain so that is what we call as a
child starts learning so that whenever
the next time same kind of images or a
voice or video it encounters it
immediately recognized that oh that I
have seen that thing Oh mom this is a
great actually
we are steady only I see here death boys
this is a very nice song so this way
child build up the model about our voice
sending those capability of the child
brain or even adult brain what we have
in our brain as a human we try to
incorporate those thing into machine and
that is nothing but the machine learning
so simple teach to machine explain to
machine and machine will start a
understand that is nothing but machine
learning algorithm and machine will
start learning you can see machine will
start learning so at class I just want
to show you and I want to give you a
very good impression that make machine
learn by your algorithm and 21st century
will be yours because every single
application you are going to use or you
are using currently will anyhow
incorporate this machine learning
component and so how and definitely in a
future so whether you need to decide you
want to be a part of this community or
not that is what a machine learning
machine will start learning now let's
understand very conceptually and a very
technical way what is machine learning
so let's first understand before machine
learning how our traditional system of
computing the Turing machine was working
so what is happening in a traditional
system of computing we are giving the
input data to over traditional system of
computing plus the program written by
the programmer like us once we fit this
data to this kind of program this
traditional system of computing the
Turing system of machine will give us
eventually the result but the very big
drawbacks or you can say just the
drawbacks but every time we need to
encounter this kind of logical or
mathematical rule we need to extract
this kind of pattern and then only
machine will act on it and it will give
us the result but can you think of
little different that if we read this 2
comma tree and a file to this machine
and can machine will come up with such a
kind of program can machine extract
those kind of pattern first can machine
learn from this kind of data and that is
nothing but the machine learning so in
this example we are giving input to the
machine plus the program to the machine
and it will give us
the output but all these rules are
hard-coded every time we change the rule
the system change but system needs to
get to get system updated we need to
change this rule programmer has to write
the new rule programmer has to write a
new program but in case of machine
learning we are not going to write this
kind of program we are going to get very
much lazy in the future so instead of
writing this kind of program what
machine learning will do machine will
start taking this data like a 2 comma 3
e corresponding output is file 1 comma 3
corresponding out is 4 2 comma 2
corresponding output is 4 and we will
speak to the machine learnings black box
system machine learning algorithm and
machine learning algorithm will take
based on data you have given me I have
come up with a program that is nothing
but the addition rule are been extracted
from the data you have been given so
this kind of rule will be automatically
updated once you change the data again
same machine learning algorithm should
come up with this kind of different rule
this kind of different program so in
future programmer do not need to write
this kind of program explicitly we do
not need to write a lot of different
kind of program instead of that we will
just quit this kind of hell lot of data
to the machine learning algorithm and it
will come up with such a kind of program
so that is the basic difference between
that traditional system of computing and
a machine learning system and machine
learning is going to become a future
because we do not need to write this
kind of rule explicitly machine learning
we come up with such a kind of route
automatically for us and that is what
happening in every different aspect
right now in an online web application
you are using mobile application you are
using so what is machine learning
machine learning is nothing but the
automation of automation you are trying
to automate the automation itself it is
extracting the pattern it is a nothing
but it's a pattern recognition system we
are time to
recognize any kind of pattern exist in
your data so machine learning is the
future so that's it for this lecture
friends I hope you enjoy listening this
video and in a future lecture we are
going to see more about machine learning
that where machine learning is if you
want me to explain more about the
machine learning more different aspects
of machine learning please write it to
comment I will be very happy to help you
that's it for this lecture friends and
thank you guys for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
