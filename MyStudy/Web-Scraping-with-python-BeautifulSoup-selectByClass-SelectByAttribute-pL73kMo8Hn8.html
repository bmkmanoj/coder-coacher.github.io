tutorial into the series of web
scrapping what we are learning with del
pop by turn and beautiful soap model of
that Python so in this tutorial we'll
see about how to select individual HTML
element based on the class and based on
the attribute so let us see what do you
mean by the class and what does the by
attribute based on by class and at about
how we can find individual element of
HTML we Delp up this beautiful soap
model okay let us consider this URL
first chilly so this is a different URL
compared to what we used in the earlier
video so it has a lot of tags some texts
are red and some texts are green let us
see its source code so if you click
right click and view page source then
you will get to know about that there
are a lot of spam span element paragraph
elements are there and if you just
search for class the lot of class are
associated with each element some are
red and some of green so suppose you
want to extract all element which is
having just the class read only or you
want to extract all element which is
having class green then you can do with
the help of this beautiful soap library
so I have my development environment
already here so let's begin with this
first import URL
leap liability okay that is one more
correction in our last lecture we found
some error that error is a friend's due
to there are two aspects are associated
with this URL Lib so suppose if you are
using Python or 2 X version means any
series of two version then in that case
you need to use this URL Lib to library
but I was using URL Lib that's why it
was giving some error regarding to that
exception handling case and if you are
using a Python or 3.0 or 3.2 3.13
x-series version you may have renamed
URL Lib to library to the URL Lib so you
in that case you need to use URL Lib so
here I am using Python 2.7 version so
that is a 2 X series version of the
Python so I am using URL Lib to
libraries so this is how I have imported
URL Lib to library now let us import the
beautiful soap library so ps4 will
important beautiful so function from it
ok that's all so let's first fetch this
URL this is what we did already earlier
like lecture we tell pup you are an open
function okay we got all HTML stream let
us just cross verify whether we have
actually got it or not okay correct so
this is what exactly whole HTML contain
what we see here that's what we have got
it okay
now the task is to find how we will find
to find all element having class read
okay let's see how we can do it with the
help of beautiful so function so let's
apply this HTML flushed to the beautiful
soap function
and we'll use L XML parser
okay there is a typo here okay so we
have got the BS function it's that is
where actually whatever the simple HTML
string we have our beautiful soap
function has converted into object level
hierarchy that where the individual
content lies now we want to find all
elements which is having a class read so
what we'll do will be s dot it has one
matter like of mind all so it will find
all element and will supply argument
like a span so it will find all element
V which is having a tag name span but we
want to find all element which is having
a class Radian
so in this way you can supply all
element having a class rate with a tag
name span and we will put it into class
tag list we will put it into rate
tagless rate tag list okay okay so it's
works successfully now let us print all
element because there are a number of
red elements we have to iterate it
so for Tag in red tag list and let us
spring all individual element
there is some problem associated with
this
let me print this rate tag list first oh
it's a blank actually let's find a green
one
okay so we have got all the green
element which is a green element which
is her class having a green tag okay
okay now let's print those green and so
instead of just red will put it as a
green and we'll display the text okay
okay so it's working fine that is all
because of some session issue and all
those there so if you write the full
code inside the single cell there won't
be any mischievous problem so if you're
concerned is and now let us cross verify
with the help of our source code okay so
you have seen this and now having the
class green okay so it's working
perfectly fine actually so we have
extracted a with Delp of dysfunction all
element having a class green and a tag
name span now let us consider the second
one which is how to select individual
element with the help of attribute now
attribute means you will see about the
ID okay now just consider this ID ID is
having text so suppose you want to
extract all element which is having a ID
is equal to text now let us see how we
can do it we'll use the same BS object
in written will put it into text text
object
now we'll supply ID is equal to text so
it will tell us that give me all element
which is having ID is equal to text okay
and let's bring this tag subject now the
are rather than iterating let's just
print the first element so it will just
give us first element and get tax okay
then so see this is the well prints so
Jeannie oh so this is what it has given
us inside this development having ID
tags
it has printed all the content of this
element which is having ID is equal to
tax okay that's it for now so we have
seen about how to select different
element based on the class and attribute
in a future video we will see about how
to select the parent of individual
element and a sibling of individual
element how to select the multiple
children of individual element that's it
