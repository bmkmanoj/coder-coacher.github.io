lecture series on machine learning in
Python and R so I am starting the new
brand video lecture series on a machine
learning and it's implementation on
Python and R so this is the first video
lecture series and all those algorithm
what we are going to learn in this
tutorial we are going to use Python and
R as our basic programming language and
we will implement those algorithm in
both Python and R so before diving into
programming side or it's a practical
side of this course I think that I have
created some agenda for the machine
learning theory we will see about first
why you should learn machine learning
like what is machine learning where
machine learning is right now why
machine learning now only you could have
started machine learning learning a baby
for why suddenly it got a lot of hype
and we will cover what we are going to
learn in this machine learning series so
in this tutorial we will take up this
problem that why you should learn
machine learning now only why you should
learn machine learning is there any need
why suddenly there is a too much hype in
machine learning so let's start so to
convince you about why you should learn
machine learning now I have created one
video and I have assembled number of
machine learning related codes which is
quoted by Bill Gates Jerry and the
co-founder of the Yahoo kind of big
famous personality that video will just
give you inspiration that why machine
learning is that much important and as
it is important you should definitely
learn now I have given link into
description and I have created video you
should definitely go and watch it this
is the link of the video I will put it
into description I'll give you many more
reason why you should learn machine
learning
let's see some of the application of the
computer science one of them will be a
very famous Amazon product
recommendation system we all buy lots of
good things from the Amazon daily and
Amazon gives us the recommendation based
on our buying habit that this is the
recommended books for you this is the
recommended product for you as you like
this thing you might like this thing
those who bought this thing those who
can also bought this thing so this way
Amazon gives you product recommendation
so do you want to know that what is the
technology what is the algorithm running
behind that another example Google
speech recognition so last year only
Google has told that in this is the news
I have taken from the venture bit its
headline was Google has slacks its
speech recognition word error rate by
more than 30% since 2012 so Google
speech recognition it's equivalent
Microsoft speech recognition and as app
by CD speech recognition also it's quite
impressive that it's error rate is
almost reduced and it's close to less
than a 5 person right now so we have
reached to the such accuracy that our
machine can understand our speech so
well so what is behind it what are the
algorithms are running behind it do you
want to know machine learning is the
technology behind it so you should
definitely go and learn about the
machine learning one more example about
the Google Translate Google Translate
translate the language from one language
to another language language pair is
close to around the 7,000 different
language Google is able to translate so
what is running behind a machine
learning
Facebook photo tagging once you upload
the photo Facebook automatically able to
identify your photo your friend photo it
is able to identify that is inside the
photo
apart from even a photo or even a face
photo other object it can able to
identify so machine learning is the
technology behind it Google web search
Google gives a very fabulous stand
result based on your query search on
your web search engine so what is
responsible behind it how Google is able
to give such a good result such a based
result which you always like based on
your query string so machine learning is
the technology behind it let's search
this machine learning keyword on a
Google triangle so you will get a better
idea so I have already searched the
machine learning term on the Google
trend so this is the statistics for last
five years this is the statistics for
last five years
wild wide so if you see in 2012 the
average relative search result was just
the 19 as it has gone to almost 100 till
today so you can see the graphs are keep
increasing so more and more people are
searching about the machine learning on
the web everyone wants to learn about
the machine learning on internet so why
not you you should definitely go and
learn about the machine learning if you
type another branch of machine learning
like a deep learning which we are going
to cover in this video lecture which is
which got lot of hype but that hype is
also very good actually
in 2012 nobody knows about the machine
deep learning apart from a very few high
prominent researchers but now everyone
wants to know about what is deep
learning what are the all technology
running behind the application which
I have just shown you in your previous
life so deep learning machine learning
kind of the technology running behind
that so you have all reason to start
learning about this video lecture series
one more reason I will show you okay I
let's go to Big Data technology so this
is the graph I have taken from this
source dr4 void dot-com website you can
definitely go and see about the you can
read about the full block so they have
created one image and this image they
are trying to convince that in a just
one minute of the day every single
minute of the day what is happening on a
social media what is happening on
internet so I'll just give you a small
glimpse there are to 3.2 billion people
around the world are using internet
right now out of them every single
minute every single minute 1 lakh 10000
around Skype calls are happening every
single minute every single minute 4.1
million users like the post on a
Facebook every single minute 300 hours
of new YouTube video getting uploaded
and there are many more things actually
every minute somewhere around this is
not quite visible since some around 20
1310 around unique visitors visit the
Amazon so we have a lots of data in the
future so if you have a data but
manually analyzing this data it's almost
impossible because data is increasing at
an exponential rate and we don't have a
such a huge amount of manpower so we
need some framework who can analyze this
data automatically we need some
algorithm who can analyze we need some
very
good framework who can do all those
tasks for us which will give us some
kind of predictive analysis out of all
those data so there is a very strong
reason that machine learning Big Data
deep learning kind of technology are
running behind it so if you have all
those data who is going to analyze
machine learning is going to analyze
this data automatically so you should
definitely go and learn about the
machine learning series and that's why I
have started this machine learning
series in a future lecture we will see
about more about what is machine
learning and where machine learning is
right now so that's it for this lecture
friends I hope you enjoy listening this
video and if you want me to make little
bit more change in a video lecture
series please please write in to comment
I am going through step by step every
single algorithm of machine learning and
will implement it to Python in our
that's it for this lecture friends thank
