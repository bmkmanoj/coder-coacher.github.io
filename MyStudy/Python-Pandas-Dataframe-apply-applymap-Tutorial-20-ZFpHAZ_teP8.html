lecture series on a data analysis with
Delta Python so in this tutorial we are
going to see two different functionality
of the attributes or the functionality
of the data frame object apply and apply
a map in the last lecture we have seen a
three different use cases of map the
same way there is another two variants
of that functionality which is apply and
apply map so let's try to understand
with the two different example how this
apply and apply maps will be helpful
while modifying or any kind of
mathematical operation you want to
perform along any exists so let's just
first import this panda okay so for
apply what he says that apply will be
helpful further applying any custom
function whatever you written you can
apply on any axis of the data frame and
apply map apply map function will be
helpful to apply that particular
function to each and every data element
of the data frame object so actually
what is the difference between this
apply and apply map is there very small
differences you can apply this apply
function along any axis only so you want
to modify particular axis or particular
column you can use this apply function
and you want to apply to each and every
column or each and every cells each and
every data of this whole data frame
object that data type of that individual
cell must be of uniform type in that
case of apply map you can use this apply
map function so I have already created
two different examples so in a very
first one I have created a simple three
column data frame object which is a
first name age and city let's try to
print it and apply this apply function
so we have a three column first name age
and a city so suppose we want to apply
actually apply function on this very
first column first name first underscore
name and we want to make it just
capitalized so we can use this apply
function let's see how we can do it so
let's create another column like a FN
and we will assign this calculated value
do this happen column so I have told
that this apply function will be
applying on any axis only so we have to
supply that which column you want to
modify or on which column you want to
perform this custom function operation
so first name we can apply any kind of
custom functionality so suppose we want
to make each and every first name
capitalized so let's define our another
capitalize function lambda X X dot
apart okay so we have created one custom
function which is a capitalized er now
this same capitalized ER function we
will apply to this apply function okay
so what it will do actually this is the
one capitalized function in this we have
given as an argument to this apply
function and we are applying those
function on individual cells of only
first column and that we will assign to
another new brand new column D FF n so
it's column name will be happy okay
let's just print it it has executed fine
okay so it has created one brand new
column for us whose name is FN and
individual values of this afferent
column is been capitalized based on
whatever values were available in a
first underscore name column so check
becomes this capital Jack Mina become
capital Mina so that's how this apply
function will be helpful to apply any
kind of mathematical operation along any
particular column now let's see apply
map function how apply map function will
be helpful
so for apply map function I have created
one very small data set of individual
person whose height and age has been
given so very hypothetical data have
created let's just print it to the air
for now let's apply this apply map
function on this whole data frame so
suppose we want to calculate the square
root of all the cells available in this
data frame object df1 so something like
a nine become three and four sixteen
become four so let's just apply apply
map
employment now in numpy library we have
already available one square root
functionality so we will use NP dot
square root okay so apply met
functionality will be applying this
custom function or this is the all
built-in function I have use in this
case we'll be applying on individual
cell so all the cells of a data frame so
let's just execute okay NP is not are
not defined we need to import this numpy
library yes
okay so it has created this square root
of individual rows of 74 become 8.6 23
4.7 and 51 become 1 remains 1 the
violent well become almost 3.46 so this
wait is applying and apply my
functionality will be helpful while
performing any kind of operation for all
the data we use apply a function and
along the individual axis if we want to
modify data or if you want to perform
any mathematical logical operation we
will use the apply function so that's it
for this lecture friends I hope you
