on tensorflow of basic tutorial so in
the last lecture we have seen about how
to install tensor flow we have imported
the tensor flow library as a renamed to
the TF you have seen that how we can
verify that whether tensor flow which
version of tensor flow be how install so
in this tutorial we are going to see
about how to define the constant or
variable or a new concepts like a place
holder inside this tensor flow first of
all are the tensor flow execution works
inside this two step first you need to
define a graph and then you need to
execute those graph so first is nothing
but you need to give the definition of
individual nodes and each graph is
nothing but the set of node and H which
are connected together so node contains
the individual operation in a H will
contain the whatever the output here got
from the individual naught it will
propagate to the another node so
tensorflow works on a principle of how
the graph system works basically so
let's define let's see how we can
calculate how we can define the simple
constant and how we can calculate or
make a operation under top of it okay so
in a TF has one matter constant
then you can supply simple value like
3.0 and we will assign it to the any
variable T the same way will be fine
another constant okay so we have defined
that to variable C now let's just add it
and print this C okay so we should
expect that discipline C should print
total seven number as a number as a
float value but it has printed this C as
a one of the tensor object so what goes
actually wrong here physically so I told
you that data execution staff works in a
two step so till now we have just
defined the three nodes which is nothing
but a B and C C is dependent on to
another node which is not a two constant
a and B but if we haven't given it is C
to actually execute we haven't given
instruction a and B to even execute so
in a tensorflow what we need to do we
need to create one a session variable so
TF will provide this session now inside
this session we need to run this C
variable so we can do like
okay now we got the C is equal to seven
this is nothing but the addition of
three and four so what is happening here
there are two steps process till now we
have defined perhaps the graph is having
a B and C node and a different operation
associated with that node so after that
what this tensorflow will do once you
start the session it will start the
compiling those graph and then if you
supplied it you just run on the variable
C C is nothing but it depends on a and B
so eventually it will then a and B also
and it will calculate this seven so it
won't work useful the way python system
ever works now let's see another
functionality like a variable okay one
thing more in a constant variable okay
so we have added just now the two
constant value now let's go for how to
add the two variable one variable will
be defined and on another variable so
let's define one constant like an X
is nothing but like a 10 but you can
give even a name of this tensor also
which is let's give X only so while
saving this variable in a persistent
storage when you retry bit you can retry
bit with this name now let's define one
more variable this is the constant we
have defined let's define our variable
so variable Y Y is nothing but X plus
suppose 6 so Y is dependent variable on
X and X is nothing but the constant for
us then name will do by ok so we have
defined a two variable one is a constant
and a one is a variable now in earlier
case we didn t need Susilo is any kind
of variable because that was a constant
value and it has been initialized while
creating this function only but in this
case we have to initialize this variable
so what this tensorflow will do
initialize all variable has a f has one
matter in isla is all variable and we
will assign it to the model so till now
we have defined the graph for us and now
we are defining all the variable value
now we have already defined as session
is equal to cells so inside this
function we can start running our code
so till now everything has been defined
now inside this session let's start
running the codon so in side decision
run I will run on Y variable okay there
are some problem
okay you once you initialize this
variable you can apply on model also
now you can run this session dot run on
bike okay we got it
this is nothing but a sixteen so ten
plus six is your sixteen so once we have
defined is initialized variable we have
to run this variable also which will
eventually create X&amp;amp;Y now once we start
running this way it has generated the
actual output the actual execution of
different this node x and y has been
starting so till now or we have seen
about how to define a constant and how
to define a variable and once inside you
are in a shain variable you can start
execution individual node and whatever
the independent node on the top of that
independent node that will also
eventually execute based on whatever the
mathematical operation we have defined
so that is for constant and variable now
suppose this is add or everything at
defining time you are already defining
the value of individual constant or that
any variable which is dependent on
another variable now suppose a while
executing graph you want to read some
data to the system you want to change
the data to the system based on some
interval of time so those things you can
do with the help of just the variable so
for that purpose there is a new concept
like a placeholder so while running this
graph at that time you won't need to you
suppose you want to provide some data to
the graph all to some data to the
particular node of the graph then how
will you do it so let's create a one
placeholder variable first and let's try
to understand how it's working
placeholder and I'll just simply give
the name x1 and no shape or no dimension
to the dis X 1 variable so it will take
any dimension of value and let's define
another variable life of y1 is nothing
but like two times x1 so whatever value
has been given in a x1 is being
multiplied by two and it will store
inside this a y1 but how to supply this
value to the X 1 because in earlier our
case we were defining both the times it
is a constant independent variable is a
constant and we're supplying this value
there only but suppose while running the
program if we want to supply all those
value how you can do it so that is the
use of this place holder now let's run
this y1 we have already this session
variable session variable now if you
supply if you run this world you will
get an error because it is trying to run
this y1 variable but it has no value has
been supplied in x1 because it is trying
to run ultimately it wants this X 1
variable to calculate this y1 so there
is a one more argument you can supply
which is nothing but this dictionary
that how will you supply this X 1 so X 1
is equal to you can supply any value
like suppose 10 and you can run it
okay we need to provide I think
or simply suppose
expected data type of D time is not x1
okay in x1 actually we need to provide
here the data type which is nothing but
the float all we have been assigned a
float and let's try to run it okay we
got this 4 into 2 is equal to 8
you can even supply in a runtime some
array also okay so every value inside
this error has been multiplied by to
various finger so what is difference
between constant variable and this
placeholder so in the case of constant
and variable while defining graph only
we have assigned to individual values
but in case of this placeholder while
running the graph we are supplying the
value to the independent variable and
eventually it will calculate the
dependent variable for us so that's it
for this lecture friends are we have
come covered enough basics for this
tensorflow to get started and to get
started for our first the neural network
and artificial neural network plus deep
learning related models so in a future
lecture we will see about the different
deep learning model to get implemented
inside this tensor flow so I hope you
