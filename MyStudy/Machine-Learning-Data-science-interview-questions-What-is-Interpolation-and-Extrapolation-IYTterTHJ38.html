lecture series on a machine learning
interview question can answer so in this
lecture we are going to see about one
more important question that what is
interpolation and what is extrapolation
so let us try to understand what is
interpolation in interpolation is there
so this concept interpolation and
extrapolation is mainly related to the
predicting the data value where we don't
have a data so let's say suppose you
have some series like I have already
listed once it is like x and y so x axis
values are like listed in the first
column and y axis value listed in the
second column so in x axis I have
already listed a very linear values like
a 1 2 9 but Y can be any one so there
must be a some relation exists between
this x and y but we cannot get some
definite equation but we have a value
available at point x is equal to 1 x is
equal to 2 the same way up to X is equal
to 9 but suppose we want to find the
value x is equal to at x is equal to 2
point 5 all we want but we do not have a
value available at X is equal to 2 point
5 so how we can use this different value
of y and we can predict what is the
value of y at X is equal to 2 point 5
which is not available it is something
like whenever you have a data missing in
your database and you want to
interpolate those data based on whatever
the data you have available which is
nothing but the interpolation suppose we
want to predict value X is equal to at X
is equal to let's say 11 so we don't
have a value available of Y at X is
equal to 11
so we are trying to extending the value
because we have all values available
between 1 to 9 only but we are trying to
extending a value
four x is equal to nine ten eleven and
based on whatever the data we have
available we are extending those value
and we are trying to predict that what
is the value available of Y at X is
equal to eleven
so let's try to plot it and let's try to
understand there are number of
techniques are available to predict or
interpolate even extrapolate this kind
of way so I will make it as a scatter
plot we will understand it clearly okay
so it has generated very nice scatter
plot for us so you can see at X is equal
to 1 we have went to 3 so this one is X
is equal to 1 X is equal to 2 X 3 4 5 6
7 8 8 ok it is just the labeling
actually so we have all data is
available in extra comma Y format in a
two dimensional graph view displayed in
a scatter plot formation now we have
data available or all integer values on
the x is 0 1 2 9 now let's take a first
question X is equal to 2 point 5 let's
say in the ED displacement we do not
have a data available so can we predict
based on whatever the value available
adjacent to this X is equal to 2 point 5
because at X is equal to 2 point 5 we
have a value available at X is equal to
2 X is equal to 1 we can go even beyond
at the other side of all so X is equal
to 3 and X is equal to 4 so can we use
those value to predict whether X is
equal what is the value of y at X is
equal to 2 point 5 that is nothing but
the interpolation so you are trying to
predict the value where value is not
available and you are taking the
advantage of all points which are very
adjacent to it so there are number of
technique you can use like you can take
a mean of all values which are nearest
who you can take another statistical
analysis tool like median or any other
statistical method technique you can use
to better Interpol
later or better predictors value at X is
equal to 2.5 so you are trying to
interpolating the value which doesn't
exist in your database because we don't
have any value available in our database
at X is equal to 2.5 which is nothing
but interpolation now interpolation
requires or means the all values or all
data which is available around that
particular value where we are trying to
predict the value let us consider X is
equal to 11 so we have data available
between the range X is equal to 1 to X
is equal to 9 only but let's try to
extend it to X is equal to 11 so it will
be somewhere around here
so based on all those values previously
available can we extend this value can
we extrapolate because you are going
extra you are going outside of the
database limit because our database
limit lies between X to 0 1 to 9 so can
we use all those value of x as usual 1
to 9 and predict the behavior or predict
what is the value of y will be available
at X is equal to 11 that is nothing but
the extrapolation because you are
extending the value so whenever you are
trying to predict the value of any
variable based on whatever the values
are nearest that particular point which
is nothing but interpolation where the
data does not exist in your database but
in case of extrapolation you are trying
to predict the value you are trying to
extending the value where the value
doesn't exist that is nothing but the
extra values of n we predict the value
at X is 11 it is nothing but it can be
anywhere you can use a number of
techniques are available for extending
you can use the regression technique
mainly and there are number of type of
regressions are available we can try to
fit any curve line or even a straight
line into this graph and we can predict
what can be the possible value at X is
equal to 2.5 or X is equal to 11 so that
is nothing but
the interpolation and extrapolation so
that's it for this lecture friend so I
