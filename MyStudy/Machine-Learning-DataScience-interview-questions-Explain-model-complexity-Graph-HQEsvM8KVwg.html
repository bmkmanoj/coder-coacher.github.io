what is this model complexity we have
build a machine learning system design
we have trained it we have taste it but
how will you evaluate it how will you
come to know about it which particular
model is the best suited for me this is
working based on a training data this is
working on based on a testing data so
which model should I choose based on the
complexity if we introduce the more
complexity what is happening to the
model if we introduce less complexity if
I make a model very simple how it is
affecting to my training and testing
data so let's try to understand this
thing with respect to one graph that is
nothing but the model complexity graph
so this model complexity graph is
nothing but your training testing error
or validation error training testing
error versus the complexity of the model
so from the internet I have already
taken one sample graph so this is the
sample graph I have already taken which
is the standard way of looking at how
based on the complexity your training
error and a tasting error change how
much it will increase and decrease so
this link has been given in a
description from where I have taken this
image so let's try to understand this
graph based on the model complexity so
you will come to know about it which
particular model or at which point you
need to decide or you need to stop that
this model I need to choose for my
training and a tasting data so you know
vertical axis it's gives the prediction
error or a training and a tasting at
best error and a horizontal axis it's a
model complexity so from left it's low
to towards the right it's a high level
complexity so let's try to understand
with respect to let's say we are trying
to fit our model to particular
polynomial or it's a
duration kind of problems so let's say
let's just assume that it's a
first-order polynomial we are trying to
fit on a left side of the data then
we'll move towards let's say little
increase like a three or fourth fourth
order polynomial slowly slowly we are
increasing the model complexity let's
say it's seven afterwards you are trying
to fit to ten then on a very high
complex City model
we are trying to fit the data to the 15
order polynomials so this way model
complexity increase so on the left side
we have a very less complex model if it
is a less complex model that means there
is a lot of biasing we have applied to
the model we have take a lot of
assumption about the Mosin model and
there is a very lease for ions andhe
model so on that side we have a
situation like under fitting is
occurring under fitting because that
won't work very good on a training data
and a testing data so red curve is
giving the indication of the testing
sample error based on the model
complexity increase and this blue one
it's nothing but the training data error
so on a left-side area that is where the
training error and a testing error both
are very high which is nothing but a
high bias and a low variance area where
the training and testing error are very
high let's try to increase the model
complexity little bit slowly slowly but
before that let's try to understand a
very high model complexity area like a
tenth order polynomial we are trying to
fit two over data or a fifteen order
polynomial we are trying to fit to the
data
this is where we are putting very low
bias but we are trying to make a very
complex model as we are putting lots of
lots of different weighting parameter
plus a hyper parameter to our system so
it's called a very high variance and a
low bias system where we are trying to
stick to our all training data
completely with of whatever the model we
have selected so definitely it will work
very good on our training data but as it
has various
to the our training data it won't
perform Valona tasting data so training
is a very good but the tasting is a very
bad tasting error is very high in case
of high complexity model low bias and a
high V rise so in this situation the
situation like a overfitting is
occurring it is just trying to memorize
the all input data but we don't want any
of this situation because we want our
machine learning model which will work
better on both training data plus a
testing data so we want situation which
is something like in between where
polynomial of order 4 to 7 somewhere
will work verified now if you consider
area somewhere here physically that is
where the testing error and a training
error both are almost minimum so that is
like a you're increasing model
complexity with respect to your under
fitting situation occurs but less your
model is not so much complex that it is
overfitting your training data so
situations somewhere here of polynomial
4 to 7 degree around X where the
training error is also minimum testing
error is also minima and it will work
better on both training and testing
error so model complexity is nothing but
it is giving you the indication that
based on your model complexity how based
on your complexity if you increase in to
model the man the way you increase the
model complexity in to your system your
variance towards the system your
variance in a system will keep
increasing because it won't work better
on a testing data so you want situation
which is somewhere around here and this
model complexity graph will tell you
that at which point you need to stop so
this is the area in which we need to
stop where we are giving minimum
training error and minimum testing error
and this model complexity graph is very
helpful after taking a lot of experiment
and and play with lot of waiting power
rate parameter plus a high
parameter on a machine learning system
so that's it for this model complexity
