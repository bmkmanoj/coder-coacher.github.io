lecture series on machine learning
so in this tutorial we are going to see
some of the visualization technique for
the high dimension visualization mostly
for the more than three dimension data
set visualization so first of all why
such a techniques is required we have
seen in earlier lot of example of
different machine learning algorithms
also we have taken some very small data
set into two dimension or sometimes in a
three dimension and then we apply some
machine learning algorithm on the top of
it that is just for the learning purpose
but in reality that whatever the actual
data set is available that will be in a
much more higher dimension it will be
generally in a more than 1000 or than
hundred even sometimes the million
dimensions are possible for individual
record so for human going more than two
or three dimension above then it will be
very difficult to visualize any data set
that's why such a techniques are require
so in this tutorial we are going to see
about one very famous technique of
parallel coordinates technique so
implementation of this parallel
coordinates technique is already
available insider scikit-learn library
so net let's see how this parallel
coordinate technique is working so for
the parallel coordinates technique we
are treating each line as a individual
features of the individual the records
and each and every align with respect to
the data record we are just connecting
with each other so once we visualize you
will come to know about beta ray so for
that purpose I have already made some
necessary inputs so we are going to use
this pandas tools plotting functionality
and I have imported this parallel
coordinates module out of it we are
going to apply this thing unto iris
dataset so I have imported this iris
dataset and we are going to use simple
finder so import pointers as epi
and matplotlib in line so we can
visualize the whole thing here so this
is all about the necessary inputs so let
me just turn it okay so I have
successfully done this after that I have
written some small code for a loading
iris dataset I have already loaded
desired data set number of times in our
earlier lecture also so you can go
through this lecture so I have done
nothing I just loaded this iris dataset
into data frame object of the Python
so first 400 will be somewhat like a
individual features of a record like a
separate several bit and better let and
vital it once we visualize it you will
come to know about better way and very
last comment column I have mapped it to
individual classes of features something
like we have all value for the target is
0 1 &amp;amp; 2 I have just mapped it to the
individual name like asset or sub
particular or virginica okay so let me
just run it for loading purpose and
let's just visualize the this data frame
so we will come to know about it how to
work okay so we have first 50 records is
lying inside this setosa class of family
this flower and first for column is a
separ length sepal way to title antenna
title wit another of 50 records in ER
the second category like a ver see color
and a third 50 records in a with jennyca
class of family so now we have already
the data set now let's just apply this
data set on to the parallel coordinate
system and let us try to visualize it so
we have already made some necessary
inputs so I am just directly going to
use this parallel coordinate
functionality and let's just supply for
just first 50 records for the visualize
and you can apply all those record at
the ones also but as we already know in
this case there
first 50 records lie into one class of
family another 50 records the next
immediate 50 record lies into seven
class of family which is nothing but the
versicolor and a third 50 that calls the
immediate next to the second 50 records
which lies into third class of family
which is nothing but the virginica class
of family so let's just apply it a very
first 50 records so it will indicate the
zero to 50 and we need to supply which
column will indicate your actually
classes so our class name name is target
name the column name is target name I
have given so I'll just apply here the
target
okay so it has visualized we created a
display for the settler set us a class
of family now if you see this parallel
coordinate system there are total four
parallel lines which indicates that
there are total four individual feature
we are going to visualize the first line
indicates the sepal length second line
is a sepal width third line is a patter
length and a part of it all are in a
centimeter so if you see the four the
sector's our class of family only
this sample length mostly lies between
this four point two to somewhere around
five point 8 centimeter the length
between these two range and as for that
sample which lies between this two point
four a one is looking like an outlier in
this case with respect to just this
feature remaining all lies into this
range so this a way you can visualize
the individual record with respect to
all four dimension now let us try to
visualize the another set of family like
50 to 100 record okay that is a
versicolor
so you can see the almost the graph is
quite chain because for the versicolor
you can visualize this Apple wind is
completely almost chain the range is
even a pattern in the pattern length is
also change but a battle weight is quite
similar with respect to the our earlier
case seesaw setosa basically so let's
try the last one also so we'll go Pitta
100 to 150 okay so this is a very scenic
ah so in case of sepal length is a quite
similar even sepal width is a little bit
similar even title later so there is a
huge amount of similarity between with
seneca anniversa color set of family
flower follower
so it will be a difficult to actually
classified is so our machine learning or
algorithm will take care of it but there
is a good amount of difference between
the setosa family and our singular
family and the setters are familiar with
sinico family because if you clearly
observe this very second and third
diamonds and this is a sample wit and a
sample pattern length which is almost
completely changing with respect between
the Saito signer versicolor family so
this way you can visualize this
individual records which is having in a
more than three dimension with the help
of parallel coordinate system at a1
stock but we have visualized
individually with respect to individual
class now let's just try to visualize
the all at once actually let's see how
it will display okay so it has generated
the three graphs and it has given almost
three color so first is the brown is
kind of gold golden color which is
setosa the second one is a more peach
color that is our C kill'uh and a yellow
one is a virginica so if you see
cytosine versicolor this this family
pack talent is might be the quite
deciding factor whether this particular
feature value will lies in to which kind
of family even the last feature also
quite discriminatory but the very first
feature is a person and second feature
is a almost overlap in terms of
arranging so the first and second
feature won't be a very deciding factor
while the classification algorithm will
apply on a machine learning system so
this is the one technique for the
visualization of more than three
dimension data or one shot and this is a
very useful technique while you are
analyzing data before apply your machine
learning algorithm on the top of it in a
future lecture we are going to see even
more this kind of a technique that how
you can visualize even more
hi diamonds and stuff into very low
dimensional data set so you can make a
very good decision about your machine
learning algorithm even for
pre-processing what kind of technique
you need to apply to remove some
outliers or anything so that's it for
this lecture friends I hope you enjoy
