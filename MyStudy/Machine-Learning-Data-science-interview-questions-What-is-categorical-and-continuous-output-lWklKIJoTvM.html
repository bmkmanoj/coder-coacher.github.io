important question what is categorical
and a continuous output or either you
can tell it as like a numerical or a
discrete output so let's try to
understand these two terminology
categorical output and a continuous
output with some couple of example so
let's see first example house price
prediction now if you see this house
price prediction problem so I'll make
one column like a output type house
price can be anything it is a continuous
value it can range from you can save one
dollar to millions or even a billions of
dollar so you can classify it into
continuous value because there is an
infinite levels are available you can
predict the house price which is any
numeric value so that is a continuous or
you can say it like a numerical because
there is an infinite numbers of labels
are there
let's see another problem you have
suppose one image and we need to find
whether that particular image contains a
cat or not so it has a just possible to
output whether particular image has a
cat or that particular image do not have
a cat so there is a two possible
discrete outputs are only there so
output lies in a two different category
whether it lies in a cat photo or it
lies in a no cat photo whether it
contains cat or whether it doesn't
contain game so there is a two two
output two possible output
so we will call it as a category
categorical okay let's see another
problem loan application will be
approved for ten years twenty years and
thirty years so there are a number of
features or a number of dependent
independent variables for this and our
objective function will decide that
whether will approve loan for this
person who is applied for the loan for
some amount of rupees will be approved
for a ten year 20 year or third-tier
which through which we will get a
maximum benefit so there is a three
possible output only so it's another
categorical but put example or a
discrete output example the three
category lies between whether being
approved for a tenure whether will
approved for a twenty year or whether
will approved for a thirty year so there
is a three possible output three
possible output okay another problem how
much loan will be a proven so it will be
in terms of rupees so let's say we have
applied for a almost half a million
dollar loan we want but they may
approved from any numbers like a 0.3
million dollar or 0.4 million dollar it
can be 0.45 million dollar so there is
infinite numbers of values are available
so it's a continuous output so we have
seen number of example where output will
be decide based on whether it has a
continuous value whether it has a
infinite value then it will be
classified as a numerical output it has
a continuous output but if the output
has a discrete number of stab or
discrete number of possible category it
will be classified into categorical
output now if you see supervised
classification mechanism we have a total
two types of machine learning mechanisms
are there
one is the regression and one is a
classification so these two types are
the supervised classification algorithm
so if you want to predict this kind of
continuous value as an output as an
output of your objective function or
your hypothesis then in that case you
can use the regression stuff so I'll
make it as a same color so you can
understand it very well okay okay so
house price prediction how much loan
will be approved in terms of rupees that
will be decided by the regression kind
of algorithm and that is nothing but of
one kind of supervised way of learning
now suppose we want to classify into
number of discreet output number of
possible output category so these two
example image contains cat or not loan
approved will be for ten years twenty
years or thirty so these are all
discrete output so there will be a
classification kind of algorithm or it's
a classification problem so you can use
the classification algorithm to solve
those kind of problem so I will make it
with another color okay okay so these
two problem lies in the classification
problem this first and fourth one will
line continuous output that's why it
phase that regression algorithm so
that's it for this lecture friends so I
hope you enjoy listening this video and
