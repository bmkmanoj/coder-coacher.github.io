lecture series on up Reddy's database so
the last lecture we have seen about how
you can cite a very simple string how
you can retry out hustling how you can
make some key to expire after certain
interval of time in terms of second in
this lecture we are going to see about
how you can use those functionality from
the higher level programming language
and for our case we are going to select
the Python programming language so let's
start that how we can install this
Python client for the readies and how
you can file the very simple command for
the getting and setting the simple key
value pair kind of storage in a Redis
database so python is providing the
peepin stoller this is the one of the
very easiest way to install the Python
packages on a Ubuntu machine and even on
a Windows also so Python is providing
this install ready I have already
installed so that's why it is saying
that requirement is already satisfied if
you haven't installed it will just
install this Redis client library for
the Python on your Ubuntu machine for me
it was already installed that's why it
is telling that it is already satisfied
so let's just import this reddy's in a
Python and let's connect already's
database from this Python so we require
to import this Redis first okay we have
successfully imported this Redis import
statement now in the red is we have a
object like a Redis on the top of Redis
where we can provide a lot of arguments
like where the Redis database exists in
our case it is in a localhost so no need
to require to provide any kind of
arguments suppose it is running on a
some different probe apart from a
default port you can give as the
argument but in this case no argument is
required
and it will create the Redis object for
us let's assign it to somewhere kind of
our and we will apply the operation on
the top of our reference afterwards so
it has successfully connected this
readies from Python to the Redis
database now suppose we want to set the
string like we have a sect commandment
like a mu is equal to bar so we have a
set function okay it has given us true
that means it has successfully set this
foo is equal to bar now let's get this
same one with get functionality on the
top of our so we'll supply the key value
okay it has given us the bar stop now in
the last lecture we have seen about the
expire and TTL time to leave kind of
functionality let's see how expire will
work so let's put the expire for twenty
second around and so okay sorry we need
to supply the key so this will tell us
that after twenty second this foo key
will they will expire and the same we
can check with our dot to get
okay still it is written because 22nd
has not over but you can check with TTL
and time to lift it how many seconds are
still left
okay it has expired that's why it has
not given any kind of output okay
it has not given output that's why it
has expired let's try to do it one more
time like it 30 second okay now let's
get it okay we need to set it first
because it has already expired so we
have successfully set it let's get it
okay we have successfully get also is
equal to bar now let's put the expire
functionality on the top of Pookie
okay for 30 second now let's get it we
have successfully retrieved this bar now
let's keep checking this TTL okay 22
second level 20 second laughs let's just
reply with okay still here it has
successfully required us only nine
second left so after 30 second it will
just expire
okay it has expired okay it want to give
result for the fucking so that is how we
can connect the readies database from
the Python programming language in a
future lecture we will see more much
more data structure like a list sad and
assorted said hash map in a Redis
database so that's it for this lecture
