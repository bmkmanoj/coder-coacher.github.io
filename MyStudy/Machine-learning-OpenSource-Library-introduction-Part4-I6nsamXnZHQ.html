lecture series onto the video lecture
series on machine learning so till now
we have seen that or what are the what
is machine learning what is the basic
building blocks of machine learning how
machine learning system works what are
the different types of machine learning
system so in this tutorial we are going
to see about what are the software is
required not generally we are going to
use the Python only so what are the
Python library is required for the
machine learning programming so let us
see
these are the all open source software's
are required as a part of machine
learning library let us see one by one
each of them and what are the they're
used so first of all we are going to
code everything into the Python there
are alternatives are available in two
are in Java so but the Python C is very
famous in how among the machine learning
community so we are going to use the
Python and on top of Python we are going
to install the different open-source
machine learning related library so
these are the second one is an numpy
scientific Python and a matte lip loudly
so this sir all helper kind of library
which are used to feeding a data for the
visualization of data or data related
manipulation if you want to do there is
one more famous libraries a panda that
is for data scientists normally use so
if you want to do any kind of data
joiner or data manipulation if you want
to visualize data you can use the
matplotlib and there is a very good
numerical Python library which has a
good amount of matrix vector related
calculation related all those
functionality so we'll install this
numpy scientific numerical python insert
this scientific python and this math
matrix plot library so these are all
kind of helper library available so this
is one of the most famous and we are
going to use this for our coding purpose
that is a scikit-learn library it is
specifically dedicated to the machine
learning related algorithm majority of
machine learning algorithms are
implemented into scikit-learn live
library the one more is a tensorflow
google is just now release based on door
deep learning technology completely open
so this tensorflow
library so these are all going to
is the minimum requirement as a software
site for our machine learning coding so
if you want to install all of this you
can use this rather than individually
installing one by one you can come use
this anaconda distribution I'll show you
how to install it and a setup based on
your operating system which you use
there are other machine learning and
deep learning related libraries are also
available Tiana and Cara's these are
just an alternatives of tensorflow so
let's see how we'll install this
anaconda distribution okay you just go
to the google and type anaconda
distribution so first page you will cut
it it that is a download anaconda so
this anaconda is nothing but the
complete package of more than around 200
and 200 packages of different scientific
Python related module so there is no
requirement to individually download and
install each module one by one you can
install anaconda based on your operating
system which when you use either don't
have windows or if you are using a Mac
OS then you can download this one and if
you are running Linux you can download
this one based on the Python 2x family
of Python you are using or the X family
of Python you are using ok so these are
all the requirement from the software
side as far as the hardware is the
concern there is a considerable amount
of Pentium 4 or about the processor plus
at least 4gb of RAM is more than
sufficient and all modern laptops and
desktop are come up with this much
minimum configuration so friends these
are all the minimum basic requirements
for our next coding part of machine
learning into the Python and
of how different package will use for
based on our different different
algorithms okay so that's it for the
this lecture in a subsequent lecture we
will see that what are the algorithms we
are going to learn based on the
supervisor and supervised learning what
are the different color suffocation and
regression based the algorithm so I hope
you enjoyed this video and please like
