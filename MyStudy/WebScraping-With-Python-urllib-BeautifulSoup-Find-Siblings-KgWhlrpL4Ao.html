tutorial inside the video lecture series
on web scrapping with the help of Python
beautiful stroke library sin the large
likes last lecture we have seen about
how we can find a descendant of
individual element inside the HTML tag
now in this lecture we are going to see
about how you can select the sibling of
individual element so let's see what
does this say bling mean in this case so
in this case also we are going to use
this reference web page let's see the
source code of this web page so if you
consider inside this table tag which is
having ID quicklist' there is a 1 TR
element along with that TR element there
is another TR element which is not the
descendant of TR element but along the
side at the same hierarchical level this
different TR element are situated so
suppose we give 1 TR element and we want
to find all the siblings of this TR
element which is nothing but all this TR
element which is having an ID gift one
gift to give 3 gift for and now gift 5
so this all TR LM meant which are all
the sibling of this the very first TR
element which is nothing but the header
of this table so this individual TR
element we present the 1 1 row of
individual table individual rows ok ok
let's start how we can do it in our
beautiful soft function
okay let's start let's first import our
UI live library for the fetching web
page and then beautiful soap library so
from URL to import star I'm using URL
Lib 2 because I am using the Python 2x
family version 2.7 if you are using
python 3x family version you can go for
just the URL little bit because it has
the same library has been renamed to URL
live from your lip to now we will import
the beautiful soaps like so from B s for
important beautiful soap so we have
imported these two library now let's
open this URL we will supply the URL of
this webpage which we want to fetch if
we want to extract the data and we will
assign it to HTML reference ranking but
now we caught this data inside this HTML
reference variable now let's pass this
data so for passing purpose we are going
to use this beautiful soft function
inside this beautiful soap library so we
will supply whole our HTML string and we
will supply the parser name so standard
parser is Alex ml and we will assign it
to the BS so till now we have got all
the parse data inside this BS reference
which is nothing but the beautiful soft
objects invisible soap library now our
task is to find all these siblings of
this TR element so let's first find this
TR element and on the top of this TR
element we will apply the next siblings
matters which will return us the all
sibling of this TR tag so let's first
find that PR element now we cannot go
directly to find a TR element
so let's the reference
it with the help of tag element and the
tag element has has descendant TR
element
so let's find this table element first
and which is having ID gift list which
we did in last lecture so yes dot there
is one fine function is there inside
that we will supply the tail tag name
which we want to find this is a table an
ID we will supply it in curly braces so
it is a gift list okay
so till now we have got the table
element the tag which is having the name
table now we want to find the the first
TR of that so it will read this much
amount of code will return us the very
first the TR tag of this element insert
the header of this table and our task is
to find all siblings of this TR tag so
there is a one mattered I traveled next
sibling
next siblings so what it will do it will
return us all TR element inside this
table which is nothing but the sibling
of the first TR element so it won't
return the very first because that's
what our reference is with respect to
the first TR element we need we want to
find all the siblings so it will return
as lot of siblings so we will put it
inside some zips reference and now let's
iterate it and print individual six
siblings with the help of for loop okay
so we have got all siblings of this TR
element inside this zips reference and
we have it traded for individual element
of this zips and let's print it so
before running this code we are
expecting it to give output like this D
our element as a first one then the
second TR element which is a guiding
gift Oh give three clip four and give
fine so let's turn it and verify it
okay there is a typo here
siblings
okay we got it so it has written as the
altie our element which is the sibling
of the first tr element we give it one
give to Heidi and a third element gift I
didn't give three fourth element as I
did you for any gift fight that is what
we are expecting from the next sibling
attribute so in this way we can find a
sibling of individual element with the
help of business sibling attribute on
the top of this beautiful soap function
