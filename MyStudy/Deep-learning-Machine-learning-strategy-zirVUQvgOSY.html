lecture series on a deep learning and a
neural network so in this tutorial we
are going to see about what is the basic
strategy behind machine learning
algorithm so before getting into how
machine learning works let's try to
understand how we as a human in our
childhood learn the different skills
there are two ways we have acquired our
majority of skills lot of things we
learn unconsciously and for lot of
things we have put explicit efforts to
learn about consciously in our childhood
like we learn about addition and
multiplication kind of mathematical
skill we learn about how to solve the
equation and we learn about that one's
mathematical skill like integration and
differentiation of a complex function
for learning all those kind of skill we
put explicit very hard efforts same way
we program the traditional computer for
traditional computing we need to program
all those kind of skill in a computer
but still from the computer point of
view there is no learning happens it's
all hard coded rule given by the program
to the computer to do very specific
mathematical and logical tasks but then
there is another kind of skill which we
acquire unconsciously let's take example
of a cat we have seen a lot of get in
our childhood but there is no single cat
which is exactly similar as another
example we learn by seeing hundreds of
thousands of different cat photos nobody
taught us how to recognize cat we learn
those skills to recognize cat by saying
thousands of different example nobody
taught us what is the color of the cat
what is the possible height of the cat
there is no hard coded rule fitted in
our brain about the description of a cat
at the time v born but unconsciously we
acquire those kind of skill and that is
what learning by example and that is
what means the fundamental idea behind a
machine learning unfortunately the
traditional computer programming are not
made for this kind of purpose it can
only perform those tasks which are hard
coded by computer programming to do very
specific task but machine learning is a
field where we cue computer the
thousands of different example of a cat
and computer will come up with the model
of the cat and with the help of model
eventually new cat photo will be
recognized whether particular photo
contains a cat or not so machine
learning in one sentence is the learning
by example not defined by any hard coded
rule and that is what we are trying to
put this learning by example skills into
machine which is the machine learning
strategy currently deep learning one of
the subfield of the machine learning
artificial intelligence and a neural
network has made a remarkable progress
to apply this machine learning strategy
into computer so that's it for this
lecture in a future lecture we will see
about more machine learning and a deep
learning strategy we'll see about more
different
in learning algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
