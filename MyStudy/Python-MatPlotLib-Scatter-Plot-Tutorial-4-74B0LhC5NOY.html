tutorial inside the video lecture series
on data visualization in Python with the
help of Miss matplotlib library so we
will see what we are going to see in
relation number four so in this lesson
we are going to see how to plot the
scatter chart so let's see first of all
what is scatter chart here so let's see
some example standard chart looks like
this so scatter chart is used for
spatially displaying the individual
coordinate into either two dimension or
three dimension space that how your data
is distributed in terms of your spatial
dimension so let's see how we can
generate this scatter plot and then we
will see that how the scatter chart is
very useful for the analyzing of our
machine learning data so scatter chart
let's display some random number
right will generate why also so it is X
dimension another under that is a wide
angle Sun so how many are there 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 will make it 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
8 9 10 ok so we have total are 10 values
for X dimension if I used for the X
dimension so what this scatter plot will
do it will generate
this Cartesian coordinate point 2 comma
3 or 45 comma 6 comma 1 it will take it
and it will display the daughter in a
scatter journey so we are using this
scatter function in this case of
matplotlib library so this is our
earlier example let's close it let's run
this ok so it has generated total tan
values so you can see that there are
some of the values around 2 comma 3 yen
which are very near and too much we have
just generated a 10 data point so
instead of 10 data points generate some
random so we will get a more idea about
how it is being generated so I'll
quickly do and P dot load our numerical
Python library functionality I will use
it
generate fire so let's close it and
let's when we cut some error
okay floor has some typos normally I do
this typo
okay yeah so it's correctly visible as
we have used this uniform distributed
function so it has uniformly distributed
all those data it doesn't look like much
a random data but you can see that what
are the based on in their Cartesian
coordinate of X comma Y pair it has put
the dot at every location so this way
this scatter plot works how it is
related to specially our machine
learning the system so if you consider
this machine learning system you have a
lot of data along the your x-axis and
your target value at a y-axis so you
want to classify that how many are
forming some kind of group in this area
or somewhere this area
especially for your classification kind
of problem in case of a regression also
you can see that how your data is moving
in two different direction based on
increasing or decreasing values of your
horizontal axis so this way scatter plot
will be very helpful so that's it for
now this this lecture I hope you enjoy
listening this video in a subsequent
lecture we will see about another kind
of plots like stack plotter by God
