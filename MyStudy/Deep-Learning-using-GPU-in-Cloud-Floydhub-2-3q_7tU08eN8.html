leverage the cloud GPU in a Floyd Hub
environment we will start with a very
simple hello world program and we will
try to run in a Floyd Hub online GPU
environment so for that we just need to
first sign up or login I have already
logged in so I have already sign up so
I'll just log in into my account
okay so Floyd hub will provide you to
create number of projects and you can
put the number of data set there is a by
default one em'ly's data sets are
available on a Floyd environment and one
project I have already created so we
will work on this project and they have
provided a very good documentation also
so we'll go to the documentation and we
will work on this documentation there is
a good QuickStart setup guide also
available so there is a two way you can
run the code you can manually run this
code on your roll local machine as a dot
python file dot py file and you can run
it into Jupiter not book ultimately all
this code will run on a Floyd Hub online
cloud GPU environment only so first they
are they saying that you need to have a
fluid hub account then you need to
install this Floyd hub CLI fluid up CLI
is nothing but from the command line
suppose you want to interact with the
Floyd hub online cloud GPU from your
local machine you just install this
Floyd hub Floyd and Floyd - Floyd - CP
CLI okay
so we will just install Floyd - CP CLI
okay so it is successfully installed on
my machine
now next task is to login into Floyd Hub
true Clow Floyd is CLI so we are we just
need to login into Floyd CLI so just
type this Floyd CLI log in so we can
interact directly from the command line
here ok so it will just ask for ok
we just need to go to our online account
and they will just they will provide one
token so tokens are available here so
you just go to the setting and inside
the setting there is no one developer
setting and inside the developer when
whole token are available just copy it
and provide it here while login into
Floyd CLI okay so login is almost
successful so we can start writing all
those code and we can leverage all those
Floyd's CLI command directly from our
command line okay so the vo created one
account we have successfully logged into
Floyd her system and we have provided
through the token system now the next
task is they have already provided one
quick starter guide code that code is
nothing but the image recognition or a
digit recognition called honor M nice
data set and they have completely
implemented all those score inside the
chaos library and our tensorflow as our
back-end I guess so I'll just get cloned
that whole code on my local machine
okay so successfully get cloned it okay
so they are provided the total to file
one is the amnesty I'll just make it
clear and you will get to see it very
clearly M nits CNN dot P Y so let's just
open and see okay so you can see they
have used this tensorflow and they are
reading this amnesty atta set afterwards
they implemented this a convolution
neural network that convolution layer
plus pooling layer and will correlate
they are implemented for the digit
recognition so we are not going to get
into much more detail into how that code
has been settle I will provide another
tutorial to understand this code because
as far as this tutorial is concerned our
focus is to get run this hello world
very simple program into droid hand pen
environment cloud GPU so let's see how
how we can run into Freud of environment
so we have already code we have
successfully logged in into our machine
Floyd hub CLI now we just need to
initialize this as a project so Freud in
it QuickStart willness okay so we have
successfully initialized this project as
a QuickStart
so now Floyd environment will consider
this our code as a one of the fluorite
project now next task is to run this
code into cloud environment so we can
see that there is a command they have
given like a flow I'd run and then we
need to provide it where we want to run
this code either on a CPU or GPU now
after that which environment we will
need to run as a tensorflow backing or a
Theon awakened or any other back-end
software and then we need to provide
just the script that which particular
script we want to run so I'll just copy
paste this whole command and I'll just
ran it
okay so we have successfully supplied
this code and they all just started the
cloud running code had started running
into a cloud so we can see these logs
from here so they are provided one code
so you can see we can start reading
these logs here or from the ok task
instant this error the resource you are
looking was not found okay but still you
can see this six from here okay see
whatever the code we have are supplied
to get it run into cloud environment it
is still running into our cloud
environment so with this command Floyd
run the same command which we have run
Floyd run environment tensorflow
and a GPU leverages we are going to use
it and the script which we want to run
is nothing but the Python Emily CNN dot
P why okay so it has started running
still it's a code is still running just
refresh it so you'll get to know about
it whether it's still running or not so
without putting any of your credit card
or any single or dollar at least you can
start running your code in a floyd help
online GPU or environment very much fast
once it runs here it will tell us
whether it's successful or any failure
message or it will source I guess it
should it should complete by the time ok
still it's running chilly so that's way
you can leverage this online GPU cloud
provider power because the setting up
this GPU environment in your local
machine is very much costly and very
much difficult also but if you want to
get it start very fast and want to do
prototyping very fast you can use this
provide hub environment very fast so
that's all about this frame this is
lecture friends
I hope you enjoy listening this video
and if you want me to create them
another or more videos regarding to this
online GPU cloud provider for other
providers like a Google or even Amazon
Microsoft Azure please write in to
comment I will try my best to create
those video ok it lasts thank you guys
for watching see into next lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
