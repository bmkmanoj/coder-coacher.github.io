lecture series on a machine learning
interview question and answer so in this
tutorial we are going to see one very
important testing question your
knowledge testing about the machine
learning fundamental that how much you
have actually grabs the machine learning
fundamental concept so the question is
there are five different problems has
been given and we need to decide whether
this particular problem is a machine
learning problem or not so how we can
find out that whether particular
situation or particular task particular
problem we can solve with the machine
learning algorithm or we can solve it
with the traditional way so I have
listed a couple of condition to test
whether particular problem can be solved
with machine learning problem or it's a
simple way we can straight away write
the logic in our traditional programming
language and we can solve it it is
something like there exists some kind of
pattern in your problem output you
cannot solve it with the maths equations
so there is a pattern exist but it is
difficult for you to extract this
pattern and put it into mathematical
form so there is a pattern but you can't
decode those pattern so you want machine
learning algorithm to decode those
patterns that's why you are using
machine learning algorithm and you have
a lots of data to extract those kind of
pattern so these are the some of the key
ingredients to test whether particular
problem can be solved with machine
learning algorithm or not so let's see I
have list it's almost by problem and we
will test for each and every particular
problem whether it's success in all
those testing scenario or not
so first problem is we want to find
whether number is odd or even so it
looks like a very simple k12 level
problem and we already know about the
logic behind whether particular how to
determine whether particular number is
odd or not and we know about the
mathematics behind it that suppose
number if we divide by 2
and if remainder is one it is classified
as a odd or otherwise it's classified
even so there is a pattern but we
already can't decode it or we can write
it into mathematical equations we do not
need lot of data we already know about
the rule so this is definitely a not a
machine learning problem but indeed this
case machine has not understood anything
what is odd and even but suppose we want
to make this problem as a machine
learning problem till now this is not a
machine learning problem but if we want
to make this kind of problem also as a
machine learning problem we can do one
thing that we can fit lot of data like a
lot of number and individual number we
will tell machine that this is or this
is either even this is odd this is even
and machine will automatically come up
with the rule like what we have already
hard-coded in our programming language
that whether particular particular
number divided by 2 has a reminder 1 it
is odd then it will be classified as an
ml problem or a machine learning problem
but till now it is not because it's a
very simple and straightforward problem
we already know about the mathematics
behind it so we can easily code into any
traditional programming language system
so that is not a machine learning
problem but we can make it into machine
learning programming now let's take a
second one let's say you have a lot of
photos or whatever image and we need to
find whether particular photo or image
contains of human face or not it's a
human face basically it's a human face
or not I'll just correct it human face
or not so there is a pattern there is
definitely a pattern across a human face
because every human race has a one lip
one mouth two eyes two years and one
cheek kind of thing so there is a
pattern
but can you decoder or can you write
those kind of thing with mathematics or
any kind of horrendous any complicated
even mathematics formula so it's very
difficult
to write any mathematic formula to
detect whether particular photo contains
a face or not so but we have a lot of
data but we have a lot of images as a
training data but a particular photo is
it has a face this photo doesn't have a
face this desire the photo has a face
and these are the photo do not have a
face so we can directly feed it into
machine learning algorithm there is a
pattern in it and it will come up with
those mathematics and it will decode
machine learning algorithm will decode
those mathematics for us because we
cannot write those mathematics equation
to detect by the particular photo
condense a human face or not so this is
definitely a machine learning problem we
can fit a lot of data and machine will
automatically come up with the rule and
that rule is nothing but to detect
whether particular photo contains human
face or not let's take a third one we
will win the next president election now
this is like a futuristic event but and
there must be a some pattern exist
pattern in the sense that suppose some
political party has done a very good job
in last 5 years or 10 years people trust
more more on that some of the political
party might not have done very well but
they are very much popular in particular
area but it is difficult to hold it into
mathematical form and eventually come up
with a formula which will eventually
tell that this candidate will win or not
this candidate will win or not so it is
very difficult to write into
mathematical formula but we have all the
past history of that particular country
all president candidate past history so
we can feed it those data directly to
the machine learning algorithm and it
will come up with those rules in a
different mathematics form for us and
eventually it will predict for us that
we will win the next predict president
election so there is a pattern but you
cannot write in no mathematics and you
want machine learning algorithm to
does mathematics equation for you so
that's why this is definitely a machine
learning problem let's take a third one
so traveling salesmen this is one of the
very famous problem so what is Traveling
Salesman problem is that you have a
suppose one salesmen and there are n
number of cities are available where
this particular salesman has to travel
at least once any it has again reached
back to its home position from initial
position or from where it has started
his journey but he has to reach every
single city let's say there is an N city
every single city in a minimal cost with
a minimal cost so it doesn't mean that
he can travel same city twice because
that will increase the traveling cost so
traveling cost should be minimum and he
has to ourselves man has to go through
every single city at least once and
reach back to its original first setting
so it looks like that this like
optimization problem so you can go you
can model this problem like a graph
based structure and you can use a
breadth-first search and depth-first
search kind of functionality but
definitely you can code it with the
definite mathematical formula and you
can keep iterating those mathematical
formula to eventually come up with a
very optimal solution for that
particular salesman because in that case
you don't have a data you have a
straightforward
the problem is available you have a
total n city this is the starting city
and let's start travelling and every
single between every two single city
there is a cost associated with it so it
is definitely a travel a traveling
salesman problem is a not a machine
learning problem you can code it this
kind of problem with the simple
traditional video programming and you
can write the mathematics for it in a
much much more better way there is a
good mathematics already
develop for it so this is not a machine
learning problem let's take a last one
recognition of speech so you might be
using in our daily life from last at
least a couple of years and it gets very
much used to for us there are nowadays
Android speech recognition or Apple Siri
speech recognition so every so task is
here actually whenever we speak
something in front of our cell phone it
should identify that particular
character and it should map it to the
particular English character or any
other language character so there is a
pattern there is a pattern for it that
if some person speaks let's say Hospital
so hospital every time it will speak
this hospital in a same manner or there
is of some particular frequency of words
associated with particular of a voice or
a consonant so there is a pattern in it
but to decode or to map those individual
speech or individual characters or
literal speech to that particular tax
based character can we write the
mathematical formula so that will be a
horrendously complicated entities almost
impossible to write for us but we have a
lot of training data available for
individual speech like a speech data and
it will map to that particular text so
we can read it those machine learning
training data to the machine learning
algorithm and it will come up with those
mathematics and eventually it will
predict what is the speech has been
spoken by a particular person so this is
definitely a machine learning problem
because you cannot write anything with
the mathematics equation so you want
machine learning to come up with those
mathematics equation for you so this is
the some of the primary taste and check
your fundamentals behind whether you are
actually understood the machine learning
concept or not so that's it for this
