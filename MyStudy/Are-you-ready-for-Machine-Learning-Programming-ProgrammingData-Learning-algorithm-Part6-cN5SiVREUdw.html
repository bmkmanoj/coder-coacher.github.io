tutorial into the video lecture series
on machine learning so till now we have
seen that what are the theoretical
aspects of machine learning what is
machine learning and how different type
of machine learning systems are there
how in general made a machine learning
system works so from now onwards we are
going to dive into the programming
aspects of machine learning so that's
why I have kept name of prepare yourself
for the machine learning programming so
why I have kept that thing because
before you dive into machine learning
programming you need to know that there
are minimum bare things before starting
any machine learning programming so
we'll see about what are the things you
should know before starting any machine
learning programming before you first
write your machine learning algorithm or
you use it from the ready-made library
available okay so what are the these are
the three things what which we require
for the machine learning programming
first one is the the little programming
prerequisites are there we will see one
by one you need the data and you need
learning algorithm so if you are being
prepared for all three of these things
you are ready to go ahead for the
machine learning programming so let's
see one by one what are the programming
prerequisite you required or even now
what other data source you require and
what are the learning algorithms you
need to know before starting machine
learning coding ok so this is the
programming prerequisite so for
programming we are going to program
inside the Python so this is just
further reference I have written that
the conditional function statement or a
looping statement list dictionary a
basic Python level data structure is a
sufficient to get started with the
Python programming
okay so there are we are going to use
the Python there are other languages
also like our Java and everyone so so
you can use those thing also but in this
video lecture series we are going to
stick with the Python along the pilot
there is a word package of numpy that is
a numerical Python library so this
library you should have a understanding
of how you can do the manipulation on
the nemetrix or linear algebra level
data manipulation so this library you
will do it there is one very famous
among the data science people that is a
pandas so panda is for the data science
this is helpful for the data
manipulation data wrangling a very
initial level data of watching data
merger or data joiner kind of library so
this is famous among the pandas data
science people matrix plot library so
this libraries for especially for the
plotting purpose so if you have our data
you want to visualize your model or you
want to visualize your data at how
classification is there what type of
data associated with what kind of class
so you have to visualize it so that's
where this matrix plot library will be
helpful so these are the programming
side some of the prerequisite and last
one is the science kit line so this is
the actual machine learning library
where lot of machine learning algorithm
like the regression or logistic
regression linear regression even
unsupervised classification algorithm
like hierarchical clustering or
nearest neighbor clustering some of the
neural networks algorithm this is entry
algorithm so these are all machine
learning labor library so these are all
implemented inside this library and this
is one of the very famous among the
machine learning community so these are
all minimum bear prerequisite from the
programming perspective you should know
before starting machine learning coding
so from next time from the next video
lecture onward
I'm going to prepare at least a fun one
video with respect to all of this Python
packages from the machine learning point
of view then we will dive into the
machine learning coding the next one is
is the data source so you know
programming now you'd acquire a data how
will you get the data so there is a very
famous iris database that is a one of
the flower related database one is the
Boston house database diabetes-related
database why I've written this first the
first three already included as a part
of your science kit library so we'll see
all of data one by one will import with
the help of programming and we will see
how that individual data's are
structured what are the feature
associated with that what kind of labels
are there and now what kind of data
purpose is for a regulation and or for
the classification they are being used
there is a very famous neural network
data so is the m-mister
so that is a handwriting characters has
been generated with the word machine
learning community and people are
telling like hello world of the neural
network this thing there is a very
famous image net it has already 1.4
million
one point four or one point two million
maybe the figures may be long but images
are they're all image has been are
tagged by some of the most famous
thousand around classes so these this
first three database is very tight
database even this one is also so this
all database will see into the future
video or one by one and each of the data
says datasource we will download it and
we will install it into our in put it
into our local repository for the
further classification or figuration
kind of algorithm so before diving into
the machine learning programming we
should have a database so from in the
future lecture we'll take individual
data source one by one and we'll see how
to import each and every database
database so these are all kind of toy
database people from the academic
community or researcher they are using
those database but apart from that there
are a lot of other public repository
which is a very high volume of data so
once you become a little expert or even
a master level into the machine learning
you can use those later is like a Amazon
Google even Microsoft has their public
repository of database like lot of
images related to particular class or
even of web clicks data so these are all
are very expert levels so I am just
talking about the very this is also very
big one actually so we are not going to
use it it has already 1.4 million around
images so we are going to deal with the
bit these are all tiny database these
are like a very tiny toy data data set
into machine learning but that will cue
the build up the foundation for us for
the future of future in machine learning
programming so these are all for the
data says now you know programming
prerequisite you have a data set now
let's see what are the third
and most essential things are
requirement this is the learning
algorithm so there is a huge amount of
learning algorithm but each and every
learning algorithm has its own pros and
cons the samel a learning algorithm
works on some kind of data and some
learning algorithm will work on some
other kind of data so it has a we have a
linear regression logistic regression we
have a neural network deep learning is
very much right now it highlighted more
deep learning because it has solved a
lot of problem it is going beyond the
state of our technology support vector
machine this is entry even a key nearest
neighbor algorithm so each and every
algorithm has its own pros and cons and
it is used for the different different
purpose so in a subsequent lecture we
will see individual algorithm and for
each and every algorithm will import a
specific set of data and will supply
those specific set of data the
particular algorithm all mostly all of
them all all of the algorithm has been
implemented into scikit-learn liability
for the specific algorithm will use some
different library so in a subsequent
lecture when we come across I will
inform you to install that one also deep
learning right now getting very famous
and it has been implemented by the
Google's one of the most famous open
source library tensorflow or the Tiano
library so that's all for this lecture
we have now the data we know python
politico's you can we have a learning
algorithm so it's time to start about
the coding but these are all just the
prerequisite what I have told you in a
future video I am going to make a video
lecture on individual topics of it and
then we can dive into machine learning
programming so that's it for this
lecture and
hope you enjoyed this video guys please
