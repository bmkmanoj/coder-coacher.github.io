lecture series on machine learning
so from this tutorial onwards we are
going to learn about one new family of
algorithm unsupervised way of learning
algorithm k-means clustering so let's
start our journey of the k-means
clustering we have already seen the K
nearest neighbor classification
algorithm from this lecture onwards we
are going to see another unsupervised
learning algorithm gamings so what is
k-means learning algorithm in a machine
learning so this is one of the very
simplest unsupervised learning algorithm
it is mainly used for the very famous
clustering problem available as it is an
unsupervised learning algorithm so there
is no particular training is required
you can straight away throw the data on
to the k-means clustering algorithm and
you will get the grouping of those data
what this k-means algorithm will do it
will group the data into number of
cluster which we have you provide
now what is key and what is mean is
equal to K is nothing but the number of
cluster you will provide to that k-means
clustering algorithm and means means
nothing but it's averaging of data so
this K means clustering algorithm works
on averaging of data and keep sifting
the averaging or the mean value of the
or the centroid of the data that's how
it works now let's define the actual
problem statement of the k-means
clustering algorithm now let us look at
this very simplistic two dimensional
data hypothetically I have created so it
is a two dimensional data so it has
individual data has every finger to
feature one is in a horizontal axis
direction one is in a vertical axis
direction I purposely created this data
which forms of one cluster in this
region in one cluster in to this region
but at a priori knowledge we don't have
any kind of knowledge that particular
data set or particular data point among
the all data set belongs to particular
cluster or not so for us at this moment
all data point belongs to nowhere so
that's why I have given just the single
color to each and every point now what
is the actual problem statement of
clustering and how we can solve it with
the help of k-means clustering algorithm
so our task is to group this data set
into two different cluster now this to
you can define any number of cluster
also based on your requirement or in
Prior based on your problem definition
you know in a future lecture we will see
about what are the different heuristic
to define this number of cluster but as
we have seen from the data there are
mostly two clusters is possible this
part is forming one cluster where the
values are somewhat lower in a
horizontal axis direction also in a in a
vertical axis directions
but in this cluster both the value
horizontal and vertical axis values are
little more higher compared to the
cluster one so let's call it as a
cluster 1 and let's call it as a cluster
2 for simplicity so this is the problem
statement now how we can throw this data
to the k-means clustering algorithm
which forms automatically grouping of
this dataset into one cluster and this
dataset into a second cluster we can
form even multiple cluster also as this
is in a two dimensional case we can
easily visualize but as we go into
higher dimension it's almost impossible
to visualize in that case you can use
lot of different heuristic based on your
problem definition or problem
requirement also you can define this
number of cluster but as far as the
k-means clustering algorithm is
concerned we have to provide this number
to a at a prior to the algorithm now
let's see what are the step associated
with the k-means clustering algorithm so
let's see what other first step so first
step is select k is equal to 2 in this
case we have taken any two arbitrary
point in a two dimensional space as a
centroid of our cluster so I have taken
arbitrary one this as a centroid and one
this as a centroid but still we haven't
touch any kind of data we have just
selected arbitrary two points if we have
selected before if you want to group the
data into suppose Phi cluster we have to
select the five different centroid five
different arbitrary point and it will be
selected as a centroid of the individual
cluster now selection of this point also
has a lot of different heuristic
associated with that in a future lecture
we will see about what are the advantage
and disadvantage of selecting this
particular initial centroid
in this case I have selected just
randomly to point in a two dimensional
space now let's see what further action
we can take in a step two so now we have
already got the two points which is
nothing but the centroid or
representative of individual cluster now
what the step two is telling assign each
individual point to the nearest centroid
so what will happen that we keep
calculating the distance of individual
to point with respect to the centroid
arbitrary we have selected and then we
will assign individual point to
particular centroid so it may happen
that half of the points or a 60% or a
30% of point will lie in to cluster one
based on the RB to three point we have
selected and remaining all points will
belongs to cluster two after that we'll
update the centroid because we have
grouped a new kind of cluster so our
green points and the red points will be
updated based on the nearest point so
earlier it was here the Green Point and
a red point is here now it is moving a
little bit closer to the particular
cluster now this is all iterative
algorithm so let's try to iterate it one
more time so in a step three what we'll
do
again we will assign each point to the
nearest centroid but in this case our
centroid has been updated and again once
we update this centroid point
we'll again update the individual
representative of individual cluster now
this process will keep our going until
we do data do not chain inside the
cluster so what will happen that at the
last will form or will get some point
which is nothing but the representative
of the group of the point which are
nearer in space and there is another
point will get which is near into
another space so this is called as a
cluster one and this is called as a
cluster two now this is as it is all
iterative algorithm it is written that
data do not change in a cluster so till
the data do not swap between the cluster
1 and cluster 2 cluster 2 and cluster 1
you keep running this algorithm the
moment you feel that this data is not
swapping between the cluster it is
almost double eyes you can almost
finalize that this is nothing but the
representative of my cluster 1 this is
the one of the representative of my
cluster 2 in this week will keep
shifting the centroid and ultimately it
will stabilize till the data has not
been swapped between the cluster so this
green point what we get after a certain
or couple of iteration or even 100
iteration or a fifty iteration this is
the representative of this data set so
this all data set forms the one cluster
because VD are nearer in a Euclidean
space with respect to each other and
this forms the another cluster too and
this red point is nothing but the
representative of this two at the final
we had earlier had all the points which
is a green because we didn't know that
individual point is associated with any
kind of class because it's the
unsupervised learning
but as a final reason we have got that
these forms of data belongs to cluster 1
that's why I have given one color green
and that this forms of data belongs to
another cluster that's why I have given
another color red so this way the
k-means algorithm is working and it is
dividing the whole dataset into number
of cluster which we are given inside
here is a prior knowledge to the k-means
learning algorithm so that's it for this
lecture friend in this lecture we have
seen about how this gaming's algorithm
iteratively works in a future lecture
we'll see about how we'll implement with
some random data set or some standard
data set in with the help of
scikit-learn library so I hope you enjoy
