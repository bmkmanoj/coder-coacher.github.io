tutorial inside the video lecture series
on machine learning so in this tutorial
we are going to see about how you can
find
descriptive statistics on machine
learning data set with the help of very
just few lines of course inside the
Python so for that we are going to use
about a path I unders library inside
this Python so let's start so in this
tutorial we are going to use about this
data set of adèle dot data I have taken
this data from this UCI machine learning
library so let's see about how that data
looks like so dot names so this data is
about information about adult people
whose age work class or even education
marital status Sachs capital gain house
hours per week the work actually the
race is the relationship and the native
come country in which day belongs so
this kind of feature has been given and
was done all those feature they have
given in the last class which is whether
their income is greater than $50,000 or
not that is what the class is so let's
try to import it and let's better
visualize it so for each of these
individual features what I did actually
I have created small array inside this
Python and the last element of this
index I have capped at his class which
the which nothing but it shows that
whether individual person has income
greater than $50,000 or not so let's try
to import this data
so we are going to use the pandas
library so let's import the find us
first so this is basically the CSV file
so we are going to use DF is equal to PD
dot grade CSC and we will supply this a
del dot data and we need to provide the
header name also so for that I have
already created this array for the
header okay so what we did actually we
are reading this CSV file from this
remote location and we are supplying
name is equal to index okay let's read
there is a typo here okay so it started
reading this symbol signifies that the
machine is busy the kernel is still
running so it is downloading that data
this data is very not very big but it's
around three to four Emmy so it takes
little time to download so let's proceed
ahead first as is let's visualize let's
see display the couple of data before it
got download so we'll use the head
functionality and it will display the
first firing okay it has done so this
part is complete let's display it
okay so it has displayed the first
pirate code from this data frame object
so it is aged work class education
marital status occupation occupation can
be managerial or cleaners or space
professor speciality relationship not in
a family or is in a husband or is a wife
race will be like a white or a black
where the sex will be male-female
capital gain hours per week its native
country so this is all data we have seen
how we can read the data
now how this panda's library descriptive
statistics related functionality we can
use to gain the information about this
data in a very minimal amount of poor
and minimal amount of time so let's see
what is the dimension of this data how
we can get it so we have this data frame
framework it has a safe attribute
associated with that so it has shown as
the thirty two thousand five hundred and
sixty one is nothing but the total
number of Records total number of
people's data is available and a fifteen
is nothing but the total features so
this is all total fifteen features are
available so immediately with just this
one attribute record that we had in our
dataset
toric there are total thirty two
thousand five hundred and sixty-one
records for them
now suppose we want to know about the
attribute each attributes datatype so
whether some data type is looks like a
string or some data types looks like a
integer some are might be either
floating value so let's see how that is
so for on da field applied D types okay
so it has given us like ages stored
inside this 64-bit integer work class is
nothing but the object so that is a very
complex object inside the Python that
will be nothing but as a string
education is the object and education
number is a 64-bit integer capital gain
is 64-bit integer so in this way all
attribute features data type immediately
we can see now why that is important
because while designing our machine
learning system you can give importance
to some of the feature and you can
discard some of the feature so like you
can see that this is the education
number so which sometimes doesn't make
sense that it has any relation with your
total income will be greater than
$50,000 or not so you can discard this
kind of feature based on by seeing the
attribute so this way we can get lot of
idea about individual features data type
now let's see use descriptive statistics
so for the descriptive statistics with a
very short function described is there
inside this pandas library so what it
will do actually for each of the feature
which is having all numerical value it
just immediately calculate these are the
values for us so for age this have
fennel weight education number capital
gain capital loss and hours per week
this
the feature which is a numerical value
so this function will be applied on the
numerical features on so for all of this
feature it just immediately calculates
how many total counts are there so there
is the thirty-two thousand five hundred
sixty-one that is nothing but the total
records we have thirty-two thousand five
hundred and sixty-one
so all those record has an age at least
what is the mean value of age what is
the standard deviation of it what is the
minimum of age
what is the 25 percentile of the same so
top 25 percent of people age lies in
which range what is the maximum value of
this age so in this way for all of the
feature which is the numerical this
described function will immediately give
us this many number of functionality
immediately so that we can come to know
about that individual feature has a
different different range its maximum
value and minimum value the range will
be different where their mean value that
is also a different so total number of
records almost all feature has these
many features so there is no record
which is having any non value so if any
of this feature has a lace valued and
lesser than this 30 2561
count then we can surely tell that there
are some of the missing records so this
way you can predict that the how your
data is because this thirty two thousand
five and sixty one manually you can't go
one by one record but with such a small
functional function you can come to know
about that how your data is actually
from the descriptive ring now class
distribution what does the class
distribution mean suppose we want to see
that
all those how many people's which is
having a income greater than $50,000 and
how many people have a income which is
less than $50,000 so the very last
column if we see which is signifying
that individual the adult has income
will be related less than $50,000 or
greater then there are just fire accords
we have shown so all fire causes are
less than $50,000 so let's try to find
how many people has greater than 50,000
how many people has less than $50,000 so
there is a one group by functionality is
there so we will apply those group by on
the top of this class attribute so
attribute is nothing but in this class
so we have grouped data based on the
class feature and we will apply the size
on the top of it so it will tell us that
total twenty four thousand seven hundred
and twenty people which is having an
income less than $50,000 and seven
hundred and seven thousand eight hundred
forty one people has a income greater
than $50,000 so it just immediately tell
us how many peoples are lying into one
class of group and how many people lives
in a second class of group because based
on that if we can apply some machine
learning algorithm what kind of
technique we need to apply on the top of
it now let's see what is the correlation
between the attribute so it may happen
that there are some of the attribute
which is highly relevant to which each
other there are some of the attribute
which is not at all relevant to each
other so let's see how we can find with
finders function so dot there is a one
matter
and you can apply which way you want to
calculate this so that Pearson
coefficient way we'll calculate the
correlation between the individual
attribute okay so for all of the numeric
data
it has sonís the correlation between
individual attributes so you can take
any one of them like age and a capital
gain so it has a strong positive
correlation actually but if you consider
this capital gain with the capital loss
there is a negative correlation so based
on the positive or negative correlation
you can decide that how much one feature
is dependent on our other feature and
how much one feature is independent of
another feature so this kind of
information will be are very helpful
while designing your machine learning
system how much weight you need to give
to individual data how much how many
maybe attribute you need to discard it
or the head may happen that some of the
attributes are just completely obsolete
because that is a nothing but the part
of another attribute so it doesn't make
sense to you and include it whether we
can exclude or we can drop some of the
columns so we can come to know about
them we can see even a skewness of
individual feature so there is a skew
function is there so it has shown is
there for age actually education number
capital K in capital laws for all of the
things it has shown us the skewness of
individual features that how much
skewness is there for individual feature
and all value it has been given in
64-bit floating value so that's it for
this lecture friends so in this lecture
we have seen about them how with just a
couple of few commands in the pandas
library we can find all those statistics
related information about your data for
taking your further decision
inside the machine learning system
design so that's it for this lecture I
have already created finders video
lecture series the description in the
description I have given the link you
can check it out for that because as we
are going to start about the machine
learning tutorial machine learning
coding actually inside this sky katelyn
library so before that I thought that
let's try to go with the how we can
analyze the data very easily in a very
fast manner so that's it for this
lecture friends I hope you enjoy
