we might have maintained a phone
directory which contains name to number
mapping so whenever we wanted to know
animal phone number this rate awayfind
their name and we will get their number
but as the time passed we shifted our
number directly to our phone our cell
phone or our Google online contact
account but in case of Internet do you
have any idea about when we type
youtube.com for a facebook.com in our
browser how browser knows which IP
address our server to connect and
download the requested page or a video
contains for that internet maintain such
a big huge directly which Maps
individual domain name to the I presence
which is nothing but the DNS the domain
name system the first time when you type
of facebook com it connects to the name
server which is maintained by your
internet service provider and retrieve
the IP address of a Facebook comment
send the request directly to that
particular IP so when the next time you
type or facebook.com in your browser
your browser knows already about the
ipad is because it has already catch
those IPS in the first request and it
will hit the request directly with that
particular IP sometimes your isp block
some of your website so when you request
those block websites your IP address
will retain a page like page not found
in such a case you can use opendns
system like a google dns the number of
dns server are situated across the whole
internet there are two problem
associated with such a dns caching
system let's say IP address of a
facebook com chain but your browser has
already catch the previous IPS so it
will keep hitting that particular IP
address and you won't find the page of
facebook com let's say your machine has
been attacked by some marvel and it
changed the IP address of a domain in
your local system then also your browser
will keep hitting the wrong I pattern
and you won't find this page so in both
the cases you need to plus all those
data from your local system and it we
again go to the DNS
and retire the first IP address of the
requested domain that's it for the
domain name system please hit the like
button and comment your views on a DNS
please share with your friends and
subscribe my channel for the more video
at last thank you guys for the watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
