lecture series on a computer science and
programming or engineering related
concern so in this tutorial we are going
to see about the strong typing and a
weak typing programming language
uncertain so let's try to understand
with one example first of all this
concept is related to data type
conversion so mostly often most of the
time we as a programmer we need to use
integer to string conversion or string
to integer converter or one kind of
other data type or even a more complex
data type to another complex data type
conversion might be required so let's
try to understand the different
programming language like a strong type
programming language and weak type of
programming language how they handle at
a compile time or execution time this
situation and what are the advantage and
disadvantage as a programmer will get so
let's concentrate on a two function one
is the add and one is the concatenate
function first one is the add function
add is not very simple we are passing
the two argument and in concurrent also
we are passing the two argument and in
the both of the argument we are passing
the same data type in a first one we are
passing the simple two numbers or
integer in a second case we are passing
the to string so data there is no data
type mismatch so first one must produce
the result like a 12 in any programming
language and once you concatenate two
different string because it won't read
fires a number and 7 is a number both
are the string so it will just
concatenate and obtain the second string
after the first thing so this is a very
simple function - now let's see how that
concept of strong programming language
and a weak type programming language is
related to this example suppose instead
of supplying the same data type like a
number and number or integer and integer
if we supply integer and string or
string and integer and here also in a
second case of concatenation function
rather than supplying both the similar
data type like a string if we supply 1
is integer and 1 string or another is
and one string one then how different
programming language built reacts so
then let's start the difference with
this same example and we'll applied on
strong programming language and the big
type in suppose in a strong typing we
supply Phi as an integer but seven is a
string and in a concatenation function
will supply fire string as is well but
seven we want supply as a string between
supply as an integer then how does
strong programming language will react
so it will immediately throw error
because this is a data type mismatch for
a strong typing kind of language so what
programming language will tell the
strong kind of programming language tell
you explicitly do this data type
conversion so either you do one thing
you convert this seven into integer and
supply again to this add function and I
will calculate 5 plus 7 is equal to 12
for you and the same way here you supply
7 as an integer rather than that you
just convert the 7 into string and
supply to the concatenate function the
to string 1 is the first thing and 1 is
the same thing and I will produce the 7
for you that will be happen with this
conversion of to integer and convert to
string kind of functionality so in a
strong kind of programming language as a
programmer we explicitly need to convert
the required data type from one type to
the another otherwise the compiler
immediately throws the error now let's
see how this week type in programming
language will handle those things
suppose the same function the same
function bo given input to this strong
kind of programming language same will
write on a weak type of programming
language so salmon here is not an
integer it's such training add function
and here 7 is the integer rather than
its it is a string so it will not throw
error and it will work perfectly fine so
there is a one mechanism in a weak
typing language it's implicit data
conversion that will be done by the
compiler so
what will happen that this seven is
implicitly converted without inheriting
Lee informed to the programmer it will
convert this seven as a string to the
seven as integer and this seven as an
integer to the seven as a string and it
will produce the desired result but
there is a sum of the disadvantage as
this is a very simple example even if
the compiler takes the decision on
behalf of any programmer or a developer
it will be okay but once you go to the
very complex kind of data type or even
unknown kind of data type which you
don't know and suppose somehow compiler
inherently or implicitly it does those
conversion then it may produce undesired
result or programmer me even it takes
too much amount of time to develop for
the programmer so that's why this strong
kind of programming language it will be
beneficial that whatever we do be
explicitly as a programmer supply and
we'll convert those data type to the
desired datatype so that is the all
difference between the strong and weak
typing programming language which is
related to the data type conversion
explicitly by the programmer or one is
in a weak type of programming language
that is implicit by the compiler so
that's it for this lecture friends I
