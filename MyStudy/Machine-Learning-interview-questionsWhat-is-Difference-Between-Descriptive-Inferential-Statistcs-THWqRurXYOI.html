one important question and a basic
differences between the descriptive
statistics and inferential statistic so
what is descriptive statistics and
inferential statistics will try to see
individual so name itself suggests that
descriptive statuses is nothing but it
just try to describe the data and
inferential statistics means it is
trying to infer the data informants it
is trying to predict the data what will
be the most probable next outcome of the
data so it is trying to infer data
predict data in a layman term it's
trying to predict data so what does this
description of the data means and what
does it mean to predict the data so we
can use the number of statistical
analysis technique like a mean median
mode and there are lot of other we
already know about standard deviation
and our variance of the system
quadrilateral and all those things so
these are all the descriptive major
technique measure of the central
tendency which is colonists statistics
whereas analysis of variance regression
are the inferential technique so let's
try to understand with one example let
what exactly the same example will be
applied from the descriptive analysis
point of view and inferential analysis
point of view let's say we have a better
data weather data okay
so this is one example we'll take as a
better data let's say from our for last
at least 10 years data so 10 years has
well almost three hundred three thousand
six hundred and fifty days almost days
data you have for individual city like
New York so New York City last three
thousand six hundred and fifty days
temperature we have like a thousand
Celsius 15 degree Celsius 16 degree and
a 34 degree this way we have a like a
three thousand six hundred and fifty
days of data now suppose we want to
apply the descriptive statistics on the
top of this data what what does it six
descriptive statistics maintain so let's
say we have this kind of data and we
want to describe this data so we can use
this descriptive statistic analysis
technique so we can apply like a mean we
can find a mean so let's say example
mean is like a 25 degree Celsius so 25
is the average temperature of the New
York City in Los almost 10 years you can
find a median you can find a variance
that how much temperature has been
deviated from a mean median value so
that is nothing but you can say like a
description of the data that what your
data is you can try to represent with
some different number with a minimal
amount of information still lot of
information is been preserved you can
even do plotting of this data you can
use the bar chart pie chart
even scatter chart to histogram that how
many of the days the temperature is 24
degree majority of these temperature is
a 12 degree so those kind of analysis
will come into descriptive analysis
technique so you are trying to represent
data with some statistical measuring
technique which is nothing but a mean
median mode standard deviation variance
kind of thing but let's say you have
this ten years of data and you want to
apply this inferential statistical
technique so what does it mean now the
same data you have we want to
inferential so what rate is inferential
statistic analysis technique will be
useful when you have a ten years of
weather data you have a ten years of
data in a descriptive analysis technique
you found that how will you describe
those data but let's say we want to
predict the temperature of the New York
City in 3651 today what is the
temperature immediately after the next
day based on whatever the data available
with you for three thousands or ten
years of data and immediately next day
we want to predict what is the
temperature or what is the weather
condition at the immediate next day so
this way in this kind of prediction
inferential analysis technique will be
helpful so we can use like a lot of
different model like analysis of
variance regression kind of technique
and based on whatever the last ten years
of data available Vitas will build a
model and based on that model we will
make the future prediction that what
will be the possible temperature what
will be the possible future weather
condition in a New York City in next two
days next four days next ten days kind
of thing so descriptive analysis
technique it just try to describe the
data whereas inferential analysis
statistical technique it's just try to
predict the data based on inter past
data so that's it for this lecture
