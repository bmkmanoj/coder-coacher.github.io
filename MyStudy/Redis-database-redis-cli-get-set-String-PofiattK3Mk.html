lecture series honor Reddy's databases
so in the last lecture we have seen how
to install the Redis database from after
compiling the whole source code and we
started successfully the ready server
and a ready splined
so in this tutorial we are going to see
about the very simple Redis command at
how to set a string get a string
how to retrieve a multiple string how we
can implement or decrement particular
keys tell you how you can expire
particular cream and how you can get the
multiple keys values so let's start
about this so we have already
successfully start this a ready server
now suppose we want to shut down this
server shut down so it's automatically
disconnected you cannot run any kind of
command so if you do this ping could not
connect Redis to this particular so in
that case you need to start this server
again okay now again we do the ping and
it has given a spawn that means server
is client is connected to the sermon now
let's start with a very simple basic
command like let's add a very simple key
with certain let's say ki is equal to
hello and value will be void
okay let's set another more value like
count 10 okay so this way we can set the
value this is the key and this is value
this is key and this is value suppose we
want to retrieve this hello okay it has
written as Y let's say we want to
retrieve a key count so get count it is
written as 10 now suppose we want to
retry multiple keys so instead of gate
we can use M Gator so it will return us
multiple values for all given case so
key will be let's say hello and come
okay so for the hello the first one is
boil for the count it is a 10 now the
second one is like an integer or float
so we can apply increment or decrement
counter also so suppose we want to
increment the count by one so I am see
we can use it key will be count okay so
it has written as 11 and after that
suppose we do get count it will return
as 11 so count has been incremented
suppose we do it again okay Bikram
entered to the 12 let's see how
decrement will work same way we can use
decrement okay now get count it has
decremented 12 to 11 so in this way we
can use simple set and get even am great
command incr an decrement commandment
now let's see one more command expire
suppose some key we want that key to be
expired after certain second so let's
say
let's set some key like hello hello is
already been created and we want to get
it expired
so we need to use expired command
actually expire after 22nd
so this hello key will be expired after
22nd
now let's say retry Otis hello
so it has written as while and there is
a one more command TPL will tell us that
how many seconds are left to get this
key acquired time to live only five
second three second now it's a one
second it's - no son already been
expired now if we suppose do get hello
it will return nil because that cook
that key has been expired let's suppose
sad pit again set hello
and let's stack this hello 4/32 so we
can keep watching about this TTL hello
26 second left 24 second left
now in this case intermediately if you
retry this with the help of get this
hello common it will return a server Y
successfully 14 second only left now now
11 second on Leela so after 30 second it
will just expire okay so these are all
some of the basic command like how you
can satyr and get a very simple key
value store here value will be very
simple string so this is all about the
very simple string related manipulation
okay it has given us name in future
lecture we are going to see that instead
of just simple string how we can put a
list hash map or a salt it's at that
kind of complex data structure in a key
value pair kind of storage in a reddy's
data set and we also see that how we can
use this functionality directly from a
thin Python library rather than using
from this command line because suppose
we want to use those functionality in a
Python programming language or any other
high level programming language you need
to use that programming language to
connect to the Redis data set this is
just the giving you small clampers that
how you can connect to read is that
doesn't have you you can store and get
the data so that's it for this lecture
