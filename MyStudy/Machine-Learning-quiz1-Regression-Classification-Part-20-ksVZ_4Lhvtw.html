on machine learning so till now we have
seen about a lot of machine learning
concepts and vo graphs the actual
concept of machine learning the type of
different machine learning system and
everything so as a part of that another
tutorial series I have started when I
tweezed video so in this tutorial we'll
check our knowledge that how much we
have grasped about the machine learning
concept so let's start with the one
first question okay so in this question
it has been given the input and output
so the very first question is you have
been given a credit history of the
individual person so something like the
amount of transaction it's due the time
at which it pays it's a credit card bill
how much amount of point every time he
turns how much shopping it will do so
this way actually input has been given
and there are two problems actually the
first output will be based on watching
the cat credit history of individual
person the output will be will company
provide another credit card or not that
is the first output and you need to
predict that whether this type of
problem lies inside this regression kind
of problem or the classification kind of
problem and the another problem is the
it it has been given the credit history
of individual person and you need to
predict the credit score of that person
as an output so you need to define that
whether this kind of problem is a
regression problem or the classification
problem so pause the video for a second
and just think about it in which
category of the supervised learning this
kind of problem lies and I will give you
answer
okay so I think you how might be figure
it out so let's try to understand it
where this problem lies so if you see
this a first and second question you
know both the questions we helping given
this credit history in the amount of
transaction in our everything the
individual person do but output or this
is the type of problem regression in
classification it depends on the output
the way you provide the output of the
system where you define the output of
the system so very first question if you
see whether we'll provide another credit
card or not so it is kind of binary
decision or company has to take so it is
a output will be a discrete step either
it will provide it or not so it's very
much descriptive so we have seen in our
earlier lecture of a different kind of
machine learning system like a
supervised and supervised it has a
regression and classification kind of
see so we have seen that if the output
is a discrete step or a finite amount of
discrete step in this case it's the
binary just giving credit card or not
giving credit that decision only need to
take so this kind of problem lies inside
this classification problem now let's
see the second one that is a credit
score credit score is nothing but the
continuous value it can lie between 0
200 might be whatever the company has
defined based on their protocol but it
is a continuous value so this kind of
continuous value lies inside this
regression problem so this lies inside
the regression kind of problem the first
one is a classification second one is
the regression problem because the
credit score is a continuous value and
this is whether to land another credit
card or not to the particular version
based on the history of that particular
person's credit history this kind of
problem lies inside the classification
problem so I hope you must have figure
it out if you don't understand anything
I have given in description the video
link where I will provide the
information about the regression and the
class
vacation how they're supervised learning
work so you can go through it and you
can thoroughly understand the meaning of
and what is the difference between
situation in a classification let's try
to grasp the another questions which is
exactly same kind of problem and you
need to figure it out whether this kind
of problem lies inside this regression
or a classification problem so the very
first question our first problem it has
been given the phase of some man it
looks like men but we can call it as a
person so then output will be the
predict the height of this person and in
a second case it has been given a phase
of some girl or but we need to find
whether this girl is happy mood or angry
mood or a sad mood so just pause for a
video for a couple of minutes just think
about it and come back here and I'll
give you the answer of this question
then you will grab the actual concept
and what their actual difference between
this regression and classification kind
of problem in a supervisory of learning
in a machine learning system ok ok so I
hope you have figured it out what is the
problem this individual problem lies
inside whether it's education or a
classification so if you see very first
problem the input is in a both the case
it's image so image is nothing but the
set of pixels so there are huge bunch of
number has been given and output will be
rough predict the height of the
individual person so by looking at that
image image is nothing but the pixel and
by looking at those pixel you need to
figure it out what is the height of
individual person so that height can be
anything it will be a from 4 foot to 7
foot somewhere around anything we can
put it in to regression kind of problem
because it's a continuous value but if
you divide this whole set of Heights
into different different bins and if you
become it a very finite set of output
cattery it can be a classification
problem also but for time being we will
think that this kind of height is a
continuous
can be 4 foot 1 inch can be a 4 foot 1
inch and another 1/2 instant 4 foot 1
inch and another 3 14 so this way it can
be a very much continuous value the more
precision it has it become a more and
more continuous value so first problem
it becomes lies inside this regression
because the height is not a lies into
discrete category but it's infinite may
be possible value will exist depending
on your measurement site so it's all
depends on how you define the problem
there is ml machine learning problem
lies inside this regression in a class
with the same problem you look at as
classification problem another person
may look at as a regression problem so
it's all depends on how you define the
output so in our case the height we have
considered it as a continuous values
it's become our equation but the same
height if you make it displayed like
either this high height of this person
will be any discrete step whether it's a
200 or a 500 different category still it
will be a classification problem so in
our case let's consider this height as a
continuous value and it will be a
regression problem now in a second case
we have been given the face of this girl
and it is for girl looks very angry for
me at least so we need to predict
whether girl is happy angry or in a sad
mood so output will be a by looking at a
pixel of this girl's image we need to
predict whether girl lies you know
category one like I'm happy your
category two like angry your category
three lighter in a sad mode so there is
a discrete step sets of output value
which is nothing but either it's in a
category 1 2 or 3 so it lies into
classification problem because
classification output is nothing but the
finite discrete category value so this
is all about increase on a regression
machine learning so I hope you are
understood and it grabs the concept of
figuration in classification
and you got the know about the
difference between situation
classification so that for our further
machine learning design whatever the
problem has been given to us at least
first our task is to identify that which
category of machine learning system this
problem lies then only we can apply the
algorithm specific related to those
category on the top of the data has been
given so I hope you enjoy listening this
