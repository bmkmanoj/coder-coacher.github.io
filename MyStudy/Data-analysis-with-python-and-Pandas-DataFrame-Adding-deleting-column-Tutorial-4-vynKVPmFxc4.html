tutorial inside the video lecture series
honor
pandas so there in our last couple of
videos we have seen about how to create
data frame object to the pandas and how
you can read the individual CSV JSON
file and you can put it into data frame
object again you can convert back into
another kind of format so in this
tutorial we are going to see about how
you can add and delete the individual
columns of data frame objects so let's
start let's first import the pandas
convention okay
let's create some very dummy data and we
will create a very simple Python list
which is we have stored inside the
variable a now we will supply this
this list G which is having a value 0 1
2 3 4 and we will supply to the data
frame function of the Python so it will
create a brand new data frame object for
us let's print it ok so it has generated
FiOS and a one column data but as
friends you can see that there is no
name of our individual rows or
individual columns so let us try to
rename the columns name so
so we want to you suppose name any name
like a call one okay so the instead of
zero it should print like a call one so
this way okay so we have got this column
one name is a call one and which is
having all those value now suppose we
want to add some new column so how we
can do it on the top of this data frame
object so let's say new column name we
have given a new column is equal to
suppose three so you can supply as
argument to the new column name and you
put the all data inside there all data
will be a three at this moment and let's
print VF again okay so it has created
brand new column for us which is having
a name new column and all values will be
three now suppose we want to add another
Phi to individual values of this new new
column so in a traditional Python
structure we need to iterate individual
record but this data frame object of
pandas it will we do not require to
rethread the individual object it just
factorize every thing for us everything
has been paralyzed so we just provide
the new column is equal to PDF
new column plus five so what it will do
it will add five to in DV new column and
it will assign to individual okay so it
has generated eight for individual
records now we have seen that how we can
do a small simple basic operation on the
top of colon in urges single line of
code how we can add the column now
suppose we want to change every index
value
so let's take create one variable like
index we will put just the I let's say
name will be a so right now we have all
index is ranging from zero one two three
four but in stephan1 our list data
structure of Python which is having
index I and let's assign this this I to
the index property of data frame object
and let's print it okay so it has
generated this our index ABCDE for us
instead of zero one two three four five
which we have given as a Python list
data structure so this way we have we
have changed the individual index
structure we have added the new column
and we have modified the new column
suppose we want to add one more column
and we will assign it to new
call vinyl surface and we will to assign
the same value which is having a called
1/2 this new call 1 so we can easily do
it and it will generate the new call 1
having the new column which is having a
name new call 1 and having all value
which is same as new call 1 so let's
bring DF ok so it has generated the new
call one column and which is having all
value which is a same value which really
resembles with a column 1 now suppose we
want to delete some column so there is a
del command is there del suppose we want
to delete the second column so we just
need to supply second column name then
let's print it again ok so it has
deleted for us so that's it for this
lecture friends we have seen about how
to add and delete individual columns how
to manipulate those column how to
rhenium the individual columns and how
we can add the index to the Python data
frame data structure so thank you guys
