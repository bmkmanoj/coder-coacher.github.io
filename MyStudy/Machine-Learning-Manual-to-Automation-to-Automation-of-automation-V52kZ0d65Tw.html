how he as a human being rich in the
world of such a high comfort in a world
of machine bullet rate software or even
aircraft this all become possible you do
machines we are the most comfortable
generation ever lived on a planet
machines have completely changed the
human life
so how our journey of non significant
Homo sapiens started and went through
understanding of complex universe
behavior and eventually reach to the
world of Android Google and Facebook so
let's try to understand the technology
machines and automation plays a vital
role to keep the human in such a state
during the cognitive and agriculture
revolution Homo sapiens our power and
sisters were doing almost all tasks
mentally if they want to go from one
place to another place they had to walk
they cross the large ocean and reach to
a different continent without taking
much help from the machine in those days
if they want to send a message to their
friend they had to go by walk and pass
the message so no Facebook no what subs
were available in short all tasks were
menu Bill Gates once a I choose a lazy
person to do a hard job because he will
find an easy way to do it we humans are
very lazy but very good at finding the
alternative solutions of manual
repetitive tasks this way machine era
Industrial Revolution begins we try to
replace every possible task with the
machine
we created a bicycle four-wheeler
aircraft to make our life easier but we
need to drive all those machines we
created an electronic mail system like
Gmail Yahoo Mail and hotmail to replace
the postman in Microsoft Outlook program
we can even create lot of rules in their
email system like him email title
contains this word it should go to test
folder him email comes from his list of
person it should directly go to the
trash
if email body contains this one then
this mail is very important all rules
are manual
it requires assistant to use such a kind
of machine a lot of tasks automated with
machine which is nothing but our journey
begins towards the automation so we
entered into no machine to the machine
automation era but human needs are
always increasing some people started
thinking about can we even automate this
automation task itself can we automate
the machine to make life even more
easier can machine drive a car the
answer is yes Google has already created
a self-driving car to replace the human
driver
lot of decisions started taking place by
machine on behalf of us with minimum or
no human information even all those
rules which we have manually created in
Outlook program can machine create those
through automatically the answer is yes
that's definitely possible with machine
learning with machine learning
technology and our fast interaction with
a different email machine can create
such a route automatically so machine
learning technology is not just
automation it's a one step ahead of
automation
it's automating and automation an era in
which we are currently living so we came
from walking by our ancestor to a
vehicle machine air off in the still
revolution and now machine will start
driving car itself a Google self-driving
car we came from a no intelligent human
to an intelligent human and now machine
itself getting very ready
we came from a no machine to a machine
era and now it's a machine learning era
artificial intelligence and a neural
network so machine learning is all about
automating of automation that's it for
this lecture friends please like video
and comment your views for a machine
learning automation of automation
if you want me to make more video on a
different technology please write it
into comment please share with your
friends and subscribe my channel for the
whole video at last thank you for
