tutorial into the machine learning video
series so till now we have seen about
machine learning prerequisite as a
numerical Python library so from this
lecture onwards we are going to start
learning about the scikit-learn library
which is nothing but the core machine
learning library in this tutorial we
will see about the data set of the
machine learning set what are the data
sets available inside the machine
learning how you can deal with those
data set inside the desai kit learned
library so let's begin let's see first
what are the characteristic of the data
set should be there for the machine
learning making the machine learning
system first one is the number of record
you should't how data about how many
records you have for the machine
designed a machine learning system has a
input to the system the number of
feature number of feature is nothing but
the characteristic of individual
instance of the data so if you have a
number of records and a number of
feature you will have a total data which
is having in a matrix format which is of
size number of records and number of
feature number of record will be a
number of rows and a number of feature
will be a number of column in the next
slide we'll see about how that actually
organized into matrix structure you
should know about the feature name
individual features name in its
description so how that feature is
actually contributing to compute the
output value so that if you know about
the actual in-depth description of that
feature you can even ignore that feature
based on your requirement or you can
give more weight a girl is rated to
individual feature here actually one
record is equal to multiple features so
individual record contains the multiple
feature and there is a one data which is
a target output that for each record
what should be the possible output in
this output can be a continuous like in
our regression case any value a real
number can be possible or it can be
discrete like in a
classification problem so these are all
the machine learning data set
characteristic that for describing any
machine learning character data set you
should know about this feature these are
the characteristic of that machine
learning data second now let's see one
hypothetical example of machine learning
data set so what I described in an
earlier site I have just put it into one
tabular format the same thing so this is
the green side we have a total pie
record which is nothing but our training
data set and each record has a total 4
features so individual record is having
a total for feature and one is the
output the second record has having
another for feature and a 1 is output so
in this way total we have a fire course
and a for feature so our training data
set matrix become PI rows and 4 columns
the same training data set output we
have a total 5 values and we have a 1
column so to target database the output
database matrix become 5 rows in a 1
column so in this way we get a training
data set of five rows and a four column
in this hypothetical example in reality
this number can be very high even a
thousand even millions or even a
building's also now these are all the
training data set what is in a testing
data set you have any training testing
data set which is where you have been
given this for feature and your
objective is to compute this output
value in a machine learning so that is
what the machine learning problem is you
have a training data set matrix your
target training set matrix and you need
to compute the output value for the test
data set for the test data set for all
the features has been given these
features can be anything depending on
the
different different datasets let's see
now different database available in is
the open source library so in this video
lecture series we are going to use the
scikit-learn library which is available
in two Python the first and foremost
thing into machine learning is that or
whatever kind of algorithm you use but
if you have a more data you will get a
better accuracy and that is the key
point in a machine learning so in a
scikit-learn library there are couple of
data set which is already available like
a Boston data set which is having a
number of features for each house and
for each house based on that number of
features you are predicting the price of
that house that is iris data sector it
has a total of four different character
for different kind of flowers are there
based on its length and height so length
and height becomes your features and the
classification among these four
different kind of flowers becomes your
target there is a diabetes database sets
are available in the cyclotron library
and there is one digit data set so
individual digit has been given as a
image and the clock task is to identify
which number as a numerical number exist
in inside that digit so in a few next
lecture we will see individually this
data set how did the data set data has
been organized in this matrix format how
you can import inside the scikit-learn
our library and further on lecture we
will see about what are the different
algorithm you can apply on but these are
all very toy data based very tiny kind
of data set in actual machine learning
system the data senses are very huge but
for our learning purpose we'll start
with this simple for data set like the
Boston data set or IDs diabetes or or
digit a data set so desirable toy data
set let's see about what is a huge data
set so as a machine learning community
they have created one very big
the data set of images which is now
image net which is having a 1.4 millions
image so the task is to or find out of
this 1.4 million
image every image has been categorized
into some thousand different categories
so if you have given a new image what is
the actual object or what are the person
exists inside that image the task is to
me if I identify that is the image net
but it is a very huge so once you become
an expert you can start working on or
this huge data set there is a Caltech
one zero one this is another image
database which is having some I'm not
sure about but around sixty thousand
around or nearly one like 100,000 images
are there which is organized into 101
different classes Caltech 256 that is
the same as Caltech one zero and it is
having a 256 different classes Stanford
as they released this house view her
Street View house number database so
these are the whole database which is
has been gathered by Google self-driving
car while taking the photos of
individual house and they have grabbed
house number inside that the task is to
find what is the number inside that what
is the alphanumeric number or value
inside thing you can consider the whole
Wikipedia as your large data set because
if you want to do some kind of tax
analysis Wikimedia can be the best
source to keep your machine learning as
an input to actually test your system if
you consider this just Google Search
application Google is considering the
whole internet is there data as input
so there is a numerous amount of data if
you can any kind of application if you
consider like Amazon product
recommendation system so the based on
the users buying habit what are the
products user buying at what are the
interval similar kind of P users has
been group into one single cluster so
those kind of based on those kind of
data Amazon is considering their own
database for their prod
recommendation system the same way
Netflix movie recommendation system but
if you consider Google News or any kind
of aggregated news website they are
considering all news related website as
their input dataset so there is a huge
amount of data sets are available once
you become an expert or into machine
learning system you can start working on
this huge data set but you can I have
given this link where a lot of
experimental level and database or
machine learning beginner people those
who experiment for them that a lot of
data set links are available ok so this
is all for the introduction related to
data set from next Enver next lecture
onwards we will see about the individual
data set which is a very toy tiny data
set available into scikit-learn library
will import each and every data set and
i will you see how to import it into
particular matrix and then onwards we
see how to process them so you will get
actually idea about it what is the
actual machine learning data set looks
like and what is the characteristic of
that what are the feature associated
with based on individual data set so
that's it for this lecture friends I
hope you enjoy listening this video do
keep like comment and subscribe it see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
