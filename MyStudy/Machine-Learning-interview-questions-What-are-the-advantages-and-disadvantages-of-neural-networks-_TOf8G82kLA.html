lecture series on a machine learning
interview question and answer so in this
tutorial we are going to see about one
more important questions related to
neural network on neural network deep
learning so the question is what are the
advantages and disadvantages of using
neural network algorithm for our machine
learning tasks ok so let's try to first
understand what is neural network so
neural network set of algorithms are the
kind of machine learning algorithm and
it's of one of the brain inspired
algorithm which we use in a machine
learning task so it tries to behave like
the way our brain works the way our
brain try to predict the next task so it
is one of the machine learning algorithm
now what are the advantage and
disadvantage of using neural lattice
especially in case of neural network the
deep learning algorithms which are the
subtype of the neural network algorithm
which has got a very much hype in last
couple of years so neural network has a
one subtype which is nothing but the
deep learning algorithm and those deep
learning algorithms are the kind of
algorithm which has almost outpace all
existing ML algorithm all existing
machine learning algorithm in case of
image video and a text related
processing task so let's say if you
consider a Google photos so it has it
will automatically categorize all those
photos automatically for us into
somewhere around 2000 different category
YouTube is using deep learning for their
own video classification still it's in
the research phase but deep learning is
taking we are taking too much advantage
of deep learning it is helpful for red
text or even speech recognition 3000 my
using Apple Siri or Google Android
speech recognition it is using this deep
learning neural network kind of
algorithm because it has almost
outperformed all existing other neural
network plus other machine learning
algorithms it also creates a very high
or low level abstraction of the input
data now what does this mean actually
creating the representation of the input
data let's say you supply huge number of
face photo to the machine to the machine
learning algorithm or to a neural
network algorithm what this neural
network will do it will automatically
extract those features for us like in a
first layer of neural network it will
connect or it will detect the line then
combinely those line it will try to
detect like unknown eyes combinely those
nose and eyes it will try to detect the
partial phrase and combination of those
partial face photo it will try to detect
these faces so this way if you supply
huge bunch of data huge bunch of face
photo to the neural network deep
learning algorithm it will try to create
this kind of representation that will be
a much more beneficial so that
individual developers do not need to
explicitly write the code for the
feature expression it will do all those
feature extraction automatically so this
is one of the big advantage of neural
network that feature extraction
automatically
it will do it will almost outperform in
image video tax and a speech related
task in all area compared to all other
machine learning algorithm so these are
all some of the advantages of neural
network but what are the disadvantages
of neural net so to do those kind of
things neural network requires lots of
lots of training data so before applying
this neural network to a on any kind of
data we require lot of data so if you
don't have enough data available this
neural network I mean one perform very
good this neural network our ticket
architecture is very difficult to debug
so what does these debugging means that
suppose you have already supplied some
of the training data to neural networks
algorithm and in some case it performs
very well in some case it perform
doesn't it doesn't perform much well but
in both the cases you can never come to
know about any kind of conclusion that
it's why it is performing good or why it
is performing bad so there is no
conclusion if something is working you
don't have any conclusion if something
is not working there is no conclusion
you have it's your luck that whether you
select some particular architecture in
it if it is work and your business
starts running there is another problem
also the number of architectures are
available to neural network so it is a
very difficult to select which kind of
particular architecture architecture
of neural network will work for this
kind of data something will work for
some kind of data something will work
for another kind of kind of data but
there is no thumb rule for it so it's
all depends on your experience more and
more experience with your data plus if
you supply a lot of training data to
this neural network it requires a huge
huge amount of time for the training so
either you can go for using the food
Arnett CUDA or GPU that is one of the
solution to reduce the training type but
even in that case also there is a huge
training time is required
sometimes this training time if you
don't have enough computation part goes
beyond the week and even a month also so
these are all some of the disadvantages
of the neural network based algorithm
specially deep learning algorithm so
lots of training data is requires very
difficult to debug there lot of
architectures are available it is very
difficult which one you can choose huge
training time actually so require huge
training time but apart from that there
are a lot of advantages also in everyone
specially in Silicon Valley giant
company everyone is using right now the
deep learning based neural network
algorithms for almost all their
predictive analysis kind of terms so
these are all the some of the advantages
and disadvantages of the neural network
so that's it for this lecture friends so
