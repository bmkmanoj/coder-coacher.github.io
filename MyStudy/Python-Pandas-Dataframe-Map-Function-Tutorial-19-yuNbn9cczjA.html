lecture series on a data analysis with
the help of Python panda's library so in
this tutorial we are going to see one of
the very useful function of the data
frame object which is nothing but the
map object so for the map object I have
already created some of the sample data
set and then we will apply this map
function on the top of this data segment
so what is this map how it will be
helpful first of all this map is helpful
and it will iterate over each and every
element of individual columns of the
data frame object we can apply this map
on the top of individual columns of the
data frame object and we are going to
see about the three different use cases
of this map functionality so before that
let's try to understand is the sample
dataset what I have created I have
created the data set in a data frame
object which is having a three different
columns first name a Jana City very
simple data set I have taken and its
column name is first name age and city
and one more dictionary object I have
created which is nothing but a mapping
individuals person city to its
individual person country like Mumbai
situated in country India Boston is in a
US Sydney in Australia the same thing so
this is all about the sample data let's
try to discipline this oh sorry
actually I have executed this import
statement
let's display this DF object okay so we
have total three columns are available
first name a Jana city and this is one
extra dictionary object I have created
which is nothing but the mapping
individual city to individual country in
which country the particular city
belongs to now let's see how this map
functionality will we can apply on the
top of it so we are going to see all
three different use cases for this the
first one is this how we can map this
dictionary object to one particular
column
one particular column of this data frame
of Jacob so how we can do it so suppose
we have already in a DF object there are
total three columns are there suppose we
introduce the fourth column and we'll
try to map this new column to
individuals countries so how we can do
it because we have already created one
dictionary object which is mapping
individual cities to individual country
so let's create one more column and
we'll understand the functionality of
this map function earlier I house all
told you that we can apply this map
function on the top of individual column
so we'll apply it on to top of City
because city is nothing but the input
the key value and we will map it to the
individual country so individual this
individual column D F City the city
column will apply this map function and
as argument we'll pass it to the city to
country so it will what it will do it
will create a new column country country
and whose value is been defined by this
expression so this expression will take
city to country as a input and will
apply on to top of this city so wherever
there is a Mumbai is there it will map
to India Boston it will map to us and
let's just display this DF again so we
will understand what is the use of this
map functionality
okay so it has created brand-new one
more column for us and it has map based
on our dictionary objects available
Mumbai - India Boston to us Sydney
Australia Boston - again us the Delhi -
India so this is how if you have a
dictionary objects available and you
want to map this dictionary object from
one column to another column this map
function is very helpful let's try to
understand one more use cases suppose we
want to map suppose first name to some
new cop new first name kind of new
column and based on some kind of
mathematical or a logical operation on
the top of it so let's do one thing I
will try to just append or will try to
prefix some common keyword into the
first name
so wherever Jack is there will put a new
underscore Jack Mina is their new
underscore Mina so dear will become a
new underscore so dear I may become new
underscore a me and Lina become new
underscore Lina so how we can do it
with the help of this in math
functionality so we will create one more
column which is nothing but a new
underscore first name okay now how we
are going to apply a disken catenation
of new underscore string to the
individual first name of the first
column so we are going to apply on the
top of first
on the top of fastening and then we'll
apply a map inside the map we can write
the sum of the lambda expression so we
have seen earlier that individual map is
just iterating over each and every
element so what does this map function
in this case we'll do it will take all
individual element and whatever the
expression will write inside these
brackets it will execute for individual
cells of this particular column and
column is nothing but our first name
column so we'll put a lambda X it will
take all individual cells and we'll
append or we'll just conquer in it
conquered the new underscore plus
whatever the names are available and
let's just display okay so it has
created a brand new one more column for
us whose name is new underscore
underscore name and the value inside
this has been defined based on reference
of this first name column and wherever
the names are there we are just adding
new and this new underscore plus the
concatenation of the first name now same
way let's try to apply this math and age
to the new age so we can take the same
expression here so instead of new first
name will let's create a new age
and instead of concatenation let's try
to do some another mathematical
operation like suppose we want to
increase the age of e all those persons
or all those rows by let's say 5 so 23
becomes serves 2856 become a 61 so X
plus Phi and let's just dissipate okay
so it has created another column for us
new age so if you see that 23 becomes
2856 becomes 61 75 80 so all those age
who are available it has generated the
new age column and it has upended Phi on
the top of faith so why this map
function is helpful because you do not
need to write this for loop iteration
and everything map function internally
those those iteration kind of work and
whatever expression we will write inside
this bracket that will be executed for
individual cells of the reference column
on which we are applying this map
functionality so this is how the map
function of the data frame object will
work so that's it for this lecture
