lecture series on our machine learning
so in this tutorial we are going to see
about how one can visualize this machine
learning data so at a pre-processing
step of applying the machine learning
algorithm how you can visualize
individual attributes of the data with
all different ways like a histogram way
or you can represent the data in your
density plot you can go for the box and
whisker plot sort of correlation matrix
between the individual attributes so in
this tutorial we are going to see about
this four different way of plotting your
machine learning data so you can take a
better decision while applying next
level process of machine learning
algorithm you can tweak different
parameters or even hyper parameters of
machine learning algorithm based on what
your data's are available and what your
end objective is there to achieve in
machine learning system design okay
so we are going to use about this
matplotlib library and we are going to
read the data in python panda's library
for the data analysis purpose so for
pandas I have already created a brand
new video lecture series the description
of this the linking is given in a
description for this video lecture
series you can go about and go through
whole video lecture series this is the
part of machine learning series so I
have kept this video in a machine
learning please okay so let's start
about how one can visualize so for this
purpose I have already downloaded
various one data base which is nothing
but the Indian peoples diabetes database
and I have kept it in my local machine
which is in a same directory so that is
nothing but the URL name for the
particular file where the data is
residing all data are available in a
comma separated CSV format these are the
names is attribute of individual
column so one is a prank plus press skin
does mass age and finally this is the
classification that whether diabetes
patient lies in a of one class of group
all inner another class of group so
these are all majority of scientific
terms like a freight plus we will just
look at it from the number perspective
after that I am just reading that simple
data in a CSV format so it will just
reference it in a data variable which is
nothing but the data frame object so
let's just run it okay so we have
successfully imported this matplotlib
library import statement plus finders
import statement let me just run it and
it will create the brand new data frame
object data okay
let's just see some of the couple of
records so we'll use this head
functionality to see first fire courses
okay so it has displayed us up for each
and every attribute Prag plus pressed
skin even tests and last one is the
class the second last is H so for
particular aged people which is having
age fifty these are the attribute for
single record and each row represent a
single record each column represent
individual attribute now let's try to
apply this histogram and all those
different plotting functionality on the
top of this data so we can take a better
decision a while applying the machine
learning algorithm so first of all let's
see about the histogram now what is the
histogram
what does histogram bin do so in our
case we have a total almost nine
different attributes are available from
prag plus path skin to the class and in
case of histogram is trying to divide
this individual each attribute into
different different bins and for each of
this bin how many values are available
it will tell us so it will guide us to
take a better decision that for
particular class like a particular
attribute of this data like age how many
people is lies between this particular
range or how many people range lies
between another particular range so this
way it will create a bin for us and it
will guide us that how your data is been
distributed with respect to particular
bins so let's try to visualize it how it
goes ahead so our data is nothing but
the data frame object and pandas is
giving one very good functionality like
a history histology so we are trying to
apply this paste on the top of this data
so it will create the histogram for us
and we are trying to display with the
help of this matplotlib library and we
are referencing it as a name PLT so we
just need to apply this alt dot so for
the visualization of particular craft so
let's just run it and visualize this
okay okay so it has created a brand new
graphic for us and for each and every
attribute like a frag press skin test
plus age class mass it has created a
different different histogram for us so
let's try to understand with the help of
very one attribute only like a age or
even a mass so if you see this age
majority of people between 20 to 30 age
20 to 30 h4 so whatever data's are
available we have majority of people
lies in this 20 to 30 range which is
around somewhere around 300 peoples are
there somewhere 30 to 35 40 another 150
people lies so it is trying to guide us
that how many people with respect to the
age attribute lies in one particular
range or in another particular range so
it has divided all those age range
between 20 to 90 now if you see another
attribute like a mass it has divided the
same attribute mass between 0 to 70 and
majority of people mass lies between
this 34 to 40 out of 40 to 30 to 40 50
to 35 actually and 35 to 40 so this way
it has created the small small bins of
some uniform or an or some uniform size
and for each of the mean how many
records are available this histogram is
trying to tell us so that is giving a
very good information with respect to
what action we need to take whether some
attributes that help you is some
attributes are even not help
some in some case some datas are
completely concentrated in one
particular beam only so it may happen
that it one give you much more
information while you apply any kind of
predictive analysis algorithm on the top
of it so that is for the histogram now
let's see what is the density plot so we
can directly apply this plot
functionality on the top of our data
frame object before that let's try to
understand what is the density plot in a
la previous one in a histogram we have
seen that it is trying to tell us that
with respect to one particular bin
uniform or distributed one particular
bin how many records are available now
density plot is nothing but it's like a
normalized version after histogram so
earlier in the case it was telling us
that in case of histogram total number
of record but in case of density plot it
will tell us how many instead of how
many is like all that record has been
normalized between 0 to 1 in terms of
density in terms of probability that
with particular being for which
particular attribute name what are the
densities are there what is the
probability of occurrence of that
particular value for each attributes are
there so let's try to plot in and let's
try to understand this thing so we have
a functionality like a plot is available
on the top of data frame object and we
have a data reference here so we'll
apply this plot and in a plot will apply
1 is the kind of density plot X Y you
can keep changing this one like another
box plot or any other now we have our
total nine total sub graph we need to
plot it so we need to make it sub plot
is equal to true
subplot through total nines are there so
we want to visualize it in a 3 cross 3
permit that is much better for us anyone
to visualize so let's put layout is
equal to 3 comma 3 and share X is equal
to false ok and last one is PLT dot so
because that is what actually we display
the plot for us PLT ok let's run it
okay test generated this graph for us
okay now let's see first of all it has
generated a nine plot for us so y-axis
in each and every graph it is indicating
the density and x-axis is indicating
individual attribute so let's it is
almost a mash-up but let's try to
understand with the Islam now if you see
this each density graph with respect to
the age Instagram graph it is almost
kind of a similar the only difference is
that this is the normalized version so
in a virus rather than trying to show
the total number of record it is trying
to give the information about the
density of occurrence of particular
value so if you consider like a 23 or 25
somewhere or thread P around the density
is highest so for that particular value
the probability of occurrence of that
particular value with respect to
whatever the data we have available
he's a very high so almost all data has
been concentrated with respect to is
somewhere around 22 of 40 age range now
if you see about mass also Bo earlier
seen in our histogram plot also so mass
is also concentrated between 20 to 40 so
that is all about the density plot for
your better decision while designing the
machine learning system so that's it for
this lecture friends we have seen about
the histogram plotting and a density
plotting and next lecture we are going
to see about this box and whisker plots
and curve even correlation matrix
correlation plot how to individual
attributes correlate with each other in
a next lecture so I hope you enjoy
