lecture series on engineering and
computer science related concept so in
this tutorial we are going to see about
what is the Fourier transform that is
the one of the very important
application in all areas of the
Engineering so let us try to see what
Fourier transformation so for the
Fourier transform we are not going to
learn about any kind of mathematical
formula in this tutorial you will get a
lot of videos in side the YouTube or any
other material related to mathematical
formula of Fourier transform you can see
there and how you can calculate the
transform how you can calculate the
magnitude and phase of the Fourier
transform so in this tutorial we are
going to see about the what is the
intuition behind in the Fourier
transform let's try to analog compare
the analogy with our real-life
application so let's just compare the
one very simple recipe this is the one
of the Salar recipe and let's say we
know about we don't know about the what
are the ingredients of this celery this
example we have taken to illustrate what
actually put your transform is then we
will compare this recipe example with
actual our signal and we will apply the
same formula for it
so suppose someone asks you that what
are the ingredients of this recipe this
is one kind of salad so how you could
come to know about what are the
ingredients of this celery recipe if you
know about the ingredients of this
recipe you can even recover back to its
normal recipe so let's say we will apply
some kind of combo filter or a tomato
filter allows filter it is all about our
intuition but he should try to capture
all those information from this cellar
like a cheese filter Apple filter so
this recipe is just for Illustrated
person
purpose I have already written the
actual content of this recipe ingredient
may vary
so suppose we applied the kokumo filter
so we will get output something like a
it may have 100 gram coke umber we have
already applied
so whatever the output of kookaburra
filter suppose we have applied a tomato
filter we may get like a 2 Tomatoes we
have already input in so in this way we
are all getting the a different
different in go in gradient through
which this recipe has been made we are
applied the chicken filter oh sorry
there is no chicken was available as it
is a vegetable slot there is no chicken
available so fill chicken filter is 0v
apply cheese filter there is a 50 gram
cheese are available we apply the apple
fritter there is a one apple also we
have put it so insert ow for this recipe
we have got this many ingredients forget
about this chicken part now actually so
now we have all the ingredients required
to make this recipe again
so if we mix it in a proper manner we
can again recover back this whole recipe
now let's try to correlate this example
with actual ever Fourier transform so by
this example we came to know about it
every single component as a part of
signal or any other object in this
universe is made of another tiny subset
of different different ingredients or
different different another component
the same base signal is also made up of
different component so Fourier transform
which directly tried to capture this way
the frequency of the data the same way
we are capturing the koo kumba data the
tomatoes data our lose data the chicken
data cheese data or Apple data
same way we apply the Fourier transform
on the top of this signal signal is
nothing but our input input is nothing
but the recipe the full recipe made up
of full and ingredients and all those
filter will give us what are the
frequencies are available inside this
original signal
so let us try to correlate with
Fourier transform let's say we have a
signal and the way we applied those
different filter earlier we apply the
same filter like a low frequency filter
then a mid frequency filter than a high
frequency filter same way we'll get the
component of low frequency trigger
signal output mid frequency signal
output and a high frequency signal
output that is what the Fourier
transform e so in short Fourier
transform is trying us to know that what
are the frequency components are
available inside our input signal so
let's try to see it with the actual
example let's say we have a very simple
digital signal like a 1 1 1 1 1 so all
values are same all values assume there
is nothing change so it contains only
low frequency signal so when we apply
the Fourier transform on the top of it
the low frequency components has a very
high value and a mid frequency and high
frequency component has a very low value
let's try to see with little change in a
input signal let's see we have a signal
leg of 1 0 1 0 1 0 so it's continuously
changing so it must have a high
frequency signal component associated
with it so when we apply the Fourier
transform on the top of this signal this
components will get bigger so in
summarize we can say that Fourier
transform help us to trying to know
about the what are the ingredients
available inside the original signal and
ingredients are nothing what are the
different frequency components so input
signal is we will try to correlate this
over with our recipe example so input
signal is nothing but our recipe we
apply the low frequency filter high
frequency filter mid frequency filter on
the topic which is nothing but the
Fourier transform filter which is
equivalent to our banana filter or Apple
filter all your filters chiken filter on
a top of recipe and whatever the output
we got out of this that will tell us
whether that particular ingredients or
particular low frequency made frequency
or high frequency component exists in
our input signal suppose we apply this
mid frequency or low frequency
a filter on the tower we'll get to know
same way we have got know in case of
when we applied the chicken filter on
the top of that vegetable salon so this
is the most intuitive way to
understanding the Fourier transform
every signal is made up of different
different component which is offer
different frequency now let's try to see
some of the application of Fourier
transform what advantage we'll get by
pricking the signal into different
components so we have broken the recipe
into its ingredients of the recipe so
how it will be helpful so it may happen
that you can remember in your old days
or when you were in a childhood for some
of the recipe some part of ingredients
or some ingredients you like the most on
some ingredients you don't like a more
so while eating you always try to put
the filter that for the particular
ingredients and whatever the ingredients
you like most you eat it first
and whatever the ingredients you don't
like you just leave it as it is you may
remember this kind of phenomena happened
with you in your childhood so it will
help us to extract your likeable
ingredients or your unlikable
ingredients when you are trying to apply
those filtering further your likeable
ingredients and unloggable in
ingredients implicitly you are trying to
extract some component out of the full
recipe which you can consider equivalent
to the Fourier transform let's slice to
see another application this is not
actually application I am just trying to
analog with our actual example
earthquake vibration so earthquake
vibration contains many different
frequency signal component so if we
suppose the dig down this earthquake
vibration signal into different
different frequency component then while
designing the buildings we can design in
such a way that what are whatever the
highest strength signals are available
based so how we can design those
building better to tolerate that
particular highest frequency signal
highest magnitude signal if you have a
different component of debt available
then we can take those decision so this
way hum Fourier transform is very
helpful while designing to buildings
image in a video signal so that will be
helpful for the compression purpose
suppose we have an image and video
signal which is a very huge in size in a
uncompressed format so once we apply the
Fourier transform or any kind of this
kind of transform on the top of it will
come to know about that there are some
of the components are available for very
high in particular frequency range and
there are some of the components which
is high in a high frequency range so it
may happen that we can boost some some
signal which is very visible or audible
to us and which is not useful we can
just discard those signal but same way
time we are preserving the actual
information it will be a lossy
compression but still looks like exactly
the similar signal it won't be the exit
but partially exit the signal so that's
how the compression will be helpful a
radio waves now every time we open the
radio we have to tune the channel why we
need to tune the channel because once we
open all our receiver every time the
receiver is a whole lot of all the
signal directly to our antenna but we
want to hear some particular channel
only but and any time all the radio
signal of all frequencies are keep
coming but we need to hear the
particular frequency channel only so if
you apply the Fourier transform on the
top of whatever the input signals are
coming you can extract particular
frequency range component only and you
can suppress all other frequency
component that's how the Fourier
transform is useful for extracting the
radio wave signal so that's it for this
