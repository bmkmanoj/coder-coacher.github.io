tutorial into video lecture series on
machine learning so what we have seen
till now is the what is machine learning
and basic building block diagram of
machine learning how this in general way
the machine learning system works so in
this tutorial we'll see about what are
the different types of machine learning
system how can you classify different
algorithm of machine learning into
different category so let's begin let's
see what are the different types of
machine learning system so the every
machine learning algorithm in a very
broad way we can classify into three
different category one is the supervised
learning wonder there is the
unsupervised learning and it is a
reinforcement learning
so this supervised learning again we can
classify into regression and the
classification so we see one by one what
are the characteristic of individual
category and we'll see about what is
supervised learning what is unsupervised
learning what are the different
parameter associated with it what kind
of problem individual category is trying
to solve in tutor machine learning
system reinforcement learning we'll see
into the subsequent lecture so let us
begin with the supervised learning okay
so this is the supervised learning just
concentrate on this very simple
functional mapping from Y to X so what
we do into supervised learning this is
the our input data what X is our input
data so we supply huge amount of data
into X we have a label associated with
all individual records what we called as
as a Y and what is the problem in the
supervised learning is our task is to
predict this function f so you have been
given this input data and a label in
short the output data and your task is
to find this
predicted function f now let us try to
understand with the help of very simple
I example this is a very simple example
of recreation that you fit the data into
regression algorithm and eventually you
will get this model this model is
nothing but this predicted function f
okay so let us try to understand with a
very simple example of this predicting
the house price State how this house
price calculation problem can be solved
with the help of regression okay let's
try to concentrate on this is the house
price is data so just see there are the
two columns and each row is associated
with a single record so in the first
column it is been written that what is
the size of individual house and for
this size what are the price associated
with that house so there is a huge
amount of data has been given for
example I have seen some six data point
here it is been read as a size of two
thousand one hundred and four square
foot of house is costing this
thirty-nine 3.99 theta three hundred and
ninety nine thousand dollar is legally
so these are all our input data X and
these are all our output data Y
so let's and what is the our actual task
is these are the data we have been given
but for this data we don't have what is
the price when our task is to find for
the size fifteen hundred and thirty-four
what is the price of that house for the
square foot of size 1534 what is the
size of that house so that is the
problem of regression now how regression
algorithm will try to solve this problem
so this is a very simple two dimensional
problem in
reality in into the practical situation
this dimension of X may equal 200 or
even our got thousand even 10,000 and
sometimes even a millions also that is a
very large-scale problem so but here we
will try to understand with the help of
very simple two dimensional problem okay
so let's try to project those data into
the two dimensional coordinate geometry
so here in the x-axis I've plotted the
size and then the y-axis it is better
right it has been apprised the ski it is
not up to the scale what I have written
the data here so don't take it as a
granted now what is our task is that we
have a whole lot of data for each size
of the house we have been given
enterprise but for unknown size of the
house our task is to find what is what
could be the predicted price of that
house so what more regression algorithm
we'll try to do it is just try to map
this into the simple line so this is
kind of non or linear regression or it
can be a nonlinear regression then in
that case it try to find this data with
the curve so it is trying to project
each and every data to this line so
ultimately this line become the complete
representation of our input data and
that line is nothing but in our earlier
case what we have seen Y is equal to f
of X function this become the F for us
now we have got this line that means the
model associated with our input data
let's try to find what is the price for
the size fifteen hundred and thirty-four
so yeah this is interpreted as a slope
and interpreted intercept of this line
so this line has been described in in
the form of these two variable
so this is the new size actually fifteen
hundred and thirty-four let's consider
it and we try to project this line this
new size of the house on this our model
and we will get this new price of that
house so this is how the regression
algorithm normally works so let's try to
find what we have done with our earlier
analogy of y is equal to f of X function
so if you have seen this Y y means
nothing but your label what are the
values associated with the house prices
has been given in the form of Y that is
what it is
here what are the X X is nothing but the
size of the house in this square foot
that is also it has been given as an
input to us now the task is to find this
F that's what with the help of different
regression algorithm and a learning
algorithm via projected those data of Y
and X into a single line it can be a
nonlinear line also and this F is
nothing but our slope and intercept what
we have fine so in this way we have
model the complete function have based
on the input data has been given in a
form of X comma Y fair so whenever we
have been given a new pair new not a new
size we can predict what can be the
possible or predicted house price so
this is what regression is so this is a
kind of supervised learning so in this
case we have been given the x and y so
input and output as input to the machine
learning system ok this is for
regression okay let's try to see what is
the classification those this is another
kind of supervised learning algorithm in
a machine learning system so see in a
regression what we have seen that all
outputs are the continuous output so I
show you
whatever these outputs are there are
continuously it can be any value or an
integer or a float or any real number it
can come so this classification how it
is different from the recreation because
overall it is another kind of supervised
learning so it holds all properties of
the supervised learning algorithm or the
only difference in classification with
the regression algorithms are this
output values at the discrete value it
has no continuous value so there is a
fixed amount of output value either ten
or five or seven or nine or even
thousand class is also possible so let's
try to understand with the help of very
simple example just concentrate on this
data this data uploaded on to
two-dimensional graph so in earlier case
of whatever the output we have there was
a continuous but here what this
classification algorithm will try to
find the boundary between this kind of
data so this class of data will lie into
the one class and this class of data
lies into the second class so whenever
we have been given suppose some new
example so it will try to classify this
and to this kind of group so there are
only two output value associated in this
class there are no continuous value so
that is the only difference between the
regression and to the class even so
that's it for the supervised learning
let us see about the unsupervised
learning how unsupervised learning has
been different from the supervised
learning so just concentrate on this f
of X we how earlier seen how we model Y
is equal to f of X based on we have been
given X and our Y value as a input but
in case of unsupervised learning we have
been given just this input data we have
just this input data X we have not been
given the Y and we are trying to find
the model function f so how it will try
to find this model
have they just tried to find the
structure between the input data itself
it doesn't try I to correlate those data
with the or function of with the output
or why he just tried to find the
interdependency between the data what
are the different structure exist within
a input data and it just try to model
this function f so what is the
difference between supervised learning
and unsupervised learning is that we
have not been given the output label
output data as an input to the our
machine learning system that is the only
difference between unsupervised learning
so let's try to understand this
unsupervised problem with the help of an
example so just concentrate on this data
we have seen in a classification we have
been given a two classes of data some
are red and some of green because in
that case we already know that some
data's are associated with the class one
and class two but in case of us
unsupervised learning we have just been
a given a data and our algorithm will of
unsupervised learning we'll try to find
that what are the inter dependency
between the data what is the structure
associated with data so our algorithm of
unsupervised learning like learn a lot
of lighter clustering and a game is
clustering kind of algorithm we'll try
to find a structure between the data
watch how much individual data's are
near in a multi-dimensional space and it
find this structure itself automatically
that's what unsupervised learning is all
about we have not been given a output
data so you know last summary what is
the difference between supervised
learning and unsupervised learning is
that we have not been given the output
data in a case of unsupervised learning
but in supervised learning we have given
input data and output data we are trying
to model the function f but in case of
unsupervised learning we have been given
only input data and we are trying to
model the function I have based on the
inter dependency and covariance and what
is the structure inside
is data and now individual Li there are
two kind of supervised learning one is
the regression in the one is the
classification so the difference between
the regression and classification both
tries to model the function f we just
write of mapping from the input data X
to the input data Y what is the relation
between the input data x and y based on
a huge amount of input output pair has
been given the only difference within
the recreation of the classification is
in the regression we have seen the
output values are mostly all the
continuous value in case of
classification we have got a very
discreet amount of value so it has a
limited in number of the class so that's
it for this lecture friends I hope you
enjoyed this video in the subsequent
lecture we'll see about how will I
install the different softwares
associated with the machine learning
library and you will see what are the
different algorithms for this regression
classification and unsupervised way of
learning I hope you enjoy this video and
