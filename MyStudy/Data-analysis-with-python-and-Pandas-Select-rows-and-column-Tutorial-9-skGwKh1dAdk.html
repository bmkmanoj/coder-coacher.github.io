lecture series on data analysis with the
help of Python so in this tutorial we
are going to see about how you can
select this individual columns of the
data frame object or you can select how
you can select multiple columns of data
frame object of one time rather than
watching each and every column and later
we'll see about how you can select
individual rows or even a cell level
granularity also we'll go if you want to
select suppose some rows of some column
then also you can go
so let's first the import disbander
library we will rename it to P okay so
we need some data for selecting columns
in a row so let's just read one file I
have already a Titanic data set
available in my same directory where I
am running this my development
environment so let's just read it's in a
CSV file so we'll use read CSV function
I have a train dot CSE and you I will
assign it to the bf in the data frame
reference now let's print the sum couple
of record first so we'll use head
function it will just display the first
fire course okay so we have successfully
read the train dot CSV file which is
having a Titanic data set so for each a
every record I have already discussed
this data set in a real lecture but for
this lecture its Titanic data set and it
has a number H and every record contains
one passenger information something like
a passenger ID
whether it survived or not which class
he has belong to while sitting on a
Titanic boat it's named Sachs edge or
even etiquette number fare or which
cabin years taken so this way all
informations are there so what is our
objective in this tutorial it has total
three plus three
six plus three places total twelve rows
are there but suppose for analysis
purpose if you want to select some
particular column only or some group of
column we want to display how we can do
it so on a DF DF is behaving just like
the way better in dictionary data
structure in a Python behaves so in a DF
we just supply the individual column
name so like a P class okay so it has
displayed for us that the first record
is three so second record is one this
record three one so this way we can
display individual column so suppose we
want to display the name of individual
passenger so it has listed on all
passengers name so this way we can
select the individual column now suppose
we want to select more than one column
how we can do it so let's see for
selecting one column we have supplied
the one column name the same way we can
supply the multiple columns names in a
arrays permit in a string array format
so let's see how we can do it so we need
all our columns name rather than going
up so let's just display all columns
name with Delta this column filled on
the top of data frame reference okay so
it has displayed all four columns
Haarlem
it is passenger ID survived in P class
and everything now let's try to display
couple of columns rather than just
single column shown here and we will
supply here as a are a formatter
so suppose we need a name and tech
ticket okay take a term so this is the
only two column it will display okay we
got it so rather than displaying the
whole set of all columns this way we can
access the individual columns are a
group of columns okay so it has a name
and ticket let's try something else like
a name versus fare okay so we got it
name versus fare okay so this is all
about how we can select individual
columns of this data set up now let's go
for selecting individual row how we can
select the individual rows further so
for selecting individual rows all rows
has been indexed with some name so if
you see the very first column which is
the first one actually it is like a
indexing column then actually the first
column second column will start so here
all indexing names are there so in our
case it's indexing is 0 1 2 3 only so
it's all numerical value and all values
from 0 to 890 so total number of 890
rows are things now suppose out of that
we want to select suppose the filter
rows only then how we can do it so DF
has one I location function so it's I
local and we can supply 50 ok so it has
displayed the flip the collar 5th row
actually so 5th row has a passenger ID 6
survived is 0 e class is 3 now how I can
verify this value so we'll just display
the
BF dot had all rows of us Pyro's so 5th
row is nothing but okay we need somewhat
more data because it said it has
displayed the sixth one actually okay
six zero three more on mr. Janice okay
we have got the six zero three more and
mr. geum's so in this way we can select
individual rows of the data frame object
now suppose we want to select the
multiple rows so let's see how we can do
it so in a DF the same I log function we
can use it suppose we want to select
four hundred and twenty three and four
hundred and twenty-four row so we can go
like a four hundred and twenty three to
four hundred and twenty five
so 425 won't be included so it will
display total two rows okay so four
hundred in twenty three and four hundred
and twenty four rows it will display and
all the corners so we have seen till now
at how we can select individual columns
and group of columns or a group of rows
or individual rows now suppose we want
to select the individual cells so
suppose this cells we want to select it
so how we can supply rows in a column at
the same time so let's let's first
decide a head function first few records
and out of that few records we will try
to display some of the records so let's
we want to select this second rows and
now fourth column so how we can do it so
second row you cannot apply on a log
function and in argument you can supply
rows and columns so second row is
nothing but
the very first index by value1 this is
the second row and we need to find the
name so this is the G wrote first second
and a third so I can give third okay so
we have got this coming smushed missus
John Bradley that is what here actually
so we have got a particular called sells
now suppose we want to display the group
of cells like we want all names which is
having a row number between 500 and 600
suppose so column name already we know
about this column will be indexed by the
third column and all rows will be 500 to
600 okay so it has displayed from 500 to
600 all rows which is only third column
of that so in this way we can do our the
slicing of this data set we can
individually select the rows columns or
individual cells of data frame object in
a future lecture we will see how we can
put the condition on individual cells or
a column level cells or the row level
cell and we can extract those data
something like equivalent to the where
condition in our SQL query language so I
