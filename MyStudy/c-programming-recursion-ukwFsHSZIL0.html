lecture series on a different
engineering concepts and a computer
science related concept so in this
tutorial we are going to see about
recursion in a programming so let's try
to understand the recursion we tell pop
some of the natural world phenomena
so let's observe these formants are
sitting and watching the TV in a movie
hole so movie hole is somewhere around
here this guy's is sitting first this is
in a second position this is in a third
position did this is in a fourth
position so let's try to understand ah
by asking the questions that what the
phenomenon of recursion looks like so
let's say this four person wants to know
or someone asked him that what is your
seat number but these guys are little
bit lazy he doesn't want to count like a
this is the first second hall and I will
be the definitely four so what he does
actually he will ask the person which is
immediate to him and he asked that what
is your seat number whatever is your
seat number I'll just add one to it and
I will tell whatever my signal now again
this person is also lazy so he'll ask
this person that what is your seat
number why I should count actually first
second third so rather than that I'll
ask what is your seat number and
whatever you give answer I just add it
into one into it again this person is
also lazy so you want count actually ill
ask to this person what is your seat
number whatever you will tell me I'll
just add inside that now the we have
reached to almost the terminating
condition because there is no person
sitting in front of the very first
person so this first person will just
tell that my number is one because there
is no person sitting in front of him so
he will just written one to this guy
these guys already make a promise to
himself that whatever number given by
this person I just add one to it and
that is what my seat number so I just
forward it here and that is it will
forward to this guy this guy's telling
that whatever this guy will
I'll just add one to it and I'll just
return to this guy now this guy's knows
that what is the seat number of this guy
so he just add ones to it and finally he
got the seat number four so indirectly
every person is lazy and they are just
keep asking the same question and
eventually the terminating condition we
have reached and we are just going
backward continuously to get this first
person who has actually called this
question that what is your seat number
and if you tell me you're sick number I
just add one to it and I will get my
answer so that is what the recursion is
just keep calling the same question or
same function to individual what and
eventually you are arriving to the
answer let's try to understand with one
more example just observe this lady this
lady is a standing and just near to his
hand another lady another lady is the
same one again it's repeating so it's
keep repeating inside this lady so one
object is calling another object which
is the same as the earlier object so
function calling again the same function
it will call to its same function so it
just keep repeating like a fractal
situation let's try to understand one
more natural thing like a box some you
can understand this as the gift box
something like in your birthday time
or any special occasion someone is given
you give but someone wants to make a
pang out of the he has given you a very
big box so you feel like it's a very big
gift something very good will come but
once you open this box there will be
another box inside once you open that
box another box inside and eventually
you will arrive at the actual gift will
be given by your friends or your
colleagues or your well-wishers so
eventually you keep arriving at a
situation and once you open the first
book you will immediately get the same
box like this so out of this all this
floor
three example we have seen we observe
one thing that the object which keeps
calling itself in a technical term so
something which keeps repeating that is
what called as a recursion so let's try
to define the recursion in a very formal
language so recursion is something like
a which repeats itself continuously in
every repetition which will reach closer
to our answer so the moment in a first
answer we have observed every recursion
step the first person is going very
closer to the arriving of his actual
answer now let's try to see how this
recursion will be implemented in a
programming languages so in a
programming language every object or
some we call it as a matter or a
function so matter or function which
call itself which will eventually arrive
at your solution that is what called a
recursion now we'll see about how that
recursion will apply on some kind of
mathematical logic or arithmetic
function so we'll use that thing to find
the factorial so we will find the
factorial of the for now factorial of
the four is equivalent to four cross 3
cross 2 cross 1 so you eventually will
keep multiplying every number in a
decreasing order till we arrive at a 1 1
is always a terminating condition so
let's try to do in a very new way or
iteration to matter so once we go for
any trait you kind of matter
we'll use the iteration so what we'll do
first
we'll just calculate the 4 cross 3 is
equal to what whatever answer we'll get
we'll multiply it with alpha 2 again so
first we multiply with the 3 what for
then again we multiply by 2 whatever
answer we have got again we'll multiply
it by the 1 so eventually we arrived at
answer because first we multiply 4 cross
3 whatever answer we have got we
multiply it with the 2 again whatever
answer we have got we multiply beta 1 C
eventually every iteration step we are
going closer to the answer now let's try
to understand how that is different from
the recursion phenomenon how we can do
it with alpha let's first call the
factorial 4 function so but this
factorial 4 function is very lazy so
what it will do let me call the
factorial 3 function and whatever answer
I will get I'll just multiply it by the
4 and that will eventually I will get
the answer
so you won't calculate the criterion for
it will call the factorial 4 3 function
and whatever answer it will get it will
just multiply it with a 4 but factorial
3 is also very lazy so you will call
factorial 2 and he tells that whatever
answer I'll get I'll just multiply it by
3 again the same phenomena occur that
factorial 1 factorial 2 is also very
lazy so it won't calculate factorial 2
and it will call the factorial well
function and it will tell that whatever
answer I will get I'll just multiply it
by 2 now we have reached the terminating
condition because factorial 1 is itself
is a 1 value basically so we have got
already the value this is equal to 1 and
1 is multiplied by 2 is equal to 2 so
this function execution has been
finished and it will eventually return
this value to the earlier function being
called so 2 is going here so - and this
guy's has promised to himself that
whatever answer I will get from this
factorial one function
I'll just multiply it by directory so
eventually whole phenomena is recurring
recursion and going backward delete
reach to the actual function and it keep
multiplying first time with a to second
time with a three then beta for
eventually they will arrive at answer 24
so that's it for this lecture friends I
hope you enjoy listening this video
about the recursion we will see about
the more engineering and computer
science related concept in a very layman
or inta to obey in a future lecture
