tutorial inside the machine learning
video series so in the last lecture we
have seen about the two different
database which is built-in available
inside the
scikit-learn library Boston house
prediction house price prediction data
set there is one more is a flower data
set I this data set so in this tutorial
we are going to see about two more data
set on about the diabetes dataset and
add each if take a said that how this
data set has been organized what are the
features for individual data set and how
machine learning system week utilize
going to utilize this future into a
future lecture so this two lecture is
giving you the actual glimpse of what is
the actually data set how data sets are
organized what are the things you
require before starting any machine
learning system so let's dive into our
Jupiter not book we'll start with the
diabetes data set so before starting
let's first import a scaler
a scale and dot data set package start
okay so we have imported the data set
let's load this diabetes with this data
set okay so we have imported this
diabetes there does it let's find what
are the keys are available inside this
diabetes variable so we can access
individual keys and values
okay so they are given just in this case
the data and the target let's print that
data size dot shape so we recognize the
total number of instances are available
in total number of features are there so
they have given a 440 to total records
and each record has a total tan feature
let's just print those data so we'll get
even more idea so we have a total tan
feature for the first record the second
record itself has another ten feature so
in this way total tan feature for each
and every four hundred and forty two
records and target value so they haven't
given any kind of names for kicks let's
see what is the target okay so this is
the might be the sugar level for
individual records so for all this
stands like course they are they have
written this sugar level so you know in
diabetes dataset in our task is to find
this continuous value of the sugar level
based on the tan feature has been given
so there is nothing more I think about
this diabetes data set any kind of
regression algorithm we can apply based
on these different combinations of this
tan feature available inside the dataset
so that's it for this diabetes dataset
let's sprint about let's see about this
digit data says so this is the kind of
image data set whatever till now we have
seen that cannot be visualized but this
data we can visualize so you will come
to know about it how this object
recognition image recognition this is
kind of digit recognition system system
will work and how machine learning is
helpful for identifying or classifying
the individual digit in two different
classes of digit so let's see about this
digit data set so let's get lower first
digit data set okay so it has printed or
loaded the digit data set in two digits
variable let's bring in two digits dot
keys okay so they have given us the
images data this is the actual data and
images these are nothing but the data
arranged into some kind of matrix format
they are given a target name or
description in a target let's plane
first what are the target what is the
possible target values teach it's not
target underscore names so zero to nine
so our task is to classify individual
records of data which is nothing but the
images they have given we're either 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 any of the number
between 0 to 9 has been eaten and we
have to classify that which number has
been written pasted on that image that
is what the target is so let's see first
how data how the total number of
instance are 10 and total number of
features are there in this Thetas so
we'll print the shape of this data ok so
there is a total 1797 or total instance
of record and each is having a total 64
feature
so this 64 feature is nothing but the
pixel value in case of this image data
set so if you just print this image data
set
sighs we'll come to know about that what
is the difference between this data's an
image in shape okay so this is same as
data and images are same just thing is
that whatever these 64 features are
there they were organized into 8 cross 8
matrix and 8 o'clock 8 image so from
just looking at this data we are not
getting any kind of idea that what that
individual image looks like so we'll see
some of the small visualization library
in a Python to visualize individual
disease so we'll come to know about it
Howdy's 1797 individual data that has
been nothing but it is a images of size
weight and height both 8 cross 8 so
let's import this visualization python
has a PI lab and let's first print this
image 0 so if you print this we'll get
this 64 values the first record is
having a 64 value another record is a 64
value and in image variable what they
did care organize this 64 value into 8
cross it matrix rather than 64 value in
a continuous format so you can look like
it looks like an image let's just
display this image so PL dot grain we
want to bring this this is a grayscale
image that's why now we'll supply this
the first images are input to this graph
plotting library so Matt matrix so we
have
and we will supply this digit and we
just displayed so we'll get the idea
about okay it has dispelled for us so
you can see that this is the first data
set out of this seventeen hundred and
ninety seven data set it is having a
total sixty four feature and this image
variable whatever they have given that
is been organized into eight cross eight
matrix so you can see this is a total
eight rows and eight columns in image
individual is having a different
different pixel intensity than that
Intel pixel intensity is nothing but our
feature vector for individual records
and record is nothing but here they
image so you can see that based on this
pixel intensity this image looks like an
0 let's print some another random
records like a five six one okay so you
can see this looks like a tree so this
way actually they have given image data
set you know 8 cross 8 matrix and total
number of records has been given
seventeen hundred and ninety seven so
our task is to find this way image has
been given as a 64 pixel intensity value
and the task is to classify individual
digit into the nine category which we
have seen in the target that what is the
value or what is the numeric value is
there inside this image either from 0 to
9 so that's it for this digit data set
and diabetes dataset we have discuss so
I think that the design of introduction
related to the data set I have done so
in the next lecture we'll see about
pandas library that what are the
different small pre-processing steps you
need to do before starting machine
learning coding or machine learning
algorithm so these are all
data how to read we have done it now we
will see that small manipulation or
small data wrangling kind of stuff as a
prerequisite part I have described in
our earlier lecture that pandas is also
one of our prerequisite before diving
into machine learning algorithm so what
we did actually till now in our summary
is that we have just read the data
whatever is available as a built-in
library of this scikit-learn library we
have from the programming perspective we
have learn about that data matrix and
array manipulation matrix or linear
algebra related manipulation inside this
numerical Python library so now the next
task is that we have read this data but
this data we cannot apply directly to
any kind of machine learning algorithm
so our task is to do some kind of
feature scaling or there are a lot of
scalars are available inside the size
scale done and then you do those kind of
pre-processing based on the kind of data
you have then you can supply into
machine learning algorithm so from next
lecture we will see about how this panda
takes care of this data then we will
supply it to different learning
algorithm so thank you guys for watching
