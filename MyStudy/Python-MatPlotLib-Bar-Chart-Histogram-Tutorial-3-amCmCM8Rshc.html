tutorial inside the video lecture series
on the data visualization in Python with
the help of my plot lab rival so in a
relation one in lesson two we have seen
that how basic line plotting things we
can plot inside this might not live
library how can we can add title and
labels in a legend inside this library
so in a lesson 3 we are going to see
about how you can display the bar chart
and how cube in this video is to come
kind of chart with the help of this
library so let's start so first of all
bar chart let's see how first the bar
chart looks like and what is the purpose
of this bar chart so if you see this
other example of a bar chart bar chart
indicates that for the different value
of horizontal axis in x-axis we are
getting different whatever the Y values
are there Y values trend will indicate
by the length or the height of the
individual bar so that means if you want
to represent them more strength you put
more height if you want to represent the
less strength it is a less height so
eventually you are trying to convincing
the audience about the strength of
individual Y value based on the height
of the individual bar now let's see how
we can draw this inside this Python
matplotlib library so let us create
another X series or Y Series for us
now suppose for one I need a very big
one for two maybe three six let's skip -
five seven
okay so this is the six element series
we have generated now let's use our help
the namespacing function PLT and for
drawing bar chart we have a bar
functions are there it says this VLT
then we will supply as usual the two
horizontal axis series and y vertical
axis series so apart from deities you
can give all those titles levers and all
those other values also I am NOT giving
in this case because I have already
described all windows title how to give
title on a labels to graph the largest
print it
I think oh yeah we have here okay this
is a ma earlier graph what we displayed
this one the bar chart so you can see
that we have given the horizontal axis
says one to six this is nothing but the
six different bar it has displayed of
equal width but for the first one it is
indicating very high value tan which is
visualized with the help of very high
height bigger height in short the 3 and
then minus y minus y is going another
reverse direction and then there is a
six and a seven and a 1 so this is about
the bar chart how you can display apart
from data or you can do one thing also
if you want to see all those options
available with the bar chart you can
just put PLT bar and question mark and
just run it
so it will display whatever the
documentation associated with this bar
function of our matplotlib library so
how you can give colors and each color
or even a line width of individual bar
how much height you want what is the
error tolerance what kind of orientation
you want you this is the vertical
orientation video selected you can give
even horizontal orientation also so you
can play with this different different
argument of individual bar chart oh
let's see about the histogram now
now how histogram will be helpful for
the visualization of data so histogram
is another kind of dated chart data
visualization technique so histogram
what histogram is doing that provided if
you have a huge amount of data are
available for all individual data it is
trying to cluster into different
different group and for each different
group it is trying to convince that what
are the strengths what are the frequency
of data lies in two particular cluster
another cluster in another cluster so
let's try to understand this histogram
kind of thing with the help of one
example so let's take the height of
different people into one village let's
say one will give 100 people height 100
people hide in a different ring so
height let's try to generate some very
hypothetical data we'll try to generate
hide between 40 and 100 so we use this
NP floor function
and then 10 another 16 multiplication of
P dot dumb
100 let's bring this age okay NP is our
numerical Python library which I haven't
imported important numpy
okay so it has generated some 100 number
between 40 and 60 so what I have done
here actually I have kept top set of 40
and between 0 to 1 it has generated this
value of 100 value which is I have
multiplied by 60 and I have taken a
lower value of it in which I have added
to the 40 of our offset so eventually
combinely this whole expression have
generated around a hundred value for us
which lies between the range of 40 and
100 so this way we have generated our
age now what histogram will do for us
that we want to see that how many
peoples have a high age between 40 and
50 how many have a 50 and a 60 how many
hours 60 and 70 so this kind of age
grouping work histogram will do so this
is our y-axis value what I have
generated let's try to age we will give
variable name age age business so let's
generate it like 50
we'll start with a fault P and 1550 and
1650 and 70 1800
okay so we have generated this to Python
list data structure which will supply to
our Python PLT hist function so that
will generate our histogram for us
so each underscore
each and each bins and pl
okay so it has generated this histogram
for us so what this histogram is trying
to convince us that between 40 and 50 is
group there are around 27 or 26 peoples
are there based on our random data
generation between 50 and 60 there are
total 18 people surveyed between 60 and
70 somewhere around 15 peoples are there
so histogram is giving us the
distribution of ages inside the
different different clusters of the each
beams so that's it for this lecture
friends thank you guys for watching in
the next lecture we will see about the
scatter plot or any the stat plot pie
chart kind of things I hope you enjoy
