and today I am going to start a new
video lecture series on a machine
learning interview question and answer
so let us begin with our first question
the first question will be which is
better more false positive or false
negative this is one of the most common
our interview question for the machine
learning job so let us try to answer
this question so what is first of all
false positive and what is false
negative so let us try to understand
this thing there are two aspects are
associated with this kind of terminology
first of all let's say you are
performing some task or you conducted
some experiment or you conducted some
tests and whatever the test is
associated with you or whatever the
output came from your test or task is
actually a negative let's say negative
but you actually predicted it as a
positive so that okay
I will just write it as positive and
this is negative
now you perform some experiment and
output is actually negative but you
predicted it is a positive so those kind
of cases will lie in a false positive in
a false negative it is exactly reverse
so actually there are some output which
are actually positive but you predicted
it as a negative so those kind of
category lies in a false negative cases
so our question is which is better like
in your experiment or your test if you
find more false positive that is better
or false negative which is better so let
us try to understand this thing with the
two different examples one is the cancer
detection medical test and one is the
spam email detection what we found in
our Gmail or yahoo mail so let's say we
go for the cancer detection test and now
some of the Hospital has conducted a
cancer detection test and we found that
will make one category like a found
cancer so that is like a and no cancer
output whatever the test has predicted
that is the no cancer and here we will
write like a positive and negative case
so these two are like an actual one and
it has predicted whether cancer is there
or not cancer so we will find the four
to cross 2 matrix and each fill has its
own meeting like a ok cancer is there in
the first row first column and it has
predicted there is a cancer so this is a
completely true positive case we are
going to ignore it
it has no relevance with our question
and same way here also there is no
cancer exist but it has predicted there
is no current concern so there is no
harm in it but that is a true negative
case so our stuff lies in to whether
particular patient has a cancer and it
has predicted it's a low cancer so this
kind of category will lie in a false
negative so we'll write like a false
negative case and this is a false
positive case that there is no cancer
patient has found but our test has
predicted that if they have a patient
has a cancer our test has predicted that
patient has a cancer so this way we are
going to concentrate on this false
negative and a false positive partial
let me color it up a little bit so you
will understand it clearly okay so our
question is which is better
false positive more false positive is
greater or false negative is better so
less given some number randomly to false
negative let's say of 1500 cases we have
found that patient has actually cancer
but test has predicted they don't have a
cancer and let's just put another number
like thousand that patient do not have a
cancer but they have a predicted cancer
so let us try to analyze which case is
much more better in which cases whether
it's in a false negative or it is not
false positive case if you have a more
number there is little less harm in with
respect to over paced so if you consider
this false negative case patient has
already cancer but we haven't detected
this cancer
so if you do more with this false
negative kind of cases then it is a very
much harmful to the patient and patient
will be diagnosed with the different
kind of treatment also and that will
lead towards the dead person so this
kind of case is false negative is a very
much dangerous so we always wanted false
negative must be very minimum should be
minimum in case of this medical cancer
detection medical tape now let's see
false positive case so in case of false
positive there is no cancer associated
with the patient do not have a cancer
disease but our test has predicted
cancer so there is no harm we can even
suggest that you go for some more higher
level tests to confirm that you do not
have a cancer but our test has predicted
cancer but patient do not have actually
a cancer so however big number this
false positive does not matter
at least patient is on a safe side but
in case of false negative if that number
is higher then it will go towards the
erroneous medical diagnosis with rêveur
with respect to that particular patient
so in case of this cancer detection
medical test we want that false negative
P greater than false positive and that
is a good for the patient also so in
first case we have found that false
negative is false negative should be
more than a false positive that is a
good condition basically so let us try
to analyze the same thing with respect
to another example and then we will
conclude that whether false negative or
false positive more false positive is
greater or false more false negative is
greater so in the spam email detection
we have a two case whether particular
email is spam or not not so let's make a
two category that
taste or our algorithm spam detection
algorithm has predicted that particular
email is spam and either particular
email is not spam or I will write as a
hum and we have a two cases one is the
positive cases and one is the negative
cases so clearly this is a proof
positive because email is actually spam
and our test has already detected is as
fun so that's completely fine email is
not spam and this is wrong actually this
is this is I should write as a spam
email is not spam and our test also
detected ISM or our algorithm has also
detected as a not spam so will write as
a true negative ways but our interest
lies in this false negative and false
positive case so I will make a highlight
to this two point so this will okay so
let's try to understand with these
different examples what is the
terminology for this false positive and
false negative compared to what our
earlier case of cancer detection medical
test so in case of this spam email
detection false negative indicates that
you found that some email is spam but
you have classified as a non not spam
that's completely fine you found some
email spam but that has not categorized
as a snot that is categorized as a non
spam and it has came into your normal
work space or normal folder now let's
see what is false positive false
positive is saying that your email is
not spam so that you import an image
definitely if it is a not spam that's
important image but our test has
predicted it as a spam
so that is not a favorable condition for
us so let's see if let's put some
hundred numbers here and let's keep it
easier two hundred so this we have found
that this is not a favorable condition
false positive so if more and more
numbers are the false positive numbers
are higher that means more and more our
email which is not actually spam that is
going into spam so that is not a
favorable condition so these numbers
should not be higher so whatever I have
assumed so that means 200 emails which
is not spam and it is going into spam
folder so that is not a good condition
but in case of this false negative this
is 100 emails which is a spam and it has
not classified as this one that's
completely ok it is I am NOT losing the
contact with those persons we have moved
which boom they have contacted with me
so in case of spam detection we have
found that false positive must be
false-positive must be minimum
false-positive should be very minimum
false-positive should be minimum so in
this case we have found that false
positive
should be less than false negative
so 200 email our algorithm has
classified they are not spam but it has
classified into spam so that is not a
good condition but it has classified
only hundred email which is a spam but
it has not classified as a son so more
and more these numbers are there that is
not a good for us but this number if
however big this number is that's
completely ok but that is erroneous in a
machine-learning spam detection
algorithm so we have found that actually
I have written it wrong way this one
should be false positive false positives
should be greater yeah so that's what I
was getting confused basically so we
have found in a both the example that
falls in first example we found that
false negatives should be minimum so
false positives would be greater but in
case of second example we founded false
positives with the minimum false
negatives would increase so our question
was which is better more false positive
or false negative so we have found that
there is no common rule for it based on
a different problem or problem statement
we found that we can define our own
matrix that in case of cancer detection
art is more false positive will be a
very favorable condition but in case of
spam email Direction false negative is
very favorable condition so there is no
general no general general Rickon rule
it depends
on a problem statement okay so that's it
for this video friends so I hope you
enjoy like this video I'll be coming up
with a more machine learning related a
interview question in a future lecture
