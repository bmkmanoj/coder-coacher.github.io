tutorial inside the video lecture series
on machine learning so this lecture is
about different list of machine learning
algorithm so in the last couple of video
we have seen about the two class of
machine learning algorithm learning
style baby or divide the whole class of
machine learning algorithm and a
similarity race we have divided whole
class of machine learning algorithm so
in this tutorial we are going to see
about this neural network related
algorithm dimensionality reduction
related algorithm learning algorithm
plus assemble algorithms so let's start
off one by one so we have seen gone
through this supervised learning
unsupervised way of learning regression
algorithm this is entry algorithm we
discuss about the Association rule
mining so let's start about the neural
network in the deep learning algorithm
so this is the very famous right now in
a current state of our technology in the
artificial intelligence and machine
learning film so this family of
algorithm are inspired by the brain how
brain works so this is completely
inspired by the brain algorithm how the
generally plane is working this is one
of the state of art technology inside
the machine learning so what we did in
this set of families of algorithm we
this is one of the Supervisory of
learning algorithm so we provide the
input individual data to the individual
node of the system this individual node
is nothing but the neurons of artificial
neural network and these are the output
so we provide the huge huge bunch of
data and we apply a couple of learning
algorithm like a back propagation
algorithm or any other advanced learning
algorithm so it will generate the
weights this individual arrow is nothing
but the weight you can correlate this
individual arrow bit synapses in our
brain and individual this round seven
node is not
but the neuron in our actual brain so
these are the brain inspired algorithm
the wave brain works there are some of
the principle we have inherited from
dead and we have modelled it inside this
artificial neural network so we provide
a huge bunch of data and for based on
data and it will prop forward propagate
from this one layer to the second layer
to the third layer and it will generate
the classification tasks so for that
actually these are the couple of lists
of algorithm I have listed here there is
a perceptron and feed-forward neural
network there are others like of radial
basis hopefully the neural network in a
current state of art technology this
deep learning is another subfield of the
this neural network field this has
become so much high because it has
almost over tech error rate in term soft
state-of-the-art technology which is
being used by other learning algorithm
so these are all like a deep Boltzmann
machine convolution neural network
specially or mostly used for image
related classification or image
recognition kind of our stack auto
encoder a kind of neural network so
these are all different variants of the
same neural network kind of algorithm
let's see where in industry some of the
place this deep learning kind of please
have has almost Excel actually so if you
use the Android phone most of the time
so Android speech recognition whose
error rate is drastically down because
of this neural network algorithm so
Google is using in Android with this new
learning algorithm google photo you can
categorize a whole set of your photo
into different different categories so
those kind of automatic photo and a
contained inside that photo detection
task has been possible due to this
neural network and deep learning
algorithm Google even built this
self-driving car so while watching ahead
like what are the possible ways that
particular car has gone that
all decision has been taken by this deep
learning algorithm so these are all
families of neural network or artificial
neural network kind of algorithm in a
future lecture we will see individual
algorithm and we will even implement if
Google has already released an open
source library Dancer flow so we will
implement those algorithm inside the
tensor flow so that's it for a neural
network now let's see about the another
set of family of algorithm like a
dimensional reduction algorithm so what
is dimension reduction algorithm will do
it is not a set of kind of particular
learning algorithm but you can classify
it as a pre-processing task for the data
so it may happen that your data may be
in a very very very huge dimension
suppose the individual a core contains
even a 1 million pixel or 1 million
feature so for processing on that 1
million pixel or a 1 million are data
for just individual record it requires a
huge amount of computation power plus
huge amount of memory so it won't be
possible to deal with so this dimension
reduction algorithm will be very helpful
so what is dimensional reduction
algorithm will do that will transform
this data from the higher dimension to
the lower dimension provided it
preserves the maximum amount of energy
even in a lower dimension so with the
help of this very small cartoon type of
feature I have shown this data is
transforming from this 3 dimensional
space to the two dimensional space but
in a reality that the dimension will be
very very huge like 100,000 even of 1
million dimension 10000 dimension so it
will drastically reduce to suppose
thousand diamonds or even a finite
dimension so whatever data you were
representing with the 1 million pixel
you can represent the same data with
just the 500 pixel or 100,000 pixel or
even 10,000 pixel so eventually this
kind kind of algorithm will be helpful
for the data compression also where
lossy data compression
is desired effect so for that I have
listed some couple of algorithm like
this PCA which is nothing but the
principal component analysis so while
transforming from high dimension to the
lower dimension he just take those
dimension which which preserves the
maximum energy of the data there is
another like or Lda linear discriminant
analysis there is a one auto encoder
which we have seen in a last slide about
the neural networks set of family of
algorithm so this set of family of
algorithm will be generally useful for
the data pre-processing that you can
transform data from very very very high
dimension space to the very low
dimensional space and you can start
processing for your for the applying
machine learning algorithm so that is
for the dimensionality reduction
algorithm now let's see another set of
family of algorithm that is unsayable
algorithm so this is a bell algorithm is
a is not a particular frame kind of
algorithm but this family of algorithm
what it does there are a huge set of
families of different different
algorithm an individual algorithm inside
this machine learning system has its own
pros and cons there is a one famous
sentence in machine learning there is no
free lunch theorem exist free lunch
exists in this world so that means that
if you try to apply some machine
learning algorithm you know some data it
works fine but the same machine learning
algorithm won't work on some other kind
of data but that for that data you need
to apply suppose some other machine
learning algorithm so there is no
generic rule that particular machine
learning algorithm will be very helpful
to apply on all huge huge amount of set
of different kind of data
so what design symbol kind of algorithm
will do it will combine multiple picker
model so what it does you apply the
machine learning different different
machine learning algorithm like on the
top of data like a model 1 model 2 and
model 3 you get the result on the top of
that and this machine learning
in semble kind of algorithm will decide
that based on which models output I will
decide the actual output so this set of
family of algorithm we take the input
from whole set of machine learning
different algorithm and based on the
output of individual algorithm it will
decide what kind of output or what
weight is I have to give the particular
model what we teach I have to do to
another kind of model should I give more
weighted to particular model or so like
you lace matches to another kind of
model based on the data so this n symbol
algorithm very very will be very helpful
when you are trying to combine multiple
machine learning model into one single
machine learning system so these are the
set of algorithm like a bootstrap
algorithm or random forest algorithm
random forest is one of the very famous
one into machine learning community or
like we have seen earlier in a decision
tree is that how that decision tree has
been has been created based on data so
kind of classification algorithm but it
may happen that if you use another
decision tree algorithm you will get
another kind of model if you use another
decision tree algorithm you will get
even another kind of model said there
are a huge set of families of different
model can be possible so what this
random forest will do it will take the
output from all this individual model
and it will decide what can be the best
output or even a majority what's so for
that this random forest will be helpful
it will combine whole set of family of
different machines and decision trees
model so one very good example of
industrial system of design simple
algorithm is IBM Watson
so I mean Watson is the actually
question-answering system so this system
won't depend on a very single algorithm
but IBM Watson has been built around the
root set of different machine learning
algorithm and those output will be given
to these in simple kind of learning
algorithm which will eventually decide
that which model output I should take or
what
of which model output I should give up
more word or less what to decide this
actual output okay so that's it for this
and symbol algorithm and that's it for
this lecture also I hope you enjoy
listening this video in a future lecture
we will see about more machine learning
algorithm and we'll start even
implementing inside this scikit-learn
and a tensor flow related life library
