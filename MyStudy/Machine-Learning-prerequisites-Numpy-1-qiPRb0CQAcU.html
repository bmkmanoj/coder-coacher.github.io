tutorial into the video lecture series
on machine learning so in our earlier
lecture we have seen that to dive into
machine learning related programming if
you want to do into Python what are the
prerequisite required so from now on was
some couple of videos I am making on to
the programming prerequisites required
for the machine learning so in this
tutorial we will see about the numerical
Python library 3 available inside the
Python so I have divided our whole
numerical Python library into two part
so in this tutorial we will see about
how to create the arrays so I have
divided the whole topics into this
number of sub topics like how to import
the numerical package here how to see
the documentation how you can create
arrays inside the numerical Python
library and how you can index it in the
second tutorial we will see about what
kind of operation you can perform in on
to it so let us start begin with the
very first subtopic that is the import
convention Python package so it what is
the normal conventional way of importing
the numerical Python library inside the
Python so generally we insert with like
import numpy and aleeah's vq NP so every
function we can access as the name of NP
you okay so it works very fine
the second one is numpy reference
documentation now suppose you want to
see any kind of documentation of a
numerical Python library so you just
type if you know already the function
available inside the numerical Python
library then you just type N P dot the
function name and you put the question
mark on it and run the cell so it will
just so the documentation associated
with array function of 10
numpy library now suppose you don't know
the actual function in you know the
partial function name like a con and you
don't know what is ahead then just put
after con the question mark or star then
it will show us the list of function
which is matching this criteria so this
is the way you can find documentation of
the Python you put the question now
let's see the third one that is a manual
construction of the array so why this
array is much more related in our case
with respect to the first of all with
the machine learning so or the first
task in machine learning is the
importing hell lot of data enters data's
are us arranged in a multi-dimensional
grid so this numerical Python library
will gives us the ability to import
those data in a very efficient way plus
manipulation on the top of it that is
what the objective of machine learning
let's say we are learning about this
array manipulation stuff inside the
numerical Python library so let's see
manual construction over how you can
create or a very manually so just now we
have seen one function array when you
supply what are the value you want to
put inside the array suppose 1 2 3 5 7
it has not displayed any output
okay so we have created the one array
which has stored a value 0 1 2 3 5 &amp;amp; 7
now suppose we want to print that array
so it has printed 0 1 2 3 5 7 let's see
the size of this array so there is one
function P dot shape that is a 6 so
there are total 6 element inside this
array so this is the story about the one
dimensional array suppose we want to
create manually the two-dimensional
array so how we can create it the same
function we can use it but you need to
give the two-dimensional array
so suppose 3 comma 5 comma 7 1 comma 6
comma 3
okay there is one more place I need to
keep there is just the matter of syntax
now let's print how this be variable
looks like so it has a total two rows
and three columns the first throw is 2 3
5 7 and second row is 1 6 3 now let us
bring the shape of disarray okay so it
has a for the first element indicates
the total number of rows then the second
one indicates total number of columns so
it has a two rows and three columns okay
so that's all about how you can manually
create the array but the numerical
Python library gives us different
functions to create the array with the
evenly spaced the values you want to
associate it with the arrays or by total
number of point you can supply and you
can create the array there are some
common array function also so let us see
how we can do it now suppose you want we
want to create the array from 0 to 100
which all element associated with that
so numerical Python has a one function a
range
so suppose 20 so it will print all
values between 0 to 20
better we'll we should have print it
here only
so it has printed 0 to 19 so total 20
value with starting from 0 now suppose
we want to where where we do not want
value to start from the 0 or we want
from suppose 3 then it will start from 3
to 19 okay so you can give starting
value and ending value but N and 1 be
included now these are all values which
is incremented by just the 1 step in in
future but we want those all value which
is in a step size of 2 so after every
interval of 1 and this value will be
printed so see it has printed 3 5 7 9 so
in a step size of 2 it has printed now
suppose we mock make it 2 step size of 4
so there is an interval of 4 between
each and every value so in this way we
can create the array in a numerical
Python library with an evenly spaced
value across the whole RM there is a one
more function by the number of points
you can supply and you can create array
for that new numpy provide the linspace
function so what does leads is function
will do you can give the start value and
ending value and you can provide the
number of points or number of elements
in the array you want to create so
suppose I want to create a 25 element so
what it will do it will create the 25
element of array which is evenly
distributed within the range 0 to 10 so
between 0 to 10 it will divide evenly
spaced 25 parts and it will generate the
array so let us print it sorry
okay so it has printed between zero to
between the maximum value ten and
minimum value zero and it has divided
whole range into different 25 different
parts so if you keep the length function
of D then it will so there are the total
20 Philemon's are there inside the array
D now this is by the number of point
let's see how the common array cell
functions are available so suppose you
want to create the array which is having
a exactly same value so let us see and P
dot once so it will create the array of
three rows and five columns which is
having all values will be one only and
will print so there are total three rows
and a five column which is having all
values one so this one's function will
create the array which is having all
values one now suppose we want to put
all values like seven so you just
multiply it by seven and it will print
this it will create the array of value
all seven so this is for the same value
now suppose we want all values to be a
zero so either you can do it this way it
will generate a zero or even Python will
provide numpy with Python will provide
one more function like NP Rotten zeros
again you supply the dimension of the
array you want to create suppose 4 comma
2 okay you may need to print
so it has created all array which is
having a dimension 4 comma 2 and all
values are 0 so this way this is the
specific kind of array also you can
create it now let's see how we can
generate the random number with the help
of this numerical Python library so
there are two ways you can generate the
random number one is the uniform
distribution way you can generate it or
one is the Gaussian distribution way you
can generate it so uniform distribution
array will generate the value between 0
&amp;amp; 1 so let's see how uniform distributed
way we can generate it so let's assign
to some variable G so NP dot there is a
one more package inside the numerical
Python library there is a random so we
are accessing totes module within a
package numpy library that is a random
and inside the random there is a
function like a random so rand function
you need to just supply the total size
or of your dimension comma 2 comma 3 so
this will generate the random number
with a very uniform distributed way
between 0 to 1 which is having a
dimension 2 comma 3 so total to row and
3 column so print
okay two-dimensional array I don't think
it can create so we have to supply one
dimensional way only okay so it has a
generated total three values in a very
uniform distributed way between 0 to 1
now suppose we want to generate the
value in a Gaussian distributed way so
there is the same package we can use it
but the function name is rent and n
means the normal distributed normal
distributed way that is nothing but the
Gaussian distribution so suppose we want
to create and this will create a value
between minus 1 to 1 which is having
mean value will be a zero and total for
value it will be it will generate so it
has generated between 0 to R minus 1 to
1 in a Gaussian distributed way and and
nothing but it is a normal distribution
normal distribution is nothing but the
Gaussian distribution so this is how
different ways we have we have created
the array let's see about the basic data
type associated in with the numerical
Python library so we have created a lot
of arrays
earlier like this see and let's concert
end on this C and D so we have seen that
this C and C are AC which is having all
value looks like a integer because we
have generated value between 3 and 20
which is having a step size of 4 so it
has generated all you but here all
values are float so suppose we want to
see the type of the
arrey then there is one property
associated with the function you can
write let's print first see now we want
to print C dot d type so it has created
integer 64-bit so that means every
element of this array which is having a
size 64 by 64 bit okay let's see about
the already dot B type okay so it is
having all value which is a 64 bit
floating value that's why it has printed
64 bit floating value so these are the
different datatypes inside the pipe
numerical python library there is one
more complex 128 bit also which is
nothing but the real and imaginary part
both are float 64 bit and there is one
more is a boolean data type also so this
is the different data type let's see
about how we can see the indexing of and
a slicing of element so we have already
created a lot of array let's printer a
so a is having a element 0 1 2 3 5 7 now
suppose we want to access the third
element so in numerical Python numpy
library all values starting from all the
indexing starting from 0 so we want
element 4 so this is first second third
fourth so we want to access the 4 that
means the third well her indexing we
have to accesing that is nothing but the
3 let's see about
to dimension array how we can access it
better we have yeah we have this any to
dimension array yeah we have a B is a
two-dimensional so let's print it and
let's extract data out of it so okay so
now suppose we want to print or we want
to extract first row and the second
column so how we can do it in number the
first row will be 0 to index and the
second column will be first index so
this is the Phi so first row and the
second column will be a fine that is a
correct now suppose we want to extract
all rows so if you put the colon it will
print all rows and only first column so
all rows and a first column so it will
be 3 comma 1 so it should bring 3 &amp;amp; 1
now first means the second index that
means a 5 &amp;amp; 7
sorry about that it is a 5 &amp;amp; 7 now
suppose we want to see just the zeroth
row and all column so this is the zeroth
row in all columns so it will print 3 &amp;amp;
5 &amp;amp; 7 so this way we can extract element
or indexing will work inside the
numerical Python library so I want to
show you there is a one good
illustration has been given here this is
from the SyFy science python lecture dot
o-r-g website so just consider this
array it has they have generated these
arrays in a two-dimensional grid let's
just concentrate on this orange part
suppose these 3 and 4 out of this array
we want to extracts so how we can
extract it so 3 &amp;amp; 4 lies in to 0th row
so they have supplied here the zeroth
row and
this is lying into the third row and a
fourth a third column and a fourth
column so we can extricate with the
three to five the last value index will
not be included so in this way we can
extract it the same way
let's concert in on if you want if you
want to extract this red part so this is
the third column and all rows so all row
will be concluded with the help of just
the colon colon means all value
associated with that row will be
extracted and this is the third row
third row can be extracted with the help
of just second column so you know we
have extracted this red part this is the
third column so this way we can extract
element inside the numerical Python
array there is one more thing and last
one in this lecture that is a memory
memory of an efficient way now
Python is already providing there is a
range functions are there inside Python
so it is nothing but kind of array here
for us so let's see what is this range
function and how our numerical Python
array is giving advantages for us so
this is the range function and I have
installed one library we just refined
time taken by that particular line or
particular line of statements on the CPU
to execute now suppose it has generated
the all where our array from range 0 to
999 and we want to have a square of each
and every element of it and let's try to
find it how many seconds or how many
milliseconds or microseconds it will
take
so what it will do it will do the
squares of each and every element and
this range function I have used from the
basic Python library and let's see how
much time it will take this is the for
loop actually so we have to eat rate it
over all element of this range function
so of array L so it has taken 60 point 8
microsecond per loop
now suppose let's generate this same
array with help of numerical Python and
library and we want to do the square of
this numerical Python function time so
this will do the exactly same operation
what we have done with the help of for
loop here but here in a Python it will
do in a very parallel it will apply low
parallelism on the top of it and it will
do there is a arrange function not e so
see it has given us that there are best
of three diesel it has shown us then it
has taken just one point 56 microsecond
while in case of our basic Python data
structure it has taken sixty point eight
microseconds so you can imagine that how
efficient and how fast this numerical
Python function for data manipulation or
matrix or linear algebra related
manipulation it is nothing but area
oriented computing for people are using
and as it is very fast it is very closer
to the hardware the the way the
computation happens on a hardware it is
very closer that's why it's very fast so
it is better to use this numerical
Python function rather than the actual
Python built into built-in data
structure so that's it for this lecture
friends so in this lecture we have seen
about how to create array how to do
indexing and how memory efficient is
numerical pythons are there in the next
lecture we will see about how you can
manipulate this array what are the
different operation you can perform on
the top update all this thing's we can
see from the point of view of the
machine learning I hope you enjoy this
