tutorial inside the video lecture series
on data visualization with the Python so
in this lecture we are going to see
about how to load this data from the
file and displayed so till now we have
seen that all data is for individual
x-axis and a y-axis we are providing as
a Python list data structure but suppose
we have a huge bunch of datas are
available inside the file then how you
can provide those data to the server
Python matplotlib libraries individual
plotting function so let's start it so
before that we need to create some data
so let's do in a very simple taste data
file so suppose first x-axis has a value
we'll put it as a comma separated 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9
for the second value suppose there is a
five six nine zero minus five to nine so
this is the example data we have created
now what we are going to do we are going
to load this file inside our Python and
those data we will supply to our Python
plotting function so let's save it at
the proper place
we'll save it like this later dot txt
okay so we have saved it now let's try
to load this data so in a numerical
Python library there is a one good CS
and DS are all comma separated value so
either we can use the built in CSV
module of Python or either we can go
with but in that case we have to iterate
it or we can go with a ready-made
function available inside this numerical
Python library so let's do it numerical
python is so before that we need to
import this numpy as a NP
okay so that's a typo okay now let's put
whole data inside this two variable
first is the x value and the second one
is all Y values or NP has load txt
bungalow TX e function is there which
will take argument of our tastes Delta
dot txt file and we will supply the
delimiter has a comma as a comma
so there is a typo this is a typo here
and new yeah we need to supply the one
more argument also unpack
okay so we have got all those data
inside this our xn Y variable the same
way we have already display
taken this the data and we have
generated in as a Python list data
structure we have got all this X when
the Y values is a Python let's just
verify it by crediting X okay 1 to 10 so
in our X data is also 1 to 10 let's
print Y also 4 5 6 1 9 so 4 5 6 and 9
this is correct actually so we have got
all data inside our to Python list data
structure now we can easily supply to
any kind of our graph like her let's go
with a simple plot only and we will
supply this to list data structure to
over plotting function of matplotlib
library
let's displayed
okay we have assigned this VLT okay so
it has generated the plot very basic
line plotting function which we used in
our very first lecture of this series so
for the first value it is having a for
the second is might be fine so this has
generated the value and here in this
case the only difference is that we have
done exactly all similar thing except
that we have gathered data from the file
so instead of just generating at a
runtime or hard coding all those value
like this in our earlier example so this
way we can load the value from filed
also and we can display the graph so
that's it for this lecture thank you
