lecture series on a engineering and
computer science related concept so in
this tutorial we are going to see about
what is the difference all what is the
comparison between two programming
language one is kind of a static
programming language and one is the
dynamic type of programming language so
before we dive into actual difference of
the static and dynamic type of language
let's try to understand how the source
code to execution is actually performing
on the machine so source code is
something like which developer writes
the code then it has to go through this
two-step process something like a
compiler will come compiler once we
supply the source code to the complier
compiler it will create equivalent
executable code for us independent of
any programming language and then this
executable code will apply to the actual
hardware machine and it will start our
execution author learning object or
program this is the most basic and a
fundamental process while executing your
source code on a machine before that one
step of compiler has to have happen
which eventually create the executable
code and which will leads to the actual
hardware machine for the execution now
with respect to this analogy we will try
to understand what is the difference
between static and dynamic type of
programming languages so let's say we
define this in a static programming
language integer a is equal to Phi which
is of type intern and one is a string a
variable name is a and a value is a
again fine but this is of a string type
and one is a simple integer so we
haven't given code the same way suppose
we want to perform in a dynamic type of
programming language we do not require
to give any datatype explicitly while
you are writing the code now that is the
very first difference now this
static kind of programming language data
types is always defying set a
compile-time so we have seen in our
earlier block diagram whatever source
code you supply to the compiler at a
compile time only we know about the data
type of this variable a every time but
the dynamic put kind of programming
language this data type decides on
execution time because as a source code
developer we haven't supplied any data
type that what this data type of
particular variable a so this data type
decision has been taken place on an
execution time so this is the main
fundamental difference that data type
decides on a compilation type in a
static programming language and in a
dynamic programming language data type
decides on a execution time now
developer needs to take care all data
type so while are defining any kind of a
variable in a static programming
language if suppose variable do a
developer do not give this integer and a
string it will immediately throws there
so for all variable defined by the web
developer in a static programming
language they have to define this data
type but in a dynamic programming
language developer do not need to take
care any kind of data type because at
execution time it will be taken care by
the execution engine Java C C++ all
those languages at a static programming
language so for all these three
languages
we must supply the data type for each
and every variable we define throughout
the program source code but in case of
Python and JavaScript these are the
dynamic programming language because we
do it is not compulsory or necessary to
supply this integer and string datatype
kind while defining the variable at
execution time it is
will be taken care so this for
difference are not a for actual
difference but these are actually this
one difference only that data type
decision will be taken at a compile time
so developer has to supply the data type
of individual variable defined by the
developer in a static programming
language but in a dynamic programming
language it is not necessary so data
type decision will be taken on execution
time that's why it is not necessary for
any developer to define data type for
all the variable so this is the main
difference between static and dynamic
programming language that's it for this
lecture friends I hope you enjoy
listening this video keep watching this
series I will be coming back with more
this kind of inta tube way of
understanding very small small
engineering at computer science related
concept I hope you enjoy listening this
