Ankita now this is the second video into
the video lecture series of numpy Python
library so in the last video we have
seen that how you can create how many
different ways you can create a number
array so now it's time to go ahead so
let's see what we are going to learn in
this video so I have described what are
the operation we can perform on the top
of array what we created in the last
lecture so the topics related to
indexing and the reshaping of arrays how
we can find a maximum minimum of the
array how can we sort the array what are
the basic operation like addition
subtraction multiplication we can
perform on the top of numpy array and
some of the statistic calculation like
median and standard deviation how we can
perform easily with help of number
package okay so let's start with an
indexing
okay so I love market like operation by
first let me put numpy package so let's
see how indexing works basically inside
the number I array accessing element
okay so let's create a very simple numpy
array
array of size three comma four so it has
the three rows and four columns so let's
print X
I think I have done all little mistakes
oh sorry actually we have to give the
stop number from which G from zero to
suppose let's take 15 this much I'm zero
to 14 it will print the number now let
us say reshape it - don't worry about
this reshape function we'll learn later
about that recipe so what I have done
here actually I have generate an array
whose element range from 0 to 14 15 is
always excluded the last number and I
have reshape it into 3 cross 5 so it has
a three rows and five columns so I have
a brand new brand new array of three
rows and five columns so let's see how
we can access the individual elements of
this array so suppose we want to find
that second
second row and third column
so how we can find a second row and
third column so see second Romans this
is the first row this is the second row
so we can access with the help of array
indexing one and the third column will
be the second because indexing starts
from zero so it should name the first
second row and it's the third column so
it should read the seven okay that's
correct now suppose we want to find all
rows of the third column so all rows now
whenever we want to access all rows or
all columns you just need to put a colon
so it will access every rows and we just
need a third column so third column will
be accessed by the number two so see it
has all rows and a third column so it is
a two seven and twelve
let's go other where out suppose we want
all columns of the first row so first
row will be accessed by zero and all
column so it has a printed zero one two
three four so in this way we can access
the different elements of okay now let
us see the another topic like reshaping
let me say Pig
arrey so let's create first the simple
numpy array array of range
28
okay let's print it so now as if you
print the size of this array shape of
disarray sorry it has not displayed
anything
but it is of 28 rows and one column now
suppose we want this variable Y which is
of numpy array of size 28 rows and one
column we want to make it four rows into
sam-7 column so four rows in seven
kilometer self is a so all those 28
number
okay sorry actually I uh
rather than earrings I will keep it like
array so it has created as all mistakes
okay so it has generated all 0 to 27
number now suppose we print the shape of
this array so it has a 28 rows and 1
column now 28 rows suppose we want to
reduce to built into 4 rows and a 7
column so in this way we can reshape the
array so you can see it has the read
distributed all those 28 number into 4
rows into 7 columns so each row has a
total 7 numbers are associated but be
careful that whatever the numbers are
associated are already available in side
array that has to be perfectly fit with
the multiplication of number of rows and
column of the resize array you want
now let us reshape it to 7 7 rows into 4
columns same also we can do it let's try
to shape it into reshape into some where
dimension which do not fit this 28
number correctly so let's do it this way
so it has thrown as error because the
size is in mismatching so we are trying
to accumulating this 28 number into 12
element array
so size is mismatching buddy instead of
six if you put 14 then it will create
the two rows and fourteen columns array
okay so this is all about reshaping and
how you can access the individual
elements of an array let's see how what
are the different operations we can
perform on the top of it so basic
operations like Max min kind of thing so
we already have a brand new array of Y
right okay let's let's reshape of I
reshape to four cross seven okay so
let's pray and it has a four cross seven
now suppose we want to find the maximum
value out of this array so just need to
provide with Max position his argument
okay so it has spring take the twenty
seven for us the same way we want to
find the minimum value it should print a
zero so out of all this element
contained independent of rows and
columns whatever numbers of elements are
there it will find a Max and min value
out of them so and this is independent
of any dimension now suppose along the
rows only we want a maximum value so
let's see how we can do it I log the row
now if you want to find along the row so
the maximum value so it should give
reason like a six thirteen twenty twenty
seven so this is the dimension exists
this is equal to one so across all all
row it will try to find the maximum
value so see it has
at 613 2027 the same way if we want a
same thing across the column occurs the
column so it should paint total seven
value because we have a total the seven
value and for the column we need to
provide X is zero X is equal to zero
so it should print 21 22 23 24 so in
this way same operation we can perform
on Macs or mean with the help of X is
also ok so these are related to max how
to find Max and min let's see how how we
can find the argument of maximum and
minimum so in P dot argument maximum so
at which indexing position we have a
maximum number is available
so it has printed 27 because at the
location trend indexing 27 we have a
maximum value basically now the same
thing suppose we want across the all
columns so if you see across the all
columns there is a 0 1 2 3 the third
quarter row so every column in which the
3rd row has having a maximum value the
same way you can perform ah where the
minimum occurs in your
so it is at a zero location so this way
we can perform how where your maximum
and minimum occurs into array let's see
what are the other things we can do with
the basic of another basic other basic
operation we can perform so let's see
how simple vector or matrix related add
subtract we can perform on the top of it
okay
so let's create a one brand new array of
NPD range 9 cross reshaped
3 cross 3 same way we can perform so we
have a to worry of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 now
suppose we we need to do the addition of
this two matrices they simply write a
plus B and it will do all parallelism
for us a minus B will perform all
element 2 element wise subsection a
multiplication of B will perform element
by element wise multiplication so these
are all operation is the element by
element wise now suppose we want to do a
kind of matrix multiplication or matrix
après matrix multiplication or matrix
kind of dot products and all those
things so let us create we have already
a is equal to and B is also what's
similar okay now we want to perform the
matrix manipulation so numpy package is
giving one dot functionality and what is
having dimension 3 cross 3 so in output
of matrix multiplication it will result
in a 3 cross 3 array to us so
okay so it has immediately given us the
3 cross 3 array so this way we can
perform a lot of basic operation on the
numpy er frankly speaking friends this
is a very faster matrix manipulation
library comfort - built-in Python
functionality whatever is available
rather than using for loop and it
created over across all element it just
paralyzing all those element and in a
parallel way it will do all those
calculation for us so I hope you enjoyed
