lecture series on machine learning into
question and answer so in this tutorial
we are going to see about the question
how is KN and different from the K means
first of all these are the two different
machine learning algorithm so let us try
to understand the difference between
these two algorithm let's not confuse
with the K word the very key initial the
very key later associated with both of
this name KN n and came in so first of
all key means K nearest neighbor
algorithm and key means means k-means
clustering algorithm so let's try to
highlight the difference between these
two so first of all k-means is the
unsupervised learning algorithm and
unsupervised by nature whereas the KN
and algorithms are supervised algal
curriculum supervised learning algorithm
I have already created a video on what
is the difference between unsupervised
learning algorithm and supervised
learning algorithm so that I will give
link into description you can go and
watch it out as it is a unsupervised
algorithm it's a clustering algorithm
category you can put it where as gain an
algorithm you can put it into
classification or regression based
algorithm as k-means algorithm is
unsupervised it do not require no label
required whereas in KN v wire label it
because it requires it is useful for the
classification
so these are the main three differences
between the k-means classification
algorithm and X K means clustering
algorithm and KN and classification or
regression algorithm so let's try to
understand the functionality or a basic
behavior for both of them so for both
the algorithm I have listed some of the
data so with the help of data I will try
to explain that what this key means is
and what this kanan and how the KNN came
in smokes so let's try to display it in
a scatter plots form X so I have listed
this data in a XY pair comma forming so
one feature is X and another feature is
Y and we will plot it into
two-dimensional coordinate geometry so
let's try to display it in a scatter
plot format okay so it has nicely
displayed all those data for us so
horizontal axis is X and vertical axis
is the Y so you can see that how this
gaming's algorithm k-means clustering
algorithm will do it is unsupervised
learning and learning algorithm and it
is a clustering algorithm and there is
no label associated with individual
records so we have just X comma Y pair
of valuing so what it will do by looking
at the data you can imagine that it will
try to form the cluster one cluster it
will try to form here another cluster it
will try to form here so that is how K
means clustering algorithm we form the
homogeneous of cluster for form the
cluster based on the homogeneity of the
data but it has no label associated with
individual record it just forms the
cluster same way let's try to see the
knn algorithm let's create a graph
scatter scatter graph
okay okay so KNN is a key nearest
neighbor algorithm so every single
record has been associated with some
label I haven't listed label well let's
keep it like a I'll shift it here I
think in LLC videos so remember this is
a key NN and this is a came in so this
is per Kanan I write it with a 1 0 1 1 1
0 1 0 and 1 so there are some of the
records are associated in class 1 and
some of the record also said in class 2
and I have already plotted those X comma
Y pair value in a two dimensional
coordinate geometry now we have a query
point for T comma 16 so for T comma 6 is
somewhere around here
so this label this data point is nothing
but our query points so I will write as
a different answer this is a query point
query data and our task is to find that
with well or in which class this
particular 0.4 t comma 6 t belongs to
whether it belongs to class 0 or whether
it belongs to class 1 so how this K
nearest neighbor will work it will try
to calculate the distance of this point
with respect to all remaining point in
the data space and it will find that K
nearest neighbors so key can be anything
you can put the K is equal to like a one
two or even a 5 so let's take a K is
equal to 5 our K is equal to let us take
for simplicity 3 so with respect to this
point which is nothing but our query
point these three points are nearest so
somewhere this point this point and this
point so this is lying around
3234 and a 42 so you can see 32 34 and
42 so out of that all are discrete
nearest neighbors means three cane and
it becomes like a tree KN and three
nearest neighbors the two nearest
neighbor belongs to group one and one
nearest neighbor belongs to group zero
so majority will win so we will classify
it as a belongs to class one so this way
a key nearest neighbor algorithms are
the supervised class of algorithm or its
classification algorithm it is trying to
classify whether particular data point
or query point belongs to this class or
any other class it there can be a more
than two class also possible so this is
the basic working of the k-means
clustering algorithm and a KNN
classification or regression algorithm
so and these are the basic differences
between a game in cenic knn algorithm
unsupervised another is a supervised
clustering or classification one do not
require a label another require a label
so that's it for this lecture friends so
I hope to enjoy listening this video if
you do not understand anything please
