lecture series on data analysis with
help of Python finders library so in
this tutorial we are going to see about
how one can remove the duplicate data
available inside your data segment so
let's see how we can do it so for that
we are going to see the two different
scenario how we can drop the duplicate
data along the whole row and how one can
look drop the duplicate data with
respect to some particular column so for
that I have already created the sample
data frame data sets and I have made the
necessary imports so I have created one
data frame option now let me just run it
and display the data frame so let's just
display see what are the data's are
there and how we can apply the drop
duplicate function on the top of this
data frame so if you carefully observe
this data frame it has a two columns C 1
and C 2 and the first column contains
all numbers written in a verse so 1 1 1
1 1 so echo along the first 4 row the
Sieben column he is almost repeated and
afterwards there is a three more rows
whose value is 2 so this is also
repeated two times so there is only two
unique value across the column C 1 if
you observe this column C 2 there is a 1
1 2 2 3 3 and a 4 so 2 value
corresponding to 1 2 value corresponding
to 2 3 2 value corresponding to 3 and
one value corresponding to 4 so there
are 4 unique value 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 and apart
from for all other values are repeated
at least once
now let's see how we can apply this drop
duplicate along the whole road
so pandas will provide him drop
underscore duplicate functionality which
will do the dropping across the whole
row now how it will decide that whether
this corresponding row is duplicated or
not so it will just start checking with
the first row second row the moment it
finds the exit duplication of the data
across the both the row or across the
all row
all columns available so if you see this
one and one the second is one in one so
definitely should discard this now again
one in two but only column c1 is
repeated column c2 is not repeated so it
will consider it as a different records
so it won't drop it now again 1 in 2 so
1 in 2 is already came here so it will
drop it now let's see how what are the
results will come okay so it has
discarded the first record because one
and one is replicated now 2 and third
record also it has discarded so 1 and 2
which is discarded for 4 it has taken
into account and fifth has been
discarded because 2 &amp;amp; 3 is already
repeated but sixth one it has not
discarded because it has not come
earlier
so while dropping the duplicate it will
just search for exit value across all
the columns available in a dataframe
even all the values of each and every
column has an exit match with the
earlier records then only it will
duplicate but this is with searching for
each and every column now let's see how
one can drop to duplicate with respect
to some particular column so before did
let me just spring this in DF so you can
make good comparison with respect to our
drop duplicate output
so suppose we want to drop with respect
to just C 1 so C 1 has just the two
unique value so it should give the
output only two records so for that
we'll just supply the list of value and
the column name as a list so what it
will do it will do the dropping of all
records with respect to the column C 1
so it won't taken into account the
column C 2 only with respect to C 1 it
is just calculate whether that
particular record exists earlier or not
so let's see a very first record is 1 so
it has no dis just first record so we'll
put it into over a bucket list now
second is 1 it is repeated so it will
just simply discard it it won't just
compare the with respect to the column C
to the second record one in two again
one is repeated even if 2 is not
repeated earlier it won't take into
account so 1 is repeated so it will
discard this second record also in a
third record also 1 2 again it will
discard because 1 is already we have
taken into basket now - now - w 8 2 is
has not came earlier with respect to
column C 1 so it will put it inside the
bucket list now - again it will discard
this fifth record because 2 is already
available 2 is again available in a 6
records so it will discard it so with
respect to C 1 let's see how what are
the results will come okay so as per our
expectation we have got a 2 result 1 and
2 the 0th record and fourth record
because it will just compare with
respect to the C 1 column so this one
and this one so one and one and two and
three two and three so we got the zeroth
record enough for the record now this is
with respect to c1 now let's see with
respect to C - another column what
results we'll get it okay
so with respect to C - there are four
unique values so we have got already
four values one two three and four the
second record is repeated because that's
how it is discarding this third record
is also dedicated third record means the
index is having a value three then 50
record is also they repeated so it has
discarded it so zero two four and six so
if you observe with zero two four and
six it is having a non repeated value
one two three and four with respect to
column c2 so it has not discarded it the
remaining all value it has discarded
with respect to c1 so till now we have
seen that how you can drop the duplicate
value across the all the columns means
across the particular along the whole
row means I cross the whole column or
with respect to particular column c1 or
c2 now suppose we want to drop duplicate
with respect to multiple columns so you
same way you can supply multiple values
as array C 1 and C 2 so we have got 0 2
4 &amp;amp; 6th record which we exactly get it
here without supplying any kind of
argument because we have just two column
in case we have a more than or two
columns and if we have supplied the our
result might have been different but
here we are going to make a comparison
and we are
dropping the duplicate we live with
respect to column c1 and c2 and as we
have just the two column c1 and c2 so it
will just exactly be here as this
functionality drop duplicate without any
argument so that way you can make a
comparison with respect to multiple
columns also so that's it for this
