first two bytes out of the request and
we left off having taken the third and
fourth bite out of the request and when
you're going to pass it to our gap flags
function so we need to go up here and we
need to create that function and we're
going to pass it the variable called
flags which is equal to the third and
fourth bite out of the request so we're
back on the RFC and you can see the
flags are this line here this is two
bytes so we're gonna start in the first
bit which is QR and that first bit tells
the NS whether it's a query or a
response if it's a query it's a zero if
it's a response it's a 1 so we are gonna
set that by saying our Flags is equal to
an empty string so that stands for
response flags and it's an empty string
and we say at QR is equal to 1 because
the first bit of the flags of every
response we ever sent will be a 1 next
we have the opcode this is going to be
either standard query inverse query or
status request or any other number where
we reserved for future use so we're
going to always say that that is equal
to 0 so the OP code as you can see here
is taken from the original query and is
copied into the response so we need to
get that from the original query so the
way we do that is we're going to create
two variables we're going to call one
byte one and we're going to call one
byte
two
but one is going to be equal to flags
and here what we want to do is set flags
: 1 because we want to go from the 0th
index to the first index so then we say
it by 2 is equal to flags and we want to
pass it 1 2 because we want to start the
bite with the index of 1 and we want to
end on the bait with you next of to you
and what we want to do is convert this
into a bite so we use pythons special
bites function to convert it to a bites
object and we want to do that for a bite
to as well so now we've extracted bites
1 and bites two from the flag's variable
and flag the flags variable only
contains two bites and if we go back to
the RFC we can see that the data stored
in bite 1 is this data here it starts on
bite it starts on the zeroth bit and it
goes to the seventh bit and from the 8th
bit onwards we're getting the second
bite so our first bite will contain this
so that means our opcode is stored in
our first bite and we've already set the
first bit of the response and that means
we want to get the third fourth fifth
and sixth bit out of the first bite so
to do this what we're going to do is run
a sail opcode is equal to an empty
string and then we're going to create a
for loop we're gonna set for bit and
range because we're we're operating on
individual bits now and we're gonna send
the range of 1 to 5 I will just print
that out initially so print bit and
let's just run this you can see we got 1
2 3 4 and if we go back to the opcode it
is 4 bits long so now we have a for loop
that's running four times which means we
can get the four bits that make up the
opcode so now that we've got our for
loop to run four times what we want to
do is we want to say opcode plus equals
to app and onto the string and then what
we want to do is want to say Ord bite 1
to convert bite 1 from a bite into an
integer then we want to do a bitwise
operation in Python which is an and and
then onto that bitwise operation we want
to put another pair of parentheses and
we want to then we want to do a bit
shift operation on the number 1 and the
bit we're actually and locking out.i we
want to say 1 bit shift and I'm gonna
say bit and we're going to convert this
to a string
using pythons STR function this probably
doesn't make any sense in a minute so
I'll explain it so we're gonna start off
with the and operation so say for
example we had two numbers this is the
left-hand side of the operation this is
the right-hand side what the and
operator does is it checks a bit to see
if 2 1 or a 0 and if it's a 1 on the
left hand side under 1 on the right hand
side the output will also be a 1 so the
output of this would be the left-hand
side this is a 1 this is 0 so the IPOP
would be a 0 for the first bit the
second bit would also be a 0 because the
left hand side on the right hand side
are not both ones the next bit would be
a 1 because they're both ones that will
be a 0 then you would have 0 0 0 0 so we
can check that if we just go to python
we say python 3 and here we just say 180
on one side then we use the and
operation we say 104 and we get 32 and
that is the correct output so that's the
and operation and the next thing you're
probably wondering is what is this bit
shift operation so the bit shift
operation essentially just moves the
bits over one to the left so for example
here is our number 32 if I did a bit
shift that I moved and I said something
like 32 bit shift to what I'll do is it
will push all of these bits two to the
left so it will say take this string and
it will delete the first two bits and
append them on to the end so we forgot a
Python we said been to convert it to a
binary and we say 32-bit shift - you can
see that's the output we get that's what
we expect
so the reason we're using the bit shift
operator here is because this is because
we can use a trick to check each
individual bit inside of bite so what we
do that is we would say if I had a bite
say the number 50 I can convert that to
binary I can say 50 and I can check each
individual bit in this byte by saying 50
and zero so if I say this what it will
do is it will give me this first bit and
it will be a zero you can see it I
putted zero the OB the zero B is just
pythons way of telling you it to the
binary number so it says zero if I run
this again I change this to a 2 as you
can see up here it says one zero because
if we look up here it's the second byte
is a 1 if we run it again and we use 4
which is in the next multiple we run
that we get a zero because the next byte
is zero and if we go up again
we'll get we run this we set it will get
another zero we run it again we get 16
and this byte isn't 1 and we get 1 I
didn't see we can go all the way up and
we can check each individual bit the
reason why we did the bit shift is
because if we look up here you can see
one bit shift 1 is equal to 2 one bit
shift 2 is equal to 4 one bit shift 3 is
equal to it and you can see that it just
goes up in the multiples that we just
did down here so every time I for loop
runs the value of bit is increase by one
so it says the first time it runs bit is
a 1 then it's a two that it's a 3 then
it's a 4 and if we go back to here you
can see one bit is a 3 that means we're
gonna get the number it when we shift it
one bit to the left which means we can
check the fourth bit because this will
be in it and then we'll have our number
which was whatever the number of our
byte one is which means we can check
each individual bit so that's
essentially what we're doing and then
what we're doing is we're checking it
we're getting the I put on if it's a
zero then opcode gets a zero up handed
onto it if it's a one off cooking it's a
one up handed onto it we need to get the
rest of our flags so if we go back to
the RFC use the after opcode we have
authoritative answer that's always going
to be a 1 so we're just going to set a
is equal to a 1 the reason we're using
the word a is because that's how it's
abbreviated in the RFC after that we
have TC which means truncation and since
we're only dealing with short messages
we're going to assume it's never
trunculus we're gonna set TC is equal to
0 and finally we're going to say Rd is
also equal to 0
our day as if recursion is desired this
is supposed to be retrieved from the
query but because we're not going to
support recursion we're just going to
assume it's always a zero and we're just
going to send it as a zero in our
response so that's our first byte done
if we go back to the RFC you can see the
second byte has three items in it the RA
is recursion available and that's going
to be a zero so we're just going to say
RA is equal to zero then we have the Zed
which is just reserved for future use if
we go up here you can see Zed this is
just three bits that are reserved for
future use and then we have response
code and response code is always going
to be a zero we're not going to send
other kinds of response codes so we say
a Zed is equal to zero zero zero and
then we're going to say our code for
response code is equal to 0 0 0 0 that
is equal to 3 zeros because that is 3
bits response code is equal to 4 zeros
because it's 4 bits so now what we want
to do is return these flags
so we'll say it returned and then we'll
just append all the strings together
we'll say QR is the first one then we'll
say opcode plus a plus TC plus Rd that
is our first byte then what we want to
do is convert these to an integer and
then we want to say that we're using ps2
at the minute because they're binary and
then what we want to do is convert them
to a byte by saying two bytes then we
want to say we want to use one byte and
then we want to give it a byte order
equal to big the byte order doesn't
matter because we're only using one byte
as if we were using multiple bytes the
byte order would be important everyone
up and on our second byte which is going
to be equal to RA plus Z plus our code
that's the second byte that make up on
flags convert these to an integer again
we're using ps2 for binary and then
we're going to convert them to bytes
we're gonna create one byte then we're
going to set byte order equals big then
what we're gonna do is we're going to go
down here we're going to say print flags
we're going to run this and we're gonna
send it a request and you can see we get
two bytes returned we get eighty four
and we get zero zero that probably
doesn't mean anything but that is
actually the correct response we want
that is the decimal conversion of the
flags we wanted a set so in this video
we created our flags and we use binary
operations we use the bit shift
operation and we used the binary and
operations and those are probably two
most difficult parts of this whole
series so those are done in they're out
of the way in the next part we're going
to be finishing off the header section
of our request which is way more
difficult on the rest of the request and
with the question count on the answer
kind so that's it for this video don't
