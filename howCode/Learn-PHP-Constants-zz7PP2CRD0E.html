learning about is constants in PHP so
what a constant is is it's a value that
doesn't change right throughout the
entire script it's sort of similar to a
variable except you can't change it at
all and it has a global scope throughout
the entire script no matter where you
create it so let's look at an example so
to create a constant we use the define
function we use it like this we said
define and we give it the constant name
so I'm going to say hello then we give
it the value which is the second
parameter and I'm going to say hello
world
so now if I echo hello I can see I'll
get the words hello world printed to the
screen
and you'll also notice that I didn't put
a dollar sign in front of it because
this isn't a variable this is a constant
a constant doesn't change throughout the
entire script and its global which means
that no matter how big your project is a
word you create it and you can use it
anywhere in any file in your script so
long as they're all included so if I had
a header file and I created this in the
header file and then I included the
header file on any other page I could
use this constant throughout the whole
script so there's two types of constants
there's there's case-insensitive
constants and there's case sensitive
ones so I can say this is a case
sensitive constant if I use the word
hello with no capitals it gives me an
error so if I want to make this constant
case insensitive I give it a third value
and I say it true so i refresh now as
you can see it gives me the word hello
world again a constant can also start
with an underscore so I start this with
an underscore and I put an underscore
there I can see nothing changed because
an underscore is a valid character for a
constant a constant can't start with a
number so as you see if I put a 1 in
front of it
and then I want in front of here I'll
just say it gives me an error so
counseling can only begin with an
underscore or a ladder and it can be
case sensitive or case insensitive
depending on whether you provide the
true value or you could just provide the
false value and I will get an error so
that's been a short introduction to
constants in HP so thanks for watching
