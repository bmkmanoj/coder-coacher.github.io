you one of the newest features Iniesta
BC so alongside all the new domain names
are available as actually loads of them
now es de vc also supports domain name
transfers so you can register a dar es
de vc domain name and transfer that to
whoever you want who also has any swc ok
so I'm going to show you how to do that
in this video so what I'm going to do is
going to register one of the new domains
web data swc and i'm going to register
francis dog wagged at eswc so if I click
register domain name you can see it's as
good news that domain is available if I
click register and I register that
and it loads that we have it I've
register that domain name so here I have
a couple of new options I can click my
domains which just takes me to the page
of mom I go to me and transfers I can
transfer to me and register a new one
log out and I can join the original
stuff so I could do me in transfers now
you can see I've already transferred out
one domain name the first time I try I
transferred it I council it and the
second time I did it all the way through
just so that I could check that it
worked obviously so there's the domain
I've transferred out before I transfer
that to a different account and here's
transfers in so I have not actually
received any domain names on this
account so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to transfer a domain here is a
page where i can transfer any domain
name i have registered so if i click
here you can say only have one option
because if only registered 12 min so you
can see here it says enter the email
address of the user you want to transfer
little me into so if i type in francis
at high code.org
and click transfer domain name before I
click transfer
just make sure to read this it says when
you transfer domain name you transfer
control of the domain name you cannot
reverse a transfer unless the user who
transferred the domain name decisive
transfer the knee and back to your
current if you transfer a domain name
and error you need to cancel the
transfer before it is accepted or you
would lose to do mean so what that
basically means is when you click
transfer domain name you have until the
person accepts it'll medium to council
it if the person accepts the transfer
you can't console it you can't take the
dubian back if they cancel the transfer
you keep the domain if you cancel it you
keep the domain but if they accept the
transfer they get the Dominion and then
it is removed to be our continents
transferred into their account to then
they have complete control over
everything to do with the knee so they
own them today and will not domain name
so what I'll do is I click transfer
domain miam it says transfer request
successful it says transfer request
successful because you can't actually
transfer a domain name straight way to
someone's account that person has to go
into their cart and accept the transfer
for to be complete so at the moment if i
go to domain transfers you'll see i have
a transfer itthat's padding and here's
my domain it's in blue because it's
pending and if I put Counsell no I just
actually consulate you'll see it will
change to red and it will say cancelled
so that domain names transfer has
counseled know and i am still own the
domain if i go back to my domains you
can see it's still here and it's not
going anywhere so what I'll do is I'll
transfer at nine so if i go to francis
at how code org when i click transfer
domain name you can see it says transfer
request successful if i try to click it
again you'll see i transfer is already
pending flat to mean so you can only
have one transfer you can only have a
transfer request pending to one domain
at a time
so what we'll do now is I will go to the
current here is my mannequin this is the
crowd I used to write to em reserved
domain names so if i wanted to reserve
for example food on each WC i had to
register it first so that um it was
reserved and here's how I've reserved
them so if i go to do me in transfers i
can look at a pending transfer in you
can see here is a transfer in that's
patting here's the current one here's
the previous one that I counseled and
here's the other two well the first one
counts of the first one completed the
second this is there today as when it's
council does the first one and this is
the today's panting one so if I click
accept know what it will do is it'll
transfer them into my account says no
Test complete if I click transfer whoops
if I click my toe means it says 60 out
of 25 registered the only reason might
said 60s because of 62 means because
well I mean it so I can register as many
as I want if anyone wants to register
more than 25 just let me know when I'll
increase your limit as well so if i
scroll all the way to the bottom you can
see there's the new domain name fries
and sweaty SVC
and if i go to join me in my domains you
can see it says you don't have any
demands yet that's because they told me
and i had is now been transferred and
it's completely god the other person's a
kind it's not mine anymore I gajillion
transfers out you can see the transfer
was completed so the reason I created
this feature for us the VC is because
since the mediums don't expire and then
if someone registers are dominium they
have nowhere to give it to anyone else
without giving them their complete
control of their current so what this
does is it allows you to if you want to
Saladin esto vc to me anymore you want
to give us somebody else's account
without letting them have your card then
you can do so so I'm going to transfer
this domain name back so if i go back to
chrome and I go up to transfer domain
you can see here is the CMP edge again
but if I click on this all the way at
the bottom you can see there max you
can't see it because off the screen but
there's the domain in the process that
web dirtiest IVC what I will do is I
will transfer it back what i'll do is i
will just piss in the email address of
the user i want to send it back to i
click transfer domain name it says
transfer request successful remember
that's only book that's one of the
request has been sanded hikes and
actually been transferred yet to finish
the transfer what I do is I go back to
the other account i click on domain
transfers again to refresh the page you
can see here is it'll be in transfer and
it's pending in I click accept it's
complete now I go to my dominions and
you can see now it's as one of 25 to
means registered and if i go back to
Chrome on refresh my domain spy agency
nights is 59 instead of 60 so that's it
