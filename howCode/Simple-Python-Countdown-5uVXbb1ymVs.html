learning how to create a really simple
Python countdown so it's going to create
a 24-hour clock that's going to count
down to a specific time that we set so
here's our Python program and if I put
in for example 10 seconds I hit enter
you can see it gives us the number of
hours the number of minutes in the
number of seconds and you can see now
it's just counting down I just start
printing it out on a new line it's just
printing it out and overriding itself
over and over again and then once the
countdown is finished it disappears and
then we can type another time and we
could say 5 seconds and then you can see
a countdown
expect so this is quite a simple
tutorial but it goes over some stuff
that's quite useful for example if I put
in 60 seconds but you can see it's able
to convert from seconds into as many
seconds minutes and hours as we need
we're also going to be going over how to
print something onto the screen and that
overwrite it so that we're not having to
print all the times out on a new line so
let's get started so the first thing we
have to do is we have to create a loop
so this is just our program loop that
runs in the background that means we can
keep providing more and more input we're
going to create a variable called un and
it's going to be equal to the input and
that's how we're going to grab the input
from the user
next we're going to try to convert that
input into a number so we're just going
to say when to stop is equal to the
absolute value of the integer that we
answered earlier and then we're going to
first capture keyboard interrupts break
out of the loop which will close our
program and if we don't get a keyboard
interrupt we're just going to assume
that the number wasn't a number so we're
just going to say a number next we're
just going to create another loop and
this loop is going to say while when to
stop is greater than zero so this is
going to be our actual counting down
method we're just going to say when to
stop - equals one just to subtract one
from that so that we can actually do the
countdown and what we're going to do is
we're going to print out when to stop
now if I just run this I put in a number
say ten you can see it prints out all
the numbers down from ten to one but it
doesn't actually count down one per
second and it doesn't keep the one one
nine so the first thing you want to do
is we're going to work out how many
minutes and seconds
our seconds get converted into so we're
going to use the div mod function to
divide the number of seconds which is
our when to stop variable by 60 to work
out the number of minutes and we're
going to store the number of minutes on
the number of seconds in two variables
next we're going to do the same thing
for hours we're going to store the
number of hours and minutes we're going
to do that by saying div mod and we're
going to divide n by 60 now if I print
that is we print out STR hitch
and
and as now if we save that and run it
you can see we got our countdown what we
also want to do is keep the leading zero
so to do that what we want to do is
scroll down and say str HZ d fo just
pass in two Zaid fill two again because
we want two columns to be taken up see
that run that I know you can see we get
the proper format but we're still taking
more than one line and our content isn't
going down one per second like it should
so we can slow our countdown by
importing the time module and after we
print out our I put we can just their
time dot sleep and we can make it sleep
for one second
see that and run it
and now you can see we're getting the
countdown as you'd expect but it's still
not on one lane so it affects that
always to do is go back into our program
and instead of printing out this string
we're going to copy that and we're going
to store it in a variable called time
left and then we're going to print out
time left but we're going to remove the
newline that print automatically puts in
for us so to do that we just set and
equals and we just passed in an empty
string and what we want to do is want to
use the carriage return character to
return to the start of the line after we
print out a certain time that way we can
return to the start of the line and
overwrite it because if we save this so
you can see when we run that we just get
all of the dates printed out on one line
so to fix that what we want to do is
want to put in a carriage return so if
we save that what does it return us to
the start of the line so if I put in any
number and run it now you can see it's
overriding itself
so we're putting in the cars return
what's going to happen is instead of
going to a new line which is backslash
and it's going to go back to the
beginning of the current line that's on
and it's going to overwrite what was
already in that line and we're going to
put in and we're going to just print out
a new line at the bottom we're going to
save that and now if we run this I'm
just going to put in something like five
seconds to begin with
and now you can see our current
I put in something even longer say
86,400 which is the number of seconds in
a day hit enter you can see there we go
with counting down 23 hours 59 minutes
55 seconds remaining so that's how we
create a really simple current time
function in Python you could really
easily extend this you could get it to
current go into a specific date all you
have to do is get the user to answer a
dear and get Python to convert down into
seconds and then pass it to the function
we've just created and then you would
have a count down to any date in the
future that you want but that's it for
