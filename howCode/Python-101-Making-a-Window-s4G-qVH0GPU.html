you can see it's a wee bit different to
the regular videos that's because I
thought of a new way to explain things
that's easier to explain than using text
it's easier to draw diagrams and with
colors and things than it is to explain
certain concepts in just plain text so
that's the reason behind it if you like
it I just let me know if you don't like
it just also let me know and I will get
rid of it but let's get into the actual
tutorial so today we're going to be
learning about is creating a window in
Python but before we do that I need to
go over some things I forgot to go over
in the first only first videos over the
series so the first thing we had need to
go over is how a Python program runs so
people think a traditional program runs
like this say it goes program and then
we are a man processor and if you know
anything about computers you might also
know there's also a layer that the
processor just doesn't just run a
program it gets converted and there's
something called binary first this goes
in between here the program on the
processor but that is true for certain
languages so for a language like say
it's true for C++ it's true any other
language is this I don't know what I
don't know all of them but for a
language like Python that's not true so
the way Python program runs is we go
program and we go program then we draw
an arrow and then we say add pipe code
which is just sort of a special language
that the Python interpreter understands
so it's sort of just like instructions
the next thing we do is we go
interpreter oops wrong
so interpreter and then we go can bad
processor okay so as wrong color but
doesn't matter so here is how a Python
program runs basically so the reason I
told you all this is because that way
you'll know that every single thing that
gets created in Python is run inside the
Python interpreter so it's sort of like
an extra layer between the program on
the computer so if you thought of it
like this if you wrote a program in C
and then you would just go with the
steps like sort of the layers of the
program would be program and would be
the first layer then underneath that
would be binary and then underneath that
is processor I suppose you could come
and sort of combine processor and binary
so I just write processor here and we
could theoretically just combine these
because they're asking the same thing
but in Python it's different so in
Python oops
Python the way the program runs is
program then the layer on mini thought
is byte code
whoops at byte I know I stopped by wrong
but it doesn't matter that underneath
that is interpreter
then underneath that is binary then
underneath that would be processor oops
sorry
I'll just undo that so these are all the
layers of a Python program can part of C
program which is why you could as you
can imagine it's probably slower to run
and we could combine these two as well
because they are the same thing so as
you can see the only real difference is
this layer here I'll just do this
because it's a different color so this
layer is what makes a Python program
different to a C program there's also
two as other things that make it
different because the two different
types of languages that pythons
interpreted and C is compiled when I
will go onto the next set of videos so
that's what we need to know and if we go
to here I'm just to write anything
simple so it doesn't matter what I do if
I was to set print hello world this
since it's written in Python is and that
means this runs inside the Python
interpreter and I'm not is this the same
can be said for anything written in
Python so this is what I'm trying to get
onto which is when new application so
goodies so here's our give a here's our
window and we'll just color it in to
make it a bit easier to see there's our
window we have a red X button on the
yellow button I think and then it goes
green so this is our window one we have
in here we have content so this is how
it appears to the user but behind the
scenes this is still running inside of
the Python interpreter so that means we
still have the same structure I showed
earlier with the layers
so anything inside the blue circle is
inside the Python interpreter well it's
about the ROM sorry interpreter so
anything inside blue is in the end runs
inside the interpreter and what this
means basically is it just means that
all of our programs basically run within
a program so if you can think of say
again so say is here say program just
basically goes program oops a program
and basically this is it
it runs like that so it's just it's sort
of on its own the Python sort of goes
like this so we have program now we can
surround it in green then we have above
that I'll just do this in yellow
interpreter okay and then this sort of
is surrounded by as well so that's sort
of the difference between an auburn
convential sort of c program on a python
program and well that's all we need to
know before you get started so that's it
let's get started okay so now we've got
that a long introduction out of the way
it's time to actually start programming
and make this an actual programming
tutorial so as you can see I'm in the a
Python and text editor the idle thing
and I got a file called take int or
tanker or whatever it's called dot pi
and we're going to be using it to create
just a simple window with Python on the
tinker or whatever module so let's get
started so a with it just like any other
a Python them module we just have to
import it so we can just say from T
kinter or whatever it's called import
all and I'll just import the add module
for using goodies in Python the next
thing we need to do is use going to
create a variable called up or whatever
we want to call it doesn't matter I will
just call it TK so this what this does
is it just sets up like the add TK
interface like tip there sorry the add
tanker interface
I can't provides that so now we've done
that the next thing we need to do is I
create the main loop so we just go to
app dot me and loop and there we have
our me and loop created
so what we're going to do now is we're
just going to run this and here we have
website over to this see I just push it
all the way so as you can see we have
our window and as I said earlier this
all runs inside the a Python interpreter
which is why when I try to close this
Python shell it says your program still
running and this will kill the window as
well so I just run that again I actually
and just push this away so here's our
window and we can do everything we can
with a normal window it just works fine
so what we're going to do is we're going
to create a title for the window okay so
to create a title that's really simple
all we have to do is type up dot title
and then give it a title so in here we
just create a string that is the title
of whatever windows going to be so we
can just say my window
I don't know ever my window made with
Python so there we have then we have
we've done and create our title and if
we head out five to run this just let it
run here we have our window so I'll just
get rid of this and as you can see it
says my window made with Python is the
title so we'll close that and we'll
close the interpreter and the next thing
we do is we're just going to put a label
on it so that's really simple but we
have to put it inside the main loop just
that I thought we laid out because the
main leaves the last thing we are set up
so what we're going to do is we're just
going to create a variable called me
double equals label is like a function
inside of the GUI library so what we
want to do is we want to say where we
want to put the label which in our case
is up because that's our window and what
we wanted to say so we want a label to
say we get what we tell earlier but we
tell our Python we want the label to
share with the text parameter and we
just say this is the for I don't know
this is my python level but and okay now
if we hit f5 and let this run you'll see
there's nothing there it's completely
empty and that's because we have to
actually add the atom into the window we
don't have to add the title because it's
not actually in the content area of the
window but we have to add a label so
that's simple all we do is we type in
label dot pack with anji parameters and
now if we add our five we can see here's
our label so if we scroll this around we
can see the labels here I might have
fault it gets positioned in the center
of the window so that's it for this
video don't forget to Like favorite
comment and subscribe and as I said
before and if you like the new intro let
me know so I'll keep it if you don't
like it let me know and I'll get rid of
it and if you think it's a good idea
that I should use 4x
more things just let me know again and
that's and I'll do so thanks for
watching don't forget to Like favorite
