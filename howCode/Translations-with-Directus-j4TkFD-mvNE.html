learning about a feature interactive the
lots of store transitions of data in our
tables so this will be really useful if
you run something like a blog so say for
example on your blog the most popular
language is English but the second most
popular language that people speak is
Spanish you might want to store Spanish
alongside the English version of your
blog post so that readers who speak
Spanish will read your blog as well and
it's actually really easy to set up and
direct us so to set it up what we're
going to do is we're going to create
some tables
so the first table we're going to create
is going to be a languages table and
it's going to store the languages we
store translations for so I turned off
status and I'm going to call this table
languages so if I save that now we have
our language is table and we're going to
be using direct is's relational
translation interface to store our
translations and link them to our posts
and it's really simple to set that up so
after creating the languages table we
want to go into it and we want to create
a column to store the language name so
I'm going to call it language and I'm
just going to save that now in the
languages table I'm going to add some
languages so the first language is going
to be English
second language is going to be Spanish
and the third language is going to be
French so we're storing three languages
and now we want to do is create our
table to store our posts so we're going
to turn off the status column for that
as well
and we're gonna click OK so we have our
posts table now we're also going to do
is create another table called posts
underscore translations turn off status
again on this table is going to store
the translations and it's called posts
translations because we're storing the
translations for the posts table so
we're just using the name of the table
underscore translations so we click OK
now what we want to do is we want to add
some data to our posts table so to this
table we're going to create a title
column and we're gonna save that that's
going to be for the title of our posts
next we're going to go into our posts
translations table and we're going to
first store the ID of the posts that the
translation corresponds to so in that
case it's going to be post underscore ID
it's going to be a numeric and we're
going to save that
we're gonna store the ID of the language
in the languages table so we're going to
call it language ID that's going to
store the ID of the language other
translation is written in next want to
create a column called body that's gonna
store the actual post itself and it's
going to be a text area and we're gonna
see if that so next all we have to do to
get this set up is go back into our
tables go into our posts table and we
have to create a new column to link the
translations so we're going to call this
column translations and we're going to
scroll down and we're gonna use je
actresses relational translation
interface and we're going to link our
posts table to the post underscore
translations table and then what we're
going to do is we're going to link e the
ID column of the posts table to the post
underscore ID column in the post
translations table next we have to do is
we have to tell direct us the table
where we store the languages so that's
gonna be the languages table we store
the language name in the languages table
and a column called language the default
language is going to have an ID of one
because that's going to be English the
last column name is the column name that
points to the primary key in the
languages table and that column is
stored in the translations table and
that column is called language
underscore ID so if I save that so now
what we're going to do is we're going to
hide our post translations table because
this is a table that runs in the
background so if we scroll down we hide
it and we save that now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to create a post so
you can see here is a new post we have
no translations at the moment if I click
on this you can see we have English
Spanish and French to choose from and
I'm gonna call this post hello world
we're gonna save that now what we're
gonna do is add some text to the body of
our post and we're going to add some
translations so the first we're gonna
put in is English so it's gonna be hello
world next we're gonna put in Spanish
next we're going to put
French so there's our French translation
and we're also gonna put in Irish so
know what I'm going to do is I'm going
to save that so you can see we have four
translations so now if I click into
English you can see we have hello world
click on Spanish we have the Spanish
version we have the French version and
now we have the Irish version so that's
