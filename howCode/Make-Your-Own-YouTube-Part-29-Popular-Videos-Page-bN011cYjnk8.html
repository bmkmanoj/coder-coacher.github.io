we're going to be doing is we're going
to actually be going over to the popular
video with page we haven't actually made
it yet but we're going to be making that
today and we're going to be selecting
videos out of the database based on the
popularity so we're gonna judge
popularity based on the number of views
the video gets so let's get started so
if I go over to sublime text and I can
see I just were blank
I actually don't have anything open so
what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to
click on file new file and I'm gonna
call it popular dot PHP and then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to
open up let's just open up my video
speech I want to just going to copy
include header or the include function
that includes our header file and then
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna come into
our header and I'm going to just on a
link to the popular page
so in here I'm just going to change this
to popular dot PHP
so if i refresh this night and I click
on popular videos it takes us to the
page I just created so what I'm going to
do is when I create a MySQL query so
we're gonna say MySQL I don't actually
have get underscore videos equals MySQL
MySQL query and this is gonna say select
all from videos where let's say this is
my call from videos order by and instead
of saying order by ID as you might
sometimes say we're going to order it by
in views and then we have to say where
they want it to be ascending or
descending so I'm just gonna say
descending when you change these two
views okay and then we want to say is if
MySQL num rows get videos equals zero
then we want to say is that there are no
videos yeah and then we want to say
underneath this is else there are some
videos so let's refresh and what should
happen is we should see there are some
videos because we do have one video in
our database so then what we want to say
down here is we want to create a while
to get all the videos from the database
what we want to say is while I'm we're
just gonna create a viable whole row
equals mysql fetch associative alright
which is this function here I don't want
to say
get videos then we want to say is we
just want to create some variables so
the variable ID is gonna be equal to
Road and then we're gonna get the album
are like the the room is equal to the
row in the database and then the this
like square means that work the row is
actually an array and what we're doing
is we're creating more like access in
the array so we're getting the ID we're
on the database so for example here it
is here so we're gonna use we're getting
the ID variable or the ID value in this
case which is one someone want to do is
we're gonna copy and paste this a couple
of times that should be enough and then
we want to get the rest of them so the
first one is video title so a video
underscore title then we want to get is
video description so we're going to say
value on the score description then
obviously a video keywords then uploaded
by courtesy we actually don't need all
of these we're just finding it's the
mall for line and uploaded by views
video ID so we need a couple more and
then a video ID and then what we need is
let's see what else is Phi lambda v and
file location we don't actually need
them so we're just going to get
thumbnail intonated action which means
last two so we're gonna come down here
and just pisses in twice I'm gonna get
some Nia delete it
someone we need to do is you shouldn't
copy all these into the in between
square brackets because that's how we
access them inside of the rule array and
what this wild loop does is a prom
actually never explain is what the
wildlife does is it's it sort of creates
an array for every single row in the
database that we want to hype up and
then from that row that from the array
we've created with the while loop we um
I like sort of pulling information out
of it and then we store them in
variables and that's how we a can use it
on page okay so that should be it so
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to echo video underscore title this one
should be it I want should we just get
we should actually just get the one
video some fresh and we got test video
which is the one video we have in our
database so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to go to my videos and I'm going
to copy the - div so I'm just gonna
do that close the PHP block open a new
one
whoops I think is gonna piss this in and
when you change this to video one or
strong I'll copy that yes this under
that should be video keywords such a bit
for nah let's just refresh and see what
happens
what should happen is yeah this that we
get exactly the same as what we get on
the my videos page that's okay because
that's because we used in my videos page
Dave so what we're gonna do you're just
gonna get rid of the add a video edit on
the London eat video options so we just
I don't get rid of times as well we'll
just delete these two
so that's them deleted and here's our
video so obviously we need to fix things
up a little bit so what I'm gonna do is
I'm just gonna pop I'm gonna come out of
the wild lip I'm gonna close this
actually and open it again and then up
here I know put in a couple of break
tags maybe only one will do yeah that's
not quite right let's just wear my
videos and probably the same thing we
did over there so I'm here with three
rectangles to dot oops Tim únicos it
let's just add or you open up PHP tags
again and then we want to do is pissed
off me break tags up here
okay so we a slight problem that's okay
we can fix not another time
election we'll fix a nice so um let's
say
set the height on a lucrative style
attribute actually I will say mocks
height just said the 40 pixels because
that will shrink everything down moves
then we cannot get it right after lot
let's just inspect the element in the
chrome developer tools we can come up
here and we just changed the locks
height and we can just place the got
ball actually as you can see it just
pushes everything down so we'll set the
max height to 80 pixels
what can we change this to E and then we
want to also do is you want to get the
video views so we're going to copy the
it's to tag up here gets it down here
and say oops
what is that video views' what does she
do is it'll just give us the a number
views that are videos hard
okay so we actually don't want it to be
like that so we'll just go over to the
h2 for not
and as you can see it's sort of not
quite the way we want it
so we'll just increase the size again of
our day of 390 pixels
and now you can see that made it fit in
better okay so I'm just gonna upload a
video on here okay there's actually a
problem with uploading videos so what I
mean by that is if I just go to one of
these ones and I try to upload it it's
probably gonna be too big on any of you
I actually need to add before I just go
down it's fine an mp4
you
there okay so this is actually not now
before it's just an image that I call
them Iranian down before because first
because of the limits of that were set
in PHP by default we aren't able to
upload videos above a certain size so I
just had to do this and obviously did
you believe it upload because I already
uploaded it so I'm going to be showing
how to fix on the next video in case
you're wondering but don't worry about
it for now but if we good of popular
videos now as you can see this video is
ordered below and the other one and
that's because it has zero video views
but if I was just about to change this
one and change that to zero and this one
the one it would I update the other one
would go above it so that's it for this
video don't forget to Like comment
favorite and subscribe and as I said I
will be fixing that problem the next
video of is the default in PHP or
stopping us from you I will upload two
long videos which I found out I forgot
about so thanks for watching don't
forget to Like comment favorite and
subscribe I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
