to be doing is we're going to be
learning how to create our own really
simple bot using the new facebook
messenger platform what I'm going to be
doing is I'm going to be showing you
everything you need to know to get your
first Facebook button up and running and
what we're gonna be doing is also
learning how to process messages that we
get back from Facebook and how to send
messages to Facebook using the messenger
API so in this first part we're going to
be doing is we're going to be setting up
all the prerequisites that we need to in
order to get our brought up and running
so in order to create a Facebook bot we
need to have a Facebook page so here I
am on the and created page a page on
Facebook what I did was I just created a
brand new Facebook account just for the
tutorial series and I'm going to create
a page for our bot so what I'm going to
do for the Bart I'm going to choose
brand a product it doesn't really matter
I'm just going to choose a category I'm
going to choose app page I like Corel I
don't type in something to call our bot
so I'll say and then let's just click
get started and we're just going to skip
this and hopefully just skip it all so
there we have our page created I'll just
skip through this and now what we need
to do is we need to create our bot so
what we do that is we need to create a
Facebook Developer kind so here I am on
the Facebook Developer website the first
time you go on to it you've got you're
gonna have to associate the developer
account with your actual Facebook kind
it just takes a second and I've already
done that what I'm going to do is I'm
going to click create a new app so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to click
website and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give the app the name so I'm
going to type in bar then I'm going to
click create new Facebook app ID so I'm
just going to put in Francis a haiku org
and for the category I'm going to choose
just education for the tutorial you can
pick one that's more specific to your
blog and then you click create app ID so
here is just the security one I just
wants to click on the waterfalls it'll
probably be different for you and then
let's just click Submit so after you've
done that it takes you to this page and
we're just going
- click Next so we have to tell Facebook
about the website we're going to use to
host our bot and as you can see here I
have a website here called Facebook -
BOTS easy i'ii pay no attention to see
zje for now it's going to be coming up
in a future tutorial series it's going
to be the successor to ESL VC but for
now I've used that to create a domain
name and create a website Facebook - bot
CAE and this is going to be used to host
our bar this is just running off of a
best best web hosting and that's what is
hosting this blank screen at the minute
so I just type in facebook bot dot c zi
e and I click Next
it wants me to do these things I can
just skip all this and that's me done so
if I skip quick start here we are in our
app dashboard and so to create our
actual bot we need to go down to
products click add product we need to go
to messenger and click get started and
here what we do is we just click get
started again and then we have the
product added to our app so the first
thing we need to do is we need to choose
the page is going to host our bot as we
just click select page and we're going
to click the page we just created and
we're just going to click OK we're going
to click OK again
and we have our page access token here
the next thing we need to do is we need
to go to our web hooks and we need to
set up a web book a web book is just
pretty much a web address that facebook
talks to and that's why we can talk to
facebook so if I click setup web hook
I'm going to type in Facebook bot dot c
zi e and i have to put in a verify token
which is just something that Facebook
can use to verify that I in fact and
have control over this URL so I'm just
going to type in Frances for the verify
token I'm going to check all these boxes
so that we have all the permissions we
need you don't have phase TTP s it will
actually give you
an hour and I won't allow you to use
that callback URL and what you can see
here is I am running this website on
HTTPS for the tutorial your callback you
would probably want to use a you know
wide pH to say last call back but I'm
going to use the index page of the bot
so I'm just going to leave it blank like
this and that will default to the index
page so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to click verify you can see we got
an error so the reason we got an error
is because I'm on our callback we never
actually sad Facebook any information so
you can see the response that they
wanted was this number but we didn't
send them anything and this number
changes each time you and try to verify
the page so the way we fix that as we go
to our page itself and we're going to
just create a PHP block we're just going
to first echo and the whole get array
actually if we act with that we'll just
get the word array returned to us if I
actually see of this you'll see that in
action if we just click verify and save
you can see Facebook receives array PHP
can't print array is using a cooz you
have to use the print our function to
print an array and Facebook doesn't
actually want the entire array returned
it just wants the challenge that it
sends to us
so if I click verify and save and you
hover over this you can see we sent them
back the array but what they want is
this number itself so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to print get and I'm
going to just put in a string and say
Pub challenge we're going to add click
verify and save and you can see that's
our web hook set up the reason we had to
print hub challenge is because if we
look at the API documentation you can
see that when Facebook sends a
verification request it sends these
three parameters but the only one it
wants you to return is hub challenge but
in PHP it's a hole underscore challenge
in the gap request so we send out back
to them and then Facebook realize it's
us and they verified and
so we've set the webhook up we actually
need to click select a page click best
spot ever click Subscribe
that's our bot subscribed so that's
everything we're going to cover in this
part in the next part we're going to be
moving on and hopefully sending some
messages using our bot so thanks for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
