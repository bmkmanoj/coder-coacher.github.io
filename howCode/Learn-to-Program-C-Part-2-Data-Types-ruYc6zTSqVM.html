learned what a sea program looks like
how to compile a sea program and how to
get set up and running with your C
compiler so in this video we're going to
be learning about data types so if you
remember back to the last video I said
that programs written in C are generally
a lot faster than programs written in
Python for example one of the reasons
for this is that C compilers to machine
code but another reason is that C is
statically typed so what I mean by
statically typed is whenever I create a
variable or I use any sort of data and
see I have to tell see what type of data
i'm using whereas in Python since it's
dynamically typed at the Python code
automatically work out what kind of data
i'm using wrong time there's advantages
and disadvantages to both but the main
one is that because he is statically
typed it has less work to do journ the
runtime so it's a lot faster but pythons
and sustainable key types has a lot more
work to do at the wrong time so it's
generally slower so because say a
statically typed it has different
keywords to create different data types
so co6 primitive data types and is int
back in as a char it has int in a short
it is long double and it has float so
these are the six primitive data types
in C so you're probably wondering what's
the difference between each data type
and see the difference between the data
types is powerfully to do with where the
terminal will handle them for example if
I ipod an integer the terminal will
format that as a number of ipod a char
the terminal will I put it as a
character on the screen one of the
differences is that each of the data
types are not the same size for example
a charge only one bite in size whereas a
double is it bites and what that means
is whenever you create a char you
allocate one byte of memory to store
that jar and whenever you create a w
allocate it bites to store the double so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
print out the size of each of the
individual data types on my computer so
there we have it here we have a print
statement that prints the size of each
data type using the size our function
the size our function is
Alton function see the text the data
type as the parameter and the way we're
formatting is we're using the percent al
you because size of doesn't return a
number every times its own special data
type that we format as a number so if i
run this if i say GCC learn c and i said
it out you see we got into equals four
short equals to flow equals four double
equals it long it was it Charlie equals
one so what this means is if I create an
integer on my computer it will store it
will allocate four bytes of memory to
store that integer the same as I create
a short of logic in two bites and I
created floated like it for a double of
it along it and a char one so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to use Python
to show you the amount of different
values you can store in each of the data
types so if i print two to the power of
32 so the reason i'm doing 2 to the
power of 32 is because an integer on my
computer is four bytes and four bytes is
32 bits because 4 times 8 is 32 because
of 8 bits and one bite so I hit adjure
you'll see we got 4.2 billion that means
we can storm 4.2 billion different
numbers in a 32-bit integer don't
confuse that with meaning we can store
between 0 and 4.2 billion don't confuse
that with meaning we can store between 0
and sore point two billion numbers in an
integer that's not quite right but I'll
explain more like that in the next video
but just know that you can store 4.2
billion possible and numbers and a
32-bit integer if I did print 2 to the
power of 16 we get 65,000 that means in
a short we can store 65,000 different
numbers this doesn't mean 65,000
different numbers at once this means a
number up to 65,000 and just in case
you're wondering I don't mean you can
store up to 65,000 individual numbers in
a in a short because you would use a
raft something like that a short can
store one 16-bit number that's what it
can store and in consol one 32-bit
number afloat can store one 32-bit
number a double can store a 64-bit
number at a target store an 8-bit number
that's how it works so that's it for
