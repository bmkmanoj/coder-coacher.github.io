we're gonna be doing is when we're
learning how to create a Chrome
extension so what a Chrome extension is
is it's basically just if you've ever
seen up in the top corner of the Google
Chrome browser up here beside this
button sometimes you see a row of icons
and those are Chrome extensions it's
working we're creating one of those
today so let's get started so the first
thing you need or the first thing I've
done actually is I've just created a
folder on my desktop called my extension
so just you need to do the same and then
I've created an icon which is just PNG
image it says icon PNG I double click on
that it opens then we see that's my egg
bone so the first thing we're going to
do is we're going to go into sublime
text we have to create a file called a
manifest so I've just created my
manifest file and it's a manifest I
thought JSON file which is just the type
of file it is so add the first thing we
need to do when we're creating our
manifest or actual explain what is a
manifest file basically just tells a you
know again user specific things about
our extension so for example amount of
fast file will need to include the name
of our extension maybe a description of
version and things like that the
manifest is also used to tell chrome
about similar things with the extension
of the type of extension as well so that
what the chrome knows what kind of
extension is trying to run so the first
thing we need to do is we need to open
up two curly brackets and then the next
thing we need to do is we need to use
two double quotes and write the word
medium and then woops macaroni in the
link color after the two brackets then
what you do is you make two more karlie
Redd's and inside them you popped the
name of your extension in my case is
going to be a Auto code
okay I'll just buy my first substantial
actually my or my extension and then you
add it with sandy :
on the other side no a comma the next
thing we do is we just repeat the
process for the different values whoops
within our extension so the next one
we're going to use is version and we're
going to set this one equal to 1.0 we
want to do the same thing in another
column and then just repeat the process
so this one we're going to write in
description we're going to give it a
short description so this is a short
description for our Chrome extension and
we're going to add another one and this
one's important this one says browser
oops
underscore action and what this one is
is it's it's sort of the italic room
things about our extension like the
location of the icon file so this one
gets its own set of curly brackets so
just make sure you put in another set of
curly brackets ER and then in here we
want to write default oops
default underscore icon and then we want
to set that equal to the location of our
icon file which is icon dot PNG which is
relative to location of the manifest
file so what that basically means is the
icon files in the same look is in the
same folder as the manifest file so
instead of saying that it's in my
desktop and then it's in a folder called
my extension in the desktop I can just
specify that called icon dot PNG because
it's in the same folder so next thing we
want to actually do is want to actually
add this to Chrome so to do that we have
to click on Chrome and go to the Chrome
browser as you can see I have no
extensions at the moment so what I have
to do is to click on this bot or we're
also you have to be in developer mode so
this is the way I look for you to just
make sure you click developer mode then
you
load unpacked extension and it brings up
this box so then what you want to do is
you just want to click on the folder I
created on my desktop called my
extension I want to click OK
ok so what this is telling us is we need
the manifest or score version and it
needs to be equal to 2 so that's really
easy we just you deal with it tells us
so we just say manifest and restore
version we set it equal to 2 without
quotes we just do exactly as I ever says
as you can see we've just done exactly
what edge would have okay so now we're
just going to try and add our extension
again so we load unpacked extensions
scroll down click on my extension now
click OK and here we have it here's our
extension it's loaded in the chrome
you'll also notice the extension is now
up here with our icon the week well that
I created earlier then click on it it
does nothing because we I'm told to do
anything you so that's it for this video
don't forget to Like comment favorite
subscribe it was a short video but I'm
gonna try and keep these extent these a
Chrome extension very short and make
more of them so that way obviously you
don't have to watch the whole thing at
once where you can like split it up
instead of you having to split it up
I've already split it up into little
different videos so thanks for watching
don't forget to Like comment favorite
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
