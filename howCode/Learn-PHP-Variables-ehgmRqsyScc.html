so today what we're going to be talking
about a learning about a xem variables
so variables are basically when you
assign a value to and something so
instead of me riding this is a test and
say I wanted to a copy and paste this
string over and over and over again so
all I'd have to do if I wanted to do
that normally I could just hold this and
say I made a mistake so as if I'm in a
mistake then I made this mistake well
hundreds of times basically but say i
oughtta have used a variable okay so
let's just go to this variables when you
assign them to basically like in mod you
would have an algebra you could say x
equals 5 y equals 6 MX plus y equals 11
basically that's sort of what variables
are it's like algebra kind of so if I
was to actually create a variable the
first thing I need to do is the UM
declare I'll declare a variable but
there's no command for declaring a
variable in PHP so variables in PHP
start with the dollar sign and then
after the dollar sign you just lay the
dock at all I'll the dollar sign em is
followed after the dollar sign you
follow it with whatever the name of the
variable is so I could basically just
write better at create a variable called
X then you put space equals so as you've
seen in the other videos the fine fine
series
the equals operator just um well I
should explain this actually so in PHP
when you just say equals 1 1 equal sign
it's assigning the verity value to
something else so that's why in a
variable you would say x equals m5 maybe
because you're assigning the value 5 to
the variable X but say you wanted to you
were trying to set compare something so
if you create an if statement like you
might have seen in the fine friend
series I have sometimes used to equals 2
equals means your am comparing two
things so saying if something is another
then do something or RM &amp;amp; 1 equal to the
signing of our I'm assigning a value and
a variable must begin with a ladder the
variable name there's no you can call a
variable whatever you want so you could
call it when I virat still a valid
variable but you can you can't just say
variable 1 equals 5 because it just
doesn't work so a very one will start
with an X or an underscore character so
could say X all underscore X so that's a
valid variable and then if I just echoed
X underscore X that works or if I just
change this to underscore X underscore X
let's still work with the valid variable
so just to keep things simple I'm just
going to say eggs so you might know that
I didn't use any speech marks on the
variable because basically if a variable
is a number you don't put any spaces
look make whatever number are and when I
say you don't use any spaces you don't
use the speech marks
but that's because a speech mark
basically means a string so if I was
creating a string of texts coz if I was
to write that and i get rid of the UM
quotation marks or speech marks and i
hit enter i get an error because that's
not a valid way to write a variable or
to write anything so i couldn't even do
that with if i was to write a crow and
then i just really much a tax that one
more so when you're writing a string in
a variable you have to use the quotation
marks are a speech marks or quotation
marks as with a co you can also you can
use it a lot or the two single quotes it
still work so um valuable names are also
case sensitive so if i have to say at MX
and it's a lowercase X and then I was to
say another variable called X it was an
uppercase X these two variables are
different so if I stack oh x.x and I'm
just also echoed X now I will get 0 1
because they're two different variables
so as I said the last one you just
commented on so the uppercase ax equals
1 so if I add with it I get one I look
enough I echo the local case X i get 0
because that's the two values I've given
them so variables are also available can
also only contain alphanumeric
characters and underscores so for
example you couldn't say in a variable
you couldn't put the odd sign and they
all this rubbish you couldn't say that
there has to be a ladder of it variable
can only be under a ladder up against
ladder
and a number like a zero or whatever or
or underscores so that's facing all you
can put in a variable so as as i said
earlier i thought why would you want to
use a variable so say I was trying to
say i want i had a big string so I a
good a big long string and I called X
the name of the variable I just said
this is roxy yeah so I'll deliberately
spell this wrong and I'll say this is a
test um I will echo I don't want so now
as you might have also realized when
you're at going a variable you can put
the variable name in between the court
in started as speech marks or you could
just remove the speech marks all
together and just act with the variable
like that we can use single quotes
except with single quotes it's a bit
different you just you have to say the
single quote and then you say another
single quote space full stop space let
me share you have to do the same on the
other side so space full stop space
quotation mark and that will work this
is a test but if I was just a CO and a
dollar sign X that's exactly what we'll
get or sine X just put this back so you
just need to be careful about that so
for the minute i'm just going to put it
in quotation or speech more and if I act
or that we get the value X so say I copy
piece to this loads and loads and loads
of times
so I got this as a test over and over
and over and over again and I as you can
see it's about this wrong and I did it
loads and loads of times so if I hadn't
created a variable and i just created a
string then I would have to go around
individually and click that put the
eyeing find it again put another I in
and that's just not an efficient way to
do anything so if I made a mistake while
I do this but I am correct it once since
I've signed it to a variable and I just
act with the variable loads of times i
hit enter and it vexes it for all of
them so that's not it sort of why you
might want to use a variable and another
reason you might want to use a variable
is sort of like well actually I can
already think of another time I heard
what there's plenty of reasons where you
would use a variable instead okay
actually say you had a script and you
don't worry you don't need to understand
what this means if you've watched the
fine friends theories up to the current
part you'll know what this means maybe
so say I had that session user logon
which doesn't matter what it means and
I'm say I had I wanted to use it loads
of times on the page so i used it here
and I had some code down here and I used
it and then I have more code here and I
used it and say as Iggy and I spelt it
wrong and I'm is meant to be stashing
just use your name then if I used it ten
times on the page I'd have to go up I'd
have to change this and change this I
don't have to do that as many times as I
as I'd use the variable I made a mistake
going off the variables am string all
this is mr. book whatever so to fix that
and keep things easy and simple all i do
is yeah i can just say user and I could
assign it
to this code here so then now I could
just say user and if I had it somewhere
down the page and say user I go further
down the page use it again and it just
makes things a lot easier and simpler so
variables don't need the M space between
the equals you can just say this is X
and you want you don't need the space
it's just personal preference you can
put the space and I leave it all it
doesn't matter so and that's basically
it for this video so if you like the

subscribe and like it hope on them I'll
see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
