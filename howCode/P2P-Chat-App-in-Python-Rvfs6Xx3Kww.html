modifying our chat up and we're going to
be adding some peer-to-peer
functionality specifically what we're
going to do whenever the server
disconnects one of the clients will
automatically become the new server and
every client that doesn't become the
server will automatically try to connect
to that client to keep the chat app
going so the first thing we're going to
do is we're going to do a bit of code
refactoring because at the moment we're
creating our socket in our server class
and we're creating our socket in our
client class but because those methods
aren't in functions they're not tied to
any objects say for example where a
client and the server disconnect and we
become the new server we're going to
have to create a new server object but
we can't reuse the same socket variable
so we're going to have to put that into
the constructor of our classes so to do
that I just copy this variable paste it
in here and instead of referring to it
as south sock I just refer to it as sock
and then down here when we have a run
function instead of having a separate
function called run we're just going to
copy this and we're going to paste our
run function in our constructor just
like this and then up here once again we
have to refer to it as socket except not
self dot sock start except and then we
come down here and do the same for our
client
it is defined in our constructor we have
to pass the socket to the send message
function so that it can use it so just
set args and we pass a topple with one
argument which is going to be sock and
we have to put that comma in to make
sure that Python evaluates at as a
trouble and here we just pass in sock
and refer to the sock and then down here
we refer to it as sock again and we
delete our run function for our server
so now what we need to do is we need to
be able to store a list of peers which
is a list of people that are connected
to the server alongside us so we create
a variable called peers and it's going
to be a list and every time someone
joins the server we want to add them to
the peers list and we want to tell
everyone else that they've joined and
whenever somebody leaves we want to tell
every other person is connected that
they've left that way we can keep the
peer list in sync so here after we get a
connection we're just going to set
ourselves up here start append and we're
going to pan the address of the peer
which is a zero because a is a topple
which is the address and the port and we
only want the address so we're just
going to access the first item of that
trouble and whenever someone disconnects
we're going to say self dot peers dot
remove and we're going to remove their
address on the list appears and then
next what we're going to do is whenever
someone disconnects we're going to say
self dots and peers to update the peers
list of everyone who's connected to the
server and then here after someone gets
connected we're in assess after thus and
peers as well down here we're going to
create our sand peers method and it's
just going to send the list of peers to
all of the other people who are
connected to the server
and we're just going to loop through the
pairs list on the creative strings we're
going to create a string called P and
we're going to save for Pier in South
stop here's P is going to be equal to
itself plus the new pier plus a comma
for our delimiter and once we've done
that we're just going to sending you
guys to all the peers so to do that we
save for connection in South our
connections and then here what we do is
just say connection dots and we convert
our string which is our list of peers to
bytes we just converted eights we said
that the encoding was utf-8 and before
the string we're just going to depend on
another bite so we're going to append on
another byte which we do that by
creating a byte string and we just set
backslash X 1 1 which just means we're
sending this byte at the start of the
string that way when the client receives
it we can differentiate between the list
of peers and when we receive a message
so now that we've sent the list appears
the client needs to understand what it
has been sent so to do that we just say
if data and we get the first byte of the
data is equal to a byte which is 1 1
that means that we received the list of
peers call peers otherwise we'll just
print out the message so now if we save
that and we run it and we connect to the
server you can see the crank of printed
I got pairs because somebody just
connected you can see the second pair
connected and we got got peers again
this here also was tools got pairs if
this first pair disconnects the second
one we'll be told got pairs because it
received the list appears again because
somebody just disconnected so we're
standing and receiving our list of peers
and what we're going to do when we run
the server is we're just going to say
server running so what we're going to do
whenever the server loses connection is
out of all the clients that are
connected they're going to lose
connection obviously and one of them
will then have to randomly become the
new server so the way we're going to do
that is we're going to create a while
loop it's going to run forever and we're
going to say print trying to connect and
then we're going to do is going to wait
a random amount of time and that's how
we're going to decide which client
becomes a new server because each plant
will wear a random amount of time and
then it will try to reconnect to the
server and if it can't reconnect since
they all waited random amounts of time
one will become the server quicker than
the others so we're going to say a time
dot sleep and we're going to say it's
going to sleep for a random amount of
time so we're going to say
and in between one and five seconds so
it's going to sleep for between one and
five seconds but we don't know how long
it's going to sleep or what we have to
do is screw it up an import time and
then import our random function so we're
going to save from random import round
and and before I forget we actually have
to store the peers that we receive as
the client because of the minute we've
just printed GARP arrows we haven't
actually saved them so what we're going
to do instead of printing a cup here's
we're just going to run a function
called set up t it peers and we're going
to get the pairs with the data we
received - the first bite because the
first bite was just to tell us that the
data was actually the peers that had to
be updated
and what we're going to do is we're
going to set peers equals STR pair data
with the encoding utf-8 that converts
our data from binary back into a string
and Python then what we do is we split
that string on the comma which was our
delimiter and then what we do is we
remove the last item because our string
ended in a comma
the last item in this list will just be
empty so we're going to say Google from
the start of the list to the second last
item and instead of going to peers what
we're going to do is we're going to set
P to P dot peers I'm going to create a
class called PGP with one item calls
peers and it's going to be a list the
reason for this class is because down
here we're outside of any class and we
can't access the peers variable in our
client class if we're outside of it so
we have to have a class that can be
accessed by the client class on a class
that can be accessed from outside of any
class so now that we've stored our new
peers what I'm actually going to do down
here as well as create a try block and
we're going to create an exception which
is going to be keyboard interrupt and if
that happens were just going to set
assisted exit at the keyboard interrupt
just means as you press ctrl C on your
keyboard then we're going to exit the
program so after you've slept for a
random amount of time what we're going
to do is loop through all of the peers
so we're going to say for appear in PGP
to peers and what we're going to try to
do is we're going to try to create a new
client object with the peer and if that
doesn't work we're going to put in
another exception for keyboard interrupt
to light the user to press ctrl C to
eggs of the program and then if there's
any other kind of exception we're just
going to ignore it
and then what we're going to try to do
after we've lived through all the peers
and we have been able to connect any of
them we're going to say server equals
server to become and then we're going to
try to become the server if that doesn't
work and we're just going to print
once again we're going to accept
keyboard interrupt to load the user to
press control-c whatever this is
happening to exit the program if they
want before we try to run that what
we're going to do is we're just going to
delete this part here of the Python code
because by default what we're going to
do is we're just going to run this loop
we're going to try to connect if that
doesn't work then we're going to become
the server and then our peers this we
can have our default set of peers so if
by default we're going to set the
default peer is us all I have to do is
type in Python to each app a
it says trying to connect and it should
shortly say server running now you can
see the server's running now I'm going
to try to connect from this other client
it says trying to connect and then it's
going to try to connect to the server
and you can see it's just connected
there so I have this second client here
I'm going to hit enter and it's going to
try to connect and there you can see
it's just connected from the server I'm
going to D I'm going to disconnect so
I'm going to press control C the server
is gone and now you can see the first
one couldn't start the server and we
just have a problem actually so I'm
going to cancel out neither of them
could start the server because if I try
to do it now it's going to throw an
error so on the Python documentation
there's this line here set sock option
if we set this option it will allow us
to reuse a socket before it times out on
the computer so if we open our chat up
again and then we're going to go to the
server and we're going to paste that in
there just to set that option sock set
option and in the client we're going to
do the same thing and that should then
get rid of that error so now once again
the server is running we both of our
clients connected and know what I'm
going to do is I'm going to close the
server now it's trying to connect on one
server and it's already said server is
running on the second one and they're
know we have a new client connected the
client on the top window has just
connected I know if I was to run the old
server one more time what it's going to
do is it's automatically going to
connect it's not perfect you can see I
sent a message there and it didn't
actually send but now if I was to send a
message a second time it sounds we
haven't built the most robust chat up in
the world that was just due to your
threads and white threads can be
difficult to use one final thing we're
going to do this works because all of
our clients and servers are running on
the same computer but if we were to
connect to a remote server we could end
up in a situation where they all tried
to become the server and it would all
succeed because the only reason it
doesn't work on this is because they're
all running on the same
trying to run on the sim ports so to fix
our problem or at least reduce that is
we can use this really simple method I
thought of what we need to do is we just
created if statements
that means there's a one in 20 chance
that the number will be 1 which means on
average 1 in 20 clients would then would
try to become the server which means we
get around that problem of every client
trying to become the server it's
obviously not perfect but for the sake
of our tutorial this should do the job
