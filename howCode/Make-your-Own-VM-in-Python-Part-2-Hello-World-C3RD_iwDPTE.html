we're going to be doing is we're going
to be continuing on in our virtual
machine series and what we're gonna be
doing today is we're going to be writing
some code so in the last serie or the
last video we left off we created a
shortcut to the our Python folder we
have a folder or a file called VM dot P
Y we downloaded the pi PI source and we
checked it was working in the terminal
so what we're going to do today is we're
going to create a test program to add
tests that it actually works so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to open up VM
by and with when writing in our Python
you can't use you know Python 3 features
like prints with a the print function
you have to use the Python 2 version so
you would hit print hello world or
whatever but I'm sure you know this
won't work if I just leave it like this
so in a write print hello world and I'm
going to go to my terminal and if I type
Python if I type Python 3 it will agency
launch the Python 3 and interpreter if I
write Python it will launch the Python 2
interpreter so what we're going to do is
we're going to compare we're going to
just run this any Python 2 interpreter
just to show you that it works so I'm
gonna say print the end up high but I
can just type in the letter V and I can
hit tab and it fills it in for me and as
you can see it says hello world so what
I'm going to do now is I'm going to try
and compile it using our Python and
obviously it won't work but the first
thing we need to do is we need to
actually go to our our Python folder go
to our Python and we go to the bin
folder and here's our our Python it's
kind of like our translator don't worry
about that that's like an interactive
version but this is what we're gonna be
using so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to create another sim link so I'm going
to say RL n minus s only going to drag
in add leech file
and then in here what I'm going to say
is I'm just going to call it our so now
if I list the content so we can see we
have our we have our Python we have VN
dot pi so if I go back out of here you
can see we have a link to the are sort
of the our Python translator we have
three things in this folder and we need
to use this one to translate our
programs so how do you do it you say a
Python because this is a Python program
you say a Python space and then the name
of it which in my case is R because
that's what I called it up here then
what you do is you give it the file name
so I'm gonna say the end up py and hit
enter as you can see it didn't work
that's because we didn't because we're
trying to mimic a C program or we're
trying to convert it into C program we
have to have something called a Mian
function which is an something that
Python doesn't require but C does so
what language is I'm just going to paste
it in and then I'm gonna show you what
we need to do send up a student now and
here we can see here is everything we
need to make our program work so I can
see up here we have the main function
under the Minister something it returns
zero so what does this call is it it's
just called a boilerplate code which is
just code that's required to make it run
so just think of it like I'll just
ignore it and just a copy paste it and I
you don't have to change this throughout
the course of the tutorials and then
just ignore this too so all these bottom
two just pretend once so you can pretend
they're not there but just put them in
the bottom of the program you never have
to think about them again
so once you've done that what we're
gonna do is we're just going to cut this
and we're going to paste our print
statement and our main function
so this is the equivalent of a C program
with the printf function in it so what
I'm going to do now is I'm going to go
back to the terminal and I'm gonna hit
up and this will let put the last come
on back in the terminal and I hit enter
now and as you can see it's gonna do
loads of random stuff but it's going to
come it's going to convert our Python or
a lot our Python code into C code and
then it's gonna compile it it usually
takes about 20 second
for a small program so just there we go
okay I took 15 seconds and if I go to
the finder you can see now we have an
executable which is a city file or well
that was a C file it's a binary file
that's called VM dash C and why go to
the terminal and I run that file by
doing a dot /vm dash C and hit enter as
you see it says hello world
we can still run our old Python program
in the same way I serve I type in Python
we end up by okay we need to just import
up here import assist which is just
standard libraries font or a standard
library module as you can see nice let's
have a world but I'm going to show you a
difference in the speed between
converting it to see and keeping it in
Python so what I'm gonna do is menus
that I'm commanding it said time Python
VM kind so as you can see it tells us
the time it says just ignore these
bottom two and just look at the real one
it says it talked naught point naught to
60 seconds to execute which sounds
pretty fast but I mean you can see how
much quicker we get whenever we are
converted to C so if I do the same thing
on the C program so if I didn't see
anything in the see program on hit enter
as you can see look it's a lot quicker
it's as you can see it takes not point
not takes now point not to six seconds
with when running inside the Python
interpreter and when we run it directly
off the computers while the computer's
processor you can see it's not point
naught 5 seconds so that's a long way
away faster and then this means that our
programs are gonna be a lot quicker as
well because we don't have to run inside
the Python a virtual machine so that's
it for this video don't forget to Like

see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
