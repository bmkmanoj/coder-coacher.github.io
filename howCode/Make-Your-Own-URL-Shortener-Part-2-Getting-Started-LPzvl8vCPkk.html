the series so in this part what we're
gonna be doing is we're gonna be
creating our database I'm gonna be
creating our files so the first thing we
need to do is we need to go to after you
pay uploader so I'm using FileZilla here
it is I have a connection to Francis
McNamee comm which is the primary
account for us which is the hosting a
card for this don't mean so this is
France McNamee come to me and I just
added onto me and called MnDOT ESWC so
what i did was i FD pain into the
frances McNamee doc calm account and I
went to my folder which as you can see
here I'm storing my add-on domains and
slash Island domains slash the name of
the domain and here it is here so if I
go to index if I go to our sorry
Minister VC you can see this corresponds
to this here so if I delete cgi-bin
so let's just delete that and you can
see there we go with SSI it says empty
directory listing if i refresh the page
now you can see that's disappeared so
this is the directory that MnDOT ESWC is
hosted in so what we're going to do is
we're going to right-click we're going
to create a new file I wanna say
htaccess because we need to use HT
access for our URL shortener then we're
going to create one more file called
index.php and we actually need two files
for this whole project so then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to open up
these files so if I click view slash add
it it will download them and open them
up in my text editor so here they are
here just where I put them into one file
so we are they are here here's index and
here's HT access so I'm just going to
say hello world just to show you that it
works and then we have we've uploaded
the file already we refresh the page
I need CSS hello world so what we're
gonna do now is want to create our
database so we're gonna go to MySQL
databases we're going to see here it
says create new database and we're gonna
I mean we're just gonna call them in you
can call yours whatever you want so we
click create database it says out of the
database
and we scroll down and then what we have
to do is we need to add a user to that
database so here's just one of the users
on the card so what I'm gonna do is
going to create a new user so I'm going
to call it let's just say hi code and
the password I'm sneeze around and
password generator just copy this so
we're like I've copied this to a safe
place we click that they use password
and I'm just going to open a new
document paste it in there so we don't
lose it I'm going to click create user
so a wing click see if password doesn't
matter so let's not see of it let's go
back and you see now all we have to do
is add our user to the database so if we
see here it says add user to database
we're just like like Francis 1
underscore hi code then we click the
database 1 attitude in this case there's
only 1 we click add user oh no we have
to choose the privileges we want so
while we're developing our project what
we're gonna do is gonna click on
privileges and then as soon as we
finished our project we're going to just
allow the privileges we need so for
example we're not going to need the drop
privilege because we're not gonna want
to drop any tables from our application
we're gonna want to be able to only do
things like that from PHP myadmin we're
not gonna be able to want to be able to
delete things my Mike but for this
series we're not so as you can see
there's loads of privileges here that we
don't actually need we're just gonna
allow them all for the moment and
whenever we finish development is when
we can look through these and then
delete the ones we don't need to make
our application more secure so if we
click Save Changes you can see it says
the changes been see if we click back
its what I'm gonna do here is click home
now I'm going to go to PHP myadmin
so here it's loading here we are here is
phpMyAdmin so here's the database we
just created
and what I'm going to do is going to
create a table called links and I'm just
going to say ten columns we're not going
to need ten columns but PHP myadmin
will only add feels that are filled in
so for example if I leave some of these
fields blank then they won't be created
as columns so we can tell it be
basically deleted so it just means that
while we're planning a tie we won't have
to add additional fields afterwards so
obviously the first thing we need is an
ID we're going to web school to index
set it to primary and then we're going
to see this it says a underscore I that
means auto increment we're just going to
click that that means that each
somethingyou row is added it will
automatically increment the ID by one
here what we're gonna do is one is put
in URL which is the URL we want to
redirect to which is gonna be a varchar'
let's actually set text because we don't
know how long the URL could be varchar'
can only be 255 characters in length
that URL can be longer than that so it
makes sense to have text for the type
and then what we're gonna do is we're
gonna have the title we'll call it i
will save our char we'll say 32 so the
maximum length that our shortened links
can be is 32 characters and that's
actually all we need I think so let's
just scroll down here click Save
and we click structure you can see when
you have three columns the additional
seven columns were automatically removed
or ignored whenever we were creating the
table because they were blank
so what we're gonna do now is we're
going to go to our index page I'm gonna
just click on page P brackets need to be
tags in him
what we're going to do is we're going to
before that I want to create a form so
we're gonna say doctype HTML we're just
gonna quit a basic HTML document then we
put the head tags in so in this series
we're all gonna be styling our project
we're just going to be doing the actual
core functionality behind it so styling
is something you can do in your own time
this is just to make sure we're not
teaching unnecessary things that are
gonna make the project a lot more
complicated I don't necessarily
complicated I want to keep it as simple
as possible so we'll just and then let's
just say shorten your links with min yes
the VC and let's refresh I'll upload
that's we just click yes I'll upload the
file go to MnDOT instantly see refresh
the page and you can see the title is
just changed
so no what I'm going to do is when I
create our form so I'm just going to I
like to a critic h1 tag and I'll say
shorten your links then I'll create a
form underneath that and the form is
gonna have a tax box the name is gonna
be say URL to shorten we're not gonna
have a value we're just going to leave
the value equal to nothing but we're
gonna put a placeholder and I wanna say
enter that's actually just saying is the
link to shorten and I don't really
thought what we're gonna do is we're
going to have input type equals submit
it was going to be shortened and the
value is going to be equal to shorten so
let's say run what that actually will
run it now you can see it's a shortened
link space the link you want to shorten
we click shortened link cannot shoot
shorten it so what we're to do is we're
just going to send her everything the
center tag is actually depreciated at
the moment so you should actually use it
for any production website but because
we're not focused on a design in this
series we're just going to use it anyway
so we're gonna say form action equals
index we're just going to be a equals
index but we could just say in next up P
whoops index dot PHP or we could just
put a slash in that means the same thing
and what we're going to do is we're
gonna say method equals post because
we're posting down off we don't want to
pass any parameters in the URL
so we're going to do is we're going to
go up here and we're just going to say
if is sat post we're going to check for
the URL button being pressed so what's
the f is that post shortened and echo
clicked
so we just we're just going to click on
the button so let's click that and you
can see it says clicked so that's it for
this video I don't forget to like
comment favorite subscribe and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
