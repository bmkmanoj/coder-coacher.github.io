left with something like this
we had split up each of our each of the
items in our expression and we were
ready to parse them and evaluate them
but there's actually a far better way to
do it doing it ourselves because Python
already has a built-in function that
allows you to do this you can get rid of
everything in this function and all we
have to do is use the eval function
which is built into Python so what I'm
going to do is I'm actually an open the
Python interpreter on a shell and what
i'm gonna do is i'm going to type in
eval i'm just going to give it a string
so if i give it the number 10
it returns 10 and if I say 10 plus 3 as
you can see it gives 13 so it returns
the evaluated expression so we're going
to use that instead of doing it
ourselves because doing ourselves takes
ages and it's difficult to do right so
we're just going to use pythons so I'm
going to exit the interpreter I'm just
gonna go here and the way we're gonna do
it is we instead of just typing in eval
exp R that would evaluate it but we
wouldn't be able to store it anywhere
because we didn't assign it to a
variable but instead of sending it to a
variable and returning it I'm just going
to return eval exp R and what this will
do whenever we run the eval expression
function what it will do is we'll take
the expression we give it and it will
pass it to the eval function and return
the return the return value and the eval
function which is the result of the
expression so if I go over back here we
can see we have this expression and what
we expect to come out of this is at 18
so if I go over here and I run our
script as you can see it gives us 18 so
it knows about precedence and it knows
the order to do the operations I can
also do some of this I can put a
brackets in it
and I can see what it did that time was
added templates to me first I multiply
12 by 4 which gave us 48 so using this
function within Python we can evaluate
any kind of expression and we don't
actually have to do any of it ourselves
we can just pass it all off the Python
that's one of the benefits of doing it
at Python I remember I said doing it in
Python has its disadvantages because of
things like speed because it also run
inside the Python interpreter
but one of the advantages of doing it in
Python is we got things like expression
evaluators for free so that's it for
