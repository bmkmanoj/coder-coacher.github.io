learning how to send emails using PHP
we're not going to be using the standard
PHP mail function because to use that
function you have to have a working mail
server running on your computer and it's
also quite low level we're going to be
using a special class that was created
just for this purpose called PHP mailer
it's very popular and what it allows you
to do is it allows you to send emails by
connecting to an external service such
as Gmail so it saves you having to run a
mail server yourself so let's get
started so the first thing you have to
do is download this library so we're
going to go to Clun or download and
we're going to click download zip now
what we want to do inside this folder is
we want to copy all the files create a
folder in here call it PHP mailer and
we'll paste them in there now we want to
do on this page if you want to put in a
PHP code to run that class and send an
email to send the email we're going to
be using a gmail account we're going to
be using what I just created here it's
social network mail to @ gmail.com it's
a special gmail account I just created
especially for this series and you can
see here are the three emails I have in
the inbox but what we're going to be
looking at is the stat mail folder
because we're going to be using Gmail to
send emails so in our file we want to
create some PHP tags and the first thing
we want to do is include this PHP mailer
autoload class so we're going to say
require once and we're going to paste in
PHP mailer autoload and that's in the
PHP mailer folder just like that so now
that we've included that class we can
create an instance of it so we can say I
mail equals a new PHP mailer then what
we want to do is we want to enable SMTP
so we're going to say mail we're going
to run the is SMTP mathas next you want
to set mail SMTP off to tell PHP mailer
that we need to authenticate with Gmail
to be able to actually send a message
next we want to send mail SMTP secure
equals SSL because to use Gmail we have
to connect using SSL otherwise Gmail
will not assign any messages next once
an mail host is equal to smtp.gmail.com
and then mail port equals
there are a couple of ports we can use
we can use port 465 or port 587 so we're
going to use port 465 and we want to
send mail is HTML because we can send
HTML emails using this PHP mailer class
next when we put in our username so mail
it goes on for Gmail the username is
going to be our actual email address so
it's going to be social network two at
gmail.com it's just a task recurrent
everyone to put in the mail password and
of course the password will be changed
after the video the next thing we can do
is we can set some of the email headers
so the first one's going to be who sent
the email we're going to send mail set
from and for the social network series
we could say something like no reply
whatever domain name we're using the
host of social network so I could say no
reply at haiku org and if you want to
follow the social network series there's
a card up on the screen now next we can
set the subject with male subject equals
hello world and then we can send mails
body equals potassium M and next we can
set mail address to add an address of a
recipient which in this case is going to
be whoever we send the email to so I'm
going to send it to Francis at Hoku org
so now we've done that we're ready to
send the actual emails to do that what
we want to do is simply send mail sand
and before you run that SMTP auth isn't
a function it's just actually a boolean
variable so we're going to set SMTP auth
equals true and it would be helpful if I
put in the username property it's social
network mail - at gmail.com so now we're
going to try to actually send an email
so here I have a list of all my sent
messages you can see that it hasn't
actually be any yet if i refresh this
page and run this script
you can see it's all about it for a
while and now if I go back here clicks
and you can see that we have a sent
email as you can see there there is
email there so that's really short
introduction on how to send an email
using Gmail so using this method you're
limited to 99 messages per day so if you
were going to set up a real life social
network or something like that and you
really wanted to send lots of emails you
have to pay for it but the setup would
be exactly the same you would just
change the host on the username and the
password to whatever service you're
using you could even be using Google for
that as well next we're going to
incorporate this into our social network
series what we're going to be sending
confirmation emails to users whenever
they create an account so that's it for
