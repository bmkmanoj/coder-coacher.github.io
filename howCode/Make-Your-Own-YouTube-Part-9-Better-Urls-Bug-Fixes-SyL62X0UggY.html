before we get started I'm just going to
say the obvious and say that I am I
change the color scheme of the computer
that's because well I got bored of
looking at the same colors all the time
I just thought it would be nice to
change it and also it should be giving a
better at frame rate on the recordings
because this is less intensive on the
graphics card so it should just make me
a frame rate of the videos higher the
last change in me did was I mean the a
font of a bit smaller so they can fit
more code in so if anyone finds this too
small just leave a comment on let me
know when I'll just increase it to what
it was but that's it for the changes and
then that let's get started with the
video so today we're going to be doing
as I said in the last video is we're
going to be fixing this bug with the
code the other thing we're going to be
doing is we're going to be changing
weather channel's URL works so instead
of saying channel dot PHP ? c equals
creative code it's going to be / channel
/ creative code whoops a creative code
so that that's what we're going to be
doing is in the set video so let's get
started so first thing we're going to do
is want to fix the a CSS book with the
side menu that we saw in the last video
so to do that I'm going to go to the
side style at CSS file and here it says
that channel options so I assume this is
it and we're going to change this from
position fixed too let's try to display
inline now let's just see what this hot
what happens now so if we refresh the
page so as you can see if we scroll down
no that doesn't follow us but it still
has this problem here so we need to do
is we need to get that to resize with
the page so I think we could do for that
is so what we're going to do affects
this is we're going to make this this
but we're going to keep this way it is
but we're going to change this I'll show
you in a second
so what we're going to do is we're going
to say height is one hundred percent
minus 40 pixels because it's 40 pixels
from the top of the page so we want to
take 40 pixels off the height of the div
okay maybe no it just to minus-40 yeah
some reason that's not working so well I
doesn't matter with you now move on we
can leave that out so I'm what we're
going to do is okay yeah the problem
that what that was is we said from the
top of the page before one so we get rid
of that so we're going to leave that
like that and then we're going to just
work here and refresh and you can see we
have this problem it's too tall down
here it's 40 pixels too tall so to fix
that what we're going to do it so the
best we're way to fix this is to do what
we did last time so say top 40 pixels
and then say a position fixed and then I
what we'll see here is here it sort of
stays there but as you can see it moves
when we scroll so at the fix that what
we're going to do is we're just going to
go down okay to do this properly we're
going to just right click here on the
image just right click on the any where
the thumb image on the page we're going
to view the source and if we scroll down
we can see this dip is called a video or
channel video container so this this
white box basically that holds all these
pictures is called a channel video
container and what we're going to do is
we're just going to say dot channel
video container and then in here we're
just going to say overflow auto and then
height is 100 percent so now you'll see
if we refresh okay
something's gone wrong okay so what we
need to do is we need to change this to
our we need to just add float right
because what's actually happening is
they're all just going behind this grab
are so now if we float right we can see
them here the only problem is there's no
set with sort of RM height or I mean
actually shut the high to 100 pixels so
when you set that to 100 and look a
hundred percent is not good because it
does this you can see here it fills the
whole page and doesn't do what we want
so we're going to do is we're going to
change this to overflow scroll let's
just see how so as you can see it sort
of gives the effect of all because we
can move these without moving the grab
bar which is the sort of fact we were
going for so what we want to do is we
want to set width at one hundred percent
so at what we're going to do is we're
just going to change width from one
hundred percent to like 75 percent and
then we need to go text align right and
now if we refresh the page that's not
enough space so we can change it to
eighty-five percent so there are videos
are taking up the full length or a full
size you want or we can I move them
around but we just need to get rid of
this bar nine okay so to keep things as
simple what we're going to do is we're
just going to change this to auto for
now and then later on we might use a
javascript sort of way to do it to make
fill the page but we also okay here we
need to change this height because we
can actually give that is 100 and we can
change this height to an auto
because that is what you know so we want
to do is we just want to change the
height to ninety percent and then you
can see we can ask roller on the videos
on it doesn't affect the arrest of the
page we also make it without bar so we
can just set the width to animal eighty
percent just get rid of the bar and a
better way is actually keep that at 85
and then just change the overflow x oops
overflow x2 auto which just means the
overflow on the x-axis which is across
the ways and as you can see it just
disappears so here it is it's all
working on ad we're ready to move on so
the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to work on getting the URL
to look like / channel / creative not
again whoops / creative code so that's
pretty easy to do so we're going to do
that not so just go to the members page
doesn't matter we're going to do is run
a create a new file and we're going to
save it as all files oops in video box
now we want to see if in the root
directory and we're going to call it da
tht access and what HT access allows you
to do is it allows things like the URL
thing you were doing and it allows loads
of things but that's we're going to be
using it for so the first thing we need
to do is we need to write rewrite that
base a normally if you're on your own
web server it's just a forward slash and
sometimes you don't even need it but
normally such a forward slash because
you're already in the root directory by
default but if you go here you can see
I'm at localhost which would be my root
directory but then I'm in a folder
called tutorial and then a folder called
video box so i need to put that in so i
need some i rewrite base instead of my
root directory it needs to look for the
video box folder so what we need to do
is we just need to tie pins last
tutorials / video box and then obviously
if we're putting this
on the internet we would just delete a
lot and just leave it as rewrite base
with a forward slash for the root
directory so next what we need to do is
we need to turn the rewrite engine on
which is just a thing in HD access that
allows us to actually I added things
like the URL so that the way it works is
it uses regular expressions to I change
that so we're going to write rewrite row
and then this is where I put a regular
expression so where we write rewrite
rule just copy it it doesn't really
matter it's just you don't really need
that I know the regular expression
because I can explain it afterwards so
it I'm just going to do add is add with
that lower case and then uppercase a and
a proper kiss side then a 0 to 9 and
then an underscore and then a minus and
then we close it off with a square
bracket then a plus then parentheses
like we start we open it with the
parentheses when you close it with one
and then we just put the dollar sign
because that's just another character
we're not going to be using these are
just two random characters we are going
to be using for a row so we can just put
them in there and then we put in a
channel PHP at ? c equals dollar sign
one and this is our rewrite rule okay
someone explain this to you know so what
does rewrite real says is basically
accept anything that's an answer is an
air too sad so any ladder on the
keyboard not symbols or anything just
matters at lower case add two lowercase
add anything in between then we want to
also accept uppercase characters we want
to accept we want to accept numbers we
want to accept underscore round- we
don't want to accept characters like I
don't know a pound sign or dollar sign a
percentage or that because that could
have potentially create security flaws
and we just throwing them in this it
doesn't really matter this yeah
the important thing to understand is
just that what we allow in a regular
expression the next thing we do is the
page you want the rewrite rule to act on
which is channeled up PHP because that's
what the channels are on and then
obviously its channel a dollar sign c
equals because that's how we get to our
channel and then the final one is the
creative code and that is that an
argument so that's just what percentage
one thing that just means argument if
you have multiple arguments you do
percentage to and things like that but
we only have one so that's all we need
and that should be it so if we come here
and we refresh the page and nothing will
have changed because we haven't affected
any pages we just change the HT Access
file so we're going to do is we're just
going to type in / creative code and hit
enter okay so something didn't work so
the reason it didn't work is because I
have the rewrite be a set to the wrong
address because i spelt video wrong oops
so let's try it and I refresh and here
it is it takes us to creative codes
channel so the next thing we want to do
is you could leave like that if you
wanted but the way I wanted it is I want
it's a video box 4 / channel forward
slash and then their user or the add
channel name I don't want it to just be
challenging because i'm going to say
that for profiles so what we're going to
do is we're just going to in between
this and the yeah parenthesis we're just
going to write a channel forward slash
and that should be it so now if we
refresh it's going to say object not
find but not if we put in a / channel /
and then whoops I saved it or try to a /
creative code if I just hit enter know
it takes us to the page but the reason
this is not showing up right is because
if we view source it's looking for the
CSS directory inside any channel
directory because the dot forward slash
means look
the current directory and there is no
channel folder so there's no knows that
no CSS file within it so if we were to
click on this it says compound because
this is the dress it's looking for so
what we need to do is work is it we need
to actually go into the header file so
include I mad hatter dot PHP and in here
what we do is we just ignore this it
doesn't matter and here it is we look
for the CSS files so what we need to do
is interesting to change this so on your
site you would change it you probably
wouldn't need to change you just delete
the dot and we look for the root
directory and then CSS but if your look
if you're like me and you're in the root
directory and then it's followed by two
subdirectories we wanted to we can't use
this because it looked for local o / CSS
last side salad CSS but that doesn't
exist so we need to write in ford /
localhost forward slash tutorials /video
box all we need to do that for all of
these what I'm not going to do that I'm
just going to leave that up to you if
that's what you want to do because
obviously your URL will be different it
would be local o / tutorial / video box
but i'm just going to show you that's
how we fix it so if we reload the page
okay okay yeah okay the reason that then
work is because there's no there's no a
local host folder we should get rid of
that because when we put the forward
slash at the start it looks for it goes
to the root directory which in this case
is localhost but local host isn't
actually a folder and then I after that
I just follows all the regular thing is
so Alex in the tutorials folder so the
for class just basically just take that
as localhost so now if we refresh it
should work and here it is so that's it
for this video don't forget to Like
favorite comment and subscribe I know
this video was a little bit shorter than
usual
I think we got a lot of good things
covered because I'm the channel you're
our mouths and things are looking a lot
better and now we can also do one more
thing if we want before we go we can
copy this or just delete all this and
change this to profile and then change
this to you for a user and then now if
we type in a video box for smash Francis
we get my profile up so that's how we do
it for the profiles as well so thanks
for watching and don't forget to Like
favorite comment and subscribe and again
since I changed some of the design
things about not necessarily the website
by the way I record the videos I'd love
to hear what you have to say about it if
you think the fonts too small just tell
me I'll change it if you think you don't
like new color scheme I just tell me
I'll change it and that's it if you have
any suggestions for videos just ask me
and I will add do my best to make them
so thanks again i'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
