today I want me what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be learning how
to create our own version of es de vc or
if you were familiar with the other one
could see see that's gon die but if I
click here you can see it brings up a
website that's how Cody SVC and es de vc
is the extension and this is just the
sort of default page before the domain
setup so I'm what I'm gonna be showing
you how to do is create a website like
this where we can type something in so
let's say just type anything and I click
search texas de esta VC and I ignore the
stylesheet problem the moment it says
that the domain is available so we can
register it and we can get around omean
with it so I'm going to be showing you
how to create your own service like this
in this series of videos so let's get
started so the first thing you need to
do is you need to have either a
dedicated server or a virtual private
server or you have root access to it so
you could add to do to get one of these
servers you have to go to a server host
so the one I use know what I'd recommend
is digital ocean so you can go to you
can go register our digital ocean one by
going to haikou de so I stay on the
score ocean I just like to be in the
description but it's just basically it's
saying hi code /t underscore ocean with
a dot between the own d so if we just
hit enter it will just take us to
digital ocean we just log in there and
create our server so the process of
creating server is pretty simple and
I've shown it before so I'm not going to
ensure it again but all you do is you
click create server you pick a good to
x64 12.04 and that's basically all you
have to do so let's just closer to that
and then you'll have something similar
this so I'm just logged into it at the
moment and the first thing we need to do
is we need to install the dns server for
our server so the sir the dns server
we're going to be using is called bind
so we're going to say app on it apt-get
install find 9 and then we're just going
to hit enter it's going to ask us do we
want to install it so just give it a
second
okay so we're just going to click y tu
well it says do you want to continue yes
or no so i click y to say yes
and this is just going to install the
bind dns server on our server
ok so the bind dns server has just
finished installing and the one thing i
forgot to say is the extension we're
going to be using in this series so at
the moment ESL vc obviously use the DA
Tiesto Avicii extension and the way that
works is it's just basically a domain
that's ES and then the extension of the
domain is VC so i just bought the e at
the domain eswc not time in eswc so what
i'm going to do for this series is i'm
going to use the extension dot TLD I
code.org so this will just this is just
a subdomain of how code org that are
going to be using for the extension so
I'll show you here this is it here this
is the extension and it links to the
high code city and server that's the
other idea the other server I used and
that's the other one I'm going to be
using for this tutorial as the dns
server so let's just and minimize that
so that's it for this video don't forget
to Like comment favorite and subscribe
and in the next video we'll be setting
up our DNS server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
