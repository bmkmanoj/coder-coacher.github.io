as you can see this video is a new
series and it's the first video and it
obviously and what this series is as the
title suggests it's just going to be am
me showing you how to create your own
YouTube from scratch this series is
going to be very similar to the social
network one because YouTube is um sort
of like a social network as because it
is users and things about but we're
going to be at doing things away batter
in this series because because in the
last series we have cut corners and
tried to do things because it was
quicker or simpler or whatever that's
why in this series we're going to be
doing everything improperly and since
we've already had some experience in it
it should make things a lot easier but I
was originally going to do this series
in January I was going to start it then
but the menu we used in the social
network one since I didn't make it I
thought it was well I got it for free
off some website but I assumed it was
just free download because it was free
like or I got it but turns out it could
um it could be copyrighted I'm not sure
if it is or not I don't think it is but
I'd rather be safe than sorry so
unfortunately what I'm going to have to
do is I'm going to have to remove the
social network videos and that's why I'm
replacing them with these and before you
go and unsubscribe just hear me out
because these videos are going to be a
lot better there M if you saw well
obviously if you saw the first eight or
nine of the social network videos you'll
know they were really crap I'm really
bad quality and things in out so that's
why these ratings are going to be a
better quality and they're just going to
be easier to understand I'll go through
things slower um make sure that I
explained things properly and we're
going to be making everything ourselves
from scratch because that was the only
problem with the last video I mean I
could change the menu
but that means for all the other videos
up to this point the point where art
would be pointless because I'd have to
remove the source code from the
description and I don't want to do that
so what I'd rather do is remove them and
replace them with something that's
better so again I'm sorry about this but
um I don't want to risk the menu being
copyrighted because I don't want to get
me or any of my subscribers in trouble
so I'm I'm afraid this is the only thing
I'm ready I can do but I suppose it's
going to be good as well because this
series since it's going to be better
then we're going to learn more and then
we can do whatever we want with our
social network because we're going to
have me at all ourselves from 100% from
scratch so thanks for watching this
introduction and I hope to see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
