how to use Rattus so what is Rattus it's
a no SQL database also known as a key
value store which essentially means when
you want to store something in Rattus
you don't store it in a table inside a
database you give it a key which is just
a name and then when you want to get
something out of the database you just
access it using its name again so you
kind of query the database like you
can't emasculated database they are much
faster than SQL because all they have to
know is the key to be able to retrieve
something from the database so i'm going
to run Rattus on a cloud server so this
is the first time I've used this server
so I have to say ABS get update this
updates all my repositories which will
allow me to download gratis neither
we've updated the repositories we'll be
able to find Radice so if I type in
apt-get install Radice server so those
Rattus installs and to start Radice all
we have to do is type in gratis CLA for
Raddatz command-line interface on that
and now we can see our Rattus server is
running on the port six three seven nine
so rather size five data types and as
strings
it has lists and has sets and has sorted
sets and it has hashes so string is
pretty simple to set a string all we do
is we say set and we'll give it a name
we'll say high code and we can give it a
value so we'll say echo dot or we hit
answer you can see router says okay to
sell us that the string was created and
to retrieve the string we can't type in
something like hoe code you can see we
get an error instead what we do is we
say get local really simple it works
just as you'd expect we can also store
numbers so I can just set edge equal to
ten and of course I can take at edge
radish commands aren't actually case
sensitive so I could take that edge and
you'd see it would work exactly as we'd
expect
although the keys are case sensitive so
you can see edge is lower case if I was
to say get edge you can see we get nail
because that key doesn't exist
radda sighs what's called atomic
operations which means if two people
were to access the server at the same
time and they were to retrieve the same
value at the same time and they wanted
to increment the value or increase it or
change it in any way they'll be able to
do that without interfering with each
other an example of an atomic operation
in Rattus is the increment operation so
because age is the number 10 I can say
incr for increment I can set age and you
can see it's incremented it by 195 SEC
at age you can see it returns 11 instead
of 10 we can also delete a key by saying
DL age now if I say cat
age you can see we get nail age was
needed we can also set keys to expire so
I can say expire edge in 10 seconds now
if I was to take at edge you can see we
still get 12 but after 10 seconds the
edge Kitty will be deleted so it's been
10 seconds though so if I was to say cat
edge now you can see we got now because
edge was deleted the second data type
and Radice is less under list is just
like an array and any other language so
if I wanted to create a list I have to
just push one element onto the list and
I can push from either direction I can
push from the left or push from the
right so to push on to the end of the
list I'm going to say or push and I'll
give the list the name of my list and
I'll push on the word Frances now you
can see we have a list with one item if
I was to say I'll push my list and I was
a sad Mac to me that will push on to the
start of the list and if I was to know
say range I give it my list and then I
give it my range which in this case is e
0 settlement to the end of the list
which will be minus 1 UNCA get both
elements printed out it fails to say L
range my list from 0 to 1 we get the
same result if I say 0 to 0 we just go
back and we printed out because that is
the first element on the list we can
also remove an element from the list
we'd say I'll pop my list and that will
remove the element at the end of the
list and it returns that element and now
if I do our range you can see it's
removed that element Rattus also has
what are called set sets are a bit like
a reson list so both used to store
groups of data but a set doesn't have an
order so you can't index a set you don't
know whereabouts in a set any particular
item is and a set can't have duplicates
so to create a set all we have to do is
we have to add one element to it so we
say s odd for sat odd we want to give it
an e/m will set my set and we'll set
Francis so now we've a set with one
element if I say ass out again my set
and I'll say the word ho code we've a
set with two elements but we don't know
were about in the set each element is we
can't guarantee the Francis is the first
element and we can't guarantee that high
code is the second element because stats
don't have a concept of which element
came first the only thing I can do to
check if an element is in a set as I say
s is member for set is member may set
and then I give it a name st. Francis
you can see I get one return for true if
I save Francis McNamee you can see I get
0 because there is no element called
Francis McNamee in the set I can also
remove elements in the set I can say s
Ram for s removed my sets process you
can see there it's deleted
so stats are currently limited by the
fact that they have no concept of order
you don't know why about since at any
particular animate days you can just
tell whether to that or not so because
of that Radice has created another data
type called a sorted set so instead of
starting your keyword with an ass for
set we start with a Z and that's how we
create a sorted set so we say is that
odd for sorted set odd will set sorted
set we can add anything we want but we
have to give our elements a priority so
they said one to this element and I say
have Francis you can see we just added
that if I says add add sorted set - I
said Connor you can see with two items
in the set but because Francis has a
lower score than Connor
that means the item Francis will be the
first item in this set and Connor will
be the second item in this set as you
can get all the elements in the set Jean
says add range sorted set sort the 0th
index go to the end of the set negative
we get both items printed out so you're
probably thinking this is just the same
as a list but a sorted set instead of
set so you can't have duplicates but you
can't have duplicates in a list so the
last data type is a hash hashes and
Radice are just maps between keys and
values so you can store a hash that has
failed and you can use that to represent
objects so if I want to create a hash
say for example I want to represent an
object and maybe I want to represent a
user in a database I could say hit set
and I give the user a name I'll give it
to Francis and I'll say the full name
fails will have the value of Francis and
then you can see that has just been set
this hash has an e in Francis and it has
one field called full name and it's full
name field has a value of Francis so a
bit like an object-oriented programming
if you wanted to create a user object
you have the user's name will be the
name of the object and you have a field
for each of the different values you
want to set about the user if I want to
set multiple values I can say here am
set for hits multiple set give it a name
I can give it to seeing them again to
override it give it full name Francis
McNamee and I could give it another
field now I can give it as many fields
as I want I could say at YouTube for the
YouTube channel I just said hi code I
could say website just like that I hit
enter and now you can see that the key
Francis has been overwritten and now it
has three different fields and three
values in those fields you can retrieve
individual fields so in Python you write
retrieve a value from an object by
saying my object value something like
that in Rattus the way you do it is you
say huge gap you give the name of your
hash or your object and then you give
the name of the fails so in this case I
want the phone name field
you can see we at Frances McNamee
printed oh if I wanted to get every
detail about a user I can take each get
all Frances and now I don't need to
supply a field to trees because I want
to at the mall I hit enter now you can
see they come out in a list so that's
been a quick introduction to Rattus if
you want to see more videos about
Raddatz just let me know but that's it
