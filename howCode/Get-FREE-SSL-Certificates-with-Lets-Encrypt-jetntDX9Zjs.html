doing is we're going to be using our
best face cloud server or you can use
another brand of cloud servers to
generate an SSL certificate for the web
so we run on the server we're going to
be using let's encrypt which is a
certificate authority that is free and
it allows you to create signed
certificates that are valid in 99.9%
browsers and they're 100% free so to get
started what we're going to do is we
first need to have a ubuntu server so
here you can see this is a VPS that's
running Ubuntu 14.04 2068 bit version
and so what I did to do that well they
just use the same VPS from the last
video I click OS reinstall when that
loads I go down here and I look for
Ubuntu 14.04 I just choose a password
and I click reinstall whenever I that's
done it usually takes about a minute
then the V PS is good to go it's like a
brand new VPS and you should be at the
same point as me which is here this is a
brand new VPS I haven't done anything to
it all I've done is reinstall the
operating system so the first thing
we're going to do on the VPS is we're
going to opt get update and it's going
to update the repositories for us to be
able to download every file we need to
be able to run that's encrypt because
otherwise we might get an error when
we're trying to run it so as you can see
it's just check for updates and there
aren't any updates available as minute
when you do a fresh install on your
server you probably want to run this
command and it will update any
repositories to make sure that you're
able to Dino with all the packages you
need so what we're going to do is we're
going to go to let's encrypt which is
their github page which is here and you
can see this is it here we don't need to
read this we just need to download it
so we're going to do is run click right
click on download zip I'm going to click
copy link address then what we're going
to use is the W Gate command which is a
lot which allows us to download files
over HTTP I'm going to paste in that
link we just copied then when we hit
enter it'll download of course there's a
downloaded and if I click LS list the
directory then what I'm going to use is
the unzip command and I'm going to unzip
about zip which is the file which is
downloaded so that's it unzipped if I
left this again you can see we have a
folder we can remove the master dubstep
ruler now with the RM command and now
we'll let we're left with just a folder
so before we go any further we need to
create our domain name because as you
can see at the minute I'm logged into
the VPS I'm using at IP address but for
assets I was telling it to work we need
to give it a host name so if I go back
to bath space you can see the host name
I chose for this server was clogged up
Francis McNamee calm but I can actually
choose whatever host name I want that's
just the DNS they might choose to point
to it so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to use es da VC to get a free host
name for our server we can use this
domain here because it's already
pointing to our server's IP address but
what I'm going to do to make this as
affordable as possible is I'm going to
use the SVC because if we use ESWC to
get a free domain name and we use that
to encrypt to get a free SSL certificate
all we have to do is pay two dollars 50
a month for the VPS server which we can
get from bare space using the VPS promo
code so what I'm going to do is go to es
de VC and this is the new ESWC here so
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to type in domain name to see if it's
available so I'm just going to type in
something like secure done ESWC I'm
going to click register see is it
available and you can see it says domain
available login to register it so what I
do is I log in and I need to click this
and it will bring up my Google account
and then I can log in so I'm logged in
by es da VC account and you can see this
is the brand new ESWC what I can do now
is register our domain names what I do
is I click the new domain button a
drop-down will appear and what I can do
is I can choose the extension I want to
register I'm just going to register a
regular ESWC domain name I'm going to
click pardon to type into QR ESWC so
what I can do now is click confirm to
register the domain name so if I click
confirm what'll happen is the tremaine
gets registered and you can see here it
is here so what I'm going to do now is
I'm going to click on it and it brings
us to our overview
I click added DNS I can add the DNS
record for our server so here we can see
I if I add an air record which is an
ipv4 address I choose the record name if
I type in secure because the domains
name is secured at swc then that will
create an air record for secured NSWC
pointing to our IP address so the way I
get the IP address is I just go to our
control panel here and I copy it from
here and then I go back here and I just
paste it in here I can set the time to
live which is how long a DNS server will
cache it for so I'm just going to leave
it at one minute for now usually what
you would want to leave it at is
something like one day or two days or
maybe six hours or something like that
but for the city of the tutorial I would
leave it at 60 seconds and we're going
to do is click add record so you can see
that our record has been added so now if
I go to our server we should be able to
type in security swc and it will take us
to our server so now what we're going to
do is going to CD into the let's encrypt
directory so we do that by typing CD
let's and then if we hit the tab on the
keyboard it will fill it out for us when
we hit enter and that takes us into the
folder if we LS again you can see we
have all these files the file were
concerned about is the Latin crypt -
audio file that's the program we're
going to run to generate our certificate
so we're going to do first is we're
going to install Apache which is a web
service will type apt-get install Apache
- we hit Y and this will install it for
us
you
so that's Apache installed and that
means our web servers installed so if I
take the IP address of the server and I
navigate to it in a new tab you can see
we now have a web server working is
serving this web page to us so now if I
go to security at ESWC we should get
exactly the same page if I hit enter you
can see by going to security swc we have
the exact same web page so now that we
have our domain name on a web server
we're ready to set up our certificate so
we do that by running the let's encrypt
Auto file so we type LS again we can see
this is the folder and this is the file
we want so if I just copy that and I put
a dot another slash to run this as a
script and then I paste this in and hit
enter
you
so here we are inside let's encrypt and
what we're going to do here is we're
going to follow through all these steps
and this will generate and install our
certificate for us so I'm just going to
hit enter to say yes to this message
then I'm going to add to our domain name
so if my host name was Clyde Francis
McNamee com
that's what I'd put in here and now but
because I want to create a certificate
for secured at ESWC what I need to do is
type in secured at ESWC and I hit enter
here I'm going to put in the email
address for any problems with the
certificate so I'm just going to type
status at hi code.org I'm going to agree
to the let's encrypt Terms of Service
and what you can do here is you can
choose to force all requests to be
secured but what I'm going to do is just
keep things simple and make it optional
so that inside of our website
configuration we can choose whether or
not to force users to use HTTPS or not
so I'm just going to hit enter whenever
easy is selected and there we have our
certificate has been installed so now if
I hit enter again to say ok there we
have our certificate installed on our
server so now if I type in HTTPS secure
dot eswc and I hit enter you can see we
are now running HTTPS website the reason
it's not green is because inside of this
HTML page some of the files are
referenced using HTTP instead of HTTPS
that makes more sense we look here you
can see that the website is secure but
it says this page includes includes
other resources which are not secure so
for the sake of the video to show the
green HTTPS in the corner I'm just going
to delete this page so to do that I'm
just going to type RM which is the
command to remove something telling of
type minus or which means recursively
because I want to delete a directory and
I'm going to type slash var slash www 10
ml and this is the folder that we are
serving our website from I hit enter
that removes that and I'm going to click
our title mixer and slash flower so I'll
use HTML and that recreates the folder
for us and then we're going to do is I'm
going to create a file so I'm going to
type Nano index
whoops Nano / bar / WWE HTML /
index.html and I'm just going to type
hello world then I'm going to save this
and if i refresh this page you can see
now we add our pages hello world and you
can see we're using HTTP it's also not
required if I delete that and just try
to access the page using regular HTTP
you can see it works as well so that's
it for this video don't forget to Like

see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
