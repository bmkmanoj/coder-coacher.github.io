today we're gonna be doing is we're
gonna be uploading at profile images and
because all right channel icons or
whatever yeah because that's easier than
uploading videos but there's not much
difference videos just take longer to
finish working out how to upload them
but once we get the profile images
uploaded
yeah it'll be easy because we can just
copy the same script across and use it
for profile picture
alright profile our videos so let's get
started
so I'm gonna create a file and the file
is gonna be called the files going to be
called upload image dot PHP now we're
going to click Save
so now what we're gonna do is we're
going to include the header file
obviously so include I'm just gonna find
the exact folder so it's includes slash
header dot PHP includes slash header dot
PHP and then what we're going to do is
we're just going to create I hate a hat
or two tag that's just going to be
called upload your channel image then
below here we're going to create a form
the form action is going to be equal to
UM think formal action is going to be
equal to upload image
HP they method he's gonna make this post
the input type is gonna be equal to the
input type is going to be file the name
is gonna be channel underscore pick the
value is gonna be upload your image so
let's see this so we just go to video
box forward slash upload image dot PHP
and we see here we have a file a file an
option but we need out of submit button
so we can just copy this alright just
I'm even actually so input type equals
submit name equals submit and then value
equals upload image it doesn't really
matter what we give it as a value so
here it is so we can add like a file we
can choose what we want we can upload it
just by clicking the button and then
that will submit the form but what we
need to do is we need to since it's a
form for uploading an image we need to
say tank type or in Craig I like
encryption sort like encryption type as
multi parked forward slash form data and
then what we need to do is we're just
gonna say up here like we normally do if
is set
submit and we are go image uploaded so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna add
an image I know these are the images
from any 5friends videos but it doesn't
matter so I'll just stop with the search
button click upload image it says image
uploaded ok so now we know our forms
that submit incorrectly what we need to
do is we need to actually upload the
images so in here we're going to say
it'll actually change this instead of if
nice at post submit we could say if a
set files and then the name of the file
so I child pic and then this at the
moment this will give us the same result
but then in here what we want to say is
if a dollar underscore files channel pic
and then directly beside this we want to
put it another set of square brackets
anything about type and then in here or
I said the square brackets and one but
two equals to compare and then two
single quotes and then in here we put
image slash all right JPEG so whoops
files so what this says is if files and
then in the files thing it looks for
channel pick which is the file input
type and then it looks for the image or
the certain type of image which in this
case is JPEGs we can also do or so we
could say oops
so we just go in here we could say or
and then we could do another image type
so just open that RSR on that one
another side of parentheses and then in
here we want to set it around this one
another set and we just want to copy
this and then we want to paste it in
here and change this to PNG and then do
another one so if we were gonna order
and then another one this time say gif
so here we have three types of files
that we're going to accept and then in
here if if it's one of those files we
accept it or else we'll just actually
died in valid file so now if we come
over here and we look up line 10 is here
so yeah okay die is if function so we
put it around here so in here we want to
do is run upload an image so our file
and a get dot d a store image isn't
isn't either a dot gif or PNG or jpg so
if I upload this it says invalid file
but if I upload PNG file it lets us I
continue on some what we want to say is
we want to create a well when we do this
so if I was to do this it's actually it
actually is uploading the file we're
just it's in a temporary directory we
haven't contacts to use it yet so we
need to do is we need to actually
allow ourselves to use it so to do that
we're going to create a around them or a
folder that's around on the me and to
contain the image so I'm going to create
a variable called chars I'm going to set
it equal to every single character in
the alphabet and every number so it I'll
just come back whenever it's done so
here's our variable chars it's got every
letter in the alphabet and then every
other alphabet uppercase and it has some
numbers as well and then we want to do
is when I create a variable called
random directory we're gonna call or
we're gonna set it equal to the
substring and well okay it doesn't I
just ignore this this is just around
them and we're we're gonna run generate
a random string but we're gonna use
these functions so the sub STR function
and then the string shuffle function
haven't you done what they do it doesn't
really matter they just randomly then
mess up the chart the characters and put
them in a random order and the things
like that so then we've done that what
we're gonna do now is going to make the
directory so we're going to make Dara
function and we're gonna say data slash
channels slash images slash pictures
gonna wear this icons slash random
directory and then just need we just
need to do I do this so we can use the
variable okay and then what we're going
to do is we're going to run the script
really so I'm going to upload an image
problem with our with our a variable in
our function so in line 7 we're looking
for char and I called it chars so whoops
just do that let's try not ok the reason
we're getting this error is because I've
told it to create this directory but
it's a RM I've told it to go inside of
all these directories and then create
this one but these don't exist yet so we
need to create those 9 so here I'm just
going to change the view whoops okay
I'll change it to that and then what
we're gonna do is we're just going to
right click and insert a folder and
we're going to call it data and then
inside data what we're gonna do is we're
going to add a new folder again and
we're going to call it channels and then
inside channels we're going to create
another new folder and in here we're
going to call it whoops
now we're gonna call it images and then
inside images we're going to create
another folder called icons so now if we
go here and we try to upload another
image
ok let's try that again you probably
didn't get along enough to pick it and
here we have it and in here we have
randomly generated folder now we can
open and it's auntie so we're almost
done with the file upload so what we're
gonna do now is we're going to say if
file underscore exists and then we just
copy this I mean yeah okay and then once
we we haven't actually checked at the
file exists this is checks if the photo
this is just checking folder exists so
we want to check the file so to do that
we just append dollar sign underscore
files whoops and then we're going to say
channel pic and then here we're gonna
send in to get the nyan tribute from the
yeah channel pic so then we're going to
say is we're just going to create an if
statement and we're just going to echo
if it's true I go oops
image exists or else and that if it
doesn't exist then we obviously need to
put it in that folder so we're going to
move it so we're going to move the
uploaded file using the move uploaded
file function so I move underscore
uploaded file and then we just say
Dawson underscore files channel
pick ten name and then here any second
parameter we give it is the location we
want to move it to so we want to copy
this and paste it in here and then we
asked you need to also specify any mean
of the file so now we've done that we're
going to say and now we can move the
file we're going to just leave it like
that for the moment
oops so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna just see does this work so I'm
gonna meet right okay we have a syntax
error on line 16
it's probably just missing a semicolon
or something all right
curly brace no unexpected curly brace so
we get rid of one of these and then
refresh okay so here's the problem we've
got a files and I'm going to their house
here so what we need to do is we're just
going to I'm gonna change this I have
one of these here so we're going to just
copy this and we're going to say
change this to an if now we're gonna say
if it doesn't equal that or that or that
so let's try no unexpected and we just
need to get rid of that
let's try no it's not we're gonna just
going to upload a file so the search
icon we're gonna upload I'm gonna click
upload image so we get invalid file but
that's how I look our image does get
uploaded as you can see our image has
been uploaded it's just not been
uploaded into the right folder but we
actually don't need this folder because
we just get the images to upload into
icons because I might simplify things so
let's do that actually so we'll get rid
of the m-step or we need to make folder
so it's just rid of this
let's try uploading it again
we still get accurate invalid file but
our image gets uploaded so just keep on
there because that's what's keeping and
working that's but we don't need to make
the directory so we can just get rid of
this so we don't need to create the
directory we just create the image or
not create the image upload the image we
get involved file but as you can see it
does get uploaded so I didn't see the
images are being uploaded so what we
need to do is we need to fix that so it
doesn't keep saying invalid file so
let's just get rid of this okay so I
just got rid of this so we can for some
reason it seems to be working in so
we'll just change it back to else and
let's have a look okay so for some
regions it isn't working
so we'll move it like this let me see
okay so a good idea to do is just took
on the same if statement twice just for
simplicity it's not the most efficient
thing to do but we can you just do it
anywhere it doesn't matter so we'll run
this twice the first time we run it all
the time at this time if it's true and I
realms will do nothing and then if it's
false then yeah I died out so this way
we only see invalid file if the file is
that is uploaded is actually invalid it
doesn't give us any errors we can stand
we can still upload things to our
profiles so as you can see if I upload
another file I put another one
this here you can see that another image
is added so sad another one as you can
see another one gets added and so forth
so our image uploading is definitely
working that's it for this video in the
next video what we'll be doing is we'll
be inserting the URL or the name of the
image into a database and associating it
with the user who uploaded it and then
that way all right with the channel of
the user who uploaded it and then that
way we'll be able to show it here and
then if we have time in the next video
then we'll start we'll also start the
video upload process as well and we'll
get a lot started and then have finished
so that's it for this video don't forget
