you the brand-new best based website and
I'll write our latest product the best
phase cloud servers so if we just go
over the website we can just see here's
the brand new best best website it's
much more easy to use than the last one
it's a lot cleaner it's also responsive
which means that it would look good on
any device so if I just go here to learn
more about our as shard hosting you can
see that here it is here's all the
tables with the features and things laid
out that's a lot nicer looking than the
previous design and we have a message
displaying our use of cookies at the top
so that's pretty much the new website
it's just a lot easier to use in the old
one so that brings me under the second
thing I have to talk about and that's
the best phase cloud servers so if i
scroll down here you can see we offer
tiny hosting and you chose and these are
the two most popular plans we have for
cpanel hosting underpriced extremely
competitively 149 and 399 respectively
you can see if we go down here we can
change our currency to a suit whatever
your local currencies but here we have
our cloud server so we have our 512
megabyte cloud server and a 1 gigabyte
cloud server so the 512 megabyte cloud
server starts at five dollars a month so
you can see it has 20 gigabytes of disk
space one terabyte of bandwidth one cpu
core one dedicated ipv4 address a
dedicated ipv6 block which is a / 64
ipv6 subnet every server comes with root
access and it's you we use kvm
virtualization there's other types of
virtualization such as openvz and things
like that but kvm is regarded by most
people as the best type of
virtualization it's essentially the same
as having a dedicated server it lets you
do almost everything you do the
dedicated server I accept you going to
do it in a virtual environment which
means your costs are significantly
reduced which is why you get all this
for five dollars a month then we have a
1 gigabyte cloud server the only
difference is it has an extra CBE core
it is twice the bandwidth and as 10
gigabytes more disk space than the five
dollar month one so if I go up here I'm
going to go to our cloud servers which I
can learn more I'm going to create a
cloud server for myself so you can see
here we have a slider that lets you
just the size of the closer you want we
have our five dollar month one hour ten
dollar a month 1 $20 month one and forty
dollar a month on all of the servers can
be customized so if you want to server
with 20 gigabytes of disk space one
terabyte of falmouth on a 1 gigabyte of
RAM that's all available within our
control panel so here you can see the
forest service we offer so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to create a
five-dollar month one so I'm going to
click order and I you can see here I
have to pick a hostname for our server
so i can either register a domain name
and use that for the hostname i can use
a domain and I already have by
transferring it to best face or if I
have for example a subdomain or just to
do man whose name servers i can change
instead of transferring it I can do this
so I created a subdomain um called cloud
dot Francis mcnamee calm and I'm going
to use that for the cloud servers
hostname so here i have the cloud server
it says the building is five dollars per
month as we already aware i almost
forgot all servers come with one
gigabits per second port so what this
really means we're like getting to
tagging Elysians anything you done with
from your server will be quick out of
your server has to deal with a load of
people connecting it once it won't have
a problem because it has more than
enough bandwidth for all of them so here
what we do is we pick the operating
system for our virtual private server
what we can do is scroll down here you
can see we have you been to Santa
where's Gabi in fedora and it's
seriously it's a bit cut off of the
screen so what I'm going to do isn't
really install the latest version of you
going to you which is 15.4 and I'm going
to install the 64 bit version so we're
going to click Add to Cart so now i have
it my cart and what we did to get as
many people excited about our virtual
servers as possible as we created a
promo code so if you click in the box
and type in VPS as your promo code
you'll get fifty percent off your first
month of your virtual server which means
you get all this for two dollars and
fifty cents so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to check out I think
to log in first so i'm going to log into
my account so i just logged into my
account and what i'm going to do is I'm
going to click complete order then it's
going to take me to paypal and I'm going
to pack my virtual server and then bass
bass will set it up for me okay so once
you've paid for your server then it will
be SAT up straight away so i click on
services you can see i have one and you
can see here I have a B 1 512 megabytes
a big one is what we call the server i
got you can get a b2 b3 or before and
that is our four different types of
servers it's what i'm going to do is
click here and it will bring up the
information about my server so if i
scroll down you can see this is loading
this is the control panel for our
servers and i just need to give it a
minute for the server to provision and
then i should be good to go okay so what
I did was I waited for about 10 seconds
then the server was fully provisioned
I'm ready to go so what happens when you
create your server is you got an email
and the email has your password for your
root account on your server so if i go
to mail you can see here my VPS details
are here so the only thing i actually
need to copy is the password so i copy
this and i go back to the internet you
can see here's the IP address here so
i'm just going to move this storm i'm
just going to type in the IP address so
i'm going to type as this hitch and
that's how you ask this H into it and
type as a chroot which is the root of
current and then I put in the IP address
so that's 1 for 2 dot 54 dot one sixty
dot 67 I hit enter and it lasts me for a
password and the first asked me desk so
I'm just going to type yes let it let me
connect then I put in my password which
I just paste it in and a hit enter and
then I'm logged into the server so here
I am in the server itself so what I'm
going to do just to quickly show you
that the server works isn't gonna type
of patchy before I do that I'm actually
going to go to it myself i'm going to
now to get to that address so the server
hostname is clogged up Francis mcnamee
com I already created an area at the
points to the IP address of the server
so if i go to clog de France's mcnamee
calm and should connect to the server so
as you can see it says a connection
refused because we're not actually
running a web server from our server yet
so what I'm going to do to fix that as
we type apt-get install apache2 and what
this will do is it will download
gee onto the server which should give us
a working web server so here it wants to
ask me whether install it or not I click
why I type Y to accept up ok so that's
our server and running Apache nice so if
I go back to the internet and i refresh
this what we get is a working web page
and this is being served off of our own
cloud server so that's it for this video
