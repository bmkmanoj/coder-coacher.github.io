generating the title for our links so
let's get started so you'll see if we
come back to our code here the first
thing we want to do before we actually
insert a link into the database is we
want we want to generate the random
string that is going to be the link so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
paste in this function i fired and stack
overflow it's a function that generates
a random string we don't want any
numbers in our string so we're just
going to delete the number at the
beginning of it so we want an
alphabetical string to be generated the
length by default is 10 so we can live
with that so we're just gonna use the
generate random string function to
generate our title so the way we do that
is just come up here and say generate
title just to create a comments we know
what's going on then we're going to set
title equals generate random string and
that's all we have to do so what I'm
going to do is going to echo title and
I'm going to comment this out just
temporarily so that we can see it in
action so let's click you asked upload
the file
let's just click shortened link you can
see it generated a random string of
alphabetical characters and I click it
again you'll see we'll get a different
string
so we're going to use these for our
links so now that we have our title
generated we can uncomment this code and
we can just change this to we can
actually just put title straight in here
because we're not actually taking the
title from the user so no user input is
involved in this so we don't need to
worry about SQL injection which is why
we can put the title a variable in the
query but for consistency what we can do
is just put a question mark Darr we'll
just put another ass here just everyone
to strings and we will put another comma
here i will put title in there so that
just makes things a bit more consistent
so let's upload this and just put in a
linksys a google com it says done now
when you add click browse and you can
see it says google com on a test title
and we have our round and Link generated
and put in the field so another thing
we're going to do if we go back to our
links here you'll see that they have
nope HTTP or HTTPS in front of them so
we're going to put that in and if it's
not already there so what we do that is
we just come up here and we'll say
insert HTTP we'll just actually insert
HTTP because if HTTP ass is already
there we wanted to insert anything so
what's the insert HTTP and what we're
going to do is we're going to say if
post URL to shorten and we actually put
us in round brackets so we're going to
say if you are actually so we're going
to use the sub str functions worse S sub
str
you'll see here HTTP is for ladders then
it has a code on in two and forward
slashes so that's seven characters in
total so what we want what we're going
to put in here is a 0 or 0 7 so this
means want to get the first seven
characters of whatever the user puts in
this text box and we want to check in to
see if that equals HTTP colon for
salesforce life and then if it doesn't
we're going to prepend it to the string
so what we check it as we say equals
HTTP four times forward slash then we'll
say actually put a nought equals in
we'll just put a comment here then a
prepend HTTP colon for size 4 / so the
way we're going to do this we're going
to use a variable called URL will set it
equal to M HTTP books HTTP colon for
those four slash dot post whoops URL to
shorten and here we will just say copy
this and say else URL equals and our
post variable and we're going to instead
of putting it in here we're just going
to pass it URL verb so if we run this
now we should have HTTP up and adan are
prepended on to the start of our string
if we don't already provide it with one
so I'm just going to put in runs marconi
com
and you can see that was chance to http
Francis mcnamee com if I put in
HTTP I youtube com what we should get is
exactly what I put in the text box so
you can see now it says HTTP youtube com
so that's it for this video we don't get
to Like comment favorite subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
