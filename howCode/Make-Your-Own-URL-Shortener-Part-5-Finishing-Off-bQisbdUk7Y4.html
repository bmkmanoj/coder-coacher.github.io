doing is we're going to be using
htaccess to make our URLs actually work
we want them to so at the moment if we
wanted to pass data to our fire what we
have to do is type class index to PHP
and then we put a colon and then we put
like title equals whatever and obviously
that's a really long URL and it's not
that pleasant to look out so what we're
gonna be doing is changing it so that we
can just type something like this and it
will redirect us to the URL we want to
so when we do that as we use HT access
so here's the htaccess file I'm just
gonna paste in a room you don't need to
understand what the real does you just
need to paste it into your project and
then change this to title so I'll just
leave this on screen for a second so you
can write it into your project okay so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna go up
here and we're just going to say if is
sat cat title then we'll just echo the
title I would still say echo get title
so and we're going to upload these two
files so now that we've done that what
we're gonna do is we're just going to
type first we're just going to type
slash index dot PHP question mark title
equals test and I'm sure you can see we
a test print it out to us but obviously
this is really unpleasant to look at so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
delete everything here and we're just
going to go to min digest of AC for such
tests and enter and you can see we get
the same result if I change this to
Francis you see we get Francis Ackroyd
to us that's because we've used HT
access as rewrite rules to rewrite the
URL so that whenever the web server sees
this it's going to treat it as if it saw
this it just makes the whole thing a lot
nicer to log out and it makes the whole
concept more user friendly so what we're
gonna do now that we have the HT access
rules finished what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go to our file again and
then we're gonna say if it's at get
title then we're going to first check
the database to see if it exists and
then if it does we're going to
Sandhya's or to wherever the link is
pointing to so we do that is just going
to copy this code from down below and
change this to select link from our
database so what we're going to do is
when I change the MySQL query to say
select all from lengths VAR title is
equal to and we're just going to put a
question mark here so we're going to
delete this because when you need one
parameter to the background function and
we need one parameter pass so we're just
gonna put one answer and one title here
so what we're gonna do is we're going to
echo or actually will say print our
result and we're going to get the get
result method so we're going to upload
this and go back to our page we'll just
change this to the more user-friendly
version we'll hit enter and you see we
get filled part three but we get and
nothing returned to us because Francis
isn't one of the links so if I go back
to our database table you can see test
is one of our links so I'm just going to
put in slash test so you can see here it
says number of 0 the reason for that is
actually because we're using the title
variable here and that variable hasn't
actually been to declare it up here it's
been defined on here so what we need to
do is change this to cat title so let's
just refresh you can see it says number
is 1 so to actually get to the value
from that what we want to do is just
access the fetch associative method from
the get result method so let's just
refresh you can see we got one item
returned it says hi code.org and it says
title this test so now that we've got
the link from the database what we're
going to do is we're just going to say
go-to is equal to
result catch results fetch array then
what we're just going to say echo go to
one so this will just act with the first
element from the array well the second
element from the array actually so let's
just refresh okay we get an error okay
so let's get results not some method so
that's just refresh well that uploaded
again and refresh you can see we got
haiku org return to us so what I'm going
to do now is a header location and then
here we're just gonna say go to actually
want to say go to will just said gee I'm
a creative rival called J and Saturday
equal to go to one
so let's re-upload this let's refresh
we're gonna get is we're gonna get an
error because you see we're trying to
redirect to slash haiku org so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna put in bestest
that's Co shorten that link it says done
we don't actually know what the link is
yet
so you see here here's the link we just
shortened let's just copy it and let's
just paste it here and you can see it
takes us to bad space so with one last
thing to do before we instead of saying
done well we're just going to do is
we're going to echo your link as being
shortened here it is I'll just put a
brick tag in there
I'm will just append title on the end of
that and actually it but before we put
the title in the end of it we actually
just want to say
MnDOT ESWC /title I will a standard
let's just add the center tag here so
let's just go on to the page and let's
put in say I could our origin short that
it says your make has been shortened
here it is
MnDOT ESWC for sauce that is that end
and it takes us to haiku org so that's
it for this video don't forget to Like

see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
