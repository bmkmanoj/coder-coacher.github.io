this video hopefully it's the last part
and we'll actually see what what we've
been will actually see the result of
what we've been doing for the last two
videos and so what we're gonna be doing
today is going to be finishing off the
DNS server hopefully and so before we
let any further ado let's get started so
the first thing we need to do is we need
to open up the add names komtar local
file again Sony and dot-com dot local
and then we want to do is you just want
to copy this address copy it and then
close the file what's control X and then
we want to do is we just want to type in
Nano press or a right-click even to
paste it in then hit enter then we want
to do is we want to just type in and
just copy as I do for the moment in
x-ray and then this time put in server
dot then you just your extension and
then a dot afterwards it seems last time
in admin and dot server dot whoops you
see and then we just want to put the
apparatus or parentheses around it so
what we're going to do is we're just
going to actually control X then press
you ass and see if it and what we're
going to do is we're going to go up to
the local file or mean and whoops not
that file this file we're just going to
copy this stuff from in here from
earlier so in a copy I press ctrl to X
go back titty and the reverse films file
and we're just going to right click not
you paste it in ok so then what we want
to do is we just want to leave this part
blank press tab and then press I n space
NS and then we open server dot our
extension
then we want to do is we want to type in
the name and give our droplet which my
case is HC d NS so what I'm going to
type in here is here to see DNS aspect
space ion space PTR and then space and
then our extension again with no post-op
at the end the reason I put this HC DNS
in is because it's at is called a PTR
record on the digital ocean if your
droplets gives your droplets PTR record
whatever you call droplet so in my case
of itchy DNS and then we want to type in
is I n is PTR and then the add the
domain we give it was test so I just
want to put in test docking C dot and
that should be it so click control X
press Y hit enter and that should be is
sorted the final thing we have to do is
we need to add a file called resolve
Kampf so we need to type in a nano / e
TC slash resolve dot-com and resolve has
movie at the end of it arming the way
just a re s olv dot conf and this brings
up this file here this is the father
that's our drop that actually talked to
the Internet as you'll see the I thought
a 8.8.8.8 is that Google's at Public DNS
so what we need to tell you is we just
sorry what we need to do is we need type
in search it's C which tiles are at DNS
or research for our extension click
control X it yes and then hit enter the
final thing we have to do is we need to
restart our our find server so
buying server you just have to pissed in
this or being cop or writing right just
pasted it in because a hard to remember
so I just had to sit inside me and I
just hit enter and as you can see if I
screw push this back it says okay okay
so everything went okay that's that good
and then now what we're going to try to
do is we're going to try to connect to
our server so I'm just going to type in
new tab this will bring this up or
whatever then we want to do is you want
to type in test dot foe whoops not
Frances sorry else I was doing earlier a
test dot hits C forward slash press
ENTER and hopefully it takes us to my
code and here it is our DNS server is
working if I click on about us and
things as you can see we're on the test
I hate C I do mean with our own custom
extension that's that's actually yet and
because you could have actually you
didn't have to use digitalocean to get
your s server you could have just an you
know how to like an AA computer at your
house and made a local DNS server but
there was a good reason that we a set it
up on digital ocean it's because one it
means we don't have to have our computer
lying around okay we don't have to have
it's turned on all the time they do all
the devotions as servers have a really
really really fast internet so that your
um your website all load really quickly
all of solid-state this drives and also
it means it's connect you can connect to
it from anywhere in the world because if
it was a local DNS server it would only
be a you could only reach it with our
lon which means a computer sort of
within sort of probably at your house
only computers that could use it but
since we used digital oceans you put on
the internet now anyone who has our DNS
settings put into their computer can
connect to our domain need offer to our
custom domain extension and it's really
easy to add new extensions are on new
websites and everything just copy the
process we just did out a new extension
on to add a new website it's even easier
I just come in here Adam you website
here so for example by one
and Frances god it's C I would just type
in France that hit C in space a and then
I put in like a server or whatever or I
could do scene Ian it's just using DNS I
could do whatever I wanted and if you
want more tutorials on DNS and just let
me know I want to make some more and but
that's basically it for this video and
also if you're going to add in your
extension or if you're adding you an
extension or even a new I don't mean you
also have to add it the reverse DNS so
you would also have to put it in the or
so you have to copy this and just change
tasks to whatever you don't mean was a
web or you can make a savage zone file
forward but just for simplicity we
capped it in the same one so that's it
for this video don't forget to Like
comment favorite and subscribe don't
forget to also let me know about what
you think of these sort of videos I was
thinking making more videos like this as
well as the ones like the how to make it
on YouTube in JavaScript and laws very
startling making or how to learn a
Python videos again on the PHP ones and
also even huge tml ones as well on maybe
even Google Chrome extensions because
I'll be pretty : on how make a Google
Chrome extension so edges let me know
what you think in the comments down
below and also thanks for watching don't
forget to like our favor and subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
