how you add more security to our forms
because a lot of websites are vulnerable
to what's called cross-site request
forgery essentially all it is is when an
attacker has a form on their website and
they submit data to the target website
and because the user is logged in
already they request the attacker sans
is authenticated and I would ever form
the attacker targeted would accept the
data so in real terms what that means is
if you had a form that had a button that
let people delete their account if
someone went on to a malicious website
that targeted your website in the
background the attacker could delete the
person's account when they go on the
attackers website or as I'm gonna show
you now the attacker could send messages
using your account so you can see here I
have a master she says CSRF message I
click on it that's the message there and
that message wasn't sent using our sand
message that PHP page it was sent by
this website how could or github that is
CSR after HTML it's just a special page
I created on a remote website to task
the site and it says non-secure because
this is running on HTTP on our localhost
isn't essentially what happens is every
time I run this page it's gonna send a
message using my account so you can see
I have one message now refresh there's
the message and I'm gonna reload this
page now and you're gonna see it's gonna
send a message so there that page has
just been loaded and it's on the
internet it's not on my local machine
and if i refresh this page now we can
see we have a new message and it's
unread because it's brand-new we click
on it and there is the CSRF message it
was sent by this website because I'm
logged in and another child the way CSRF
works is it takes advantage of the web
browsers authenticate on our social
network we are authenticating using
cookies and every time we send a request
the authentication cookie is sent in
that request so whenever I send a
request from another page the
authentication cookie is sent as well
which means I'm logged in but it also
means that the attacker just by virtue
of me being logged in at all can send
messages on my account
so here's the CSRF page that has a form
on it that sends its data using an
iframe so we never actually see the page
reload we hid the form and the form
submits to this page our send message to
a PHP page with a question mark and then
as receiver equals three because that's
the person we want to send the message
to the person who the manage will be
sent from will always be the person
who's logged in because they've already
authenticated so that's the problem but
how do we fix it but the way we fix it
is we need a guarantee
that every form that is submitted is a
form on our website and as we can see
here we want to make sure that it's not
a form that's coming from a different
website so whatever the user tries to
access the form what we're gonna do is
generate a token and whenever the form
gets submitted we're gonna compare the
token in the form with the token that
was generated by the server and if the
two tokens match we'll know that the
form was in factored form on our website
and it wasn't a form on a separate
website trying to do cross-site request
forgery so on our sad message page the
first thing we need to do is generate
our token and we're going to use
sessions for this we're not gonna be
using cookies so the first thing we want
to do is generate our session so up here
we'll say a session start and that
allows us to use sessions next what we
want to do is we want to create a
session token and we're gonna set
session token it's gonna be equal to a
token and we're gonna get our token from
our login script so if we go to login
and we scroll down we can see we're
generating a token using these two lines
here so we're going to copy those two
lines and paste them here and we're
gonna say token is equal to token we
don't need such a strong token because
it's this has sexy four random bytes or
we could do a much smaller token and
we'd still be safe from CSRF but we're
gonna keep it like that for now and
below here we will print our the session
variable so there is our token we've
just generated and I what we want to do
is store that token in the form so the
way we do that is we scroll down and
here we have a hidden field in the form
input type is gonna be hidden and its
value is gonna be the value of our token
which is gonna be echo session token
like this all now we're gonna refresh
and if we view source you can see
there's the token there and there is the
hidden token in our form we're just
gonna give this a name of no CSRF so
what we're gonna do is wanna say if post
no CSRF doesn't equal token then we're
gonna die we're set invalid token and
we're not gonna print out our session
token so we've created our token we need
a way to destroy the tokens so after the
button has been submitted we're gonna
say session destroy to destroy that
token what we want to do is actually
change that to session because we want
to check the session variable and here
we want to do is we want to check if the
token has been set so here we'll set if
is not set session token so if the
session token doesn't exist then we're
going to create one
so we're gonna send a message it says
message sent
there's our message it was sent using
our form now what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna try and go to our CSRF page I'm
gonna click refresh now you can see no
message was sent if I inspect the page
and go to network and I refresh you can
see there is where we are sending the
request that sends the message so when
we try to use our CSRF attack we end up
with this error so we prevent that error
what we could simply say is also if is
not set post no CSRF so in other words
if they just leave that field out
completely then we're gonna die and say
invalid token so if they don't have the
csr I failed we're gonna say invalid
token and if they try to put in a random
value in the CS or I failed that is
invalid we're also gonna say invalid
token and that's gonna prevent CSRF
attacks we just have to put this on
every form that we want to prevent CSRF
attacks on so if i refresh the error is
gone and it says invalid token but if I
go to the page properly and I try to
sign something hello world know CSRF and
I click send message it says message
sent and I refresh and the message was
sent successfully
there's the message we have a slight bug
in our messaging system we just need to
put brackets around here and we refresh
and there is our message hello world no
CSRF and I can click this page as many
times as I want and I refresh and we're
getting no messages being sent and then
every time I do it we see invalid token
