know if it's welcome back but it's
welcome to this series I can't remember
I've done all my child since I changed
channels a few months ago but just in
case I didn't because i don't think i
have this is a series obviously called
questions answered it's where i'm going
to answer the questions that people send
me a message man messages asking me to
have fix their problems and things that
sometimes just don't bother with the
messages and then people think i'm
ignoring them but i actually don't I
read every message but in this video I'm
just going to pick out a few of them
i'll explain them and on you go fix your
problems so let's get started so the
first one says hi when i change from
HTML PHP come HTML to PHP and it comes
up with the code now rather than a web
page could you explain what i need to do
to fix this please but that's pretty
simple and so what I'm going to do add
effects this is that it's pretty simple
you need to have a program called you
need to have PHP installed in the mask
you animal and to simplify the process
there's a program you can download
called exile just google it and you'll
find it at on apache frames org and the
program called xampp you install it and
it sort of sets a lit up for you but in
my tutorials if you've locked the URL
you'll see in the URL its local goes
forward slash tutorial / fine friends
that's because if i go into Aksum it's
sort of just like a web server so when I
right when htdocs folder this is a
contains and folders but here's the
tutorials one and then here's fine
friends so here's where I store all my
files if I was to put these in my
desktop and record it I would just get
code as well I wouldn't actually get a
file so what you need to do is install
xampp and by default that should be
installed on your C Drive and if you
want to mock it should be in your
applications folder and you just open
eye exam you open the htdocs folder
you'll have a bunch of files you can
just delete them
then you can just put your files in the
UC docs folder or in some folders like I
have and then you should be able to see
your code but I don't forget when you
turn your computer on you might have to
turn on xampp each time you turn your
computer on and if you don't turn on the
exam you won't be able to see your files
either so the next thing was already a
question so at what it says is another
thing is a report button that will
report stuff to any admin or mod so
that's something I might do in further
tutorials as so yeah that's a good idea
and I'll probably do it later on and
show you how to do it okay so this next
question says can you help me please
when i'm uploading my fat and website up
files on our be why posting after
uploading when i go to my site it
nothing comes my server name is trif
trifling com please help okay so i'm
sorry there's not a whole lot I can do
there because obviously I can't see your
server and I can't see you or you're
uploading your files and things yeah but
just as like or just like the last
question make sure you upload them to
your htdocs folder or else you won't be
able to see them so for example if I go
on my website as you can see my stuff
shows up because in reality if you
looked at my ftp you would say that i've
uploaded to creative code code icici or
whatever c ZT c 4 / htdocs but you don't
see that so if I type it in it's not
going to take me anymore but if I didn't
upload it in the htdocs folder and i
just uploaded it in the same fine with
AC docs folder i would just get what the
problem you are having right now so what
I'd assume when I try is just contact
your web host and see what's going on
and then there probably was sort of like
for you because I mean it's hard for me
to assume because I'd probably just make
the wrong assumption then it probably
wouldn't have you anyway so next
question so the next question says does
anyone actually read these posts yes
actually I do
it says I got one more question the bio
forming the account settings by default
display is right something about
yourself I would like to change this but
i can't find this message anymore please
could you tell me where to find it
please please please so that's why i
opened this file and one of them do is
just show you where it is so it's ok
nominated yeah I remember and I ok so
that lot line isn't actually on this
page it's on the index page when the
user registers and just insert write
something about yourself into their bio
section and the reason it shows up on
the account settings page is because
this gets inserted into the database and
then the account settings page pulls its
values from the database so that's why
you were seeing it so I hope this helps
and just don't forget it's on the index
page if you want to change it so this
next question says you're teaching and
making this website brilliantly I just I
want just one thing that please build a
share system like Facebook guys so yeah
we might do that as well so that's
another feature we're probably going to
add before the series is over and that
goes for anyone if you have a feature
you want to add or you want to show be
shown how to do just send me a message
so long it's not going to be really hard
and teeming with the values to make and
I think it's a good idea then I don't
mind making it and then showing you how
to make it the next question which is
sorry but it's our final question it
says your tutorials have helped me to
understand programming could you write a
gaming site like IGN com or commercial
site like ebay com thank you very much
well I might do that in the future after
the social network series but what I
plan to do is I do the social network
series and alongside it I'm going to be
things like Python c programming
javascript programming things like that
and after this series I'll probably be
and I also be continuing the blog series
but after that i'll be maybe they form
then maybe a YouTube sort of sight and
then I don't know maybe i'll do an IGN
sort of sight or an eBay site I don't
mind so at thanks for watching me I
think it's the first episode of
questions answered and i'll be doing
more of these more often to answer your
questions and i know i got where more
questions in this but i'll try and
answer everyone eventually so well
thanks for watching don't forget to Like
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
