able to identify variable names variable
assignments so what we're going to do in
this video is going to actually assign
the variable so the way you normally
assign variables and keep track of their
values and things like that if you use
something called a symbol table so our
symbol table is just going to simply be
a Python dictionary so I'm gonna create
a global variable called symbol table or
actually just call it symbols and I'll
set it equal to a dictionary then what
I'm going to do in the at the end of the
last function I'm just going to comment
that out so after I've commented out
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna add
a new item to the dictionary so the way
we do that is really similar to an array
we just say symbols we give it an e/m so
this would be our variable name so I
would say variable in the case of the
last video the variable we assigned was
called variable that what I'm going to
do is I'm going to set it equal to a
value so say hello then what I'll do is
obviously a print symbols
so as you can see at prints our
dictionary and we have just a random
value so that what we want to do is we
want our interpreter to add these values
for symbol table so we come down to our
parse function and we can see here this
section is used to print and different
values and to know what to do with each
of the values so what we're going to do
is we're going to say if tokes
oops all right f tokes i plus space plus
tok i plus 1 plus space plus chokes i
plus 2 equals and this is worked so
let's sort of make a bit more sense
we'll say variable actual said var then
we'll say space equals space string so
we're going to live string an assignment
to variable names so that's what this
means and we actually need to get the
first 3 characters of it's will say 0 3
and that's how we got abs are so as you
can see up here actually I'll go up here
you can see the token for a variable
looks like this so we want to get the
first 3 characters which is the word var
and that's how we're going to identify
it as a variable equals is fine and then
string we have to get the first eight
characters than the first six characters
actually as we go 0 6
so then what I'll do is I will say I
plus equals three because in here we say
I plus equals two because we want to
push the counter I arm to because we
just used two tokens when we've
identified two tokens together that do
one specific thing so we wanted to move
on after that so here we have three
tokens that do want specific things we
want to push it on three tokens to get
the next opens so what I'll do first is
I'll just print set toks
I plus two so this will just print the
string hello in this case so one way one
good way to debug things we can go up
here again I'm okay so I can see the
problem straight away it's because we're
returning nothing because we were
trapped we basically turned off the
parse function while we were adding
stuff to relax function as little deals
I will basically turn the parse function
back on by returning the tokens variable
and if I run this you can see we can
have our 40 our first evaluation at the
top and then we can see the string hello
which means we can see that part of the
variable assignment is actually done
correctly so we're gonna get rid of the
print from the for the moment now we're
going to focus on the variable so here
we have the variable name hello and if I
run siggy and we'll just get a string
hello printed out to us I will the token
action but this isn't actually assigned
to anything so what we want to do is we
want to go down here and all we have to
do is create a function called assign
variable and we just need to pass it
toks
I plus 2 which is the string that we
just printed out or the token we just
printed out actually so what are
actually we'll call it do assign and the
reason we call that do assign is because
we want to keep so we want to keep the
function name similar so here we have do
prints we're going to do do assign for
variables so if we go down here we print
the def or we create the function using
the DEF keyword and we said F assigned
or a deaf to assign so we want to take
two variables actually we want to take
the variable var neom all we want to
take involve value because we can ignore
the equals because we already know it's
an assignment because we're using the do
assign function so we don't need to pass
that to the function we just need to
pass tokes I talked I plus two so what I
want to do is we just want to say
symbols VAR name equals and our value
but we actually want to save our name
and we want to get rid of the first four
characters so step four I'm not ruling
well actually for codon that means it'll
start at the fourth character and move
on so we don't want the beginning of the
token being stored because it's just a
waste so we don't want these four
characters to be stored we just want the
rest of it here this variable name to be
stored so if we run this we should get
the result we're looking for but what
I'll do down here just to be sure it
worked as I said print symbols okay oh
yeah we're we're using Python 3 so if
use the print function source as symbols
so if we run this you can see it prints
our symbol table and here is the
variable stored and I can go in here and
I can just copy and paste it and I can
override a variable and as you can see
now that variable equals this or I can
create another variable so I said var to
so as you can see now we have two
variables in our dictionary and we're
storing them correctly
one thing to note just before we go and
on language we denote a variable by
anything that begins with a dollar sign
and it isn't part of a string and one of
the other basics you can say that a
variable is denoted by a string of
characters and then a dollar sign at the
end the reason we didn't use the dollar
sign at the end is because it's a lot
easier to identify it if the dollar
signs in the beginning because if you
think about of them wheat otherwise we'd
have to have an else down here that just
loops through every character and just
looks for dollar signs and then goes
backwards and gets and any other
characters so it's just a lot easier to
have the dollar sign in front of our
variables to denote a variable so that's
