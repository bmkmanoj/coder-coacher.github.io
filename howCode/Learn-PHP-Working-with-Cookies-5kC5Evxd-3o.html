we're going to be learning about is
cookies in PHP and what I'm going to
talk about is just basically what
cookies are and how you can use them on
your website so let's get started so the
first thing you're probably wondering is
what is a cookie so a cookie is just a
small file at a website embeds or a web
server embeds on a user's computer that
sort of a can be used to store data
specific to that user so if you wanted
to store like the user's preferences for
example if you allow your website to
have themes you could store a user
specific theme preference in a cookie
file on their computer so that way each
time they went onto your website
you would know which theme they wanted
to display and so that's one use for
word another use is to identify users so
for example if you were using a login
system you could one the person logged
in you could set a cookie for it and so
that way they don't have to login once
and then your website could remember to
keep them logged in so let's find out
how to actually create a cookie so to
create a cookie in PHP they have a
function called the set cookie function
and one thing to note about this
function is that it has to be above all
the HTML tags so for example if I had a
simple web page here and I just give it
a title actually on some body text so um
I don't know this is my web page and the
sack cookie function has to be above the
HTML tag or else it won't work so for
example if you wanted to use the
setcookie function whoops here on your
webpage you wouldn't use it here because
it won't work so you have to actually
just use it up above your webpage
above the HTML tags like that so this
function itself does have a syntax so
what I mean by that is it just means
that the function takes specific
arguments in a specific order for it to
actually work properly so the way these
are the arguments this function texts
are Neum so at the name of the cookie
the value you want to give the cookie
the time it takes for the cookie to
expire it actually also takes path and
domain what these last two are actually
these last are actually optional but the
a path one just means that the cookie
only works the cookie can only be well
path actually means the path from which
the domain of the domain of which the
cookie will actually be available to so
for example if you set a cookie and a
folder called images and you set the
path of the cookie to slash images it
would only be available for images and
every folder within that images folder
but if you for example set the path to
the forward slash that means root so
what's at the cookie to be available on
every directory on the domain the domain
parameter just means that it just
defines the domain that it can be the a
cookie can actually be defined on and
used on so where for example if you were
to do an Holly co.org then it means the
cookie would only be would only work on
hi gorg but if you wanted it to work on
the subdomains of hi gorg you just put a
an Asterix here and then a dot and then
that would mean every subdomain
otherwise if you want to just specific
ones you just put in what lynnium the
subdomain was and for me to work on that
specific subdomain there's also another
one another parameter called secure and
the secure parameter just means whether
the cookie works on over HTTP connection
or HTTP connection and just in case you
don't know at the moment you can see
here there's no is there's no HTTP in
front of the URL which shows the
is just an HTTP connection and you can
see if I just type in HTTP I just
removes it but it actually is HTTP
connection and we can also check with
the site information it says identity
not verified and it says that the
connection is not secure or I mean not
encrypted even on well this shows us
that this is a HTTP connection so if we
set secure it is to know then it means
it would work on HTTP connection but if
we for example went to a web site that
had a HTTPS connection for example this
subdomain and I know it's got a log in a
register form but they don't actually
work yet they're just a work in progress
but as you can see not on the login
section on the ssl subdomain we can see
we have a HTTPS connection and this
followed by a green box actually as well
and that shows us that the connection to
this is secure and we can go to then
click on the check box and we can see it
says identity verified and if we click
on connection it says that the
connection has been verified and
whatever it's encrypted so what this
means is if we set security yes then it
means that the cookie would only set
could it would only work over a HTTPS
connection like this um but if we
started to know then it means it'll only
work on an HTTP connection like this
because there's no Houston GPS in front
of it so let's create a cookie
so we'll just get rid of all this so
that's create a cookie called hello so
the first thing we want to say is the
add name of the cookie which is going to
be hello whoops no cookie the value of
the cookie is going to be a hello from
PHP cookie and then the expiry time is
kind of weird why you write it but you
use the time function which is like this
like any other function and then you say
plus whatever you wanted so if I wanted
to set it for a minute I would say 3600
because this means get the current time
or set the expiry time of the cookie to
the current time plus 3600 seconds so
what this means is it whatever the
current time is it just adds one minute
on to it so it means the cookie will
inspire in one minute's time so if we we
can actually close this nine so if we go
to our index page and refresh nine says
okay to be okay so the reason that
didn't work is because I surrounded this
in quotes or double quotes even so if we
get rid of that and we just do it again
yeah if we just refresh the page now it
says this is my webpage but there's no
errors so that's a good sign so what we
can do now is we can say um echo a
dollar sign underscore cookie and the
name of the cookie was hello cookie and
we can uncomment this to stop it
resetting the cookie every time so
here's our cookie and we can accurate
outlines see what it said and what it
should say is hello from a PHP cookie so
whips we just a KO it out and it should
a quote the value of the cookie and it
says hello from PHP cookie this is my
webpage which is as which is actually
different so to stop any confusion I'll
just get rid of it whoops and refresh it
says hello from a PHP cookie so what we
can also do is if we want we could use
cookies for example logins well sort of
gasps login system so what we would do
first is we would check at the cookie
had been set with an if statement sweets
that if is set cookie and then inside
the cookie variable we specify the name
of the cookie we want to check for so we
can just call it user or I don't know
guest for the guest login system and
then we would just echo
hi comma and then just add on the dollar
sign underscore cookie cast and then we
can also append on even further and just
put an exclamation mark so if we run
this now we actually will see nothing
because they F statement is checking if
the cookies been set and in our case the
coda hasn't been set so it doesn't run
this code and we haven't set a
alternative
we haven't set like an alternative
stammen like a now statement to say
whether the cookies an open set supposed
to set else not logged in this way we
should get not logged in because what
it's doing is it's checking as the
cookie set and then it says no the
cookies not set so it goes to the Al's
block and echoes not logged in so we're
going to set the gas cooking noise so
we're just going to say I set cookie the
name of the cookie is guessed obviously
the value it's going to be let's just
have Frances for now and the time is
going to be what we don't actually need
the double quotes the time is going to
be the time function plus I let's say 1
minute flips 1 minute times 60 times 24
times 7 so that should be one week
because it's 1 minute
tie or it's 1 minute times 60 which is 1
hour times 24 which is one day a times 7
which is one week so let's try that now
and we had a refresh
just because the first time the cookie
was being set and then the the first
time we did is it's at the cookie and
then it you know how to refresh the page
before it would actually be able to
check if the cookie been set yet so
that's why we had to refresh it twice
whoops
and I will on just a space so that says
hi Frances so that's it for this video

radio tutorials on text articles I'm in
the process of writing them now so it
should be will be a wee while further up
but there is a few currently on the
hardcore login system the en one outside
of the form that we saw in this video
doesn't actually work probably yet it's
just I'm in the process of making it so
I don't worry if you try to use it it
doesn't work so thanks for watching
