I won't be doing in this video is we're
gonna be finishing off or I mean
continuing on with the next part of the
how to make your own poll series so
let's get started so in the last video
we left off with echoing out the poll
title but now we've done that what we
want to do is we want to create another
query and get all the questions for the
poll so what we're gonna do is we're
just going to copy query and all of this
just speed things up and we're gonna
paste it down here and we have to close
that off and close the one above it off
so I'm just going to space these out a
bit more for well just to make it a bit
easier to read so let's just tidy things
up a bit so obviously we can't use these
same variables o-ring in so I'm going to
say questions equals select all from
questions or polite equals poll ID and
now we're going to keep this the arcs
we're going to change that so we're set
Q to this because it's the second query
we're going to set that equal to the
questions variable and then we're going
to set this to q2 and that should be all
we have to change actually change this
to row two we can change this wrote here
we can just leave it as are so I'll
change it to are actually just so that
it's different from the original
variable up here and we're gonna echo
out or the first thing we're gonna get
actually is we go to questions I'm gonna
structure we're gonna get to the
question which is which has an index of
one so we're gonna set a question and it
has an index of one so then what we're
going to do is going to echo a question
so we're gonna go to the back to the
website and we're gonna refresh the page
and I okay we have a syntax error on
line 25 so let's go to line 25 as you
can see we just have an extra curly
brace so I'm just gonna delete this one
up here and that should be our our go on
so as you can see we got nothing Ecuador
and that's because we have no questions
in the database with that pole ID we
have no questions at all so I'm gonna
click insert I'm gonna add a question so
the question is just going to be test
question we're gonna give it zero votes
for now and we're going to set the
polite equal to test and now I'm going
to refresh the page and it says test
question now what I'm going to do is me
to create another question so second
question it's going to zero votes as
well and it's gonna have a called idea
test as well so that we have two
questions in our poll so up here what
I'm actually gonna do is I'm just gonna
say echo each one and I'm just gonna
echo the title out of the poll so here's
our test poll it gets the title from the
database and we have our two questions
below it so the next thing we need is we
need a way to actually sort of click on
the questions to submit them so what
we're going to do for that is we're
going to do something really simple
we're just going to create a table so so
what we do is I'm just going to close
off the PHP tags and we're going to put
our table in here so we're going to set
a table we're gonna create a table
detail actually no we'll leave that as
table row and we'll go down below here
and we will
close off the table room go down here
I'm just gonna close off the table as
well so in here what we're gonna do is
want to create a table detail
I don't know actually I mean a table row
so we're gonna create another table row
oops a little okay my mistake well
create table detail up here and we'll
create another one down here and this
one last to put them side-by-side so
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna have
radio buttons down here on the left and
the questions on the right so I know
what we're gonna do is we're going to
say okay what a smarter thing to do
would be is to put the table row inside
with the question so let's try that
so in here we can just hang over to this
I'm just going to echo it out slightly
differently after that and I'm gonna say
question and I should be exactly the
same the only difference is we need to
put in a great tag which we can actually
write with the table detail on the table
row so I'm gonna put in the table row
first and I'm gonna put in a table
detail and I'm gonna put in or I'm gonna
add the table detail and then I'm gonna
add the table row and then I'm gonna put
another table detail and that's gonna
have the radio button so let's refresh
the page okay so let me see
so what we need to is you seem to open
that table detail up here and let's try
it here so as you can see now it sort of
lines up better the radio buttons are
gonna be on this side and the questions
they're gonna be on this side so we're
going to do now is we're going to create
a submit button at the bottom of our
table so we're just going to create
another table row and then in here a
table detail and we're gonna say input
type equals submit name equals vote
value equals vote
okay so let's refresh the page so now we
have a vote button at the bottom of our
table so what we need to do is we need
to come up here I'm going to create a
form so they form it's gonna have an
action of index dot PHP actually if we
leave the action empty it should just go
to the page wrong then I'm gonna have a
method of post and we're standing data
to the server down here what I'm gonna
do is I'm gonna close off the form so
now that's refresh let's click vote and
I can see a refreshed our page at the
top there so now I'm going to create the
radio button so that's really easy all
you have to do is go in here and put an
input type equals and we need to just
close it off I want to say input type
equals radio the name and the name of a
scene for each of them so the name is
gonna be a whole option and then we're
gonna say value equals and we're set the
value equal to nothing for now so let's
say I go back to Google Chrome and
refresh that's count a lot I'm just
reloaded actually so you can see now we
have a radio button for each of these
so she said we actually have to set the
value so we'll set the value equal to
what's that the value equal to question
so we're going to include the question
variable so there are not our radio
buttons how have a values for me click
on these the value is signed or we can I
check the value by going up here and
saying a co-host that's a whole option
and then let's refresh the page so at
the minute it's undefined but if you
click test question and click vote it
says test question if we refresh and
click second question it
no I says second question we can click
test question again and does exact same
thing so now we know we're getting the
data from the radio buttons so now when
you weren't getting the data from the
radio buttons will actually end this
video and I will continue on in the next
one so once again thanks for watching
