learning how to create a really simple
web server in Python Python actually
comes with a built-in library just for
this purpose
so it makes it really really simple to
create a web server in just a couple of
lines of code so you can see here I have
a page that's being served from our web
server and it's being served from this
directory called web serve we have our
server here and we have tests at HTML
here so if I try to go to another file
even if I just call it test you can see
it says file not found and if I go to
network and I refresh you can see we're
also sending back the 404 status code to
say that the web page wasn't found if we
go to the index page we also get a file
not found error because there is no
index page so I can copy and paste this
and I can rename it index and I'll just
change this to index page and now if i
refresh you can see we got our index
page so now we're going to learn how to
create this really simple server so this
is all our server is it's 20 lines of
code so the first thing we do is we go
to the HTTP dot server module on the
import HTTP server and base HTTP request
handler those are built in to the Python
HTTP library so we don't have to do
anything we could just use them as they
are then what we do is we create our own
class called serve and that's gonna be
the class that holds our server what
we're doing is we're inheriting the
methods from the base HTTP request
handler that's what this do gap method
is we can't rename this method it's
built into this class up here that we're
inheriting from so this method runs when
we receive a get request and any time
you go to a web page in your web browser
and you type in the address of that
you're sending a get request to its
server so when we get a get request what
we do is we check the path of the
request and we check if it's a forward
slash that means there on the index page
and if they're on the index page we
change the path to our index dot HTML
file that's how we read the index page
the next thing we do is we try to read
the file that the user is trying to
access so the user tries to access test
dot HTML we're really doing is we're
trying to access this file on the web
server so what we do is we say file to
open is equal to whatever file the user
wants to access and we say a dot read to
load its text into this variable we use
these special brackets on the one
character so that we can just get this
part of the file name and we can skip
this forward slash so we read that file
and if it works if it's successful then
the try block will end here and it will
leave out the except part so if the
files find and it's read successfully we
want to send a 200 response so a 200
response is the response every webpage
sends whenever you access a page
successfully so if i refresh you can see
the status code is 200 so if the file
can't be read then we go to our accept
block and we say file to open equals
file not find so instead of displaying a
file to the user we just display the
text file not fired and we send a
response for a 404 that means the file
wasn't found so if I try to access a
file that isn't fine
slash test for example you could say we
get 404 not found then what we do is we
send this softer and Hatters method that
is required by the base HTTP request
handler class and finally what we do is
we write the contents of the file onto
the screen so to write it to the screen
we have to convert it to bytes so we
assume all of our files are encoded
using utf-8 so assuming that we convert
the text file to bytes using the bytes
method and we tell it that the text is
originally stored in utf-8 then finally
all we do is we create our HTTP variable
we call httpd because that stands for
HTTP daemon which is just what you call
a program that runs in the background
because that's typically how web servers
run and what you want to do is call our
HTTP server class that's the server
class that python implemented for us we
give it a tuple with the address to host
our server arm which is localhost which
is our computer and the port we want to
listen on and then finally we passed the
serve class that we created and that was
how we customize the default
functionality of pythons to HTTP server
then finally we just run the surf
forever method so that's it for this
