three in the how to make your own social
network series so this is the part three
of the remix have been doing and in
today's video what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be learning how
to create this search box
so the search box is going to use CSS
automation to do actual automated things
and I've already I'm going to include
the CSS in the source code so you don't
have to copy it out because it's kind of
long some of it so add without any
further ado let's get started
so the first thing we want to do is want
to create a div on we want to call it
search box so create a div give it a
class of search box and within the day
of what we want to do is how we want to
create a form wanna set the method woops
actually I'll just do this till you get
both the closing on opening form we're
gonna set the method equal to search
stop PHP um whoops that's not the method
wanna set the action whoops
equal to start/stop PHP the method to
get and I want to give it an ID of
search don't want to do is
create an input type of text I'm going
to give it a name of queue size of sexy
and a placeholder we went to the face
Wonder equal to search so let's refresh
the page now and see what it looks like
so obviously it doesn't not create at
the moment and so what we're going to
sort that out 9 so what we're going to
do is we're going to go up here we're
gonna start at CSS and we're going to
create a new class so the class is going
to be search box and within this class
we're going to say a background whoops a
background image URL and we're going to
set that equal to the same as these so
let's just copy that we're going to set
the
to absolute absolute top I'm going to
say 13 pixels we're going to set margin
margin laughs 135 pixels and that's it
for the search box class then we're
going to do the search ID actually we
can just copy and paste this in because
I've already got it in the clipboard so
if we paste this in so since I've
already got a ps3 on the clipboard I'll
just paste it in now and I almost forgot
we have these two images here that are
for the M magnifying glass for the
search book or the search box so let's
refresh the page and as you can see now
we have our search box we click on it
and it animates it feeds we can type
them do what we want and it works
one more thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to say go up here and I'll say add
padding padding top and I can set that
equal to five pixels and what that did
is you just push the logo down so it's
more in line with the search box so
that's it for this video don't forget to

I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
