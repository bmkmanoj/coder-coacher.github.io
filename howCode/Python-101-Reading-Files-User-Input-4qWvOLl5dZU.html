101 video tutorial and today we're going
to be doing is we're going to be
learning how to read files using Python
so what I mean by that is you're
probably familiar with being able to say
print a little world save it and then
click run module or f5 by doing that we
get printed hello world but what if we
don't want our input to be well okay in
the case of the print statement the
input is whatever is in between the are
the quotation marks or the double quotes
and well then that's not that's works in
most circumstances but sometimes we
don't want our input to be just within
the program sometimes we want to get
input from a user which is when we would
use the inputs function and sometimes
you want to read it input or I get our
input from a file and there that's when
we were to read a file so what I'm gonna
be showing you is how to read a file and
then we will be creating kind of a
simple example and when you would and
maybe do it or use for it so what I'm
going to do is our reading a file in
Python is actually really simple so what
you do is the way it works is first you
open the file then you know extract or I
get any info you want from the file
ignore the orange I'm just showing we're
just writing down what we're going to do
and then after you finish with the file
you have to close the file so we just
enclose the file it's obviously not that
simple like it sounds not written in
plain English but it's a pretty
straightforward and easy to do so first
thing we need to do is we need to create
a variable called fat or my file and
that's equal to the open function which
I
is the file we want to open so in
between the two single quotes or double
quotes or whatever is where we give the
name of the file we want to open and
since this file this Python file is
located on my desktop it's going to look
for files on my desktop so which is why
I created two tax files my fellow txt
and file tutor takes T and file Twitter
takes T is just to M ed said just for
the second example of using the file and
open thing in Python just reading files
in Python in general so for the moment
I'm going to be opening my father txt so
if we were to send my file dot txt and
if it was in a different location like
if I had it in a folder called my files
then I would just put that in front of
it and if I had a and I don't know a
folder if I was in a folder called my
files that I had if I read a file that
Pi was in my files are the a folder my
files all we'd have to do to get back to
my desktop to read my father takes T is
put a double or a top top forward slash
and then what I'll do is go back like go
up a directory so that would go from
desktop to Francis and if my file was
located in now but it's not so we can
just leave it like this so now we've
opened the file what we need to do is we
need to get any information from it so I
can just create a variable called info
equals my file dot read lines deny all
of the info is stored in a variable
called info so now we've got our
information from the file we need to
close the file so you can probably
assume I mean you can probably guess
what we do my file dot close and what
this does it just closes the file when
we're done with it so now we've done
that I'm just going to print info the a
variable info so we should get the
contents of the file so now if I run the
module you can see it's giving us the
contents of the file and you can prove
that by going to context and as you can
see the what's written in the Python
shell and in context is exactly the same
oops
so what you can you can I also I will
actually leave that for later because
that's a bit complicated but now we've
actually read our file we want to be
able to add a user to specify file we
want to open so that's actually really
really simple so instead of doing this
what we do is we'll just say our user
input and then we just go above here and
create a variable called user input
which is equal to the input function and
in the input function we just say we
want so we say enter the name of a file
oops file you want to read and then now
if we run that module it says enter the
name of the file you want to read so I
could set my file dot txt whoops ah
let's have a look what doesn't work
okay so I think the reason without this
error is because as you can see I
literally talked what we said but it
didn't surround it in and quotes so
we're gonna actually do that ourselves
by just putting whoops double quotes
around it and then a plus and in the
double quotes we put a single quote we
do the same for here so double quotes in
between then we put a single quote so
what this will do is I'll take our
literal whoops and it will take what we
literally say so we need is we need to
include the single and double
it's not single I mean when you include
these single quotes are on the string
because it is a string and whoops so
what we're going to do here we're just
going to go back and run the module
again so here it says Angelina five you
want to read so my file dot txt okay so
I realize the problem and it's because
we actually need the raw input function
because we're dealing with strings and
things in that case we don't need these
so whoops if we were to run this again
we were to say my file dot txt we get
printed out the contents of that file we
can run it again we can print the
contents of the other file so five two
dot txt and we get printed this is the
second file so I hope you enjoyed this
video that's a quite short but you know
that's just there's not a whole lot you
can really say about just one aspect of
Python such as this but at I mean
they're more exciting things to come
soon like making windows and gooeys and
things like that with Python and their
frameworks and things so I hope you
enjoyed the video don't forget to
comment like favorite and subscribe and
I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
