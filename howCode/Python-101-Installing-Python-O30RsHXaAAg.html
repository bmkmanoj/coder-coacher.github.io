Python 101 video series and today what
we're going to be doing is well all
we're going to be doing is installing
Python and checking it it works well
we'll save the real Python code for
another video so what we're going to do
first is just download them Python
itself so we're going to do is go to a
website called python.org and then if we
scroll it up all we do is click on
download and then you'll get to this
page here and there will be a link in
the description so what you do is you
just download the corresponding version
for your computer so so I'm just going
to go to the windows installer ok so now
that that's almost done okay so now
we've downloaded Python and let's just
open the Installer and now it says you
sure you want to run it we click yes oh
yeah click run actually not just as
preparing to install okay so now we've
AG up the install weather are the
install wizard up we're just going to
click Next now we're just going to click
Next again click Next again and it's
going to install ok so python is nearly
done installing and let's just wait for
it to finish ok so this says pythons
just finished installing so let's click
finish so that's it
python is not installed on our computer
ok so once you install python you're
going to get something called idle and
i'm going to open that up now so if
you're on Windows just go to start and
type in id id le and then you'll find it
ok so there this is the Python shell or
idle so I'm just going to make it size
of the window
to make sure everything worked properly
we're just going to type in print that's
just a Hello that's what everyone does
we could just say um if you can say this
you installed Python correctly oh okay
so I meant to put an exclamation mark
down what I'm so as you can see in blue
we get printed if you've installed us
you've installed Python correctly so
that's it for this video and the next
one will actually be doing some real
Python programming and technically that
was a bit of Python programming but not
really and what I wouldn't count it as a
whole lot of programming so add thanks
for watching don't forget to comment
like and subscribe and don't forget to
subscribe to the show if you enjoy it
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
