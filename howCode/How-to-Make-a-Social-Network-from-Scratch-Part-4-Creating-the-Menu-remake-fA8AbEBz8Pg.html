series I'm remaking on how to make your
own social network what I'm actually
making the whole series I'm remaking the
first 14 videos of it so today we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
creating the menu for our social network
so let's get started
so we want to do is going to come down
here and we want to create another div
and we want to get whoops we want to
give it the ID of menu and I'll just
point something like that the reason
sometimes use classes sometimes use IDs
is a classes usually used for something
that you would only use and your they
would use in your webpage multiple times
so I suppose we could use IDs for these
but an ID is something that you want to
use in your webpage once I mean you can
use the same thing with this or you can
use multiple items with CMIT
but that's just generally what people do
they use the IDS for things like the
menus that's only going to be on at once
and things like I don't know menu items
if you wanted to style them and
specifically you could put a class on
them and that would add a class on them
because you would have multiple menu
items so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create our link and the links
just going to say at home and we're
going to just put in a hash tag in there
just to make sure that we'll meet when
you click it a dozen things too many
weird pages or it doesn't take us to the
it doesn't reload the page this one and
just do nothing basically with the hash
tag in it so the second menu item is
going to be about the third one is going
to be signup and the fourth one is going
to be sign-in I'll get rid of these last
two so let's refresh the page now and
we'll see we have this quite ugly
looking man you it's not really even a
menu yet but we have these four links
that are ugly looking so since what the
links don't look that good we're going
to use CSS to style them and make them
actually look good so we're going to
come down here to the bottom of the file
and we're going to access the menu ID so
we'll say a menu and then we'll access
the link element within that which is
the anchor tag we'll access within menu
ID
I mean with within the admin with the
idea of menu and then we're going to
we're going to set the text color equal
to white to FFF FFF which is the exit at
on the I just HTML color code for white
what's that text decoration to none
which means in the wander lines or
anything like that the font size oops
pump size will be 14 pixels the
background image will be the same as
this so it will be it will be this
background matter this Miami BG image up
here
we're going to set background repeat'
equal to no repeat potting whoops
carding top equal to 19 pixels padding
bottom equal to 22 pixels and we just
give it a semicolon up there a potting
left 10 pixels and padding oops doing
that padding right 10 pixels as well
then we're going to set the harbour
source set menu a:hover which means
we're access whoops let's get rid of
that this means we're going into the
element with the idea of menu that we're
going into the anchor tags within that
and what what's like we did up here but
then we're not going into just anchor
tags we're going to do the anchor tags
whenever they're hovered over Swiss
means this class this M sort of class
will only run whenever we hover our
mouse over the anchor tags within the
element with the idea of menu so
stuff from up here to keep make things
quicker and then we're going to say a
menu BJ underscore hover underscore
mouse over or underscore over me so this
is just the hover image for our menu
items
bonzai stairs the seam and the potting
top is time will be 18 pixels potting
bottom is still 22
I've left and unlocked and right is
there ten actually make that nineteen
that shouldn't actually change so we'll
get rid of actually all of these the
only thing we need to include in here is
what we're going to change
otherwise everything we cut the seams
and anything we're going to change is
the mouse over image so as you can see
in the image folder I have the menu
underscore BG underscore however on the
squamous underscore over image which is
going to be our hover over image so
let's refresh the page now imagine see
we have four menu items we can wave our
mouse over them and as you can see the
background color of the of each of the
menu items changes so what we want to do
now is we'll actually want to make them
line up on the menu properly so what
we're going to do now is rax you're just
going to copy this am I going to paste
it up here and we're going to get rid of
the a s so that it's just menu so it
accesses just the eye elements with the
idea of menu and we're going to delete
everything here except the background
image URL I'm also going to surround
this in something called a media query
so just copy the query as I write on the
screen
sort of media query is is it just means
that this math s/m will only run if the
media query is true so this means if the
browser is lesson or the width of the
browser is 1280 pixels well like if it's
maximum where there's 1280 pixels then
this query will run the other one we
want to do is we want to copy it again I
want to set the minimum words so we'll
just change that to men and now this
means if the minimum width is 1280
pixels then this will run so we're going
to say is position:absolute top:0 pixels
right zero pixels height 37 pixels
padding ad top
19 pixels margin right 4% and then let's
just copy this and paste it in here and
change the margin right to 6% and let's
refresh the page so as you can see now
the menu lines up over here on the right
hand side of the page
we're also going to creel so we need to
actually create two more queries so
let's just copy this and paste it down
here and this query is going to say
minimum width 400 pixels
and then we want to set the mid margin
right to 10% and then we're going to set
the minimum wig to 1920 pixels I want to
set the margin right equal to 25% so as
you can see nothing changed because the
media queries are still incorrect
present the browser size but what should
out I can see what's happening is the
menu the menu is staying and at the same
distance away from the edge of the page
so that's it for this video don't forget
