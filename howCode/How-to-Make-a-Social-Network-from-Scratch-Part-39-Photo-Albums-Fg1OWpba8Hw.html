gonna be doing is we're gonna be doing
something a bit longer than the last
buddy because in the last video all we
did was a lot of users to close the
constant things so in this video what
we're going to be doing is going to be
starting with photo albums and then
we're going to probably a lot of people
to report each other and well I don't
know actually
but the minute that's what we're doing
will be creating albums like photo
albums and then I think people upload
photos and things to them so as you can
see here I've had it on in PHP
underscore albums dot PHP profile dot
PHP on profile the PHP open I just have
the website here and our database so the
first thing we're going to do to get
started is we're gonna add an option in
actually let's go to the profile and if
we scroll up so here's the profile image
so it's below here somewhere here here
so I'm just going to copy one of these
submit buttons and we're just gonna
paste it in here no no actually we'll
create a form the form action is going
to be
you underscore albums dot php' the
method just kind of a post that would be
a sit-in so the only thing we're going
to change or the two things we're going
to change is the name and we're going to
change it to view albums and obviously
will change the value to have you it
will just said view albums so now if we
go back to the profile page we have the
new viewer blooms button okay so I
thought of a better way because if we
use a form it's got a push it on the
line below so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna delete the form and refresh
and I sort of on the same line so let me
see the best place to put it
the best place to put it might be on the
other side of the likes or just pasting
into this form that's just envelope okay
so no that's there and then the up
unlike button embed is below so we want
to cut that and then yesterday in the
form as well so now if we refresh yeah
that's sort of pushing you down but I
shouldn't see y'all all this still works
and if we click view albums
oh yeah obviously it won't kick ass
anymore because I'm totally - so what
we're gonna do is okay so this looks a
bit strange because of the like button
there so what I might do is go down here
and then add the new one of sort of new
days and then
sad like photos of the username so let's
try that actually
so we scrolled on down here just paste
it there it's gonna look a bit strange
first but if we go up here and we just
cut this and then go down and paste it
in here I will just say albums and free
I scrolled on and then refresh we have
them you did the am here is going to be
probably to include divs for the albums
so we might if we leave it without this
video or next but in the meantime we'll
just we'll just leave it like that for
nine then we'll work on the view albums
page there are nine so I'm just gonna go
actually to view your score albums dot
PHP with a black page which is good I
suppose so if we put our PHP tags in we
type in include Inc slash Hatter dot
pink dot PHP and then we click refresh
just put it like that
it's actually not was fine it's the ink
slash ink files folder should be in so
let's try tonight and we get our header
file
the next thing we're going to do is
we'll go down here and we'll create a
header tag ELMO type and usernames
albums and then put a hitch HR
underneath which is just the horizontal
line so obviously we're not going to get
anything you're just going to get
undefined variable here
which is fine because to fix that what
we're gonna do is we'll go to the
profile page
now we'll just cut this and paste it in
here and then now if we refresh let's
look at the problem but now if we type
in a question mark Q equals cinema hmm
oh yeah and obviously we need to use the
right variable so now if we type it in
and we refresh we get cinema albums so I
think what I meant to was append an ass
and apostrophe s on the end of it so now
we have an apostrophe ask me into the
person's user name snow moves on that
what we're going to do is whoops I
actually will go create a new document
and we will plan out the fails for our
albums table so obviously we need an ID
we need an album title and a description
we need created by and the data was
created so I'm and I get a UID for the
album so that we can associate photos
with that album so and that adds up the
sex fiends so I just believe that open
for not so we'll go here and create a
new table called albums and it has six
columns so the first one is ID second
one is going to be album title third one
is going to be album description the
next one is created by the next one is I
get created and if we scroll down final
one is UID so the album title it's going
to be a varchar' description it's going
to be taxed create a bike we have our
chart left well get created is going to
be a date and UID it's gonna be varchar'
UID is gonna have a length of 32 title
can i've 32 as well
description 300 characters is probably a
good enough leg for that user name could
have 32 as well and then obviously
doesn't get one so now we go over up and
auto increment we click yes and index we
set the primary
so we like to save and as you can see
right at the top of our table it's as
albums so if we go to structure and we
go to insert will insert some dummy data
so the first one's just going to be this
is a test album the description is going
to be this is the description of my test
album created by it's going to be cinema
see it it's gonna be today the UID of
the album is gonna be just a random
string
okay I'll actually make the UID task for
now so it's easy to remember and I use
what we're testing it on so if I go to
browse it says one row is inserted rows
and here's our album but obviously if we
refresh we're not gonna get anything
because we have told it to so now we can
actually chose that and in here we can
create a new PHP block and what we can
say is get albums equals mysql query
select all from albums where i created
by equals and obviously wanted to be
username num rows close my spell no rose
got albums and finally will create a
wildly wild row equals last year I'll
fetch associative Nam Rose no yeah
numrows it's probably wrong actually
think it's got albums then we set ID
equals mu ID and we're gonna echo ID so
we should get a code one and that's what
we get which shows the queries been
successful so yes that's a few more
times
section total change this to album name
North's title actually change it to a
description created by Dean and your ID
so now I and I'll just echo album title
okay I'm finding next date
okay so it's probably because it's
probably didn't created yep so here it
is we this is at a stall bow so what
we'll do is we close that off and then
open it again and you pitch p-block and
then here we'll put in each three tags
then we'll just echo album title let's
sing hitch to maybe lots of it big so
what we'll do is we'll just keep it up
we'll go back and just don't do that
I'll keep this the way it is except
we'll change it so it's bold it's now we
have posed now we should have bold text
it's probably something the CSS
overriding so that will fix that later
so now we have our album name showing up
we want an image to show up underneath
so we're just gonna create another Akko
image source equals and for the minute
we're just not out of equal anything and
we'll give it a height of 200 pixels and
a width of let's say 140 pixels so
obviously there's no image so it's just
gonna show up like this
yeah but that's fine because I'm
actually this isn't very efficient
because making runs back it was but
doesn't matter so
run ahead Dave and that was give off a
break-in here
we could even Center this and in this
day we're just gonna say style equals
because I changed my mind and as you can
see in the side style at CSS I'm just
gonna copy these from newsfeed and paste
them in here and then change it from
newsfeed to albums on the woods we're
not gonna set i know if we change it to
div class when you set it to albums so
now if we go back and we refresh we have
a messed up dave so just put it
back to 70% and that's how it look
did it work this time so we're still
having a problem okay so what the
problem was is the CSS just didn't have
time to update it so well delete well
actually undo that and then make the
width I'm in the fresh again so now our
on fills up the full page which no I
think about it might not good so I will
undo all this here we're just gonna put
in h2 which to again I don't values
gonna username
another values gonna be album title so
obviously its Beneatha and that's not
what we want so I'll change it so it's
inside its own Dave and the day was just
gonna be sad to style just play in line
it should put it beside it
no so let me see okay so what I'll do is
I'll just cut this and paste it inside
now the Dave and I'll say it just a
v-line top let me see
cut it again inside yet create another
day and then change the V align the top
on the new Dave and then close the old
one off wasn't even off even so mmm our
photos disappeared okay so it looks like
we're running over time so I want to
actually have time to fix this in this
video but will in the next and just
before we go I'm gonna cut this and
paste it and change this to new albums
dot php' slash albums /v almost up HP u
equals 1 or whatever so what this should
do is it should I mean if we go to
refresh when we go to slash albums slash
the cinema okay let me see
so what I'll do actually I found the
problem
so just paste that in there and you're
the /a start smile if we type in slash
album slash cinema yeah we get our page
so what we'll do obviously is on the few
albums dot PHP page wait Mike yes I
asked included a long way so it /
localhost / so it's a little sliced mesh
so if I include the long way now it
should work as you can see something
went slightly wrong so let's have a look
let's see so we fix this let's just go
to this and just act with our under this
line so field to open so another thing
about it I'm actually a very own idiot
because when you include files in PHP it
doesn't matter whether than the same
directory or not all it does to sort an
extent it's kind of complicated but as
you can see when I open this it does
actually show up the problem was the CSS
stylesheet that wasn't showing up so if
we go back here only comment that line
back in what we do in the cationic the
PHP file is we just type in / localhost
/
so we just include the right CSS
document so you have the documents being
included but there's a few more
documents to include so that's just just
a Molly let's try it mine and we also
have to remember to remove the localhost
at the beginning and now if we could
refresh it works so yeah I'm sorry about
the mistakes but they're all sorted now
and anything else will be fixed in the
next video so don't forget to comment
rate subscribe thanks for watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
