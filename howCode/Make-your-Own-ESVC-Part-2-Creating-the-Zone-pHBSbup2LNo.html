this series on how to make your own DNS
I mean your own extension sort of like
est BC using bind and a point to sew and
the last video we left off having just
installed by the bind DNS server so in
this video what we're going to do is
we're gonna start setting it up so what
we're gonna do is we're going to set CD
to change directory into the /et see
slash flying directory and we hit enter
so this every type ls' this will list
all the files in the directory what we
want to do is we want to add it to file
named comm local so I'm just gonna copy
that name and I'm going to send Nano
which is the text editor I want to use
and I'm just gonna paste in the name of
the file so this loads up the file on we
can add it and put in our configuration
for our Adomian here so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna create a new zone so
we're gonna say a zone we're gonna say
zone and then we put in the name of the
domain in add 2 double quotes so what
I'm going to say is TLD dot code.org
then we want to do is we want to put two
kardi brackets in to surround or me to
open if it was a zone so everything in
here is where we're going to put in the
information for our zone file
so we're gonna type here is a we're just
going to indent it a bit I'm just going
to say I'm type master now we're going
to go down a line and we're going to
type in so what we're going to type in
here is the location of the zone file
for the domain so this is basically sort
of a reference to the a zone file and
what we're going to do is we're going to
put in the file where the zone is
actually stored so we just put in the
word file then we give it the file
location
and we need a semicolon at the end of it
so we're gonna say is slash UTC slash
pine slash zones slash t le dot hi
code.org top zone the file name on the
location is just up to you you can put
you can put the file wherever you want I
can call it whatever you want
but I'm just going to call it this for a
simplicity the next thing we need is we
need the reverse DNS zone which is
another zone we create and we reference
the reverse DNS zone
it's what reverse DNS is is them it's
the opposite of DNS so DNS works by you
give it a host name and it can resolve
the IP address of the server and what
reverse DNS does is you give it the IP
address of the server and it can find
the host name so we again put in the
zone when we create the new zone here
and then here instead of putting in a
domain name we put in the IP address but
it's sort of weird it's not the actual
IP address that you would it's not the
actual IP address we put in so when I
say it's not the actual IP address it's
actually just the IP address backwards
which is a which is actually a bit weird
so I'm just going to paste in is the IP
address of the server here and I gotta
show you how do you put it in the
reverse DNS so what we do is we type in
two to it dot 23.2 for 3.16 two in my
case and your case i'll obviously have a
different IP address
then we type in the word dot in - a DDR
darpa so just ignore the rest but that's
just required to make it actually work
and now now we've got the IP address and
we need to delete it so a quick thing
you can do is you can instead of
deleting the whole thing you can just
press ctrl K at the end of the line
it'll remove the whole line if you're
using Nano and again we just do the same
thing we say a type master file let me
give it the location of the reverse DNS
file so I are the reverse DNS zone so
I'm gonna set bind zones and then just
the same thing again so I'll just copy
this and paste it in and we'll set our
zone at the end of it
actually now we'll get rid of that
because just over complicates things
putting too many dots in so whoops we
have a knife over here so we need to get
rid of it
so just get rid of the F and that's K I
click ctrl X and then hit ye and then
hit enter to see of the file so we just
set up the well the references to the
zone files in our buying DNS server so
that's it for this video don't forget to

I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
