the remix of the part of maker and
social network video series so this is
the second part and this is the part
where I change the original design to
the second design we used so let's get
started so the first thing I did was I
went into the startup CSS file I created
a website made a background color and I
set that equal to e FF 5 f9 so now if i
refresh the page what should happen is
everything changes to this kind of pale
blue and then the next thing we did was
we went into the header menu and I
almost forgot we included a new image so
this is the man you BG image this damage
we're going to be using for the new menu
from now on so I'll just get rid of this
background color I'll change it to
background image URL and I'm going to
set it equal to image whoops
image slash menu DG PNG and the reason
for the reason I have the dot dot
forward slash at the beginning is
because we're telling since this is in
CSS slash style dot CSS and the image
directory is in the fine friends slash
image I'll show you so here's our
directory to the moment when we're in
our CSS file we're in it this is where
we are here as you can see there's no
folder that says image so what we want
to do is we want to go up one directory
which is back to define franz directory
and we want to go into the image
directory to get the menu BG a PNG image
that's what this data for slash means
means go up one directory so that we can
access the image folder on the menu PG
PNG file
so the next thing I'm going to do is I'm
just going to copy this menu in our
background image URL I'm going to paste
it here and we're going to refresh and
I'm also going to paste it here
let's try this one as well uh
okay so that's almost dead except
everything's not there quite the right
size so we need to fix that now so what
we want to do is whoops I want to go
there we want to come up here to our
header menu and we want to reset the
size with 256 pixels and as you can see
now everything fits perfectly the way it
should so that's it for this video don't
forget to Like comment favorite and
subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
