about arrays in JavaScript so the first
question you're probably asking yourself
is what is an array and an array is just
basically a way of storing multiple
values in a single variable inside
JavaScript
once inside any language it's Aseem so
to create an array what we do is we
create a variable and I'm gonna call my
in my array and we set it equal to 2
square brackets like this so and
normally you would save our me an equals
Francis and you would Saturday go to a
string which is delimited by two double
quotes so array is delimited by two
square brackets and in JavaScript
actually semicolons are not compulsory
but I'm just going to put one in just to
avoid confusion so what I'm gonna do is
we're going to put an array of strings
arrays can hold multiple data types so
for example there was a string I could
put a number in as well so I could say
10 and I can also include objects such
as a well another array or I could
include an object I created or I can
include a function so I'll just say PHP
Python and I'm gonna say down here the
document not write my array
so as you can see it printed out like a
list it looks like a normal string with
commas in between each item but as you
see javascript is no problem including a
number with strings in the one array so
add to keep things so but I'm just going
to change this to a string so I'll say
JavaScript
so when JavaScript was a function called
type of and if I say I like to check
console dot log and I'll said type of my
array and then to do this what we have
to do is you have to open up the console
and will refresh I just can see the
console says object what this means is
that JavaScript sees arrays as objects
so what this means that's why we can
include objects in arrays and what that
also means is we can create arrays using
the new keyword so I could say it for my
let's say sakkath array and I can set
that equal to a new array and I can give
it a 5 and what this will do is this
creates a new array with five undefined
indexes in it so 5 spaces for
information that are currently empty
there's no point using this second
method it's just you can't do it but
it's more its preferred to use the first
method because this first method you
could say like this might say third Iraq
I can just set that equal to say 5 and
what this does is this creates a third
array with space for five items in it so
the difference between using the new
array keyword and just you know putting
in two square brackets on the number is
the number tells javascript how many how
many items here I can hold but what the
new array keyword and the function does
is it creates a new array with five
items in it so this uses more memory
straight away at this moment this array
will be smaller than this one because
this one has failed five and
is up as undefined so it is a slower to
use this second method and it's more
preferred just to use the method and the
first one so since arrays are objects I
can use I can do this so if I get rid of
the square brackets and replace them
with curly brackets what I'm doing now
is I'm creating an object I'm not
creating an array but on Iran an object
of the same thing so then what I can do
is I can say line one time two then I'll
say a line three I know what I'll do is
I'll say a console dot log my array dot
line one
and as you can see we get Python
returned to us if I said lying
- we'll get PHP and if I said line three
will get JavaScript
so what you can do to access items in
our array is let's just go back to an
ordinary array so what you do to access
items in an array as I could say
console.log
my array and get these zero index so
since computers can't from zero that
will get Python because this is the 0th
index this is the first one and this is
the second one even though the street at
three items in the array so if i refresh
the page now you can see we get python
again i can override items in an array
doing this so i could say in myarray
zero equals HTML i know if i refresh the
page i can see we got hitched your mouth
returned to us so you can add a new item
to in a read by doing this you'd say my
array and then you put the square
brackets to give it an index and i could
say a my array dot length and the way
the reason this works actually have to
go to bali saucer CSS so the reason this
works is because arrays cut from 0 so
even though those three items in this
this javascript element one have an
index of 2 and since of three items the
length of this will be three so this is
the same as saying my array 3 equals CSS
the exact same way except this is a more
dynamic web because this means no matter
what length of our what length our array
is we'll add a new item to the end of it
so I'm just going to log console that
log the entire array and I'll see when
you get CSS added to the end of it okay
so the reason we got that arrows we just
fucking rid of the brackets
so let's refresh emergency we have
Python PHP JavaScript CSS is the last
element in the array the reason that
didn't work is because length isn't a
method which is just basically a
function length is a property which just
has the name of the property it doesn't
have anything after it
so just remember length is a property
not a method and so that when you're
using it you don't put the parenthesis
on the end of it so I'm gonna add
another item to the array I'm gonna get
rid of this and I'm just going to add
arrange side of an array so as you can
see you'll find out now I I can add an
array to an array by just creating
another array up here same bar I'm just
called a and I'll just give it some
value so I could say test and hello and
I could just add it to this array by
doing that and that would add the array
I can also do it this way so I could
just get rid of that
and here I'll just pissed in here the
new array and if I console dot log that
now you can see we have another array
and if I open this up you can see in
sight we have two we have an array
inside an array so let's bend in a short
introduction to arrays in JavaScript
