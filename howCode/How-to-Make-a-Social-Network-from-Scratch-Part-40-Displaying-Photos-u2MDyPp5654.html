we're going to be doing is we're going
to be finishing off where we left off
last week and maybe we're going to be
displaying photos inside our albums so
if we go to the website at the minute we
can see a non-attractive sort of looking
page and it displays it's gonna display
the album so if we put more albums in
we'd see more albums out here and what
we're gonna do is one once we finish
this page we're gonna move on to the
next page which is gonna be actually
displaying photos and then after that
we'll probably move on and actually
upload photos so let's get started so
we're gonna go to context here and I'm
just gonna delete all this now we're
gonna start from scratch so first thing
I'm going to do is I'm gonna come up
here I'm going to create TM look I don't
able go in there and then then we will
go down here and we're gonna end the
table rule and then in the table so if
we refresh the page now we won't see any
difference apart from that actually
disappearing because we generated the
code for that but what we're gonna do is
so that's coming here and firstly what
we're gonna do is create a table detail
and in case you're wondering the reason
why these are outside of the PHP code is
because we only want this to show up
once when you want one table but inside
this a co it's gonna be repeated for how
many for however many albums the user
house so we'll go down a bit and in here
we're just create a dude on the div
class it's going to be
oops the div class is gonna be albums
from our CSS file and in our album stuff
SIA in our albums class in the CSS file
I'm just going to add a width of 200
pixels and a height of 200 pixels so
then an offer refresh we have a 200
pixels square here and you'll see if I
cut this and then paste it again on copy
and paste it again and refresh I didn't
see we have two squares beside each
other so what I'll actually do is
include and space
okay so glad to fix that actually we're
gonna come into the album's and we'll
just put a padding on the left just a
padding left 5 pixels sloppy refresh
that's right let's try this 9 yeah so it
was margin right so I just set the
margin right to maybe 10 bucks so now we
have a 10 pixel margin or a gap in
between the two boxes so I've done that
and we can get rid of this and in here
in here what we're gonna do is we're
just gonna create an image we're gonna
put a hash in there because we haven't
got our image yet and all this at the
height equal to
one saddening I'm the word equal to 170
pixels as well so now if we refresh it
again no and also to make a look a bit
better we can Center it well that's not
really the correct way the center tag
does work and sometimes I use it because
I'm really easy what's the correct way
as of 2014 is to say text-align:center
now if we do that and refresh my are
just in the center I don't know why
they're changing it but that's what
they're going to do and then we're gonna
put two line breaks and then we're just
gonna say album title album title and
then just the fraction again and there
it is so there's our album showing up so
the next thing we're gonna do is we're
going to allow you I like people to
click on it and then to view and the
inside the album sort of your pictures
and things so we'll just create any file
and then we'll just save it as all files
and we'll just call it we could just
call it view photo dot PHP so now if we
do that we hit save we have a PHP file
so what I'll do is I'll just include
this whole file basically just paste it
in and then in this Dave now we're gonna
link the image we're just gonna actually
create a link here to view photo HB
I didn't see will actually say we
actually need to create no well that say
you ID equals yeah okay sorry if that
didn't make sense but we're gonna go to
view folded-up HP UID equals my new ID
and then down here we're gonna and the
huge raft so now if we refresh we the
link that when we click on it and as you
can see it takes us to albums so we need
to open our dead htaccess file by going
all files and then double clicking on
this file that looks like it doesn't
have the name but if your way of your
mouse over it you can see it says HDR
HDR access so now if we open that all we
have to do is copy this line and paste
it down and just change this to view
photo dot php' whoops
you photo and then click Save and now if
we refresh ok so the reason the I this
file isn't working is because we need to
go into here and then change it so it's
got a UID no no we can just leave it as
a you in whatever no actually we'll
change it just to make sure we don't get
confused and then change this obviously
DUID
but obviously since we did that now this
isn't gonna be looking for view photo
dot PHP it's gonna be album slash and
then whatever the UID is so if I go into
the database and then the database as
you can see it says UID and then
test so what I have to do is type in
albums slash test and some reason it
didn't work but I were actually change
this to our fourth album / view photo /
and then this way now if we go to albums
/ view photo / test okay we keep getting
redirected so what I'm gonna do is just
comment this out let's see what happens
so we go to column / move a little flash
test and here it is but okay the reason
it's redirecting us is because now we're
including the header file from the wrong
location what we have to do since we've
gone to directories further away from
the ink file well okay let's include
line will only work from the root
directory I know even though we haven't
actually changed directory
according to HT access where two
directories further in so what we need
to do is just type in dot dot slash dot
dot slash to go up to directories and
then it will find the ink slashing file
/ a turtleneck dot PHP file so you can
maybe I was wrong okay so okay so that
was nice the problem with the real
problem is because we thought we said
here where is it username equals
masculine read escape string UID so
basically we're just create a variable
called user mean that filters this URL
string and what it does is it checks
that against the database so since we
don't have a user called test it doesn't
work but if we typed in cinema it works
and that's
so we can uncomment this line and we
need to change this to okay let me see
picture and then we can just rename
these so we're gonna say I select all
from photos wire eg ID equals UID no
actually we need to change best picture
okay so now I've done that we're gonna
change this where a before we move any
farther would actually gonna create the
database table so if we go here and we
got create table okay so I'm gonna do it
here so we're just gonna size photos and
then let's go into context and plan out
our fields so the first one obviously I
is ID next one can be you've ID because
photo doesn't really well k no say you
ID username date hosted and description
let's try that
so there's five fields so it's five we
need so that's great table with five
fields called photos and click enter
okay so the first one we created was ID
the second one we created was UUID next
one was username next one was dance
posted the next one was description so
what we're gonna do is create that I set
the UID equal to a varchar' of length
thirty-two username can be 32 as well
they posted just to keep it set but
we're going to
to date and then description can be
taxed then we're going to go over and
set the index to primary and then set it
to auto increment so now we're just
going to save our table and as you can
see now we have a new table called
photos so we go to structure and we are
we insert value the value of the UID is
gonna be test obviously the username can
be cinema it doesn't matter
the opposed to give me today and the
description is this is a test so we're
going to do is we're going to click go
and know that that queries gone through
we're gonna click browse and we can see
it in our database tonight so I made
sure to make sure that this UID matches
the UID in the albums table of our album
so that the photo knows which album to
go into basically we need to make sure
those two you IDs match so we'll go back
to the photos table come up with context
just want to change this to you ID and
then username so we're just gonna pissed
this time and then change this one to
get posted
posted and then finally the last row we
used one's description so
now we've done that we can go down here
and what we're gonna do is we're going
to go here and just change this the post
or not photos actually and then
obviously change it to UID as well and I
just realized change this actually to
post photos I keep saying posts so we're
gonna just cut these copy them actually
and then delete the bottom two because
we don't need em our server doing any
extra work than it has to because that's
just gonna skew our page time and then
here we can just change this to you ID
know remember we should have got a photo
title we'll just change it to
description for now it's not if we
refresh we're not gonna we're gonna get
taken back to here because a photo who
called cinema doesn't exist or our photo
with the UID of cinema doesn't exist so
before we do that we're actually gonna
go to albums and change it to albums /
view photo / and then you ID which is
why the you ideas how to make the CM so
we can point to it from that so we're
going here and we type in album / cinema
and here we get the album so now if we
click on the link let's have a look
so we're gonna leave you photo pH
actually let's just say let's go to it
to Drew okay here it is it's because
it's slash album / albums so just go
down here and then jelly thoughts and
then we'll just go back to the albums
page and then we'll click on it not so
here today's it looks exactly the same
but as you can see the name change says
this is a test
if we go back this is a task table
they're pretty similar but it shows it's
working because one
this isn't even a link just either so no
if we go to view photo and we change
this to photos or we just actually said
photos in this and then here it is so we
can get rid of they know no kidding like
that
so we can before we go we can another
road in the table and this time it's
just one row at the bottom it's actually
the most important one it's the photo ID
or the photo URL so it's photo image URL
now we'll set it to have our char and
then actually said at the text and then
I'm just a dancer so now we have the
image URL field in our case it's gonna
be empty at the minute so let's click in
line at it now we can edit our feel like
this and okay as floating is added it
because it's add me so I'm
gonna put in I'm gonna go to homepage
are they a newsfeed actually and here
I'm just gonna drag this image up and
copy its URL - paste it in so this can
be our test image for our photo album
and here I'm just gonna set or include a
new row image URL then set this to image
URL so now if we go back to our albums
and we click on the photo here it is
here's our photo so that's showing up so
that's it for this video and if you
liked it don't forget to like favorite
and subscribe the more like that's
coming soon as well as well as videos
and other programming languages such as
JavaScript Python and maybe see your
other ones like that so I don't forget
to comment rate or a comment like and
subscribe like I said and in the next
part we probably what we'll probably be
doing is actually I think people upload
their own images to photo albums so
thanks for watching and see you next
