we're going to be printing out numbers
and expressions we're not going to be
evaluating expressions which means
working like the you know the value of
an expression so for example I have an
expression say 10 plus 2 if we evaluate
that we'll get the number 12 but we're
not going to be doing that in this video
we're just going to printing out the
expression because evaluating
expressions is kind of complicated to do
in an interpreter so what we're going to
do is we're first going to get rid of
this print tokens because we can see the
tokens already actually leave it there
for debugging but what we're going to do
is you can see what we can print strings
in a moment but we want to be able to
print numbers and expressions well we
actually want to be we want to be able
to print numbers and evaluated
expressions but for now we're just going
to print numbers the actual expression
itself so what we're gonna do is we're
just gonna say or we're going to paste
in the same thing again we're going to
do is want to change this to numb to
begin with so what we're going to do is
we just need to change this to 0-3
and because what this is doing is this
gets the award string from the string
token because the strength to open also
has the value of the string and what
we're doing is we're getting the first
three letters over the num token because
the NAM Dobin also has the value of the
number so what we're going to do now is
we're just going to go to terminal and
refresh this okay we might get it okay
we add don't get anything printed out to
us okay the reason we don't get anything
printed out is because here it says
print and work starting on the 7th
the 7th character and the string but our
number is not that long
whoops if I go to here you can see it
says num colon 10 and there's only 6
characters in that source drawing the 7
so we're getting a blank
so we're basically getting a blank
strings what we want to do here is we
want to say if whoops
kokes
I plus 1 and then we will say :
zero
sex equals strain then we're going to
print like this now we're going to say
else I will just Alice because we'll
have multiple ones a left Oaks I plus 1
: 0 2 3 we're going to get the first 3
characters I want to get the word Bob so
we'll send up and what is print tokes I
plus 1 and then we well so we want to
ignore the colon as well so that's why
this start on 7 so this means that since
numbers 3 characters long we want to
start on the 4th characters for as if
for go to the end of the string we're
just going to copy and paste this and
you probably notice that interpreters
are quite repetitive so far so we're
just going to say expr listen before and
this is going to be 5 all we have to do
here is change this as well so we'll say
over folks I plus 1
is equal to expression which is going to
four characters so we just load this on
hit monitor you can see it prints ten if
I said ten plus twenty or twenty nine
new and I'm just mistyped it and I hit
enter you can see it says 10 plus twenty
nine if I also say a plus oops I want to
just use numbers okay not number and hit
enter you can see our expressions can be
as long as we want but if I put a - say
- 39 in there or not it's just going to
give us an error because we don't know
how to deal with minuses at the moment
so that's really easy to fix all we want
to do is come in here and change this to
an or tok equals minus or to' equals
actually we'll just do my row and I'll
show you that it fixed it so if we come
up here and hit enter you can see in our
we can see if minuses we can say or toke
equals divided or total equals x equals
we're also going to do brackets because
we're not going to do anything my
precedence in this video but we're going
to use brackets to work out precedence
because in some most languages like C++
are all you can do ten plus two times
four and what that would do is it would
do the two times four first which is it
plus tab which is 18 so that's what now
gives me 18 and that's just a in C++ or
most other languages but what we're
going to do is we're going to ignore all
that and to make things simpler we're
just going to say at ten if we see ten
plus two times four we're just going to
say that equals 10 plus 2 which is 12 x
4 which is 48 so that's going to be in
our language
to solve the precedence problem what
we're going to do is really simply we're
just going to say a 10 plus 2 times 4
looks 2 times 4 and then to solve this
problem we're just going to put brackets
around it because in no mods you do the
brackets first so that does 2 times 4
which is 8 plus tiny team so that's what
I like which we do to get 10 so we're
going to keep brackets but we're not
actually going to do anything with
brackets the movement we're just going
to allow you to put them in an
expression so now if we load this again
you'll see we get the same result let's
say I do in the exact same expression
again so I said 10 plus 2 times 4 and
I'm just going to put brackets around it
when we evaluate ad that's expression
what we're going to get is obviously the
right value which is 18 but what we want
to what we're going to do in this video
is just print it out so I print that so
as you can see we just get 10 plus 2 and
then in brackets 2 times 4 which is
exactly what we provided we don't even
need to book right we could add get rid
of some spaces we get up a space that
space there are no spaces on these ones
I don't give us the exact same answer
because we just ignore spaces so what
I'm going to do now is I'm just going to
get rid of that print tokens because we
don't need that at the moment
and if we just do that again you can see
that's what we got as a result
but before I go what I'm going to do is
we get rid of these quotes around the
hello world so to do that what I'm going
to do is we create a function called to
print and the function is going to take
the string to print so what we're going
to do is we're going to say if to print
oops I have to print um not to six
equals string then we're going to say to
print equals
to print seven onward you actually want
to get rid of the double quotes as well
so if we're starting on sad we actual to
add one on to make it to ever to the
first quote and then what we also want
to do is when I said to print equals to
print colum and then we'll just say
minus one so then what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to go down here and
I'll say a print to print now what I'm
also going to do is I'm going to come up
here and say if it equals a number so
we'll say LF will send um
then what we're going to do is we just
copy this again change this to a four
we'll also do that for expressions as
well
the xpr will change this to the five on
this to four so what we want to do now
is we actually just want to pass it the
variable toks
I plus one because we're doing the sort
of convert we're getting rid of the
value of the two of the beginning of the
token in the print function we're not
actually needing to pass the already
removed version so for example the token
if I had a string that said how the
world the token would look like this
oops hello world so what we're doing is
we're passing this entire token to the
do print function and what the function
does is the first thing it does is it
removes this string and well after this
and then what it does is it removes
those as well so we're left with just
the words hello world
so we just have to change this a print
function to the do print function I will
just copy paste this I just saying if we
hit enter okay we got something wrong
with the string so we'll just say that
minus 1 and hit enter and as you can see
it got rid of the double quotes for us
but it preserved our expression so
that's it for this video don't forget to
