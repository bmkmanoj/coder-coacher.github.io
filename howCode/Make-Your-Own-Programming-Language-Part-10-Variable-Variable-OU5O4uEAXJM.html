doing is we're going to be enabling
variables to be assigned to other
variables so the moment we can assign a
variable to an expression we can assign
a variable to a string and we can assign
a variable to a number but we can't for
example assign if we add a variable
called test to another variable called
Frances for example so this we're going
to be learning how to do in this video
so if you look here on the Wikipedia
page you can see we can assign a
variable to another variable they have
assigned it to a variable and then
they're appending something onto the and
new value but for the moment we're going
to be just assigning it to another
variable same way as their as they have
done here
so let's just go into basic pie and all
we have to do is change our parser so we
can down here you can see we can assign
to a string a number or an expression so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy this
whoops actually I just want to actually
that's right so we'll just paste it in
here and I want to set this equal to var
so what we do is we just take the first
three characters again because we want
to get the word var and what we do is we
go down here and we copy one of these
and I change this to var on the only
thing that's different is we want to
first assign we want to study the IDS
sign but then what we want to do is we
want to we want to do a lock up at the
same time so I want to say get variable
I want to pass it this string which is
the variable name which is the set of
our name of the second Bible so for
example if I go here on the Skip
herbalist I'll say var one equals 10 and
I'll say var 2 equals var 1 so this is
what we want to do so this is bigger
first variable and this is a second one
so the second variable is this this is
what we're passing to the get variable
function and we'll dig a variable
functional terms is the value of that
variable and if it's not find it'll
return variable error undefined variable
and what will also do then is exit
because that way then the the whole
program will stop running so what we're
going to do is we're just going to run
not now so I'll run that and it phrases
okay the reason it phrases is we are
copying it wrong so I'm just going to
get rid of that and I have to copy this
whole section not just the second part
of it
so in
change this one s one part engines is
devar and that should work nine so as
you can see we got 14 in Francis that's
because we didn't see of it so if we run
this knife we get no wipe up because we
didn't tell it to print anything so if
we print var one to begin with we should
get ten we print var two will also get
ten and if I say
ten let's say sixteen I will get sixteen
as well so there we have it we can
assign variables to other variables we
can assign them to strings numbers and
expressions as well so we just go to our
check list and then check not is done so
