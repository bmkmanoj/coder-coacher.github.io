to create views from our controllers in
this video we're going to be learning
how to create models and models are how
we're going to connect to our database
and how we're going to interact with it
sometimes models are used for all of the
logic in the application but what we're
going to be using it for is just for
database accesses so the first thing we
need to do is we need to create a
database class and if you go to our
social network series you can see this
is the source code over here you can see
we already have a DB class created so
we're going to use that as our template
I'm going to copy this up we're going to
go to classes and we're going to create
a new file and we're going to call it
database we're going to paste in this TB
class we're going to change the name of
it to database and then what we're going
to do is we're going to create a public
static host copy PS up we're going to
create a public static DB name username
and password then on our connection
string here what we're going to do is
we're going to first change the single
quotes to double quotes and here what
we'll do is we'll include the post
variable the DB name variable username
variable and the password variable and
we actually to just put itself here so
we put a dot and a double quote and that
allows us to break the string for a
second while we can put in this self
keyword we're going to copy this I'm
going to do it for DB name as well and
then for username we're just going to
put himself it's not as strings we don't
need to do that and pass we're going to
put in SAS as well and then in about us
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a special functions we're going
to set public static test for example
just to test this out it's a public
static function and what we'll do is we
will say a self query to query the
database also select all from users then
if we go to our rights to PHP page we go
to about us we're going to say about us
instead of about a script view we're
going to say about us tasks from our
task function and then in our base
controller class wanna see a class
controller extends database the in
controller what we need to do is we need
to set public host equals 127.0.0.1
public TV name equals social network
public username equals root and public
four equals an empty string and we just
want to pierce them static here to make
sure these are all static and we're not
really clearing the variables and what
we'll actually do is just delete them on
the controller class we'll just put them
right in the database class because it
probably makes more sense
so just paste them in here I'm gonna set
the values in the database class and if
we refresh we get nothing printed out
because we haven't told it to print
anything out but if I just print
underscore R the result of our query you
can see we got all of our users printed
out of the database and this is
happening in our controller which is
being called by the route which is being
run based off of the URL parameter
that's passed to the index page we could
tidy something up in the write-up HPT
page you can see we have a method called
create view and we have another method
called test what we could do is from the
create view method we could run our
other methods so what we can do is we
can say run a function called something
like do something and what we want to do
is put static before that and this is
called let static binding you can find
more about that on the PHP website if
you're interested but just we want to
call static here and that will allow us
in our about Us class which is our class
that extends the controller class it
will load our class to say a public
static function do something without us
having to create the do something method
in the controller class which is the
parent class so if I run that
you can see we had exactly as we
expected but it's bit more tidy because
in our rights page we only have one
function running in each right nine so
that's it for that short series on model
view controllers we're going to be using
this in our social network series so
this was quite useful to learn
beforehand but that's it for this video
