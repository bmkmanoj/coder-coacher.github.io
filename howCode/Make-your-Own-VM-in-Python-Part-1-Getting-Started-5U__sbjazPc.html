we're going to be learning how to do is
you're going to be learning on a create
a virtual machine in Python so what a
virtual machine is is it's basically
kind of like virtual computer that runs
within your own computer and the reason
that virtual machines are used is mainly
they're used for things like programming
languages so a programming language like
say for example would take C source code
and convert it down into a machine code
which is a basically like ones and zeros
so loads of binary code of it it
converts it to a machine code that is
specific to the processor of the
computer but what a virtual machine does
is it's a program that runs on the
computer and what you would do you had a
programming language that use the
virtual machine is you would have the
programming language would convert the
source code into machine code but the
machine code will be specific to the
virtual machine rather than the computer
that it runs on the advantage of this is
because is that wherever your virtual
machine runs your programs will run so
for example if you write a program in
sane you convert it into machine code so
basically you convert it into an
executable file you can actually use
your program that program will only run
on computers that have to see them
processor architectures that when you
compile it on what if you have a virtual
machine anywhere you can anywhere you
compile your virtual machine is where
the code for that one room so you don't
need alter any of it or anything so
that's why they're used today we're
going to doing is showing you how to
create one so the next thing you'll
notice is I'm on this website called pi
PI
and what pi PI is is it's a project that
is the project's goal is to create an
implementation of the Python programming
language and that is written in Python
itself and the reason I'm on this page
on this website Amin is because PI bi
has this tune called translate PI and
what it does is it converts Python code
in the sea and then compiles it into an
executable the reason we're going to do
this is because if we just run ours
inside
we just read in normal Python and rahmat
our virtual machine will be really slow
because Python it's out runs in a
virtual machine so and then basically
this means our virtual machine will be
running inside of a virtual machine
that's running on a processor so we are
converting it to say using pi by we're
going to eliminate that step and make
our virtual machine a lot quicker so to
get started what you're going to do is
you're gonna click download on the pi PI
home page and you're gonna scroll down
and you're gonna find the source so
we're gonna click download on the source
of pi PI so this is going to download
the pi PI source code into the Downloads
folder obviously my computer the reason
we're downloading this is because the pi
PI source is where we're going to find
the translator that'll turn our Python
code into pi PI
Armenian to see a code that can be
compiled ok so we're just going to open
it up and here it is so as you can see
here there's a folder called our Python
and in pi PI you can't just convert
normal Python code in to see because
pythons are much higher level languages
and C is so what pi PI has is it's kind
of language called our Python which it
stands for restricted Python so it's
kind of similar to Python for what we're
gonna be doing it's going to be
basically exactly disorder but there is
a few differences but don't you don't
need to worry about them because for
what what we're gonna be doing you're
not going to notice them so here's an
our Python folder so what I'm gonna do
is you could just copy it instead of
copying it what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to create a sibling and I'll show
you how to do that now so here I am in
my terminal and I'm in a folder called
virtual machine it's not actually on my
desktop and as you see I have a folder
called V n PI which is here but this is
just a blank file so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a sim language
is just a shortcut basically to the our
Python folder so I'm gonna say L n minus
s and then going to drag in the folder
our Python and then what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to call it our Python
so what the did is it created a shortcut
called our Python so now I can access
the our Python folder so if I type in CD
our Python and I can press tab and it
will fill it in for me as you can see
and I can see everything in the our
Python folder so that's what I'm gonna
be show you how to do in this
introduction video in the next video
we're going to be actually doing some
code so look forward to that so once
again thanks for watching don't forget
