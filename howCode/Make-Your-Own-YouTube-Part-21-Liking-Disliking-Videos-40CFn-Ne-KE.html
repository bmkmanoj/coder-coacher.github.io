thing you see in this video is actually
I've changed the tax data I'm gonna be
using I've decided to use this text
editor called sublime text 2 instead of
context because I thought the syntax
highlighting was better because the
colors in this one were better and I
liked the dark background so if you
actually add don't want me to use this
text chatter and you think it's better
to use context just let me know and then
we'll use context and sad but for now
let's just use sublime text and let's
get started so what we're gonna be doing
in this video is we're going to be
actually letting people create likes so
we're gonna be putting a like button and
if we have time a dislike button as well
on the video watch page so let's get
started so the first thing we need to do
is we need to decide where we're gonna
put the like and dislike buttons and I
think I'm gonna put them here on the
left hand side and directly opposite to
the progress bar we created in the last
video so if we go into the code and we
scroll down to the progress bar Dave
let's see this is it here um so what we
want to do is we want to actually put
this on we want to put it above this so
if we scroll up okay so we're
gonna come in here and we're just gonna
put in some random text and see where it
goes just to make sure that we're in the
right place so as you can see the tax
code is there so that means we need to
come in here and we'll create a Dave
actually we'll go up here whoops and
we'll do is we'll just set it give it a
Stein attribute and then one sided to
float:left
set its width to 100% and then we'll
just write here this is a native and
we'll see where this goes so as you can
see there it is there that's what we
wanted so what we need to do is let's
cut this and paste it in here so as you
can see that sort of put it more in line
so what we're going to do is we're going
to change the width to let's just set
the width to 40%
okay maybe not 40% let's have a look
let's change it to 10 okay so it appears
that if we set this to zero it should
push the progress bar back so it looks
like whatever extra space we give this
div or go is it's going to take away
from this div so what we need to do is
cut the step again paste it in here
and as you know we need to actually give
it a percentage with so we'll give it a
10% width and as you can see it's
starting to fill up the we're starting
to give the div more space without
actually taking away from the progress
bar am i pushing it over so we're going
to do is we're going to give this 50%
width
maybe maybe a bit less okay and then
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a form so form and then include a
general form down here give it an action
of this here
it's that watch stop PHP now video our
video ID equals and then the video ID so
we can just copy it and paste it up here
and then what we can do is we'll give it
a method of post and then in here what
we're going to do is want to create to
submit buttons so the name of the submit
button is going to be like and then the
volume is going to be like and then what
we're going to do is we're just gonna
copy this and then create another button
called dislike and we're it's gonna set
just like so now we have our two buttons
just get rid of that so what we need to
do is we're just going to set their
position maybe so
so actually within this day we're just
gonna create a new Dave and then close
it off
so the visit we're just going to set the
position to absolute let's just see what
this does
okay that's not we wanted actually
instead of that we'll just give it a
margin so margin and I just say if I go
back here we wanted to sort of push up
so byte we can do that by giving it a
negative margin of maybe minus 10 pixels
what they should do is it should push
our buttons up as you can see it did
maybe we don't want to push them up as
much but we'll leave it like that for
now because we can style them with CSS
later on okay but maybe for the meantime
we'll just push them down so negative 5
pixels made me so that's fine for now so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create the nativist able to hold likes
and dislikes 9 so what we're going to do
is first want to plan it out so we need
to plan out our fails so we'll just set
DB table fields maybe maybe table fails
and then the first field is gonna be ID
obviously second one is going to be
whether to like or dislike you know the
first the second one will be I like or
I'll just write L oh they from like or
just like just shortened it time and and
then the next thing is going to be the
video ID and the person who did it or he
liked or disliked it so just say
username so that's all we need for
fields so let's go into our table and
scroll down and create
for a table called ratings so we're
going to create the table called ratings
that's gonna have four columns okay so
it says ratings already exists oh yeah
we made in the last video so let's just
have a look so we can just append
another column on to the original
ratings table and this turret this new
ones just gonna be a username and the
username can be up to 32 characters long
I think so we'll set that as the maximum
length so now we've done that we're
going to go into we're gonna close this
and we're gonna come in here and we're
gonna say if we're going to say go up
here and add a comment um let's say add
ratings code so what we want to do is
we're just going to say if these whoops
inset post like so if it's a like that's
been posted then we just want to say
MySQL query update
Arnel insert into readings values and as
you can see we have f4 possible that
columns to fill in so the first ones IDs
we leave it blank the second one is
video ID so we'll just set that equal to
video video ID the next one is going to
be if it's a like or dislike so in our
case it's going to be a likes we're just
going to set it equal to like because
it's a the values type or mean the a
column name is type only a type of data
it takes is just a word like or dislike
as you can see here and then finally we
just need user name so the user name
we're just gonna use the variable
username that we get from our header
file or there okay so what we're gonna
do is we're just going to say we're
gonna need all like that for an eye and
we're going to test this out and see
does it work so if I come here and I
click like I'm gonna find variable
username okay that's okay about our
query should still run successfully so
as you can see there's four rows here
now and then if we refresh hopefully
we'll get five I didn't see its as
approximately five total and so
everything worked except the username so
as you can see now I'm in the header
file and I've got the session variable
up here and it's actually called user so
let's try it now click like we had no
one to find variables and it should have
worked
let's go into the table again I'm as you
can see now that like has been added to
the table so what I'm gonna do is I'm
just going to delete this table and I'm
gonna show you that it actually is
working so just empty the table and if
we refresh knowing we should actually
just seem nothing okay we see warning
division by zero we'll fix on the next
video but as you can see if I click like
what will happen is the bar will just
fill them whoops let's just refresh so
as you can see our bar just filled full
and what we need to do actually is we
need to say create a header or use the
header function to reload the page after
likes been after something's been liked
because at the moment you have to
actually manually refresh it and that's
not good so let's just copy this
okay so that should be it so that's just
to try it again it's like like and as
you can see if we go over it's still
green so we won't actually notice any
difference but if we refresh we have two
rows so we're just going to quickly do
the dislike one and I'm we I'll be able
to show you that actually is working so
we just basically just copy and paste
set this to dislike and then just the
only thing we need to change if we need
to change this to dislike and then
that's it so let's try it now click
dislike and as you can see it updated it
without me having you do anything if we
click just like again and again as you
can see it is increasing in the bar we
click like a few times the likes slowly
increase the know the actual amount of
green and so on and so on it just gets
more and more and more so we have a few
more things to do obviously we don't
want people to be able to dislike and
like the video more than once so we'll
do that in the next video and we'll also
sort at the warning division by zero so
that's it for this video don't forget to
Like comment favorite and subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
