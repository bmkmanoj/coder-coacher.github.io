isn't going to be showing you how to
install software on your best face
hosting account it's the easiest
possible way you could ever think of of
installing software on a website so the
way I'm going to be showing you is using
this software package called Softaculous
it's a piece of software that I've
installed on and the big huge and the
unlimited plans and it allows you to
install software really easily on your
account
so in the last video I showed you how to
create a subdomain so I created the
subdomain hello da Frances McNamee comm
so what I'll do now is I'll install
WordPress on it so if I go into the best
space control panel this is cPanel and I
scroll down to the near the bottom you
can see it says Softaculous that's
because I'm on the huge plan
so here if I click on Softaculous
you can see it has a list of software I
can install there's actually way more
than this it's just a simplified version
of the list so here's the nest of
software I can install as loads of
different pieces of software and what
we've done to make this faster is we've
actually pre downloaded all of the
software for you so we've predominate
all the software onto the server itself
this way you don't have to download it
every time you install it you just
install our local copy of it so here if
I click install
says what protocol do I want to use HTTP
or HTTPS and if I want www or not I just
choose HTTP then choose my domain I want
hello da Frances McNamee comm and in the
directory I want to delete that and that
way it will install in this root
directory here which is hello da fastest
McNamee calm with nothing after
so this database name I'll just leave
that as default it says table prefix
I'll leave that as default as well I'll
say hello world for the title
so for description I'm just gonna write
this is my blog I'm not actually use it
so let's just go in here I'll here's the
admin password
Anjali the light is default cuz I'm not
gonna use it I'm gonna delete it
afterwards so there's no point changing
it and what I'm gonna do now is I'll
just click install and you can see this
is gonna be out really really really
fast because we've already proved
downloaded all the software so there you
can see it's installed so if I go to my
website and I click refresh you can see
it says hello world and here's my blog
and I didn't have to do anything to
install that I didn't have to go through
the WordPress installer I didn't have to
do anything all I had to do was use the
soft tacos installer install I'll
install another piece of software I'm
gonna install my own version of
Wikipedia because Wikipedia is
open-source if you didn't already know
so the source is here it's called mini a
wiki so I'm gonna install this version
here so I'll just click on it and I
click install and I want to install this
version of it which is the newest
version then I want to install it on say
hello to France make me calm again I
wanna install it in the directory just
in the root directory and I want to say
my wiki as the name it doesn't actually
matter and I'll just click install so it
didn't let me install Wikipedia that's
because I've already installed WordPress
in the CM directory so what I'll do is
just delete WordPress and this will show
you how easy it is to delete I'm a piece
of software as well so if I click remove
this will delete everything until it's
the database deletes the files delete
everything click OK and there we go it's
all about likely gone in less than five
seconds so what I want to do now is I
want to install the wiki so I click on
media wiki down here and I want to click
install
so wanna start out on my hello da
Frances McNamee com domain in the root
directory I want to call it my amusing
with you if I go here and refresh I see
the WordPress installation is deleted so
what I'm gonna do now is go down here
click install and you'll see within a
matter of seconds Wikipedia will be
installed well my own version of
Wikipedia will be installed
there we go it's automatically installed
if I click refresh now it will be my own
version of Wikipedia so there we go
here's my own version of Wikipedia
installed and running on my website and
it took me less than a few seconds to
install so that's it for this video but
