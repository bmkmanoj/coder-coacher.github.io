video is I'm going to be showing you how
to set up a dirty esta bc domain name to
work with the best space hosting a kind
so there's actually two reasons why it
doesn't work so the first reason it
doesn't work is because what I find out
really early on after I mania stop bc
was that digitalocean doesn't allow SAP
subdomains to have a separate song file
for each of them so what that means is I
had es de vc host dns hosted with
digital ocean but digital ocean doesn't
allow me to host eswc as well as all the
subdomains I can only host either eswc
or all the subdomains so what I did was
I moved at all to its am its own server
esta bc hosted some records and you can
check this because we go to reserve to
me in spades as a domain called a nested
is the VC and the reason we don't let
you register that is not only because
it's two letters long it's also because
that is the address of the name server
that that domain points to the name
server so because they're we're not
hosting our DNS with digital ocean what
we do is we create a zone file for every
single subdomain so there's a zone file
for a food a taste of AC that looks
similar to this here it's not exactly
the same but it looks similar and
because of that were not able to add an
S record store eswc domains because you
can't because DNS doesn't allow you to
have a subdomain that points to a
different name server that's different
to the peridot mean it just doesn't
allow you to do that which is why every
time someone tried to add you know
create an NS record here and then
pointed to ns1.dsredirection.com in five
dot 53 don't it and that is one of best
mrs. IP addresses and if you point it to
that IP address you'll be able to host
your domain through bad space so not
once you do that you just click
interrupt a record an update your record
so because you're doing it this way
instead of you know put and changing the
name server
of your eswc domain I'm pointing on the
best space you have to manage your DNS
through this website you have to manage
it through past miss itself words of
your home or any other domain you can
host them directly with best face
because you can change their name
servers so if you're using a dsw domain
name you have to host you GN s where the
SVC so after you've done that you have
to wait for the next DNS zone refresh
which happens once every hour so what
I'm going to do is show you a way to
check whether your DNS is updated or not
so what you can do is you go to terminal
and some people think you just type in
NS lookup and you put in food at eswc
hit enter and this is what it gives you
it does return the right record but this
cash is the result so you can only do
this once a man when you get that
results cast so if I updated the DNS now
and i did a refresh and then I round
that command again I would still get the
same result so where you can check it
that doesn't Castle results is you can
use the dead command so you type in dig
and then the plus symbol and you're
right trace and the plus and the trace
there's no space between them then you
put your domain name which i guess is
food at eswc and then you tell it the
name server you want to look up so the
name server I'm going to use is Google's
public dns server which is the idiot
3830 and you put a knot sine before that
which is what tells dig that that is the
name server you want to use so what I do
now as i hit enter and when it goes
through it will find this is the name
server points to an st SW c and then
that name server returned this record
which is food at eswc I'm food at least
uh BC has an air record that points to
the best space IP address it also has an
IAM server record so you can't have a
name server record in a subdomain but
hostel point to the same name server you
just can't have an external one which is
why it wasn't working so you can see
there that my dns is actually updated on
this is the IP address that food at
least avicii points to so then what you
can do is go to best finish go to the
client area and log into your account so
here i'm at the login page you can log
into the control panel or you can log in
through cpanel itself so i'll just log
in here and you can see here it says me
and domain and it says food a tiesto vc
so what I'm going to do now is just
going to go to food at eswc and prove
that it works so this is a food at eswc
i hit enter and it loads and this is
food on East IVC and this is being
hosted off bass space so this is proof
that you can do it with best fish you
can host your domains of bass face I
know I used food which is actually a
reserved extension with the swc but I'm
never going to make any subdomains out
of it so I used it for this six so i use
it for this video so you can use e-stop
vc with a bad space but what is probably
the easiest option is just to use a
dot-com or co uk org or net or some
other to me so you can see here if we go
to product you can see all the name all
the domains that we actually offer you
can see here here's the domains without
your ads so if you register one of these
domains with us or any domain with us
and the name servers are automatically
set to the best face name server so you
don't have to worry about it you just
register your dummy and choose your
hosting plan you're good to go straight
away there's actually nothing there's no
messing about with configurations so
that's probably the easiest way to do it
but if you want to do with the SLV see
this is how you can do it there's also
as actually also a promo code at Bass
space so when if you pick any hosting
plan any of these three hosting plans
there's a promo code esv see and if you
type that in a check out you'll get
fifty percent off your first month so
any of these three debate kids or a
limited plan you put a promo code in a
SVC you'll get fifty percent off your
first month so that's it for this video
don't forget to Like comment favor and
subscribe also let me know if you have
any trouble with anything to do with the
swc or best face or anything like that
and I mean more than happy to help you
so thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
