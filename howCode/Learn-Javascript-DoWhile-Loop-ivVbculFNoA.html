learning about in JavaScript is the
while loop but before we get onto that I
just want to say that from now on I'm
gonna try my call the job the learn
JavaScript videos under five minutes or
five minutes or less because it just
means that if you don't have time to
watch the phone like a full 10 20 minute
video and at least if they're cut down
into smaller videos you can watch em
them in your free time instead of having
a watch like massive video all at once
so without any further ado let's get
started so what we're going to be
learning about is the while loop
starting to create an example well first
I'll explain it so what a while loop
does is it executes the code within it
so long as the conditions and within the
while loop or true so what I'm going to
show that sign is kind of weird and I'll
just show you so here is where we put
our conditions so I'll just say
conditions here and then code to execute
goes here
so we're gonna put in here is I'm gonna
create a condition that says I is less
than 10 and what I is is just a
placeholder variable so I'm just gonna
create not know sounds equal to zero
just so it's defined then we want to say
is document dot write hello world and
then a new line and also we're going to
actually we're just gonna say plus I
plus underline so what this will do is
it will say hello it'll print out hello
world then a space then whatever number
I is at and then it'll print out the new
line so what I what happens here is it
says while I is less than 10 and to
start off with I is 0 so what we say is
mile 0 is less than 10 right I'd had a
world's it hello world's fish zero and
then a new line
but this will keep running forever
because this condition will always
retrieve investment now we actually have
to change it or else and run forever so
to change it we just say I plus plus so
what this does is the first time the
while loop runs I is equal to zero so it
just says is zero less than ten the
answer is yes so it prints it out and
then then this line what it does is
increment I by one so basically just
adds wonder whatever I use at the time
so in this case if I was zero I would
become one the second time the while
loop run and went say a white one is
less than ten on this code then we want
to do is we want to increment increment
Y again or I again as for the third time
the wire bronze III is equal to two so
now if we come over to our page and
refresh says hello world hello world
zero outer world will neither work to
whatever it was a little bit to mine
some reason I realize that working with
it doesn't matter for a minute anyway so
M so the next thing we can learn about
is the do loop so with while is to do
out of while loop so what this sort of
linked together so the do the do loop is
a variant of the while loop and what it
happens is the code within the do loop
gets executed at least once whether the
condition the while loop is true or not
so what I mean by that is if you create
the do live like this
so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna um
create a while loop underneath the do
loop alright well it's actually not wire
loop it's sort of just while with the
statement sorry and so yeah the
condition in our wire loop goes in here
but we don't actually use the yeah curly
brackets this time because the condition
arming the action that actually gets
executed we put up in the do loop so the
difference between this and just using a
while loop on its own is the wire loop
was only a bird on the code within it if
the condition is true but the do loop
allows you to execute the code in the
due date first and then it will check
the condition is true so the difference
is it just means that the code instead
of instead of a the wire loop never
executing a coat a piece
code you can make the wire loop executed
one sort of with by using material so
what I'm gonna say is the same condition
as last time so while I is less than 10
and I'm gonna come up here and assign I
equal to zero and then what I'm gonna
say inside the do loop as I'm just gonna
use the same code again so we should get
the same result at whoops
document dot write hello world and then
we want to append I on and then we want
to append in u9 so instead he's the new
line toggle just into break time this
time and then we want to say is I plus
plus because again if we don't do that
the loop will just run on forever so we
should get the exact same result as last
time except everything's going well then
you know at the end of it so that's it
for this JavaScript tutorial on the
do-while loop just two ordinary loop so
