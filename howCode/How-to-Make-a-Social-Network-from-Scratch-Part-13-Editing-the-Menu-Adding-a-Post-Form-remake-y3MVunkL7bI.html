is part 13 in the remix of the how to
make your own social network video
series and in this video what we're
going to be doing is we're first going
to be adding the header menu so that one
of your login you see different options
so when you're logged out because for
example at the moment whenever I'm
logged out so I can see sign up and log
in but if I log in I obviously don't
want to be able to see log in and sign
up I want to see a some specific options
for members only and we're also going to
be editing the profile page so that the
post form on the posts display actually
work properly so we're going to make an
easy one properly so let's get started
so the first thing we need to do is we
need to go into the header file and we
need to find our menu ok so here's our
menu and if I actually go back up here
we can see we assigned the sashen user
login to the variable username so what
that means is we can just surround this
in page in a PHP block this part and
then just close close the PHP block and
what we can do is we can create an if
statement that says if username so this
means that the variable isn't equal to
null which means if T that means the
users been logged in then we want to run
this code but obviously this is going to
give us a syntax error at the moment so
what we need to do is we just need to
say echo that a single quote and then
close it off down here with a single
quote and semicolon then we want to say
else and one can actually since we've
already put this in the wrong place this
is the login and sign up and since this
is in the wrong place we can actually
say if not username so we put an
exclamation mark before the username
variable and then this means if the
users not logged in we show them this
code and then if you are logged in we
show them some other code here so if
they are logged in we obviously don't
want to show them signup so we're going
to show them so we're going to show them
instead of sign up we're going to show
them a link to their profile so we'll
say profile and we'll show them
link to their account settings and
finally we'll have one more link and
this is going to be to log the user out
to get to the profile are too easy all
we do is put in we include a variable
and to do that since we've used
Singapore top here we can't just put the
variable in like this because it will
die
we'll add a quit literally so it would
actually actually show you an example so
if we AG go over to the home page again
and we try and log in I just ignore that
for now we'll fix that
so as you can see now it's all change
the three menu buttons are different now
and the first one says profile but if
you look down here in the bottom
left-hand corner of the screen you can
see it says that it's linking me to a
page that's called dollar sign username
and that's the variable we put in here
but since it equity literally because we
use the single quotes up here so what we
need to do to make it accurate as the
actor actually AK with the content of
the variable instead of the variable
name we need to put another single quote
and then a full stop and then we want to
put a full stop on the same record as at
the end of it as well so it should look
like this and if we do it like that
before you refresh the page and we wave
our mouse over you can see that it says
Francis at the bottom I click on it now
it will take me to my profile look like
the home dot PHP for now the next thing
we need to do is account settings and
lowlights these last two are easier all
we have to do for con settings is taking
the user to a page called the comp
underscore settings dot PHP and then the
log I all we need to do is take the user
to a page called logout dot PHP okay so
now let's refresh the page again account
settings doesn't exist so that's going
to take us to a page it's not find but
Allah God does exist so if we click on
logout it should a Lagos out so we need
to fix this out so now we need to fix
this error put the undefined variable so
that's easy all we do is we go into our
page again and we put in username equals
nothing else so that's it we're just
defining the variable regardless of
whether there's a session or not but
we're not storing any data in it unless
there's a session and as you can see the
error went away we can still see I use
these buttons if I log in with Francis
it so lets me login I can click on
profile and everything should work as
it's supposed to the next thing we need
to do is okay I'll actually log back in
because the next thing we're going to do
is we're going to onto the profile and
we're going to fix all this to make sure
it actually works so the first thing we
need to do to do that is we need to go
over to our folder and we have a post
stud SQL file and I'm going to drag it
in here and this is just this business
just says create table if not exists
post so if the table does not really
exist create the posts table create a
field for ID party get added added by
and user posted to an auto increment ID
set ID to the primary key as well so
that all the IDS will be unique so we're
just going to copy this now we're going
to go over to our SQL page inside of
phpMyAdmin
I want to click go so there's our table
has been created there's our table that
has been created now and we can actually
use it now so that we're going to do is
we're gonna go into the profile page and
we're going to start work on actually
being able to use the profile page as in
like posting a display the posts okay so
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to paste in the form here and I'll just
separate it out a way but to make it
easier to read and I also have to change
this to the long PHP tags as well now if
we go over here and we refresh we should
see the post form on the page as you can
see we have a post form now so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going going to
shrink down the columns a bit to make
sure it fits in better
okay so here we go 460 columns
and a good way to do this is to use the
chrome developer tool so we click
inspect element we see here is our
our post form as so on the fine variable
user so that's easy to fix
I mean just a chrome user neum that
should max you change anything we can
see what it you just get rid of that
error and then what we're going to do is
we've got our text area I'm just going
to change this the columns using this
and this way we don't have to keep going
in and out of the text editor and we can
decrease the rows movie say there okay
we've decreased the rows to 4 on the
columns 250 it and it seems to fit in a
lot bad or not so we'll say a columns 58
on rows 4
the next thing we need to do is we need
to up the post step in here so I'm just
going to refresh we'll see those changes
now we actually see any difference
because the codes the exact same as it
was inside the chrome developer tools
but as you can see now the changes have
been saved and we now have our posts
form at the top of the profiles so
that's it for this video don't forget to
