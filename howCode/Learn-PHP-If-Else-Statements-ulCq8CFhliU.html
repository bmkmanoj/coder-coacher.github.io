what we're going to be learning about is
if statements in PHP so I'm if
statements basically say f something
something do something and if it's not
that then do something else so that's
general that's just the most basic
understanding of what it is so you could
say if that's well this isn't correct
syntax but you can just say if the sky
is blue then and say this guy is Luke
otherwise say it's not blue that's not
the correct syntax but that's kind of
the way and if statement I'll work it
will say if something which is in this
case the sky's blue then it will do
something or else or otherwise it will
it will do something else so M good sort
of like say so here's the okay forget
that and here's the correct syntax for
an if statement so in PHP the correct it
and syntax for an if statement is if and
then two parentheses and then this is
where your condition goes and just think
as you don't know a condition is
basically what you're comparing czar you
saying if something is something so in
the last example it was if the sky is
blue then we want to do something so
them and instead of just saying then do
something what we say in PHP is we use
well we don't say it we use the two
curly brackets our credit braces or
whatever so add these this is the sort
of the equivalent of then and then when
evers in here is what you want to say so
the curly brace kind of means then and
then and then last time we said
otherwise and since we did not know that
means there and it meet and do something
so we don't we can sit otherwise because
that's not a valid and thing in PHP so
instead of saying otherwise we just set
else so let's have an if statement
structured so if something which is in
the curly braces so if your condition is
true then we're on this first block if
it's false on this block so then we're
good so we can test this out so we could
just say um I could actually just ask I
so create a variable called sky and I
could equal the sky is blue like I just
said so we can basically just do the
example we just said or the example i
just created but we can create it in the
prayer in the correct PHP syntax so it
will actually run on our page so we
created a variable called if are called
sky and it says the sky is blue so we
can just say if sky I'm by default and
if you say if and then the name of like
a variable it wills it was there will
say if the variable is true so it was
it'll basically if you said if sky it
will basically say if the sky is blue or
you could just you could say if sky and
then if you wanted this first block to
be if the condition was false so if this
guy wasn't blue all you'd have to say is
if this a F sky which is the variable so
remember in the last remember in the
last video I said one equals you're
signing something and two you're
comparing something so in the next event
you're comparing the variable sky to
something so if the variable sky equals
this string so we can just say grande
and obviously poor just yeah obviously
this string is not the same as this
string even though it's a word it still
one word substring
so since that since this condition is
false is false we're going to set back 0
false and then we could say echo true so
if this string sky equals the string
round then when we are echoing with yoga
so since sky we know sky doesn't equal
ground because sky equals the sky's blue
we're going to get false and if I was
well listen we'll go back and relax so
true okay sorry i just made mistake so
what we said is f sky equals grown
nickel a crow false which sky obviously
doesn't need got the variable sky
obviously doesn't equal ground so it's
awkward true which is why we got true
but if I was to change this to just sky
which means if this basically instead of
Los riding sky equals sky we can visit
we can just write sky because that's the
default that's what it means that's what
PHP will think we said if we just wrote
sky so now i will get false so if we
said if sky so if the sky is blue we
could say oh we just say out of yes Lee
yes about that round I don't know it
doesn't matter so I'm we could say
obviously it is blue and then otherwise
we could say you're wrong this I is
always look I don't know anything so now
we're going to it's going to say
obviously then we could say
I'm going to introduce you to a couple
of other things so we can say anything
it's me instead of saying if something
equals something we could also say if it
doesn't leak or something and to do that
instead of 2 equals we just say ! !
equals and that means doesn't equal so
if sky doesn't equal nothing just up
that aqua obviously so I once again will
if i refresh the page that shouldn't
change and if I said I just change this
to sky we should get your mom is always
blue okay so that's basically what an f
statement does it just compares to M one
thing with another so that's basically
it so thanks for watching don't forget

we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
