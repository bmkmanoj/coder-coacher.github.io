the new version of ESL VC is here so in
this video I'm just gonna show you and
how to use a new version of it and I'm
gonna talk about and some of the
differences between the new version and
the old version so first we can see here
it uses HTTPS as opposed to HTTP to make
sure that everything you do is encrypted
and secure just as well as I'm providing
security it just provides extra trust to
anyone who wants to use it and as you
can see here we have a drop down every
click at neither there's nothing is only
one option it's just a register at ESWC
domain there will be an additional
extensions so if I were to reserve to me
in list you can see here's a list of the
domains that are currently reserved so
they can't be registered by they just
can't be registered and you can see
there's this one here and this one here
are used for ESWC itself to actually
work this one here on the other rest of
them are additional extensions you can
request extensions and you can operate
your own extensions as well just send me
an email if you want to make your own
extension but these are the ones that
these are the ones we have at the moment
the first one that's going to be created
is food at ESWC and this is gonna be
used for well if you're do that if
you're like creating something and you
want a free Tampere domain name so you
can see what it looks like on the
internet you can use a food at ESWC
domine and you can even use an ESWC one
but food IDs da vc sort of states the
purpose of the domain as well and these
are just the general de janeiro
extensions and then these are additional
ones that we're gonna make as well so
we'll go back you can see they're just
an about Us page it doesn't really do
much so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
click the log in so as you can see
there's just one button it says login
with your google card and so because
we're using Google authentication to
login we don't need to store any
passwords so when you log in with your
Google account your password never
actually goes to ESWC
we just got your email address so that
we can use that to log you in suppose
you can see that I just put me in
straightaway because I've already logged
in
I've created an account but if your car
doesn't if you if this is your first
time visiting es Davi see it'll ask you
to give ESO VC permission of your email
address and stuff as soon as you give it
permission that take you to the domains
page that I might know so as you can see
here's a list of little means that are
registered if I currently have its
domains registered and everyone is
allowed to register up to 25 domain
names if you want to request a domain
that's already been registered you can
use this link and if you want to create
a new extension you can or if you want
to request in your extension you can use
this link they both just link to my
email address so you can send me an
email and ask me whatever it is so you
can see here's all the domains I have so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna first
register a new domain name so I'm gonna
register domain so if I put in you know
one letter to me and I hit enter it's
gonna say that the do means have to be
at least three characters in length and
if I put into my league of characters
like this it's gonna say domains kind of
start with a - so what I'm gonna do is
gonna put in the word I go and I'm gonna
register haiku de esta VC so I'm gonna
click register it and as you can see it
takes me to this page it says the domain
you want to register the due date the
date it was registered on the length of
the registration and the day it expires
on so all domains are registered for one
year and they expire one year from the
day they were registered so I'm going to
click register a new domain name
as you'd say it says nine domains
registered and here's my new domain so
what I can do is I can also delete it on
my end so if I click it's right here
it just elated the domain domain
sunniest IVC so what I'm going to do is
gonna go to this to me and dot Pat ESWC
and I'm gonna click at it so as you can
see it brings up this page this is the
new SLBC
zone editor so doesn't say it's a bit
different from the last one
but it's a lot easier to use that it's a
lot better actually so as you can see
here's our zoom file and you can see
here it says digital ocean here so the
way SLBC works is it uses the digital
ocean API to create manage zoom files
and that's why it says Anna Swan ns2 and
ns3 dr. lucian comm so here we can
create a new record these are all the
records we can create an heir record is
for an ipv4 address and aaaa record is
for an ipv6 address es IVC oxy also
supports ipv4 and ipv6 so if you wanted
to edit a record in the old ESWC editor
you had to just delete the record and
add it again with whatever changes you
wanted me it but with the new version
you can edit them or you can add a track
or you can delete your records and you
can create new records and so what I'm
going to do isn't going to edit this
record first for now I'm just going to
change this to a 53 and this is just
going to change the IP address to change
it we just click the button update
record so as you can see there's a
spinner and then there's a tech and that
tech tells you that the record was
updated successfully so if i refresh
this
as you can see the zone didn't update
that's because edge Aleutians dns
updates roughly once every hour so it's
gonna take an hour for your changes to
take effect but you'll be able to see
them straightaway in the boxes down here
doesn't see that actually changed and
the way it did that was it used Ajax to
create an API call to the digital ocean
API to update this zone file so I'm
going to put that back to 52 and I'm
just gonna click update record and
doesn't see it updated it without
refreshing the page so that's it updated
and if I want to make sure it's updated
and I wanted to double-check I could
actually just refresh as you can see
this won't change this 52 is the way it
is because the zone file was updated
using Ajax so I never actually had to
refresh the page so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create a scene iam
so I'm gonna say Casey and I'm gonna set
it equal to how code.org what you have
to do is you have to put a dot at the
end of it as well or you'll get an error
so if I click add new record this it's
actually refreshes the page because it
does a lot more stuff to do than just
updating a record but here it is here's
when you've seen iam added and whenever
it's updated in the digital ocean DNS
we'll see it out of tourism file what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna delete
the record for now because we don't
actually need that because dot dot ESWC
is one of the reserved domains and it's
going to be used as an extension we
actually want to have any subdomains
because we don't want it to conflict
with any subdomain someone registers so
if I created a subdomain in the zone
editor say for example test at ESWC
if someone registered test dot dot ESWC
it would that would register their
domain and I create a new zone but the
resume would not actually work because
this zone would override these when they
created so if I go back to my domains
you can see I'm back at the domains page
so this has been a brief overview of the
new version of es top VC there be at the
moment sent you know there's no new
extensions but they're becoming really
soon and the first one is going to be
arriving is food IDs top VC followed by
all these other ones in the order
they're listed in the reserved domains
table so thanks for watching don't
