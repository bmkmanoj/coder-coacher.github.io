on the question kind on the answer kite
so we've a lot to do so let's get into
it so the question kind is actually
always gonna be one because every DNS
query has one question if you read this
RFC there are parts of it or talks about
multiple questions in a DNS query but in
reality that never happened so every DNS
query has one question and then it can
have multiple answers so here what we're
gonna do we're gonna say question
current and that is going to be equal to
QD current which is the way it is
written on the RFC you can see it's
called QD current and that is equal to
two bytes and it's always going to be a
1 so it's going to be equal to a string
of bytes and that's gonna be slash X
which is how you create a hexadecimal
number and you share 0 0 for the first
bite because you're allowed two bytes
for question kinds but question count is
always 1 so the first byte is always
going to be 0 and the second byte is
going to be 1 so it's 0 1 so that's our
question kind done the answer kite is a
bit more complicated so the answer cut
will vary depending on how many answers
you have in your zone files so here we
have a zone file it's the zone file for
hookah.org if I click on this this is
the zone file I'm gonna put this up on
github so you can download it the only
relevant part of this to this series is
the the heir record section
it's a JSON file because python is built
in JSON processing and here you can see
for the high code.org entry we have
three answers so we're going to expect
an answer count of equal to three so
before we can get the answer current we
need to figure out what the actual
domain name being queried is so if we go
back to Wireshark
and I convert this into hexadecimal you
can see that domain we're trying to
query is haiku org it's in the query
section and you see it's haiku org so we
need to extract this so to do that we
need to understand the format of the
domain name and the dns request so here
I have a DNS reply this is the
hexadecimal data that you can see in
Wireshark and it's all color-coded so
first is the transaction ID then there's
the flags and there's a question so
we've done these three parts already
then we've got the answers and that's
the one we're working out the minute to
get the answers we need to figure out
what the domain name of the query is and
this is down here and this is in the
orange so the way DNS encodes domain
names is you'll have the length of the
label which is what it's called you have
seven characters and then you have these
seven characters so high code is seven
characters long then you have three
characters and then you have a rg4 org
which is another three characters and
then you have this zero byte Natale's
dns that that is the end of the domain
name so what we're going to do is we're
going to just create a method called cat
question domain
and then we're gonna pass it data but we
don't need a pass at the entire data
because if we look here you can see that
this is our DNS header we don't need it
pass at the DNS header because the
domain name only starts in the query
section which is after the Hatter
the Hatter is also always 12 bytes so we
can pass it data and then we can say at
12 : to start anew 12 index which is the
thirteenth byte which means that we are
skipping all of this data above and the
first piece of data we're gonna send is
the actual domain name which means we
have less processing to do so what we're
gonna do is go up here and we're gonna
say def get question domain we're gonna
pass it a variable called data and what
we're gonna do is just print out data
run our server and you can see this is
the data we have the length of the
string then we have hoe code we have the
length of org and we have org and then
we have this other data here this isn't
part of the domain name so what we're
gonna do is we're going to create a
variable called stit and it's going to
be equal to zero and then what we're
gonna do is say for byte in data which
means we're looping through every single
byte in the string of data and what
we're going to do is create an if
statement that says if state is equal to
one then we're going to do something
else we're going to say state equals one
so at the minute state is equal to zero
so the first time it runs state is going
to be zero which means we're gonna run
this else statement so we're going to
set state equal to one first and then
we're going to say expected length
equals byte because the first character
in the string is the length of the label
that we're going to get so we're going
to say that the expected length is equal
to byte and then up here we're going to
say expected length is equal to zero
just to initialize it so the second time
it runs we've got the length of the
label that we expect but then we have to
get the first character so we're going
to create a variable called domion
string and it's going to be equal to an
empty string then what we're gonna do is
if state is equal to one we're going to
say domain strength is equal to bite but
we need to convert bite into character
because when we iterate over a string of
bytes we just get integers so what we're
gonna do down here is just print
domi and string we have a syntax error
just we need to make this a double
run this again and you can see we got
high code printed out and then we got
org printed out and we don't want to set
domain string equal to char we want to
append the character on to the string so
we run this one more time and you can
see we get high code org so that's great
so far but what we want to do is we
wanna split org and high code up so we
wanna create another variable called
domion parts and we want to set it equal
to a list I'm gonna want to do is create
another variable called X and when I say
X is equal to zero and we want to say if
x equals expected length then we want to
say domain parts dot app and domain
string and then after that we want to
say dummy and string is equal to an
empty string to get rid of all the old
characters and what we want to do is we
want to say X plus equals one and let's
just come down here and print domion
parts so you can see we get high code
printed out but then we get this weird 3
so what we want to do is we want to just
move this actually up here
and we want to just put it here and then
we want to set it equals zero
and then finally what we want to do is
we want to say if bite equals zero then
we want to say do me in parts dot append
to me in string and up here we want to
do is reset X every time we reach the
expected length and then finally we want
to brick out of this whenever we get to
the zero character which is the
character that denotes the end of the
string in Wireshark here so let's just
run this let's just see what we get we
get a list and we have high code an org
and it's split up in two different items
in the list which is exactly what we
wanted so what we'll do is return domion
parts by saying question type and what
we can do is create another variable
call it Y set it equal to zero so now
every time the for loop runs we're going
to increment Y by one and if we go back
to Wireshark we can see that after the
domain name the next two bytes are the
type of the query so therefore if we
come down here we can say that question
type is equal to data and whenever we
get down to this part Y is going to be
equal to the index of if we go back here
this 0 character so if we increment Y by
1 and increment up by 1 again we've got
the two bytes that make up the request
type so we can say direct go from Y plus
1 to y plus 3 so if we just print
question type okay so the reason we got
this weird error is because we just need
to take this out of the for loop and you
can see there we have 0 0 0 1 and that's
the question type so that's it for this
