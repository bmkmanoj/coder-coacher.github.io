we're going to be making our interpreter
understand print hello world so as you
can see I have a file here called test
outlying and it says print hello world
so that's the source code for our
language well for a part of this is not
the source code of our language I mean
this is a file with our language in it
and then we're going to in basic dot PI
we're going to use the source code and
then basically dot PI we're going to
actually start writing the source code
of our language of our interpreter so
what it is going to create a run
function and what the run function does
if you've ever programmed in C is it's
just going to be the function that
starts the program off so if I define
the run function up here
I'm just going to define it with the
open file function as well so what the
run function is is it's a function of
functions basically and what the open
file function is going to do is it's
going to have a command-line argument so
that we can pass file names to it then
what I'm going to say is from this
import all so we can use command-line
arguments and then what I'm going to do
is going to find the Open File function
in here what I'm going to say is file
name and then up here I'll just say fine
so if I run this now Python 3 is PI and
then test on line as you can see it
prints out the word pass start line
which is our file name so now we know
what the file name is we can open the
file I'm going to say data equals
finally websites are see it's open filed
in and then we're going to say we're
going to open it for reading and then
we're going to read from the file and
what we're going to do is run a print
the data so we can see that the files
been read
so it's in centers how to print hello
world which is exactly what I pop this
file we're going to now is going to
return data so we can use it the rest of
the program because we return this then
what we can do is we can send data down
here and we can assign that equal to the
return value of the Open File function
on this data and this data have nothing
to do with each other they're just the
same thing there's actually no reason
for it and then what we're going to do
is want to create to want to create one
function so in an interpreter there's
two main functions there's a lacks
function and a parse function and what
the relax function does is it sort of
makes the interpreter understand what
everything is so here we have a print
keyword so what the lacs will do is it
would say what is this is a print
keyword so it's going to work out as a
print keyword that's what it does and
it's going to say this what is this this
is a lot of ladders but in between but
on the outside of the ladders is two
double quotes so that must be a string
and then it's going to say that's a
print and then there's a string and it's
gonna have a list of these things called
tokens and then what it does is it
passes these on to the parser what a
parser does that is it says oh there's a
print and there's a string so means I
have to put the string to the screen or
if it's our number then another plus and
the number it would say I have to add
those two numbers together
so I'm going to create the lacs function
now and up here I'm just going to fine
the legs launcher
and I'm going to just say I'm going to
pass data to the last function then I'm
going to say this is the pile data also
say also file contents
and what I'm going to say is a file
contents equals list file contents I
will just print file contents
you'll see we get a list on each item in
the list is a ladder from the file so
what we're going to do now is when I
could have for loop we're going to look
through every letter in the file and
work out what each one H key word means
in the file so we're going to say for
let's say char and file contents we're
going to say print char
as you can see that prints out every
ladder in the file so we're going to do
first is we're going to say if well
actually said Tok plus equals char
because what the token variable does is
it gets bigger and bigger the more
throughout the running of the program so
each time this loops the top farmer gets
bigger so what I mean by that is if I
just print it out as you can see whoops
we have to just come up here at say tok
equals nothing
so you can see it starts off with P and
by the end of it by the time it's
finished opening and the toke variable
is equal to print hello world which is
the whole file
so what we're going to do is we're going
to say if tote woops toke equals space
so we're going to ignore spaces so we're
going to ever two space then we're going
to set it equal to nothing because we're
going to ignore that and reset the token
variable then we're going to say is out
if Tok equals print and we're going to
say print find
find a print then we're going to set 2
equals nothing because we reset the
token variable each time we find a
violet token and what we're going to say
is we're going to find strings so we're
going to say i'll if total equals double
quote so this is a double quote just
ignore that slash that's just because
that's just an escape character so we
can put a quote inside two quotes and
we're going to say if state equals 0
then we can say state equals 1
I'm going to say else say Aleph state
equals one resist it equals zero so
state basically means if state is equal
to zero and we take every ladder in the
program you find as a keyword or part of
a keyword or a variable or something
like that and then we say if the state
is equal to one and it means every
ladder we find we're going to assume as
part of string I'm going to create a
state variable up here and set it equal
to zero then what I'm going to say down
here is I'll if it equals one so if the
state say were the one that means we
find a double quote then that means you
want to say we're going to use another
variable called string and we're going
to set that we're going to say plus
equals character
and up here we'll just create a string
variable
and then what we're going to do is we're
going to whoops we want to say
if states equal to one we're going to
reset a string variable back to being
empty but before that we're going to
print find a string so if we just run
this now says find a print we actually
have to just reset the token variable
again so if we just hit and urgency it
says find a print to find a string so we
find these two tokens now so that's it
