learning about Python exceptions so an
exception is a block of code that runs
whatever a different block fails so for
example if I try to open a file in
Python normally and the file wasn't
there or didn't exist so I couldn't open
it I would just get an error and the
program would crash but what I can do
with an exception is I can provide a way
for Python to handle the error so that
the program can keep it running so let's
try to open a file that doesn't exist so
let's see what happens so my time in
open and I just say open hello you can
see a no such file or directory
hello and I can see it gives us this
error and the program would crash if
this was an actual program so what I can
do is I can use exceptions to provide a
way after the program to keep running
even whenever this fails so let's try to
open a file using exceptions to make
sure that our program keeps running even
whenever the file fails so the way we do
that is we could have tried block like
this and we said try and open the file
so we say open hello and then what I
want to do is I want to say except I'm
the type of exception we want to throw
is called an i/o error so we say IO
error and then what I'll say is what I
want to do whatever the file fails so in
this case I'm just going to say oops
couldn't open the file I know what
happens when I hit enter again is it's
going to run this code it's going to try
and open the file it's gonna see the
file won't open because it doesn't exist
and then it's going to give us an IO
error instead of crashing our program
so as you can see it just says couldn't
open the file instead of providing us
with some massive error and exiting our
program so this has been a quick
tutorial on exceptions using Python 3
thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
