the remix of the how to make your own
social network series so in this video
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be creating the database for
our social network and we're going to be
converting our page from an HTML page to
a PHP page and including our end so that
we can do things like include a header
file and things which I'll explain more
about later so let's get started so the
first thing we need to do is we need to
convert our HTML PHP PHP page which is
easy all we do is click file and then we
click see of ours and we click on PHP
and we flex Eve it's really easy and now
we've done that we can delete the hits
map image I will drag in the PHP page
actually probably dragged in to be saved
it over so now we've got the PHP engine
we can I use PHP code obviously so the
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to create the header file so I'm going
to click file new file I'm going to save
it as in the folder called link and I'm
going to call it header dot Inc HP then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy all of this
I'm going to
actually I'm going to paste it in here
and then what I'm going to do is women
replace it with an include function or
include a statement in PHP the
additional space is like here on an
inside here optional I just did it to
keep things tidy here but you don't
actually need them so what you do is you
just type in / and / or mean - slashing
to make sure you're in the shear it's
dot slash is the same as just putting in
nothing but I just do it anyway it
doesn't really matter and then I say hey
drink cup PHP which will include our
header file so now if i refresh the page
nothing should change because our header
file was included but if I comment that
out
I can see now everything goes away
because the header file wasn't included
very included everything comes back we
can also create a footer dice so that's
what I'll do I will cut that I'll
replace that with a PHP block with an
include function in it it's going to say
slash Inc slash footer link up HP and
then obviously we have to come up here
click file new file and we want to save
it as further adding stuff PHP I want to
get started so we shouldn't see any
changes to get ok a federal dining table
HP didn't open so let's see why okay we
see have the footer link to achieve on
here to just drag it into the egg folder
I'll close this because now it's the
wrong file so close up just like on the
Inc and open it up again and there we go
app refresh the error is gone so now
we're going to do is we're going to
create our table and as you may have
noticed if you go back to the root of
our files there's a file called users
that SQL so I'm going to just open it up
in sublime text and here it is here and
I'm just going to go over there from
fields so this is the file we're going
to use to create our users table so what
it says is create table if not exists
user so that's pretty self-explanatory
it just means create the table users if
it does not money exists within the
database then what you want to do is
like we want to tell what rows to add to
it or I mean comms so we want to are the
ID a username first name last name email
password sign up get and then activated
which is an enum which basically just
means it can be either 0 or 1
in my case it could be anything you want
but I chose 0 or 1 I want to set the ID
to the primary key which means it can't
be the same as anything else in the
table we want to sound out I did also to
be Auto incremented which means every
time a new record is added the idea
increments by 1 so for the first user
the ID will be 1 for the second reason
the ID will be 2 and then for the third
year the
it will be three etc so instead of just
importing the file we can actually just
copy and paste this code come over to
our database click on the SQL tab paste
in here and click go
now you can see it says our query was
executed successfully we click on
structure and we have our users table
now so we've got one more thing to do so
we're going to create another file we're
going to call this one we're going to
see it in the ink roller and we're going
to call this one and connect dot ink on
my PHP now we're going to just open to
the PHP our PHP block in here and we're
going to say MySQL query oops
actually not I'm stoked weary I'm going
to say MySQL underscore connect
localhost root and then I have no
password and the localhost is the host
obviously root is the user name for my
database instances of my local host I
using xampp the default is root so I
just left it as the default
there's no passwords that like MySQL
select image we want to do next and we
want to select the find friends database
which is what we put in there and we
want to say or Die couldn't select DV f
if that doesn't work and then we'll say
or Die couldn't whoops
connect to database or just say I can
connect to SQL Server
then we want to do is when you go to the
header file we want to just come up here
and include arc - will connect file put
ink slash connect dot PHP
or meaning / connect dot Inc now PHP and
let's refresh the page so nothing should
happen it should all just work the way
it was but we can check that it's
working is if we put in a fake username
we should get an error couldn't select D
me because it was able to connect but
okay yeah it's because this one was Kim
sagging so if we just comment that out
let's just change the host and that
should be what we need to do
yeah okay we couldn't connect to SQL
Server so leave that a local most common
toboggan leave route as the username in
my case it might be different for you
but here we go everything's working as
expected so that's it for this video
