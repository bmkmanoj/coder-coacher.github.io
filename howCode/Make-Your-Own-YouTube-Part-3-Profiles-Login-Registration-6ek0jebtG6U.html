video we worked on the login page and we
got most of it finished except there was
a few things that we were going to fix
up in this video such as security
problems and things we also have to
change a few things in the header file
the log a log ID script we need to make
that we need to make it a bit more
smooth and then in the mavar's file if
we get chance we can do some stuff in
there and but let's get started so here
I am on the login page so I'm going to
log in to my account so if you'll
remember in the last video I just made
one account ok ok so there it is now
we're gonna click a log in and as you
can see here's our memory our memory
page and we know we're logged in because
Francis is the AquaDuck because that's
the fashion username but as you can see
up here and they login and create a con
- that didn't disappear and not to
change when the users logged in because
they don't want to log in twice when
they've already logged in such as gives
them errors so we'll change that first
so we're gonna go to the header file
actually up here at the top we're going
to go back to our login script and see
our session is session username so on
the header file what we can say is if
session if session username actually no
if is sacked
so we say FA set session username so
checks the sessions been sat so if the
sessions in sat the users been logged in
if it's not been sat the users not
logged in so we're just gonna create an
if statement that we're going to say
else
so if the sessions been created we can
assign to a variable so we could create
a variable called user and then PS 13 so
that not means when we refer to the
variable user were X referring to the
sashen username that was created when
the person logged in so to prevent ours
we can actually also come up here and
say user equals nothing just to define
the or declare the variable and if
they're not logged in we want user to
also hold as zero or nothing okay so now
we can refer to the variable user so
down here and the menu we can just come
in here we can create a PHP tag and what
we can say is if a user since we created
the variable up there we could say F
user equals nothing then echo this so
we're just going to move this down and
then do this just check close it off so
what this does is it just says if the
user every user equals zero or I mean if
user equals nothing which means the
users not logged in then we show them
the login and they create account
buttons so then what we're gonna say is
we can actually come down here and okay
that was just this is a stupid idea
let's just leave it like that and then
this this way and it'll just our code
will just work better they'll be less
confusing as well so if we and I've done
the first part of our if statement we
need to come down we need a clean house
and then we can just copy this once we
can paste it in first we have to say
echo and then we move over a bit so now
we yeah she just say log in whenever
were logged in but that's not we want so
I'll change that to members we will
create one more and this one's gonna say
logout so I'm members we can just take
it to members dot php' obviously logout
we can take the log on top HP so now
i've done that we're gonna go to the
login page and then the a log scripts
working so but after the person logs out
we needed to redirect them somewhere so
we're just gonna say header location
index dot PHP which is just taken to the
home page so now if we I come in here
and we refresh so as you can see this
has changed so nights as members and
says log art so we click on members
first taste us to the members page and
if we click logout now it should destroy
the session on the log web page and then
redirect just index dot PHP we can tell
we're logged out it's because create
account and login disappear so on the
login page now we're going to change
driver login dot PHP and we are going to
change alright put a bit of security on
so and these them variables when we're
parsing them we're just going to say
strip tags to get rid of any tags when
someone tries to login so they can't do
things like SQL injection so now we will
not here it says if it's at submits
marching change that to if is set
post username post password so that
means they have to have both fields they
have to have something in both fields
for taxi work and then we can try that
log so obviously we have to refresh but
as you can see if I try to put in some
PHP tags and I hit log in to my account
okay we actually need to change one
thing I won't be able to see that no I
can instead of changing the form we can
just say echo username okay we'll just
do a current user name because that's
all we need to prove that works so we're
just gonna refresh the page so in here
what I'm gonna say is just I'll put in
actual user now I'll delete the password
field in it login let's try that again
okay so there's something in the
password field we get awkward Francis
because that's what I put in the
username field but now if we do the
strip tag or since we did strip tags
whatever we put in you'll see ok let's
try it again
so I'm actually to change this to I just
put in Francis because then that way the
user would exist let me see
got a bit of a problem here okay so the
reason for the problem was just because
with the strip tags if I had log into my
account some reason it isn't ok so
what's happening here is the strip tags
looks like it's working the problem is
when I do PHP it strips the two tags
it's left with a space but there's no
user who's using them as a space so
that's what we're getting that user
doesn't exist but that's it so we can
move on because that looks like it's
working so now we've done that we can go
into the members page and we can just
create a header or h2 tag we can say
members page so I'm just don't even like
that and I just thought a better thing
to do and the more fun thing is the
profile page so we're gonna do that now
so I'm gonna go to the video box folder
I'm gonna create a new file called
profile up PHP and obviously we're going
to include the Hatter so include include
/ whoops
headed off HB here I'm just going to
create a hitch to jog that says we're
just going to echo user so what we're
gonna do is we're just gonna penned an
apostrophe s on the end of that are an
imposter yes in profile so now if we go
to you
I thought PHP here it is it says
Francis's profile so what we wanted to
do is we want it to be unique to every
user so the first thing we need to do is
we need to say we need to create a
variable actually so we could create a
variable called user name I'm gonna call
it get your so now instead of acting
user we can actually using you you don't
see if we do profile page but you equals
Frances which it doesn't change but
whatever we assign variable you is what
gets awkward on the page so what we're
going to do is we're going to set
Frances for now and we're gonna say
we're going to do MySQL query act query
actually so just a check username equals
my straw
query select user name oops user name
from users where username equals
username which is that the variable
above so then all we have to say is kind
equals my skew while num rows check
username if x equals 1 then do nothing
basically all right
then or else oh can you say I could we
could I say I had her out of location in
that stop HP so that way that we can see
if the user doesn't exist so here if i
refresh we shouldn't see any change
because Francis is he using the database
but if I put a 1 there and hit enter it
redirects us to indexed up HP so that's
good that means it's working
so I'm gonna go to profile top HP again
and here it is so now that we've done
that inside the profile page we want to
instead of actually select user we want
to select everything and then we want to
say while row equals Lasher whoops nice
girl fetch a saw or associative or
whatever
check user name so we're just gonna
create a wild leg so that we can get all
the rows from the database so first one
is obviously ID it's gonna be row ID we
can check that this is working by
echoing ID so now if we refresh we got
one which is good that means it's
working and we can do this for all the
other users nine so are not all the
other uses for all the other fields so
we have first name last name user name
email password
of Earth and then um let's have a look
okay so that's all the fields we have at
the moment so that's all we need we can
now get to work on actually making our
profile page look good so we can assign
okay what we'll do is we will move this
hitch to tag and we'll just echo echo it
here so then now we can remove this and
the other PHP tag so there we have it's
not if we refresh okay we get one's
profile that's not correct username okay
the reason that is is because we've
reassigned the variable username to the
row ID so we just need to change these
to first name last name email password
and date of birth so now if we try it
again
it gives us Francis and then underneath
we can echo certain things like name
first name space last name so there are
there are some information there we can
put more in so I don't we could say
email so we'll do that
- for now and the reason I did this was
just I wanted to get the basic
functionality of the profile done but
we're actually going to much is probably
more sensible and I should have done
this at the start we're gonna go back
and just begin the registration because
I just wanted to get this out of the way
and don't miss basic profile thing we
can make it look way better in the next
few videos we will be an a profile won't
be a channel so what we'll do is we'll
change will give users the option to
create a channel if they want and then
they'll have a separate page for their
channel so none of them not I've got the
basic profile stuff done we're going to
create the registration page so join up
HP so on the profile page we can just
copy this first line so on the header
file we can change login area change
create an account to join the PHP so if
we log out with like create an account
takes it to join up HP then we're going
to say create your kind so now we have
that then what we're going to do is we
create a form obviously so form action
equals ID join top HP and the math that
is going to be post because we're
somebody sending data away to database
so we can go to the login page we copy
some fields
so we can paste this in a few times so
the name of the first one is first name
last name usually you can stay email
password and then we'll have password
repeat we could have another one in and
we could call it data bar okay the data
bars one will be a bit different so I
will leave that for a line so now I've
done that we get them unique names we're
gonna just change this just to avoid
confusion after the registration will
leave everything is taxed including the
passwords so now you can see if we
refresh we have all our fields and we
need to submit button so we'll just add
that line so input types a bit mean
register and then value create your con
so there we have our failed so we're
gonna start with the validation so the
first thing we say is if post submit
which or I register actually because
that's the name of it then we're gonna
echo registered okay so we need to just
put the outside in front of that for
some reason I don't know why but we'll
just put the odd sign there and click
create account and there's right
register chose up
okay something just working so then what
we're going to say is we're going to
first check the check that everything's
mean everything's not like the average
fee has been filled in so what we're
gonna say is first name equals so we're
just going to say we're just going to
assign a the contents of each meal to a
variable email we're gonna say password
1 and then we paste it in one more time
to get password
- and then password to biggie alright
password repeat so now I've done that
we're just gonna say if first name
equals nothing then we just aku we're
going to say error equals that first
name cannot be left empty so underneath
here we're just gonna say HP echo error
and then up here we're going to say our
going to create the error variable and
assign it nothing so it's blank so that
we won't get any errors from it being
already declared then we're gonna say is
we're just going to change these these
for each one of them last name password
one password too so we'll set password
can't be that blind come in repeat
pasword cannot be left blank let's try
this nan let's click on all these to
disappear their values we're going to
create a coin okay I'm gonna find
variable okay that's because it's a
capital e there's no capital e in it so
we'll try it again just click all these
to get them blank and then we're going
to click create account repeat password
okay so the reason for this is because
we just need to put an else in here
we'll say I'll say let's just keep going
and then piece this one here smaller you
can see first name cannot be left empty
so we click all of them except first
name we should get last name cannot be
not that in it'll do that for each field
so unfortunately I'm out of time not in
this video but in the next video we'll
be finishing this registration form off
and if we have time we will be improving
the profile page because it's a bit bad
at the moment who need reason that we
did it was to get some of the basic
things for it out of the way so I'll see
you next time don't forget to Like
favorite and subscribe and well I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
