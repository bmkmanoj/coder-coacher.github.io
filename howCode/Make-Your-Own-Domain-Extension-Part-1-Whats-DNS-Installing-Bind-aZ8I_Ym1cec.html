we're going to be doing is we're going
to be doing something a little bit
different to usual what we're going to
be doing is we're going to be creating
our own DNS server and then we're going
to be a creating our own domain
extension so as you can see user comm
extension we're going to be creating a
room one so before we can start I was
going to talk about what DNS is and what
a DNS server is so basically when you
try to go on a website say for example
this one here and I'll talk about why
I'm on this website in a little bit
later on now when you try to go this
website here the first thing that
happens is the first thing that happens
is at the dock there's these things
called com DNS servers and well okay the
first thing actually happens as it goes
to this thing called the root domains or
the root DNS servers which are these
servers that are all over the world and
there are dead
there are the servers that tell your web
browser how to get to the com servers
and I'm going to guess the dot-com
servers it looks for the in this case
digitalocean a domain within the dot-com
servers and then the seems is it's
exactly the same for the www as well
whenever gets the digitalocean it will
check for the IWW are the wwm server or
whatever and that's how it actually
works out where to go I want to guess
each server what happens is it finds for
example if it was looking for calm or I
mean if it had found out that it sorry
if you did find the dot-com server and I
was looking for the digitalocean servers
what do we do is would find out whether
digitalocean domain is inside the
dot-com servers and then it would find
the IP address of the digital ocean
website and that's how it would know
where to take you to so what did Dan ask
basically does is it just stops your
having to type in IP addresses at into a
web browser instead of all right instead
of actual like words because if you've
ever tried you can type in an IP address
into a a web browser and so long as the
IP that you're timing in is a direct you
to a web server you'll be able to see it
in your web browser all the DNS does is
it provides a thing called the domain
name which are these things here
top so that you don't have to actually
memorize of IP address and the reason
I'm going to okay and the next thing I'm
to be doing is going to be show talking
about why we're going to make our own
extension and okay the reason we make
our own extension is I think it'd be fun
and I think will be a cool topic but
it's not quite the same as an extension
like this because everybody knows how to
get to the dot-com extension because of
the route name set of the root DNS
servers but you can't just make your
extension and put it on the root DNS
servers yourself and I mean you just
can't do it because you don't have
access to them so we're going to be
doing is putting it on our own DNS
server but DNS servers I'm also at this
thing called an authority so basically
the root DNS servers are the most are
the authoritative name servers which
means they are the ones that you go to
first or the other ones that are sort of
in charge of all the other ones that the
further the first place you go to
basically but you can't just make one of
them put on the internet for everyone to
use
otherwise there'll be loads and loads of
different extensions made by random
people so our DNS server will be able to
connect to it but we have to go into our
computer and change our DNS settings a
bit so that we can actually connect to
it but once we do that we'll be able to
use it like any other DNS server so that
brings me on to the next part of the
video is why I'm on this website
digitalocean this is the website I used
to get my hosting off for high coding
things and it's basically just a web
it's a host for websites but it provides
Virtual Private servers which are
basically just they're sort of in
between shared hosting and we call it
there just and dedicated servers so
they're sort of in between because it
gives you sort of it gives you all the
things you get from a dedicated server
except it's sort of a server split in
the servers but that's not important
that's just at what this company does so
what you're gonna have to do for this
video you're gonna have to make a an
account on this website and I think they
give you an ending 12 hours to use a
free server or something so once you've
made your card and you've on your right
okay so what you have to do is just make
your card and then you'll be at the same
part of me which is at this part here so
what this is there what
crowd icon talking but what they do is
they create these things called droplets
and a droplet is just a server basically
and so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to create a new server for this video
and it's going to be a DNS server and
I'm just going to call it it's CDNs for
how cool DNS on the host name image it's
not important now but you'll know it is
in fact are sort of important later so
just make sure it's something you
remember you'll remember just ping
anything at all to do modern and then
you have to pick the region I think if
you pick a free one it's only the New
York one you can choose but if you
actually are if you've paid for the
servers or whatever you can choose on
any of these so I'm just going to choose
the one that's already selected and I'm
also going to choose this one's already
selected which is the 512 megabytes of
RAM one CPU and 20 gigabytes of sword
server which costs five dollars a month
and then we're going to do is we're
going to go and select Linux Ubuntu and
then we're going to go on select Linux
or I mean Ubuntu 12.04 x64 between
64-bit and then now we're going to Nami
VAT on that we're just going to click on
create droplet I just ignore these
things once you click create droplet it
says the root password will be emailed
to you so yeah well my droplets created
it takes about a minute and then does
have an email with the root password and
I will be back whenever the droplet is a
finished being created okay so another
word add back and got the root password
in my email on my Mac copied it so as
you can see here's our server and if we
tried to go to this in a web browser it
wouldn't actually work because it's not
a web server so what this the next add
this brings me to the next table which
in which my browser is called putty it's
just an answer th client that it's
actually really good it's free and it's
sad it's just easy to get free quick to
install and think well actually as no
installer it's just an exe so what you
do is you just type putty in a Google
that takes you to the home page then you
just click on download and then you
click on putty dot exe down here and it
will download it to your computer so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
click here and I'm just going to
- howdy and here's buddy here I'm just
going to click on it and the only thing
you need to worry about here is just put
in the IP address of your droplet so a
mine in this case is 1 1 6 2.2 4 39.1 4
1 and then leave the port other wet is
keep asset age selected and just click
on open ok this is going to come up the
first time you connect your droplet so
just click on yes all right here we have
our window so what I'm going to do is
since this is the first time I've logged
in I have to use the root user which I
just type in log in as root and click
enter now it's going to ask for my
password so what I'm going to do is I'm
just gonna right click what you won't
actually see what I just did but it it's
in the password that I just probably
from my email and let's say you get a
stand putty you a right-click so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to change
the password so I'm just going to type
in pass and then WD so passwd without
the over without the or and then I'm
going to type in a new password so I'm
just going to type in password for my
password and there I've changed the
password so now I can add login password
instead of the other one okay so now
what we want to do is we want to install
this piece of software called buying
them what buying does is little is M it
is what I'll just get like this size at
bind is what AG makes our DNS server
work fine is actually the sort of the
software behind the DNS server and
without it we don't actually have a DNS
server so I'm just going to type in
apt-get install find 9 I'm just going to
hit enter and then what it's going to do
is it just going to install it I have to
click why and then I press ENTER again
it's just going to install it takes a
couple seconds that's it so when I be to
actually basically have our DNS server
set up and so what I'm going to what I'm
gonna have to do is gonna have to end
the video now and because it's about to
run over time so we're going to do in
the next video is we're going to
actually start it on making our our
custom domain extension work so thanks
for watching this video don't forget to

and I will see you in the next video
