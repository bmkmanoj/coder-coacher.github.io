episode in the questions answered show
yeah this is just a weekly series where
i answer your questions that i receive
in my youtube inbox instead of reply
where all the ones i don't get to reply
to any way so let's get started so the
first one says um great until no but i'm
not sure if the search box is working I
mean it shows up if it shows a list of
people that are already that already
have an account and find friends when
you type in a name like Francis please
have a look at it thanks so what I don't
really know what this means because when
i type in my search box type in Francis
it doesn't do anything so I'm great I
would be grateful if you could clarify
that so that I can make a video showing
how to fix it because I don't know what
the problem is really so our thanks and
a next question so this question says hi
great tutorials thanks can I have your
permission to use your codons and why
projects I don't have a problem with
anybody using my code in the projects
all I ask is maybe add that if you do
use some of it to add maybe give me
credit or something or put a link to my
youtube channel that's all I ask but
it's not i don't mean I can't make you
do it so thanks our next question so
this question says that dude can you ask
my question number one how old are you
number two where did you learn this from
a number three how much did you did it
take you to learn this thanks for your
time and awesome videos so once again I
just like to say thanks for the
compliment and I'll answer your question
so I'm actually 15 years old I just
turned 15 I learned this by Google a lot
of it I'm YouTube yeah because you'd be
surprised how much you can actually
learn just with the Google search box
and
and for example I like have to type in
is learn and I'll learn PHP and a whole
list of websites comes up and these are
already good websites for learning PHP
on the same for HTML or whatever so you
can use google and i don't really like
tax to tourism because i find them
really boring so that's why i would use
youtube for some of it well actually
most of the learning i do i watch
youtube videos and that's how i find out
how to do it and as you get better at a
programming language from watching
videos i have actually get to the stage
where you don't need videos you can just
get yourself and you can I suppose make
it up as you go along and then your coat
alone because you know the correct way
to do it and last thing says how much
did it take you to learn all this so I
mean I passport that probably means how
long did it take you and well I started
taking an interest in computers and I
was like five but I got part of it
because she can imagine it's hard for
five year old to be interested in that
so when I was nine I started again and I
started learning about websites and then
from websites I learnt HTML first and
then I learned well I dart HTML CSS and
also sorted style websites then I
started wondering how you can make a
website like google youtube and then i
discovered PHP and then I just really
enjoyed it so that I started teaching
myself all the programming languages
like Python sayin whatever so next
question so this question says I'm
getting an hour parcero colon syntax
error unexpected and user / index 2.php
online 93 so this is just a pretty
simple mistake so as you can see line 93
is PHP open and close tags well just the
open part
and you get an unexpected and error
whenever you go and you delete one of
those so if we go to find friends and
then I'm just locked as you can see
syntax error unexpected end and all it
says like 138 but it's the same error so
all you have to do is just add you've
probably just left I one or two curly
braces and then you're started in whoops
added in click enter and comes back so
next question so those questions as hot
thanks you're very good at your very
good about programming how many pro or
how many computer languages do you know
so I suppose computer languages is
really the right word for that that's
what I mean because a computer language
a computer only understands binary and
then a programming language it's
basically just something that humans can
understand those converted into binary
but I'm not going to be such a I'm not
going to be worried about that so the
question says yep how many programming
languages do I know so if you can't HTML
and CSS which aren't programming
languages but if you comment them and I
suppose then that's too but I know a lot
more than that I out of actual
programming languages because I'm
excluding HTML and CSS I know PHP
obviously or us I wouldn't be able to
make this series I know python i know c
c++ java javascript and I Objective C so
I mean that's that's all I thought I
North moments and I'm considering
running some more but when I do I might
make some videos and show you guys how
to learn them as well next question so
this question says I have a problem
everything is fine when i manually make
the browser smaller the menu or
everything is fine but one of it when i
manually make the browser smaller the
menu moves under that over why and
that's most likely because
it's just I made the man you badly so
this is from part four of the social
network before I got the new menu so i
made the menu badly at that time and if
you want to stop that all you have to do
is set the position of the search box to
absolute and then it will sort of just
float there and then it won't go
underneath your man you yeah but it
depends like smug you're making your
window as well because you're making
your window very small it's hard to
accommodate for every window size but
you just have to accommodate for most of
them because as you can see find friends
new design looks good here but if I make
smaller it cuts off a little bit so I
mean no design can look good on every
single possible window size but the our
goal is just to accommodate as many as
possible next question this question
says major problem if the person is two
or more friends if a user removed one
friend then all the friends the
usernames friend now removed you only
tried one friend try adding two friends
and remove one both cats removed so this
is a problem obviously um um I will
either try and fix it in the video or I
will change the way the friend system
works because the France system the way
it works in the minute it's kind of
complicated and the pecan deluded so I
might change it to the way to make it
work the way the private messaging
system works were you send a message and
then it's recorded in a database called
message or a davis table called Matthews
and then in this case I'll just call it
make a database table called friends and
then I'll have two rows first one is the
friend who sent requests or two columns
first column is going to be the username
of the person who sent requests and the
second column it's going to be the usual
the person who received it and then we
can use out to join them together and
make them friends and so that's it for
this video don't forget to like favorite
and subscribe
and also also subscribe to the show if
you enjoyed it and what I'd like to say
is I just like to say thank you for
everyone who subscribed because thanks
to all you guys subscribe me I was able
to get a full youtube partnership I mean
obviously there youtube says there's a
lot of YouTube partners know where you
don't get any browning or anything but
you just get the ability to monetize and
custom thumbnails yeah but no since I
joined a network at rpm it's a good
network if you have meet the
requirements it's a really good nap to
go with if you add if you're going to
say ok whatever so thanks for everything
because thanks you guys I got the
banners and I've got to join their
network and thanks to you guys even
without you guys I wouldn't have a
youtube channel so thanks for that as
well and I just like to whoops screw it
up show you guys my stats so according
to the website social blade here's my
stats I get 9,000 views in the last 30
days and I got 66 subscribers so I'm
really happy with that and how it's
going and as he said thanks because
without you guys I wouldn't have a
youtube channel so when thanks again and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
