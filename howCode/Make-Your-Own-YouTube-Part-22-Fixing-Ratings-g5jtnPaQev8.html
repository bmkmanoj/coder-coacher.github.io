we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be
finishing off the rating system on the
videos so as you can see here we can
click like over and over and over again
on a video and it will let us like a
video more than once and what we want is
we want to actually only make it so you
can only like the video once and or
dislike it once we want to also a lot of
people to be able to change their mind
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
set it so that when you click like and
the like button becomes inactive and the
dislike button stays active so that you
can change your mind and decide which
one you want to do so that's what I'm
gonna be doing this video so let's get
started so we're back in our what video
watch page file what we're gonna do is
we're gonna scroll down to the code
where we display the like button and the
dislike button I'm just gonna show you
what it looks like whenever we set one
of them to disabled so that we can't use
it so if I just type in disabled and
just like this with no value or I mean
no equals and no quotes or anything
after it I just type in that word and I
put it at the end of the input type and
I click back over the web page and
refresh what you'll see is now the like
button is disabled and I can't click on
it so whenever I try to click on it
nothing happens so but the a dislike
button still works so that's what we're
gonna do in this video we're gonna set
it so that whenever each whichever one
of these you click becomes disabled so
you can't click it again on the same
video so to do this what we need to do
is we first need to well we actually
need to go into our ratings table what
we want to do is we actually want to
empty it and by emptying it what this
does is it
I just gets rid of everything in the
table so this way I wouldn't mean what
happens is we start with no likes on
this video and no dislikes because at
the moment we have a load of likes and a
load of dislikes and if that'll just
mass of our code if we don't correct it
first so what we want to do is we want
to click
cattitude truncate the ratings table
which basically just means delete
so whenever we've deleted that if we
come back here and refresh what will
happen is the the what the iranian
actually disappear because there's a no
ratings to display okay so I just had to
refresh again because the table didn't
delete quick enough but there it's gone
now so what happens now is if we click
on like once well this'll there is it
just likes it obviously so we'll get up
on our green bar here that is 100% green
and there's no red in it if we scroll
down as you can see we have a full green
bar line so what wanna do now is we want
to set the like button to disable if the
if the person is like the video so here
I am in the ratings table and as you can
see we have one rating and it's bag
contains the video ID the type of the
rating which is in this case like and
the user who liked it so what we want to
do is we want to query this table we
want to check did the person liked the
video so what we're going to do now is
we're gonna actually going to do that we
want to check this whenever the page
loads not whenever a button is pressed
so what we're gonna do is we're just
going to come up here and we're gonna go
above this just here in the PHP block
and what we're gonna do is we're going
to just query the database and see if
the person is like the video so just put
a comment in to check if the person has
liked the video so so I'm just gonna put
a comment in here and I'm just going to
say um check if you if already like /
dislike I what I'm going to do is I'm
just gonna say check under score so you
supposed to check under score l equals
mysql query
I'm what I'm gonna say is I'm just gonna
select whoops I'm gonna say select type
from oops from ratings where video
underscore ID equals the variable video
ID and we got this variable just because
it's the GATT variable at the top of
this file as you can see here so what we
want to do is we just want to check if
it's the video ID for that video and
what we want to also check is and user
let's just have a look at the row in the
database for the new ratings okay so the
row for the username like the row name
for whoever okay this here row name is
username and this means that if we check
this for the word Frances which is which
we are checking because I've logged in
as Frances so we check it against my
username so if we check against that and
we check against the video ID as well we
were able to check whether I've actually
liked the video or not so we wanted to
do is I'm just gonna say we're use I
actually have to say username as well as
video ID and I just say user name equals
user user username and what I want to do
now is I just want to hit enter once
just to make any line I'm just gonna say
if MySQL num rows check underscore ell
doesn't equal zero so if there if the
video has actually got a is if the video
has been liked by me or disliked by me
so if I were just left a rating of any
sort then we want to check what the
rating was or else we just want to say
tacho and nothing so if the video hasn't
been liked by me we want to do nothing
because we just want the other code to
show up and run but if the video has
been rated by me we just want to say a
while row all right let's just say I ran
it raining equals mysql fetch
associative all right and then we just
want to say check underscore L and this
just lets us select all the fields from
the table what we actually want to do is
we want to change this to all because
I'm get all the fields so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna get the video ID
so video ID underscore ell and equals
rating
video ID and what this is doing is it's
just I'm actually check okay there's no
underscores the value ID so we need to
change that so what this is just doing
is it's getting the value from the
database of the video ID so in our case
it's just pulling this information here
from the database so what we want to do
next is we want to say reading that's
action we gotta use that variable I'll
just say writing underscore l equals
rating type let's actually choose not to
type and then user underscore al equals
reading username
so now that we've got that we want to do
is we just want to echo type with which
our case we'll just act with the word
like right onto the page so if we come
over back to our video watch page on the
we click refresh okay so as you can see
here we have a undefined variable so
that's okay all we need to do is come
back into our code and change this to
the variable user and then let's try it
again and as you can see now we are
correctly pulling the the row out of the
database and we got the word like if I
was like just like now as well we'd
actually get like and then just like
printed beside or I could beside it but
to make sure we don't mess up the code
and have to delete the table again or I
mean down to the table again I'm not
gonna click either button for an eye
so when we've done that now that we've I
got the type what we also want to do is
we want to set the video or the a
buttons so that they are disabled so
what we're gonna do is we're just going
to come in here and it's really simple
all we have to do is create a variable
we're just we're just going to act with
a variable and we're gonna call a
variable day and we're just going to
copy it again and paste it down here and
what this variable is is it's gonna be
equal to nothing unless the the video
husband liked already I mean yeah if the
video hasn't been created then it's
gonna be equal to nothing so that way
and the buttons won't be disabled but if
it has and if the video has been rated
and the correct button will be set to
disabled and we actually need to do is
write D and then D too because we need
the two variables to be separate and
different from each other so we want to
say up here instead of act or not or AK
nothing what we want to do is we just
want to say de equals and whoops nothing
and d2 equals
nothing so what this'll do is he just
sets the variables equal to nothing so
that our code will run just like it
should so if we refresh again nothing's
gonna happen it's just going to so it's
just going to get rid of the like up
here and for some reason we have an
undefined variable okay the reason we
have the undefined variable is because
we're not actually running this block
because the raining actually does exist
I have created a raining so we're gonna
run this block but if I hadn't created a
rating it would run this block and
that's and this is what the block the
variables are defined in so if I wanted
to get rid of this error all I have to
do is copy and paste this up here and
this way it would since it's running
this first block here this first block
in the if statement then the variables
get and defined up here because they
weren't actually defined because they
were to find in a block that wasn't
being executed so as you can see now the
errors go on so what we want to do is we
just want to say we want to get the
actual type of the video so since we
have actually a selected the type from
the database we want to just do a check
of which type it is so if I was to say
if and whoops type is equal to like then
we're gonna set de equal to disabled and
I'll just say else the only other option
is if it's a DES like so or else we're
just going to set d2 to disabled to
prevent errors were actually going to
come back up here and copy-paste these
two variables just to define them so
that we don't get any on the find
variable errors so let's try that now
what should happen is the like button
should get disabled and as you can see
now the like button is disabled so we
can own it we can't like the video again
but if we just like it now it's just
going to create another dislike
so if I click this it's just gonna
simple with the buttons tonight being
disabled
okay so actually it works the way we
want it to but I can like it again but
as you can see it didn't remove my
previous like so what we want to do is
we want to set it to that whenever you
click Submit on the like button
so what we want to do is we want to set
it so that if you click if you click on
either one of these buttons when you've
already collect on one a tag actually
set just updates your previous rating
instead of actually adding a new one so
unfortunately we've run out of time in
this video so I have to do that in the
next video so thanks for watching don't
