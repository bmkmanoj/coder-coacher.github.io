designing the profile page after
designing the profile page we're also
going to be learning how to get the
posts from the database so quite similar
to how we get them from the database on
the home page except when we get them
from the database from the home page
we'll select the other posts from users
who were following but on the profile
page we're selecting all posts pay the
user who's proof up is wrong so you can
see here is the users profile here if we
zoom in a bit you can see the user name
is up here at the top we have this
optional tech icon if the user is
verified we have this about Us section
we have a list of users posts printed
out here and then over on the right-hand
side we have this button for creating
new posts if I go to the browser you can
see with a slug psych and if I resize it
you can see it resizes properly so the
first thing we have to do is go to
bootstrap studio and we want to export
this design so we're going to click
export
it's been exported if we click on that
so wherever you export it to you're
going to end up with a file called
profile HTML and I'm just going to paste
it in here into our project so here is
the file and the web browser here so the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to get the username so in our code
we're going to go to proof a lot PHP and
we're also going to go to profile dot
HTML and we're going to select all copy
that and we're going to paste it in to
profiles of PHP so we're going to paste
it underneath everything just start at
the bottom now if I go to profile our
PHP you can see we have our design
underneath so you can see here we're
just echoing usernames profiles so if I
just copy that
scroll down and piss it in here refresh
now you can see it says Francis's
profiles up here it says verified if I
go in here and I just said if verified
then we'll echo that out otherwise you
want to echo it out so just like that
we'll be able to display the tech if the
user is verified so now if i refresh
scroll down the tech is still there
because I'm verified if I go to sequel
Pro and I change my verified status to
zero my refresh you can see the text
just disappeared the next thing we want
to do is want to select all of the posts
that are being printed out so to get all
the posts what we're going to do is
we're going to go to our index page so
on our next at HTML if we scroll down
you can see here is how we got all of
the posts
so we just want to copy all of this
javascript from the index.html page we
want to go to profile up HP I want to
scroll down to the bottom I want to
paste it in here below out of our script
tags what we want to do is scroll up
I want to change it from FBI's icecap
posts to APA sized cat profile posts
then what we're going to do is we're
going to go to our APA and we're going
to scroll down you can see here we have
Gap posts we're going to copy this
and we're going to pierce it in down
below you can see now we have another
our self statement of what we're going
to do is change it from GAAP posts to
get profile posts so we don't need the
token anymore so we're going to delete
that and we're going to get the user ID
from the database by selecting user ID
from users and we're going to select
just the ID column from users where
username is equal to user name and the
user name is going to be the username of
whoever's profile it is so we're just
going to put in username in here it is
going to be equal to get user name so
once we've done that so instead of
getting the posts from the people the
user is following what we're going to do
is going to select all of those columns
I'm already in a select from users and
posts and we're going to delete this
were clause and just leave the second
one and we're going to delete this other
part of the were clause so what we're
going to do is just scroll across and
change this from user ID to ID as well
and if we were to run this now you can
see we got every single post in the
database printed out so what we want to
do to fix that is just set and users dot
ID equals user ID so we're not going to
select posts for this user so if i
refresh now you can see that it's just
decreased if I change this to verified
you can see we only get one post printed
out because in the database verified as
an idea of six and there's only one post
with that ID so we're going to do is go
back to our index page index.html and
scroll up and you see we have this div
called timeline posts so if we copy this
and I go back to profiles our PHP you
can see here are our posts so each post
is inside one of these Ally tags so what
we want to do is delete all these and
we're going to paste in timeline posts
then we're going to do is go back to
provide HTML scroll up and we just want
to copy one of these posts and go back
to profile of PHP and the first thing we
want to do is instead of going to FBI
size profile posts we want to go to API
size profile posts question mark
username equals and here we want to put
in a username so in this case it's going
to be our username which is going to be
equal to echo username then we want to
do is scroll down here and you can see
here is where we're accessing the time
line posts variable and here is what
we're putting in the post data so what
we want to do is put in a slightly
modified version of that so we'll just
hit enter a few times to move that other
way and we just put in a new string and
we'll paste in our post here then what
we want to do is want to get posts
indexed post body copy that and paste it
up here
just like that let me want to scroll
across we want to get posted by we want
to piss that in there want to get post
it and we have our data post ad here for
comments we want to copy that
scroll across to our comment button and
paste it in there
and we want to scroll across one more
time and get the post ad for the like
button so to do that we'll just copy
this you can see here we have our like
button here what we want to do is just
scroll back and paste it in here and it
still looks like we have some errors but
that's just because we need to put all
this on one line
you
and we just want to delete this old
version of the post we just want to move
this double quote over the string
because the lies will get an error and
we just want to do a couple more things
we want to scroll across and you can see
here it says five likes so we're just
going to replace that with the actual
number of likes so we're going to put in
a variable we're going to say posts
index dot likes we're going to scroll
across again and you can see comments we
have a number here but we aren't
actually numbering our comments so we're
just going to delete that and we're
going to go back into index.html scroll
up and you can see here is our modal
window here's the window we use for
displaying comments so we're going to
copy that go to profile PHP and we'll
just paste it in here and finally what
we're going to do is we're going to
scroll up on profile at page P and we're
just going to delete this form and we're
going to delete these posts and we're
just going to use HTML comments to
comment out this form just to hide that
as well and now if i refresh you can see
we have our new profile page it has a
design it shows I'm a verified user you
can see all of my posts printed right
here they're all different posts if I go
to another user you can see the verified
has one post if I liked our post
I've already liked it so that'll click
it again now I've just realized it and
says it has one like if I click on View
comments I can see all of the comments
associated with that post you can see
verified isn't actually verified so if I
go into users go to verified and I set
their account to 201 you can see neither
verified so that's it for this video
