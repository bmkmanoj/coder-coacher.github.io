some of you guys this is probably
already long awaited video and while
here it is finally
so what this video is about is it's just
going to be me giving you guys out the
source code to the social network series
that I started months and months ago and
then I ended quite abruptly and then
started a new one so adjusting is any of
these don't know the reason I stopped it
was because I didn't make the menu and I
didn't want to get in trouble for
distributing people's copyrighted work
so then I decided instead of getting
sued about it so I just private 'add all
the source code but instead of getting
rid of all the videos I just left them
up because the end the actual PHP code
which is the main learning point is
still in the videos so you can still
learn from that but I also decided
instead of just stopping a series and
not doing anything I started the new
series how to make your own YouTube
which I promise he made everything
myself so that way I wouldn't have to
worry about copyright or anything um um
well that's really the reason why I
private it all the source code and what
I've done is I we've downloaded the
latest version of the source code from
the last video I think it was the forty
second video and I removed all of
everything that what could have possibly
been copyrighted so here's all the code
here well not only the code the files
that I'm going to be giving out again
these are all files that we made
ourselves because if you go into the
JavaScript file there's only one file
and it's the one we made ourselves it's
only ready short and then the CSS file I
got rid of every single CSS file because
even in the CSS files I made myself I
copied some of the code from the ones
that didn't so I just got rid of all the
CSS so I'm just going to show you that
all the code still works so I went on -
well here's it here actually as you can
see it looks pretty bad because there's
no CSS but that won't that wouldn't be
hard to fix I mean all you'd have to do
is just add a CSS file and then add
things to it so for example we could
and you can I'll show you how you can do
it even though you a good way to do it
is to use the Google Chrome developer
tools and for example we can go to the
body and we can just click in here we
can type in background color um blue if
we wanted or whoops so I can do that I
could do this and then I can type in
blue and I would make the whole thing go
blue which obviously we don't want but I
mean that's what you could do and you
could just go around doing now for all
the different elements on the page so
I'm just going to prove that it still
works and I'm going to log in oh
actually I forgot the am extra files
folder has all of the SQL files were
used in the videos I'm not sure if than
the most up-to-date or not they might be
a might not be if they're not just let
me know and I'll try and find me most
opportunity at once this is just exactly
the same these files are all exactly the
same as they were in the part 42 of the
video of the videos so if I type in my
name my password and I click in login to
my Conn takes us to the home page and we
can see our newsfeed and as you can see
the Java scripts go on so all of the
fancy effects and things are gone if we
click show comments nothing happens
because we actually does okay we can see
we still see the comment if we act like
on it we can still post comments so if I
just wrote a comment says hi I clicked
post comment and it posts it I could
oops I can go to my profile it looks
messed up but it still works as you can
see the htaccess and things still work
everything should still actually worked
I mean there's nothing changed I didn't
change anything
at all so we can still we can click on
messages and see them we can reply to
messages I think so let's just type in a
message and then tighten another four
like text just and the person we click
send message and it should send so
that's really it that's all I wanted to
really show that's a lot for everything
raised to show so that's it for this
video don't forget to Like comment
favorite and subscribe on the all the
code for this will be in the description
and I promise I won't private this code
so this code will stay up for you guys
to download so thanks again for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
