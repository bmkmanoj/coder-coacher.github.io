be going over is our rhythmic operators
on arrays in PHP so you're probably all
aware of the plus the minus well for
definite and multiply obviously but
since in PHP you can't just say X 4
multiplied use the asterisk the divided
there's no divided on a keyboard so it's
a slash forward slash modulus is this
percent so let's get started so I'm
going to create a variable called number
one not it's going to equal 40 num2 it's
going to equal 20 and i'm going to
create another variable called answer
which is going to equal long 1 plus not
num1 plus num2 so if i echo answer I
should get 60 and if i divide it I
should get to so we can now multiply as
well which will give us a 800 and
there's modulus so simple we get 0
because there's no remainders is because
40/20 is an even number it leaves an
even number 52 set 40 / 21 we get a
remainder of 19 okay so perhaps so
uh there's also minus well that's all of
it like a rhythmic operator is it pretty
simple nothing so now on to the next
part of this video so arrays so a razor
basically just ways of storing sort of a
list a lot of system based thing a list
so if I was to create an array I would
put it in a variable and I would just do
it like any other function so all right
and then to a parenthesis and salmon
come on so in a function you get a
parameter so just what we're going to do
with this arai so i'll give it three
parameters and as you can see well three
values each value is separated with a
comma so say I was going to give the
first one Francis and I could say the
next one is Connor and for a number i
could just say any so if I was to echo
all right you'll see I will actually
just get the word array we want to be
given the values all the data that's
contained within your right but if I was
to use a special function called print
underscore are now you'll see we got
array and we have the three values so I
just changes to another word so i'll set
John so now as you can see we can we can
use this data visually we can manipulate
so where we can now that's in an array
we can use things like
we could echo alright and we can select
the 0 which is the first piece of data
because in PHP it doesn't start at one
it starts at zero as soon as a lot of
other programming languages so if I was
to click reload reload this page we get
Francis and we can also do is we can
change this so we could sit Francis and
then we can say equals on the greater
downside and then we can say 14 mm so
now if we echo 0 we won't be given
Francis anymore will be given Connor but
now if I echo whoops faik if I choose
the references we will get 14 and seemed
as if I choose 14 waxing no dr. Park
yeah we don't have 14 area right so I
rather just basically ways of storing
data so what we can do is we can well if
you saw my other tutorials for the
social networks as you'll see how we can
use our eyes we can spider eyes to get
the data item so we could split this
around into several strengths or we
could split so here we get rid of this
so we had three names in our a we can
split this into a string and we could
say we can split it like this so we can
use we can turn one file you into
basically more than one so that's
basically it for memories I mean it's
kind of simple
I mean that's just a basic thing I
didn't explain it very in-depth but i
don't know i probably will i will
eventually be getting an advanced series
so I'll explain everything I've done and
more depth basically but whatever this
is all you need to know for this minute
so thanks for watching don't forget to
