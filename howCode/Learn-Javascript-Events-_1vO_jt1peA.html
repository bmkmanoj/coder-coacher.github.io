we're going to be learning about it's a
thing in JavaScript called
events and what an event is is it
basically is for example like this the
onclick event it's an attribute that you
can add this certain HTML elements that
allows you to run JavaScript code a
specific time someone specific and
actually happens or whatever still went
out for in this case when the button is
clicked we're gonna run some JavaScript
code it's there's more than just on
factors on most mice and whoops my start
and my stop and there's loads of other
ones so let's get started so I shouldn't
see I have a basic HTML web document I
are a html5 web document actually it's
has a title that says learn JavaScript
it has the JavaScript script tags it
allows to actually embed JavaScript in
the page as opposed to having it in an
external file and we have a button of
type button on the house and it has an
on click event that does nothing but
it's a text is set to my button so here
just our page itself it doesn't like
does she do anything yet so let's get
started so I'm going to create the first
more to do in the on click event is I'm
just gonna alert Creighton alert it's
gonna say how the world so what an alert
is is it's just a built in function
inside of JavaScript and what it does
just great small window or ad fro
mosquitoes it makes like a slight tiny
window at the top that's not a real
window and then it says how to world in
it so I'll show you don't mean in a
second so if we come here and we refresh
the page to that you know reload make it
reload our changes I'm gonna click on my
button says the page at localhost says
hello world okay and then ya alert
disappears so what I'm gonna do now is
since I've showed you want to have an
event is I'm gonna create a custom one
so we're gonna make a function and don't
actually worry about function is in this
video and we're gonna cover that in
another video but just for now just
write ad copy what I do and then it's
just a good way to learn about events so
I've created a funk or I mean sorry it
on the on click of the button it says my
function and that's what's gonna run
it's gonna run my function and which is
why it has the apprentice ease around
the end because that's what a fun that's
how you you execute a function in
JavaScript but you can also have things
like things in like arguments and things
in your parentheses like horizontal like
that or whatever and they'd always have
written by commas but that's for another
video so don't worry about that for mine
so I'm just gonna create a function up
here which is work this is where we
actually create the function down here
is just the code we used to execute it
so it curtains off front we've created a
function and what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to create a small Dave down here
on the idea I'm going to go it is really
important I'm gonna call it my Dave the
ID ice itself that I gave it's not
important but the fact that I gave it an
ID is because that's how we can interact
it with it that's how we can interact
with it with JavaScript so this div just
is how the world and if I reload the
page you will just say just hello world
underneath the button it's what I'm
gonna do now is I'm gonna create a
variable and it's gonna be called my div
the variable name is known for and it's
just what I called it and it's gonna be
it's gonna be equal to get element by ID
whoops it's actually a document dot get
element by ID and then what we're gonna
do is we're gonna give it the ID we
created earlier in the div which is my
dude it's actually just a coincidence
that the okay the safe computer original
color variable date to show there can be
different but the the if I didn't you
give it and the ID you give to get on
the PI ID has to be the same because
that's how JavaScript knows which if you
wanted to add to a mass with and then
what we're gonna say is add a dot inner
HTML equals whoops let's just say the
button was clicked
okay so what I'm gonna do is we're gonna
go into our page now and I'm gonna
refresh and I just see now when I click
on the button yeah
taxes has how the world should change so
it's changed to the button was clicked
so what happened was yeah
Romeo when we use the on click event in
the button around the function my
function and then write execute the code
that we wrote in the function we can
also do is we can say add a dot style
dot color equals and then we could say
blue and this would set the text color
to blue as well as that changing it so
if I click on this I should see the text
color changed on the attacks and stuff
changed and finally we can also do one
more thing we can use that on my time
what will happen is it'll execute the
code tonight if you notice the last time
I had to click on the button and I had
the fun click on the mice with the
button itself had a foot like before the
code and execute but all right I just
see if I just clicked on and don't lift
my mouse up I didn't see I'm so clicking
on the button but the actual script is
executed on the text underneath has
changed and the color of the text itself
has changed so that's it for this video
