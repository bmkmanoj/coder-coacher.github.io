masses compression but before we do that
I'm gonna just explain why there's so
much talking and not as much coding in
this actual series so far it's because
DNS is actually incredibly complicated
and if it wasn't for all this intro into
this series it would be extremely
difficult to follow along because it
gets quite low level because we end up
working with single bits and stuff like
that so it actually helps a lot if we go
over there sort of stuff first if I look
here this is the actual prototype that I
created for this series before it you
can see it's quite long here for example
when we try to create the alp code we're
using a pythons bit shift operators to
shift single bits around and things like
that which is the reason why I've spent
so long on this sort of intro to this
series because it gets quite complicated
and it wouldn't make any sense otherwise
so here we're going onto message
compression message compression is just
used to reduce the amount of bandwidth
that a DNS request ticks and I'm going
to show you an example of that now if I
send a DNS request using dag again I'm
gonna run my prototype server so the DNS
servers running now this is the one that
can actually respond to queries and I'm
gonna hit enter where's the query we
sent there's the response we got so you
can see these are the three records it
sent back and they're correspond with
the zone file the DNS server loaded
whenever a dead boot it up but that's
not why I showed it to you I showed it
to you because if we go to Wireshark
it's still capturing packets here's a
query from dig and here's the response
that got back from our server and I can
see it was 109 bytes long it was under
the 512 byte limit so here's where I'm
going to show you compression here is
the word high code it's encoded and the
way it's encoded is here's the length
which is seven characters and that is
high code h o w c o da then it has word
normally you would find a dot it is the
length of the next part which is three
and that is o rj and that has a zero
which just means the end of the domain
name we can see that is the actual word
high code encoded in binary or in this
case encoded in hexadecimal and if we go
down here to the answer it says haiku
org as well but you can see it only
takes up two bytes in the response
whereas in the question it uses the
actual word haiku the reason for that is
because DNS compresses the answers to
see if bandwidth so this probably
doesn't make any sense in a minute but
you can see there is compression taking
place that's why it only takes two bytes
to send the answer if I scroll down here
there's haiku dog again and it takes
another two bytes and they're the same
in fact so this C 0 0 C is actually
we're looking at here and it would make
more sense if we just right-click and
convert this into bits and if we just
click on the name hi code you can see
here is the actual bits that we're
looking out if we read this paragraph it
says the first two bits are ones so the
first two bits are ones so we can ignore
those the offset is what we actually
care about so if we go back to Wireshark
when we look here there's the two ones
and then we have a load of zeros and
then we've more zeros and then 1 1 0 0
so if I just type this into a
hexadecimal converter 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
which is the first byte then we have if
we go back we have four zeros two ones
and two zeros so 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 if I
convert that now you can see we got some
random decimal number that means
absolutely nothing that's because we've
included the first two bits so if I
delete those and now we only have the
offset which is what we look at it here
this is the offset this is what we
actually care about this is where the
compression is stored so if I just
convert this now you can see it says 12
and in the last video I mentioned that
the DNS header is 12 bytes long you can
see this is the DNS header and it's 12
bytes long that would make it more sense
if we go back to Wireshark and we see
additional R RS that's the end of the
DNS header that is the 12th byte and I
just convert this back in a hexadecimal
to make it easier to read so this is the
12th byte and if we look here the 13th
byte is the word haiku org
with its size prepended to the front of
it so essentially what our compression
is doing is it's saying go to the top of
a request which is up here at the
transaction ID go 12 bytes down which
will bring you to additional resource
records and then that means the next
byte is the word haiku org which is the
word we're trying to compress it looks
like nothing c00 see but we converted to
binary and we take away the first two
bits and we're left with just the offset
it makes sense it's 12 and that means
that haiku org the first occurrence of
it is 12 bytes from the start of the
request and the reason we need to know
that is
because whenever we want to send a
response from our server to the user we
need to understand how to build a DNS
response and that means we're gonna need
to understand how to use DNS compression
so that's it for this video don't forget

and I'll see you next time and in the
next part I promise we'll actually be
doing some actual code so thanks for
watching and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
