be able to add hashtags to posts and
then when you click a hashtag we want to
have a list of topics to appear with
posts with those hashtags in them so
let's get started
so here what we're doing is we're
checking if the first character starts
with a not sign what we're gonna do
again is copy and paste this and check
if it starts with a hashtag and if it
starts with a hashtag instead of going
to profile that PHP we're gonna go to
topics drop HP topic equals and then
whatever the topic and the hashtag is
what we actually need to do is just
delete that move this up here and we'll
say else if I'm gonna run that again so
it works as expected if we put in hello
world
hash like PHP we click post now you can
see the hashtag PHP shows up and when we
click it it'll take us to topics and
that'll take us to PHP so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna go to our posts
table and we're good out of other column
this column is going to be topics and
it's gonna be varchar' so what we'll do
is we'll just say something like 400 is
the maximum length for topics that's
because topics is going to look like
this in this instance it says PHP so the
topic is gonna be PHP if we had a couple
of hashtags would say that PHP , for
example maybe even HTML Javascript
something like that and while each post
can only have 160 characters we also
need to account for these commas so I
just picked a big number that means
whenever I have a problem with storing
topics so what we're gonna do whenever
the user creates a post is we want to
store the topics in that post so
whenever we create the post we want to
go back up to create post and we want to
insert topics we want to do the same for
create image post but we'll do that
afterwards so topics is going to be
equal to topics
and we're gonna create another method
called find topics and it's gonna be
really similar to link ad we're gonna
copy and paste up I'm only concerned
about the hashtags and we're not
concerned about anything else we'll tell
it all that what we'll do is we'll split
the text up based on spaces we don't
need a new string and what we'll do is
we'll just say if we find a topic which
is here we will just say topics dot
equals word which is the current word
we're on and will create the topics
variable up here a word comma and then
down here we'll return the topic string
so up here we'll say topics equals get
topics post body and that'll go through
the post body and get all the topic and
we just want to copy paste that and use
it down here we're running Gap topics
we're not running South cap topics which
means we're running a function within
the class that we're currently in so we
want to say itself
we've already fresh and resubmit that
and now you can see we have the new post
and we have these two topics and they're
both links now if I go to the database
and I go to content and refresh we are
our two posts and then here you can see
we have the topics and you can see we're
storing the hashtags too so we can get
rid of that when we create the list of
topics we're going to say word is equal
to sub sub STR and we're going to skip
the first character to remove the
hashtag and we'll try this one more time
we would click post everything worked as
you would expect go back to sequel Pro
refresh and now we can see our top
external hashtags and I'm gonna go in
here and just delete the old hashtags so
what what I do now is create the topics
page so we're going to create a new page
called topics got to go to profile and
we're just going to include some of the
stuff we have on profile so here we're
saying if it's a cat username but of
course on topics we want to get if it's
at get topics and where you can delete
those old variables and either we know
we have a specific topic we want to get
that topic from the database so what
we're going to do is create a DB query
and we're going to go to Socorro about
this query and if we go to our query we
can say select topics from posts click
run we can see all of the topics from
the post sable then we can say it were
and we can use a special function called
find in set and this lets us find
specific data inside the column so what
we want to do is pass for example PHP
and then we want to pass in the column
names were set topics if I click run now
if all the posts were one of the topics
is PHP so if I copy that and if I paste
it here we have our query except we want
to change PHP to topic we get topic from
our cat variable
so if the query is successful will echo
say valid topic and we need to change
this from topics to get topic we'll run
that and we got an error so we just have
a syntax error here would run that that
says valid topic if I put in something
else like this
we got nothing because it's not a valid
topic so now that we know that it's a
valid topic or at least we know that
some posts in the database actually
contain this topic we're ready to I put
those posts so what we'll do is we'll
copy this query and we'll store in a
variable and then what we'll do is we'll
iterate through it we'll set for H posts
as post and now we'll just print our
post so let's just see what happens we
get an array of posts so what we'll do
is change this to select all and we will
put in some pre tags here just to make
it easier to look up and now we can see
our two arrays we have that post and we
have that post and what we're simply
gonna do is print out a specific post so
what we'll do is we'll just echo post
and we want to get say for example the
post body so we got out by saying post
body we will just remove them and will
append a break tag so now you can see we
have all of the posts with the word Java
Script in them or if we change that to
PHP now we have all the same posts
because they have the word PHP in them
if I change one of these and I add in
for example HTML and I change the topic
to HTML you can see we only get one post
returned because that is the only post
with the topic of HTML in its hash tags
so that's it for this video don't forget
to Like comment favorite and subscribe
in future parts we're going to be making
it much more like Twitter but this was
just to show the concept so that we can
take hash tags we can create links out
of them if we want and we can use the
database to query all of our posts and
look for posts with a specific hashtag
so that's it for this video don't forget

don't forget to follow us on Facebook
Twitter and reddit and I'll see you next
time
