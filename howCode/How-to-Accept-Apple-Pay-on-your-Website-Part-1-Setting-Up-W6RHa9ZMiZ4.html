how to accept Apple pay as a form of
payment on a website so what Apple pay
is is it's a contactless payment system
you can use it to pay with your phone in
a shop but you can also use it to pay
for things online all you have to do is
put your fingerprint down and your
credit card is automatically charged
which makes it one of the best ways to
pay for things online it's also
extremely easy to actually add your
website I expected it to be a lot more
difficult than it was but it actually
only takes a couple of minutes to set up
so hopefully this signs interesting
before we get started I'm just going to
show you a quick demo of how it actually
works so we already have a website here
it's just Francis McNamee comm and
there's a special Apple pay button so
all I have to do is top pay
and as you can see this special dialogue
pops up and what it says is it chooses
the card you want to charge this is just
one of the special task cards they gave
you on their website below it it says
pay heiko 210 pounds so if I put my
finger on the fingerprint sensor it'll
charge the card if it was a real card
anyway and then it'll take me to the
success page that will say that I've
actually been charged so if I just hold
down the fingerprint sensor now
it's processing and there we go it says
payment made and though the payment has
gone through obviously this is only a
sound box it's a fake environment but if
this was a real payment that would have
been all I had to do to pay for whatever
it was I was buying so let's get started
actually implementing this it only takes
a couple of minutes so to be able to
accept Apple pay the first thing you
need to do is create an Apple Developer
account there is a paid account and a
free version you can use we're just
going to be using the free version so
you just click on a current and sign up
so you just go to create your Apple ID
over here and once we have our Apple ID
we can create a sound box account which
will allow us to accept Apple pay
payments and a special sandbox
environment without using real credit
cards so once you're inside of your
Apple account you you're not going to
get this big red box that I have yeah
but what you want to do is you want to
click on iTunes Connect and you want to
click go to iTunes Connect then what you
want to do is you want to click on users
on roles and then you want to go to
sandbox testers so here you can see I
have one special sandbox account set up
it's just Apple pay at Hoku org and it's
just one of kind what you have to do is
click this plus and you create a special
sound box account so once you've created
your account you want to go to settings
and you want to log into your Icode
account the one you just created the
special sandbox account so as you can
see I'm logged into it the first time
you log n it's going to send you a
verification email you just have to
click on that link and it will take you
to the Apple website and you can verify
your account but once you do that you'll
be logged in and you'll be able to see
exactly what you can see on my screen
here so after you have that set up what
you want to do is add one of the special
sandbox cards to your phone you can only
add these sandbox cards to a sandbox
account so if you try to add one of
these cards to your actual live Apple ID
it'll just give you an error and say the
card is invalid so what you want to do
is you want to go to wallet and Apple
pay and you wanna click
I'd credit or debit card you want to add
your card details and we're gonna add
one of these Tasker cards in a second so
here I am on the Apple website again and
if we scroll down you can see all of the
cards you're able to use there's visa
cards MasterCard Discover in American
Express the first card I used in the
example was just this one here but I'm
just glad this second card down below
you
so now we just put in the expiration
code which is November 2022 on the
security code which is it 5-1 and this
is a kind of fit card when I actually
work for anything other than this
sound box to actually test Apple pay so
we just agree to the terms and
conditions and the card will be added
so you can see now we have to visa
tester cards so now that we've set up
our tester cards we need to actually
create a server for us to be able to
actually host our website to be able to
process the Apple pay payments so I'm
just going to use digitalocean for this
so what you want to do is want to click
on one click apps
and you want to go to lamp on
point o4 which is just Linux Apache
MySQL and PHP on ubuntu 16.04 we're
going to go to the five dollar-a-month
one and we're just going to pick the
default
we're gonna give it a host name of Apple
pay dot Frances McNamee calm so the
server's just been created so here you
can see our new server has just been
created on its life now on the internet
all I did was add a subdomain to my
actual demand Apple pay up Frances
McNamee com so we can SSH into our
server now we can say SSH root at
whatever the server is we can give her
the domain name or we can just put in
the IP address just type in yes for this
we see this the first time we log in to
a new server and we just paste in our
password it's gonna ask us to change it
and there we are we're logged into our
server so that's it for this video don't

subscribe again as I said Apple pay is
really easy to set up so we'll probably
finish the series in the next video but
