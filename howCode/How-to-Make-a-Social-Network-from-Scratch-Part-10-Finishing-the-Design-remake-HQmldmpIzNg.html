remix of the harder make your own social
networking website series so as you can
see this is this has a different design
to the previous one and that's because
the previous design had bugs with
Internet Explorer not are not displaying
it correctly and the easiest solution
was to just change the design so that's
what I did I just changed the design
same as I did last time except online
again you can't give out this code
because I didn't make this menu I just
remember finding it on my an hour drive
so unfortunately I can't give you like
to the G menu but the it all yeah final
source code has the same as all this
except for the CSS code because I didn't
want to give it ID since I didn't write
it but I'm just going to show you that
it all works the same
so here we go it says hello rhymes would
you like to logout a click logout and it
signs me out so all the functionality
we've built so far is working as it
should and the only difference is now we
have a different design which is the
design we're going to keep for the rest
of the series so this has been a pretty
short video but thanks for watching
don't forget to Like comment favorite
and subscribe and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
