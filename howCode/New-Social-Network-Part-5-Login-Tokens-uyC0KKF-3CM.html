having verified the users password and
user name marched and in this video
we're going to actually learn how to log
the user in we're not going to be using
sessions like we used in the last series
we're going to be using cookies so the
first thing we need to do is create a
new table in our database we're going to
create the new table and that's going to
be called login tokens we have an ID
field we need to create another field
called token it's going to be a varchar'
it's actually to be a char because we
don't need a variable length and then
we're going to set its length to 64
characters and then next we're going to
set user underscore ID and that's going
to be an int
neither of these fields can be empty so
we're going to turn off a loan oh and
what we want to do is make the user ID
unsigned as well because we can't have
negative user IDs we want to make token
unique to make sure that we can't have
duplicate tokens and our database so
we're going to go down here we're going
to add a new key it's going to be unique
we don't need to give it a name we're
just going to click Add no the token
field is unique next we're going to
create a relationship between a user ID
and the login tokens table and the ID in
the users table so we're going to do is
click relations we're going to add a new
relationship the relationship is going
to be the user ID of the login tokens
table and it's going to reference the
users table and it's going to reference
the column ad we don't need to give it a
name but we can if we want and we're
just going to click Add so now that
we've set up our database we need to
actually log the user in so when our
login page whenever we log the user and
instead of just saying logged in we want
to set a cookie but before we can create
the cookie we need to generate what
we're going to put in the cookie so what
we're going to put in the cookie is the
login token itself we're gonna get the
login token from here it's going to be
using the PHP open SSL random pseudo
buycks function which is just going to
generate some random bytes and we're
going to use those random bytes as our
login tokens so we're going to copy this
we're going to set token equals and
we're going to paste in this function
and to this function we're going to pass
the number of bytes you want to generate
which is going to be 64 which
corresponds to our database table and a
token of the length of 64 and then we're
going to pass it true which tells PHP
that this should be cryptographically
secure which means it's good enough to
use for login tokens and then
surrounding this function we want to say
then two acts to convert the binary
that's generated from this function into
a hexadecimal number we can store in our
database and then here we'll just echo
token to see what it looks like so the
reason we got this error is because
instead of passing through we have to
pass a variable C strong which stands
for cryptographically strong and we just
say equals true so let's try this again
so now if we just refresh and with the
arrows gone and we'll try to login and
you can see it says logged in and then
here is our massive token and we're
going to check if the user has a cookie
that is equal to this string and that's
we're going to log you man if i refresh
and resubmit the form you can see we got
a different token generated every time
so now that we've generated the token we
need to store it in our database so
we're going to say DB query and we're
going to insert it into our database
we're going to say insert into login
tokens values the first ones the ID
which is Auto incremented so we don't
need to worry about it the next one is
the token and the one after that is the
user ID so what we need to do is also
run another query and get the users ID
so when up here it will say user
underscore ID is equal to DB query and
we'll select the write a so we'll say
at the end of the query we want to go to
the 0th index again and we want to go to
the ID failed this time instead of the
password fails so that in here what we
want to do is pass our parameters the
first ones are token and the next one is
our user ID
we're not quite ready to submit this yet
because as it stands if we submit the
talk and as it is to our database and
store it anyone who gets access to our
database will have access to these
tokens and all we have to do is copy and
paste them into a cookie and then
they're logged into the users so it's
essentially the same as having an
unencrypted password that token is as
good as the user's password to log into
their account so to protect against that
we're going to use the sha-1 function in
PHP to harsh the token that we store in
the database so this way if Saudi was to
gain access to your database they would
only have the hash token just like if
the access to database that have the
hashed passwords they wouldn't have the
actual raw password they couldn't
actually log in to use as a current
because they wouldn't know the password
and here they wouldn't be able to log in
because the don't action of the token
the only place the raw token is stored
is in the users cookie in their browser
so this way if your database has ever
compromised your tokens are safe because
they're stored with your users so we've
run that query and it says logged in so
what we're going to do is we're going to
try and see that this work we just need
to comment out the single quotes around
our ID fields because we're using single
quotes to actually include the string
and we also need to pass the username
parameter to our first query so we're
going to test this so it says logged in
if we go back to our table we check the
content out you can see we have the
token idea of one we have the actual
token itself and sha-1 form and we have
the user ID and that user ID corresponds
to this rule and the other table so we
need to finally do is create a cookie
which we actually wholly log the user in
so now we need to set the cookie to log
the user in so to do that what we want
to do is down here it will say set
cookie and the first thing we want to do
is pass the cookies name so I'm going to
call SN ID for social network ID next
one a pass the token itself the on past
version of the token then we want to set
the expiry date which is going to be
equal to the current time plus however
many seconds you want the token to be
valid for so say 60 seconds times 60 for
60 minutes times 24 for one day
times seven will be valid for one week
the next parameter is the location of
the server the cookie is valid for so
we're just going to say a slash for
every where the next thing we're going
to say is no this is just for the domain
the cookies valid and we're going to put
and no for that next we want to set null
again but if your website toasted over
SSL you want to set this to true so just
means is the cookie available over a non
HTTPS connection and we're going to send
no because we wanted to be available
over any kind of connection in a minute
if this was a real application you would
want to set it to true and then finally
we want to set true again and this true
stands for HDTV only which means
JavaScript can't access this cookie
which helps prevent against cross-site
scripting attacks so we save that we're
going to refresh and we're going to try
and log in again um if we click on this
I in the top you can see there's no
cookies currently and now if I click
login
it says logged in and it says one cookie
in use this cookie is called SN ID like
we said and this cookie is equal to the
login token itself and if we go to the
database and refresh you can see the
login token in the database starts with
1 to b7 and the token itself starts as
easier 1 6 so it's nothing like Lee
token in the database because the
database tokens hashed so that's it for
this video don't forget to Like comment
favorite and subscribe in the next video
we'll be tithing a bit of this up
because ultimately user can have an
unlimited number of login tokens at any
one time
which could be a security flaw so you
might want to limit it to say for
example 5 tokens per user at any one
time which would mean they could only be
logged in on 5 devices at any one time
but that's the design decision we also
haven't created anywhere to log the user
out so we're going to do that in the
next part but that's it for this video
don't get to like comment favorite and
subscribe don't forget to follow us on
Facebook and Twitter and I'll see you
next time
