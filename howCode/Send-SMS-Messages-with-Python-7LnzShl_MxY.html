how easy and cheap it is to send SMS
messages using Python so we're going to
be implementing this in Python but
actually send SMS messages we're going
to be using Amazon simple notification
service it's also extremely easy to
implement so to use Amazon's simple
notification service with Python the
first thing we have to do is install
Amazon's SDK so to do that all we have
to do is we type in pip install Bo to3
so if we had at Ranieri that should
install if you get any permission
problems just type in sudo and your
password from windows you can also use
the pip install bo to3 command so once
you've got that installed we can
actually just launch the python
interpreter like this and we can type in
our commands so before we can use
amazon's sdk we need to set up our
credentials so inside your amazon web
services account you want to go to i am
and you want to create a new user so we
give them a username i'm just going to
call them test 1 2 3 4 we want
programmatic access because we want them
to be able to use amazon's api's and we
want to attach an existing policy
directly and the policy we want to
attach is one that lets us use Amazon's
simple notification service so we just
type in SNS we want to click on the
policy Amazon S and ask for access and
we scroll down to review
if we create the user it's going to give
us our API keys that we need to actually
access the service so once we have our
API keys you can go to this page and you
can follow the configuration
instructions all you need to do is run
the command editable us configure and
it'll ask for your API keys and to do
that you have to install the
command-line interface as well but
that's really easy to install so you can
just click on that link to install it
and if you don't want to install it you
can alternatively just create a file in
this location and give it your API keys
that way so once you have that setup
we're ready to go into Python so inside
of Python we want to import that library
we just installed
so once we've imported the library we
just installed we're ready to start
sending text messages so we're going to
create a variable called client it's
gonna be equal to be oto 3 dot client
and the client we want to give it is the
SNS client and you can see I just got an
arrow there because I didn't specify a
region so I'm gonna use the region
that's based on Ireland which is called
EU West one so to pick a rage and all I
do is give it a second parameter and I'm
going to type in EU West one and that is
the client variable created so now that
we've got our client connected to my
Amazon a current we're gonna try to send
a text message so to send a message all
we do is we set client dot publish and
we want to provide the client with the
phone number to send the message to on
the actual message itself so to provide
the phone number we write phone number
equals and then the string which
contains the phone number and to provide
the message we just say a message equals
and then the message so I'm gonna say
hello world from haiku org and now I'm
going to type in the phone number and
before we send a text message we what I
go to manage text messaging preferences
and here we can provide a default sandor
ID on Jean C my default Sander ID is
high code so we're going to send that
message
and now you can see the message showed
up on the phone I'm against and as many
as we want so I just sent three messages
there
as you see how quick it is and it's
extremely cheap as well
so hopefully you know you've seen how
easy it is to send tax messages using
Python and Amazon simple notification
service it only actually takes us three
lines of code before we're ready to
start sending messages but that's it for
