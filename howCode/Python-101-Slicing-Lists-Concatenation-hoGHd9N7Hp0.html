we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be
learning about slicing lists and
concatenation so I'm just going to
create a basic list so my list equals
and I say just put some items in our
list so a not this case I'm just gonna
put some numbers in so what 0 1 2 3 4 5
6 so then we have our list so if I was
to say print my list here's our list and
gets printed out to us but to slice a
list and what this what that is is
basically um I'll show you so say we
wanted from the as start of the list - I
don't know the 4th item
let's hit return in a print site for
items 0 is the 0 with first second third
all right 0 or 0 first second third but
if you add them together it gets 4 so it
prints out 4 things at up our list if I
was to say my list 1 5 it gives us F for
items from our list because you know
telling it we want the difference
between 1 &amp;amp; 5 items which just means 4
ok let's say what if we wanted to go
backwards so if we said my list and we
wanted to go backwards we can use -
numbers so we could say go from minus 5
to 2 all right
that's my list let's go back - minus 5
minus 2
so quit backwards from the yeah fifth
one and list so since is the zero with
this is the first second third and then
this makes it the fourth but as I said
you Adams gather so one two three four
five so then it goes from four to two
because the difference between these two
numbers is three so it prints out three
items from our list but you can you can
also say my list
zero and then if we just do zero and we
don't put anything after the : since we
said zero it will start on the very
first item in the list which in this
case is also an item called zero and
then since we didn't specify where to
end it will just print outside the whole
list so what you can do that then is you
can catenate two lists together so we
could say create a list so it's just say
HP my SQL CSS plus javascript and let's
just say JavaScript and I know where C
oh no we're good when we pass on because
that's what we're learning okay so if we
do Python in there and we can count it
these two lists together what you'll see
is just one big list with the two lists
join the gathers so it just turns into
one big list we can also do is now we
can concatenate things like strings
together so I could say create a string
so my name is plus Francis and I'm gonna
put a space there because when we can
can't eat it okay without the space we
just can count me in it and does this
and there's no space there so if I was
to do my string
my name is space
there it is it concatenates the two
strings together and forms one string
what we can also do is we can multiply
strings out so where what if we said and
pizza
type whoops pizza times 10 and it gives
us pizza it gives us a string with the
word pizza 10 times so what if we want a
space there so all we have to do to do
that is just put a space at the end of
it and then do times 10 but this time
we've speak pizza with a space so our
string should up like this so we can
also do is we could say if we wanted we
can create a list and multiply one item
ten times so say we had pizza on the
list and was just one item if we did
multiply by five it creates us a list
with five items in it so that's it for
this video it was relatively short and
more videos coming soon and I'm sorry
there's been a few days with some videos
because I've been actually working on a
little of them I just have to upload
them though so I don't worry there'll be
a lot of videos coming in the next few
days so I look forward to that and I
will see you next time and don't forget
to comment like subscribe and favorite
and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
