name and we've pointed it to mass fest
which is we're gonna host the project
and know we're ready to create our
database so we're going to go to cPanel
again click home I'm going to scroll
down to MySQL databases so what I'm
going to do is when I see here it says
create new database I'm going to create
a new one called
Frances one underscore MSG I'm gonna
click create database
says that database has been added
so now what I need to do after I've
created the database is I need to add a
user to that database so what I'm gonna
do is go down to MySQL users I'm gonna
click a new kind of create a new user
I'm going to call it a fascist one
underscore F I don't expect password
generator I'm just going to pick around
and password
that one will do so I'm just going to
copy that and click this box to use the
password and I'm going to click create
user so we've just created that user
now what we need to do after we've
created the user or created the database
is we need to add that user to the
database we've just created so we scroll
down again it says add user to database
and I'm going to look for this one here
Francis one underscore msg and i want to
add the user francis 1 on your score ass
so I'm going to click Add
and here we can choose the privileges
for that user
so obviously you don't want to have all
these privileges but just because just
why we're making it we're just going to
pick all privileges then afterwards what
you can do is delete the privileges you
don't actually need to make your
application more secure we just added
Francis on the front somewhat underscore
ass to the database Francis will an
underscore msg we've added those
privileges to it so that's all finished
now so what we're going to do is we're
going to go to index type PHP and we're
going to see does it work so we're going
to create a simple PHP script and we're
going to say creative Arabic on TV and
said DB equals mysql i
and we actually said DV equals new my
SQLite because we're creating a new
instance of the MySQL light because
we're going to be using object-oriented
PHP we're going to be using prepared or
my scalp apart statements for document
using procedural and MySQL queries in
this series so what we're going to do is
we need to have four arguments the first
argument is the database host and since
the database is hosted on the same
server as the actual files we can just
put in local loose
then what we want to do is want to put
in our username so we're using it as
Frances 1 underscore F and the password
is this password we saved from earlier
then we want to add the database which
is Frances 1 underscore msg and that
should be it so that should be it but
sort of as an added check we're going to
check to the connection succeed so the
way we do that as we say if then we're
going to say DB and what we want to do
is want to access a member of the DB
class because this is just a DB the DB
variable is just an instance of the
MySQL a class we want to add our access
the connect error so we want to add lis
connect we want to access the connect
error member of the DB class and we're
going to say I couldn't connect to TV
then we're set house tie connection
successful so then we'll just try that
look like upload
and we'll go to MSU today a VC will
click this as this couldn't connect to
DB okay so the reason it didn't connect
was because the user name was spelled
wrong it's Francis one underscore half
and the password is for some reason
wrong so what I did was just change the
password here's a new password and it
should work and I so let's just upload
this go to the Google Chrome just
refresh you can see it says connect and
successful now so we're ready to go what
we'll do is just get rid of that and the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to get rid of this because we
don't actually need it on the index page
so we're going to put it on the update
messages page and we're going to put it
on the GATT Massey's page
so that's it for this video don't forget
