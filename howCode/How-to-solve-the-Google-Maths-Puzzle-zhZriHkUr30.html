doing is we're going to be learning how
to solve the Google math puzzle that
they did a couple of years ago so what
they did was they had a billboard this
is what it looks like if you solved this
puzzle and took you to a web address and
then you solve another puzzle and then
if you could tell both of them then and
you would be able to apply for a job and
what we're going to do is when a figure
out how to actually solves both of those
puzzles so what the puzzles asking you
is a the first ten digit prime finding
consecutive digits of a so what a is is
it's just a mathematical constant just
like pie and what essentially this means
is we just have to go through all the
digits of a and find the first prime
number that is 10 digits long so to do
that obviously we need to have a value
of a so what I did was I create a file
it's just an empty file and I'm going to
paste in a value for a it's just when I
find in the internet it's a to 500
decimal places so if I just call the
variable a and I make a string and paste
in the room this is the number itself
you can see it starts with 2.71 so we
presume the rest of its correct as well
but what we're interested in is
everything after the decimal point so we
can actually just delete the too dark
because warning interested in numbers
that come after the decimal point
because that's what we're going to be
searching for the prime number so in
order to find the prime number the first
thing we have to do is create a function
that can actually find prime numbers so
the way we do that is we're going to
create a function that will determine
whether or not a number is prime the way
we do that is and just create the
function we're going to call it is p and
that's just short for is prime we're
going to pass it one parameter called
oops one parameter called n that's the
number we want to check so what we want
to do is want to create a range from 2
which is the smallest prime number up
until add the number we're actually
checking and what we want to do is
divide the number we're checking by the
number within the range and then if at
any point not range we got a remainder
that is equal to 0 as in we get no
remainder that means the number isn't
prime because it has more than two
factors at self and one so what we do
that is we use pythons modulo operator
and that's going to if that equals 0
that means the remainder 0 because the
modulo operator is like divide
cept instead of dividing the two numbers
and giving you the result it divides
someone gives you the remainder so we
want the remainder to be zero so we're
going to divide them so that we do this
is we use a for loop and we're going to
create a viable called I which is going
to be the points within the range that
we're currently out so if we were
chatting 10 to see of 10 was prime and
we would start at two and we grow up to
10 and then I would be equal to any
number between 2 and 10 within the range
so i'm going to set for i in range which
is the python range function we're going
to start on the number two and we're
going to end on the number and so now
what we do is we say if and / I gives a
remainder of 0 that we know the number
is and not prime so we say I return
false because the number was in prime
otherwise if we get through the entire
range and then I'd say the for loop we
return true which means the number is
prime because if we get the entire way
through the for loop without returning
false then we return true because
obviously that means the number must be
Prime so we're going to task this so
we're just going to say we're going to
print the result we're going to print is
pay we're going to pass it a number that
we know to be prime so just 13 that is
going to be prime so this will return
true we said Python 3gp you can see it
returns true now if i type in any even
number for example 20 we know that's not
prime because it's an even number and we
run this you can see it says false so
that's our prime number tracker and
that's the first step in solving the max
puzzle so the next thing we need to do
is we need to check at the number itself
a our new check can we find the prime
number so what we're doing is we're
looking for a number that's ten digits
long so we're going to grab 10 digits
out of a and then we're going to check
them to see if their prime if they're
not then since we started on the first
number then we're going to move to the
next number and move to the next one
we're going to move one digit at a time
until we get and until we find our prime
number so what we're going to do is
we're going to create another for loop
and we're going to set for X in a so a
is our variable up here and X is going
to be any specific character within its
05 to print X what it will do is it will
pray
every single character with a new line
after it as you can see that's what it
did so what we want to do is want to get
a block of characters that are 10
characters long so the way we do that is
we say if a because Python strings are
and arrays of characters we can use the
array operator and we can use that to
grab 10 letters out of the E string
still where we do that as we say we
start on 0 which is the first character
and we go up to 10 which is the 10th
character and what we do is we are
surround this in the function is PE to
check out the number is prime but as you
can see a is a string and what we're
doing here is getting a substring which
is set a string so what we need to do is
we need to convert it to an integer to
run it through our function because our
function expect an integer so there we
have the number path to our function I
what we want to say is equals true that
means if the number is prime then we
really kind of the for loop otherwise we
say a is equal to itself and then what
we're going to do is we're going to
remove the first 10 characters so the
way we do that is we say it is equal to
itself except what we're going to do is
we're going to start on the first index
instead of the 0th index so that means
instead of starting at seven we're going
to start on one and we're overriding the
variable a each time so actually
shrinking it its length and we want to
say it's equal to one and then we see a
colon which means it goes to the end of
the string so what we've done is
essentially just reduce the length of
the string by removing the first
character and then what we say is after
we've reduced the first character we
check again which is what happens when
we run the for loop so what we want to
do then is if we find the prime number
we want to print out the string this's
find it then we want to print the actual
number so we're going to print a we're
going to print a 0 to 10 which is the 10
digit prime number we just find so let's
run this and see what happens so this
looks like we have an infinite loop we
actually don't if I just close out with
control state I'll just and the program
so what's actually happening there
is our function is finding the prime
number what is doing is it's checking
the range from the number 2 up to the
prime number but if you see if I grabbed
10 characters out of this string you can
see that's the first 10 characters and
that's 10 digits which means this number
is actually seven billion 182 million
eight hundred eighteen thousand 284 so
what essentially this means is all for
it passed a loop seven billion times to
get the entire way through that range so
what it actually finds the prime number
it's not actually frozen it's just
looping essentially seven billion times
what we can do is we can just print I
and if we run missing key and what
you'll see is this you can see this is
the loop actually happened happening in
person and you can see it's on about a
million nine but that means it has
another thousand ad Goudy at a 1 billion
and another seven times longer than that
to get the 17 so as you can see it takes
ages which is why it looks like we have
an infinite loop when in fact we don't
so the way we can actually get our prime
number is instead of saying if the
result is true then printed out because
this function doesn't actually get
chance to return yet because it has so
many and loops to do so what we could do
to solve this problem is we could either
decrease the range but that would mean
that we couldn't be one hundred percent
certain that the prime number we find is
actually the first one because if we
start the range too high then we're not
we might not find the prime number early
enough in the sequence which means we
could find a 10 digit prime number but
it wouldn't be the first one which is
what we're looking for we're looking for
the first ten digit prime number so
alternatively what we can do is we can
first just pumpin that now we can say if
the result is false obviously we don't
want to break out of it so we find it
because we didn't so we just want to
copy that and we pass it up here and
then we'll sell
so in other words if it's true and will
break I've it obviously and if it's
false we're going to print like the
prime number we're going to print out
the string e is equal to 0 to 10 so I
actually take note of the fact that our
print is below and the string way over
right the array of characters the reason
for that is because since we're
overriding them first we're essentially
just pushing a string a long one which
means when we return when we print out
the number it's actually not the current
number that's checked it's the number
after it I'm because our function never
returns when we get to our prime number
because it's so big because we're
printing the number that's not actually
being checked we're printing the number
after it that means that when we get to
our prime number we don't actually wait
for to be checked when we get to the
masses of infinite loop we can actually
just assume the data is our prime number
and the way we could check it is we just
put it into the web browser and see does
it show up to the correct website so if
i run this now you can see this number
here is actually that I'm what we were
looking for all along this is the prime
number of the first 10 digit prime
number in consecutive digits of a and if
we waited for our function to return
long enough then it would actually
return property so the next thing that
happens when you go to the website this
calm which is what it tells you to do in
the picture so if we go over to here you
can see this is the second part of the
puzzle if we go to our prime number com
this is the web page will get we get
congratulations you made it to level two
go to lenox start organ enter Bob's your
uncle as the login and answer to the
equation as your password and as you can
see this is just a list of the same
function and and it returns different
values if we look at this fourth value
it is equal to the prime number that we
just found and if we actually just copy
this value are we and command F we paste
it in here you can see this is a the
first ten digits out of the after the
decimal point in a if we copy the next
one this is another set of hand edges
from a carving the next one I'll also
part of the other town these are another
10 de disney
and our prime number that we find in the
first part if we call me Miss top you
can see that is another ten digits of a
and what these ten digits have they have
one thing in common and it is that they
all add up to 49 so the sum of the
digits if we add these all together is a
49 so essentially what we're looking for
is we're looking for a set of 10
characters in the string that I'd
together equal 49 what we're looking for
is characters that happen after this for
phone so if we just add pieces here
agency we're looking for characters from
this nine onwards we're looking for ten
characters not equal that was some
together equals 49 and that will be the
answer to this equation so to do that
what we need to do
is we need to create another for loop to
loop through the string much the same
way as we did our neurons was there for
X and ay which will loop through every
character in the string is a for now
we'll just pick another character set
see in in again but what we're doing is
we're going to look through a substring
this time of a so we're just going to
say a and now we're going to pick a
substring which is going to be 0 to the
10th index that will give us our 10
digits of numbers then what we're going
to do is going to sum them all together
and before we can do that we need to
create a variable to hold them to hold
the S summers riding it up so we'll say
s is equal to 0 so then we'll say s is
equal to int and then c c is going to be
a character and then we need to convert
it from a string to an integer that's
what we're using the end function for
and we're going to set plus equals to
increase the value of s then what we're
going to do is going to go down here
outside the for loop but within the for
loop the elbow for it we're going to say
if s is equal to 49 want to say is if s
is equal to 49 then we're just going to
print e is equal to 0 to 10 which is the
10 digits of characters and after that
and we're going to remove the first
character of an eh time so we're going
to say a is equal to itself minus the
first character and that will just push
the string along so that we can actually
and find the 10 digit we're looking for
so we just run this you can see here is
a list of the numbers that find that all
add up to 49 and if we just piss them in
here you can see this is the first
number which is f equals 1 is the second
number f it goes to third one F equals
three fourth one F equals four and the
fifth one which is what we're looking
for is this one here so if I just remove
any ones after that this is equal to F
equals five
we're looking for so if obviously this
website doesn't work anymore but if we
were to go to lenox start or type in
bob's your uncle and at pearson this as
the password it would have taken us to a
page that would allow us to apply for a
job so hopefully you find this tutorial
