learning about the core concepts in
Django and we're also going to be
setting up our first two pages the sign
up on the login page I'm going to be
setting up the database that powers our
whole website so the first thing we have
to do is install something called MySQL
clients because that will in like Python
to talk to our MySQL database so we want
to say a pip install MySQL client
all we want to do is go to the Django
settings file and tell Django to use our
MySQL server so dine here in the
databases section of our settings file
what we're going to do is we're going to
comment that out because we don't want
to use SQLite we want to use MySQL so
we're just going to paste this in and
what we do is we tell Django we're using
MySQL and then we give our database name
our database user name our host which
we're going to give as the IP address of
localhost and we know password so we're
going to save that and now if we run our
server as hit as we've 13 unapplied
migrations so what we're going to do is
we're going to type in Python
- our PI migrate and this is a feature
in Django and what it's going to do is
it's going to take all of our Django
models that's going to convert them into
tables
so we haven't created any models yet but
those are the default models and now if
i refresh you can see we have all these
tables and our database 9 so what we
want to do now is we want to create our
user model because to be able to add
users to our database we have to know
what a user looks like so what we're
going to do now is we're going to create
our user so to do that we're going to
scroll up to our installed apps and
we're going to add a new app called
entity pack and that's our app which is
this folder here which means inside this
folder now I can create a file called
models so in our models file we have to
import Django's models so we said from
Django DB import models that allows us
to use Django's models which we need to
do to be able to create our own and then
we want to create a class called user
and it's going to inherit from jangles
models model and this just means our
user object will have access to jangles
API so we can do things like database
access so a user is going to have a
username and email and a password so a
username is going to be equal to models
dot char field and it's another max
length of 20 characters that's of our
chart and MySQL and an email is going to
be the same model search our field max
length is going to be 140 this time and
proposed word we're just going to do a
char field again but it's going to be
equal to a max length of 100 that's
because when we hash our passwords we
want to have enough room to be able to
change our hashing function at some
point in the future so we're going to
have 100 characters even though we won't
necessarily need them straightaway so
now we want to do is you want to set
Python managed up I make migrations we
want to give it a name we're going to
call it in step X so you can see it
created the model user and then what
we're going to do is run Python managed
up high again and we're going to migrate
that and what that did was it created a
new database tables now we have in step
ik underscore user and
have these four fields so the next thing
we want to do is want to create our
login and our signup template so we're
going to create a directory called
templates and we're going to go back to
our settings file and were going to
scroll down to templates and we want to
stay in this ders part we want to say
the directory to login is that templates
folder we just created so here's the
design for our login page and our signup
page is pretty much the same so I'm
going to export this design and outside
of our templates folder I'm just going
to paste it out here so we have our
assets and we have all these files that
were created by the template so here are
all the files straight out of bootstrap
studio and what I'm going to do is paste
in these two more files in our templates
folder these two files have been
modified so that they'll work with
Django so here are the two slightly
modified files back within settings you
have to do one more thing to be able to
include things like CSS we just have to
modify this static URL property within
the settings file and this part down
here we have to add that in to tell
Django already at our static files from
so once we've done that we can go into
our template or we can use this load
static variable in our signup page on
our login page which will allow us to
load static assets in Django and to do
that we have a regular string that we
would have got from bootstrap studio but
we surround it in this variable what
we're saying we're loading a static
asset and we're telling it were these
static asset is and we have to do that
for all these static assets on our file
so we have to do that for the logo and
we have to do that for these JavaScript
files as well we have to do that on the
signup page too all of this will already
be done in the source code in the
description of the video so what we want
to do is create URLs because we were to
run django now it doesn't know about any
pages we have to go in to our urls file
and add a URL for our index page and the
URL for our signup page
so here we just created two empty
regular expressions this first one
matches the index page because we
haven't told it any particular page so
it's just gonna match the index page
this second regular expression we just
want to put in signup so Jaguar knows
when we go to our website forward slash
signup we want to load this view here
and then what we need to do obviously is
include our views file because at the
moment Jango doesn't know what view
indexes or views signup so we just want
to say from the current directory import
views and we haven't created views yet
so I'm going to right click in here and
I'm going to create a new file called
views and our views file is going to
look something like this so we have to
import this Django shortcut called
render and redirect redirect allows us
to redirect the user to a different page
and render is how we render a template
then we want to go to our models and
import our user model because we're
going to need that later
and we want to import everything from
our forms file which we haven't created
to a create that now because forms is
going to hold all of our validation so
we're just going to sort it's going to
leave a blank for now so we have our
sign up on our index and all they do is
to render these empty templates at the
moment so if I was to run this by going
to Python manager PI run server and
before we run that I just want to make
sure our assets are actually in a folder
called static because as we told Django
to login so now if I run it you can see
our in our login page works and displays
as we would expect and with by going to
slash signup we're matching a different
regular expression and now we're getting
our signup page so that's it for this
video don't forget to Like comment
favorite and subscribe don't forget to
follow us on Facebook Twitter and reddit
so in the next video we're going to be
implementing the logic that's going to
actually create user accounts and log
people in also don't forget to create
your upload care account to actually
build the follow along the series
there'll be a link to that in the
description along with the source code
of the video but that's it for this
video and I'll see you next time
