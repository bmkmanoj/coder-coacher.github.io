to find most of our tokens we have a
couple more left to do and then we're
actually able to run our laxer we've one
special token to create called T
underscore ignore in lowercase and that
just tells play anytime you see any of
the tokens in here just ignore them and
pretend they're not there so we're gonna
ignore spaces that means that when play
sees 1 + 2 it's the same as 1 space + 2
ply is gonna ignore all the spaces in
between the characters so you'll notice
that we don't have all of our tokens to
find we don't have int float or name
defined so we needed to create functions
for those because they're a bit more
complicated so we said Dafty underscore
and we pass it the variable T and we
create a string that's gonna be a
regular expression and that is going to
be / day + which just means any
characters whose length is more than one
so if we see one that's an integer if we
see one two three four five that's also
an integer it can be infinite length the
next thing we do is we convert the
tokens value from a string to an integer
this is because at the moment we have T
dot value which is part of the token
object and we need to convert that to an
integer so we say T dot value equals
integer T dot value then we return
t.t is our token objects we're just
getting the value attribute of the token
object and we're converting it to an
integer so that Python can actually
perform mathematical operations on it we
can add them subtract them stuff like
that and then we're returning it the
next thing we want to do is we want to
create our float so we said after
underscore float
we pass it the token object again we
create a regular expression string and
we say a float is equal to any integer
followed by a dot followed by an integer
of zero or more characters whoops of one
or more characters so essentially this
means if we say one dot one more one or
two that's a float if we see 1.45 that's
a float as well first can be of any
length either side of the decimal point
if we had have gone with the asterisks
instead of the plus that would have
meant one dot nothing would have been a
float we want to do one or more
characters in the left and followed by
one dot followed by one or more
characters in the right which means we
actually to put a plus in here so now we
need to say T dot value is equal to
float T our value to convert our token
value into the float and we return T
again finally we have one more to do
we've said def T underscore neom we
posit the token variable and we say our
it's a regular expression and we have to
specify what is allowed to be a variable
name so we're gonna use things called
character classes which are these square
brackets inside them what we do is we
say add is add and to Big Z or
underscore so at the moment this means a
variable name can be one character and
it can be any character edited lowercase
or any character and is that uppercase
or it can be an underscore but we want
more than one we want variables to be
more than one letter long so we're gonna
create another character class we're
going to say eddie's add lowercase well
we can say uppercase lowercase at is add
we're gonna like underscores and we're
gonna say note tonight
so this means the first character can't
be a number because we have a character
class which means this is the first
character and this is gonna be the
second character and any character after
that because what we're gonna do is
we're gonna put a star here the star
means zero more so we don't actually
have to have a second character we could
have a one character variable but wait
if we have more than one character the
first character has to be a dad
lowercase or uppercase or an underscore
and the second character can be any of
these that means the first character
can't be a number obviously because any
time we see a number or laxer thinks
it's an integer or a float so let's get
around up underneath here what we say is
T dot type is equal
to neum whoops and then we return t
finally we've one more function to make
this function is called t underscore
error when nor case and the reason for
this is if we have a fuy find out an
error when we're getting our tokens then
we want to run this function so we say
print and there you go
characters
and then we can say t dot laxer dot
don't skip and we pass that one so let's
just skips one token onwards then
finally we want to actually create our
lecture so we said laxer is equal to lag
start legs if up here we hadn't have
said import played alexis legs if we had
just left its import play bit of hard to
say lecture is equal to play lag start
legs so we just keep it simple we say
like stall X well save this I'll run it
and we get no I put that's ok because we
haven't actually provide it with any
input yeah so we need to provide our
legs with some input so we want to say
lecture dot input and we'll just pass it
a string say 1 plus 2 and then we'll
come down and we'll say a while tree and
we need to keep grabbing tokens will say
it took is equal to lecture dot token
and we'll say if not took break
otherwise print tok let's see the zest
work let's just run that and you can see
we got three tokens we get into plus and
int that's just a slightly more
complicated example and let's just say
ABC equals one two three
you see we got token which is a name a
variable name we get the equals
character and then we got another
integer which is 1 2 3 and we'll say a
dot 4 5 6 because 9 is a float let's
just see does that work
No we have an illegal character okay
that's the reason this is not worked is
because it's recognizing one two three
is an INT and four five six is an end /
then it's finding the dot and thinking
that's an illegal character effects that
we need to just kick our float we need
to put above our integer token so that
it locks four floats before it locks for
integers we're on this now you can see
we got named Abby's a is equal to flow
22 for dot four five six so that's our
legs are created and in the next video
what we'll be doing is creating our
parser so thanks for watching don't
