the design to the notifications page and
we're going to be tithing a few things
up because some people have been having
problems setting up the source code
getting it up and running and what's
special with this video is not just that
it's the last one of the social network
series it's the first ever 1080p high
code video so we were supposed to
incorporate the MVC stuff that we
learned in the MVC videos into this
series but what we're gonna do instead
is we're gonna do something that's
probably a lot more useful rather than
making your own MVC framework and then
sort of incorporating that into our
series we're gonna start learning things
like larva because that'll be a much
more useful skill to learn and it makes
our life easier because we don't have to
create the framework ourselves so let's
get started so we're going to go to
bootstrap studio when here is the design
limit for the notifications page it's
really simple so what we're gonna do is
we're gonna display the notifications in
sort of this table so you can see I have
one notification here and what we're
gonna do is we're just gonna display
them one below the other in a sort of
table which makes it really easy for us
to sort of convert between this non
designed version and this version here
that incorporates our header and our
footer and things like that and actually
fits in with the rest of our website so
we're gonna export this
those are designe exported so it's just
gone onto my desktop and here's our
notifications file here if I open that
up we can see here as the notifications
tablet so if I open that up in our taxed
editor you can see here is the template
and what we want to do is we want to
scroll down
to where we find this less group and we
want to put in the PHP code that
displays our notifications so what we're
going to do is just copy and PSL this
HTML into the notifications page so the
PHP is way above the HTML first we're
gonna just delete this heading close the
PHP block open a new one and we're gonna
copy all this PHP code and we're gonna
paste it in here so if I was to see of
this you'll see it's gonna look a bit
weird so if I go back to the
notification page and refresh we have
our design but our notification doesn't
really fit in with our table so what
we're going to do is we're just going to
copy one of these notifications and here
where it says this person mentions you
in a post
we're going to put in another echo and
we're gonna paste in that HTML and what
we're going to do is just simply copy
this and then between our span tags
we're going to paste it in there so of
course we have to append in our PHP like
that so now if I save this
you can see it says Francis mentioned
you in a post on our notification sort
of fits in with the rest of our design
so we're gonna do that down here as well
so we pasted that in there
and we're just gonna copy this and we're
gonna replace that with what's already
in our spawn tags
like that and again if we refresh we're
not going to see any difference sort of
it is just going to post something I'm
going to say out Francis hello world
post that
refresh now we have our second
notification and you can see the two
notifications tie in nicely together you
can see the rounded corners here and
here that's all bootstrap doing that for
us so that's our notification system
it's going to be really simple and
finally what we're going to do is go
into our SQL file we're going to scroll
down and you can see we have these
constraints a lot of people were having
trouble importing the database because
of the constraints so we're going to do
is just delete the constraints like that
that's all we have to do the constraints
gone no and you'll be able to import the
table
these you can always other constraints
again after you've imported the tables
we're going to keep scrolling down and
looking forward tables with constraints
apart from the primary key we can keep
that
I will delete the last one
so that's all the constraints deleted
now if we were to in
that would work fine it wouldn't have
any problems importing it and finally
one more thing to tidy up in the API you
can see I've already done it you can see
here when we're getting a post request
what we're doing is we're assigning the
token to the cookie to the value of the
session ID and if no cookie exists this
is going to return an error so what we
do is we just surround it and it is set
if statement so just to check if the
cookie has been set and if it hasn't we
just stop the execution of the script
every school dinah bet we have these
three ones here as well we check the
bodies and all the receivers and
although the user IDs no and if any of
those are no we either kill the script
or we just give body an empty value that
was causing errors whenever I imported
the source code so I just did that and
everything appeared to be working again
so that's it for this series so this
series we learnt quite a lot we did
everything from scratch we learned a lot
about security and things like that but
in future what we're gonna do is we're
gonna learn how to make our lives as
easy as possible so we're going to use
web frameworks like lair eval and django
that already have a lot of these
features built into them so that we
never even have to worry about them
because we should end up with a better
overall product and it should be easier
and quicker to create but that's it for
this series don't forget to Like comment
favorite and subscribe don't forget to
follow us on Facebook Twitter and reddit
the source code to all of this will be
on the github page that's it for this
video and I'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
