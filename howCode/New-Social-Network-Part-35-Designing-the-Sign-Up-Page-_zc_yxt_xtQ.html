up our login form to call our NPI unlock
the user in and we had lots of nice
features such as if we put in an invalid
password and click login it tells us and
we can respond to that and if we just
click on the button itself that gives us
a bit of feedback it tells us there was
something wrong so in this part what
we're gonna do is we're gonna give the
registration form this same treatment so
if I go to our registration form you can
see we have three fields here so what
I'll do is we'll go back to bootstraps
studio and we're gonna create the
registration form and the creators of
bootstrap studio have been kind enough
to give me two free licenses to give
away all you have to do to be in with
the chance of winning is subscribe to
the hi code YouTube channel follow hi
code on Facebook Twitter and reddit and
apply everyone's name who's a follower
and do a raffle and their winners name
will just be picked at random if you
subscribe to the YouTube channel follow
us on Facebook Twitter and reddit you've
got four chances to win so let's get
started with the registration form so if
we go to bootstrap studio here we have
our login form what I'm going to do is
create a new page this new page we're
going to rename it
to create account and then we're going
to drag in this login form again because
that's going to be our template and
we're going to look at our registration
form you can see we look for a username
a password on an email address so we
have a username a password an email
address so what we'll do is we will
scroll up on the HTML section you can
see it here there's our form group and
what we want to do is right click over
here we will duplicate that and now if
we just scroll this down you can see we
have three form fields we want our first
one to be our username so it's going to
be called username and it's kind of a
placeholder of username next we want to
change our login button from our login
button to firstly a button not a submit
button and then we want to change the
text on it and we can do that just by
double clicking and change it to create
a current and of course we can add any
sort of customizations we want we can
just scroll down here we can change the
color of oak and absolutely anything we
want to but we're going to keep the
default because the default actually
looks really good and what we're gonna
do is we're just going to delete that
link or we could just actually say I
already got an account click here
something like that so now what I'll do
since we have the preview on is we'll
just click on that I'll open it in the
browser so now we're previewing the
create account page we click on that
it's not going to refresh the page
because we changed it from a submit
button to just a regular button before
we can create the users account using
the API we need to modify the API to
include creating accounts so to do that
what we're going to do is let's go to
our API and when we go to do off when we
send a post request to earth we log the
user in so what we'll do when we send a
post request to users is we will create
the users account so we'll go to users
and the first thing we need to do is get
to the user name and the password and
the email just like this we got username
password and email so we'll just call
the sec or an email and it will get the
email failed we could do some checks to
check that all of these were supplied
but we're just going to assume they were
for simplicity because this isn't a
series about creating an API
specifically so we're just going to
assume these have all been filled in and
then we're going to do is we're going to
begin the process of creating the users
account so to do that we want to go to
the create account page it's pretty much
exactly the same
we've got our variables here we've got
our data and what we want to do is just
copy from this F statement all the way
down to here then we go to our API and
we will paste them in here so we'll
change it from DB query word query is a
static variable to DB query just like
this and we scroll down you can see
that's how we query it here because we
changed DB to an object in that series
and we're probably do it in this series
because that is a matter way to do
things
so we have our DB query here that's the
same or checks for username length
password and email length length of the
same we only need to change our queries
change this to DB query and as for
setting mail at the minute this won't
work so it affects it what we need to do
is go to classes go to our mail class
copy that paste it in our API class copy
PHP mailer and paste it in the API as
well and then know what we need to do is
just scroll up to the top of our API
require once the mail dot PHP and that
should work but before we task that what
we're gonna do is scroll down and here
when we act with success what we want to
do is return JSON so if we scroll down
here you can see that whenever our query
is successful we're echoing out some
JSON and when it's not successful we're
acting out some JSON and returning a
response code so what we're gonna do is
just copy this go back up to here and
when the user already exists what we're
gonna do is we're just gonna paste this
in here set error user exists and the
response code is going to be a 409
response code which means that there was
a conflict we're just going to delete
that we're going to copy this we're just
gonna keep passing it up here so we're
gonna change invalid username to invalid
username and we're going to return a 409
response code we could change the
response codes to be more specific so if
the username is invalid we could return
I different response codes but we're
just going to keep it simple we're just
gonna return 409 s for them all invalid
username exactly the same thing invalid
username I'm just gonna keep doing this
and then for success we're just going to
paste this in here we're going to return
a 200 response code and we're going to
say success and we could return
something like the user ID or we could
just say it user created now that we've
done that we want to go to bootstrap
studio and we have our registration form
what we're gonna do is just click on the
button go to animate and we're just
going to add the animation that we did
last time the shake one there are lots
of other animations we could use we
could use rubberband you can use
literally any one you want
but we're going to use Schick so what
we're gonna do is we're going to export
this again we're gonna click export it
says the design was exported you can see
now we have assets and we have our
create a current page so we're gonna
copy that we're gonna paste it in our
social network source code and we're
gonna open that up in Adam we're gonna
change this from login form to just
something like create account and what
we want to do is give all of our forms
IDs so it's going to be username we
change the type to text just like in the
last video the ID for email is just
gonna be email on the ID for password
it's just going to be password the
button will have an ID of CF or create
account and what we'll do is we'll
delete the animation the reason we added
it was because it inserted this line of
code here for us and that will allow us
to go back to the login page and we can
just copy and paste this code in here to
automate the button so what we'll do is
we will just copy this JavaScript code
and paste it in here and this JavaScript
code instead of going to off we want to
go to users and we're still sending JSON
and this time we're sending the username
the password on the email so we're just
gonna copy username and then we're going
to paste it in between username and
password and that's gonna be where we
put the email so we just pasted it in
there change this to email change this
to email and then here what I'm gonna do
is when I put in a comma so that should
be it when we get a success response
will log that to the console and we got
an hour we're gonna check the create a
card button so now we're just going to
run the help you can see here we're not
in the correct place we're using the
preview version that was created in
bootstrap studio what we want to do is
go to social network slash create
account dot HTML here we are on the
create account page what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna click create account nothing
happened because we didn't change the
click action from login to CF or create
account we were targeting the wrong
button
refresh go to network will click create
account and you can see the buttons
shook wait two seconds click it again
the button shook again and now we're
getting 409 responses which means we had
a conflict because that's what we
returned every time something went wrong
and you can see it says invalid username
you can see it says it as well as on
here so I'm gonna put in another user
name Francis McNamee 1 2 3 4 5 6 a
random email that doesn't exist on a
random password I'm not I'm gonna click
create
it says success user-created if I try to
create it again neither button shakes it
says user already exists so just like in
