learning how to create our own simple
Python currency converter so to convert
between currencies we need to know how
much currency egg converts in the
currency Bay and our data source for
this is fixer dot IO it's a foreign
exchange rates and currency conversion
API and if we click on this API here you
can see this is the data that it sends
back to us so we're going to be using
this data set to convert between our
base currency and our target currency
and here's an example of our program
running we're converting one euro into
one dollar one pint into one dollar one
Canadian dollar into a pound and one
Canadian dollar into a euro so let's get
started so the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to import our HTTP
library so in Python we're going to
import your Lib request and we're going
to import JSON then we're going to do is
we're going to create a class called
currency converter and using our
constructor we're going to download our
data set from the internet and we're
going to supply the URL of the data set
which in this case we're just going to
call it URL so what we need to do is say
our request is equal to URL Lib dot
request dot request we pass our URL and
then we're going to pass another
parameter called headers and we're going
to supply our user agent pie code
currency but we'll call it something
like that next what we're going to do is
we're going to download our data so
we're going to set data equals URL Lib
request dot open URL we pass in our
request and then we say dot read destroy
the data in a string in the data
variable then we're just going to
convert data to JSON by saying data
equals json dot loads and we're going to
pass our data variable in but we're
going to convert it from a byte string
to a utf-8 string like decoding it like
this and then up here we're going to
create a variable to store our wreathes
so we're just going to say Ritz is equal
to a dictionary and you can see here we
don't order a data set we want to go to
the Ritz section of it and then in there
we have all of our rates so I can simply
say self dot Ritz to reference this new
dictionary and I can set that equal to
data Ritz and that's all over it's
stored in our Ritz dictionary now we
only need one more function in this
function is just going to be called
convert and it's going to take a couple
of parameters it's going to take the
amount to convert it's going to take the
from currency and it's going to take the
to currency which means the cards that
were converting from in the currency
we're converting to so to convert from
one currency to the next we need to know
what our base currency is and on this FB
I the base currency is euros so that
means to convert anything into your
is easy but to convert anything from for
example US dollars to pounds when you'd
be converted to euros first and then
convert it from euros to pounds because
we have to go through the base currency
so we just want to say if from currency
doesn't equal euro then that means we
have to convert it to euros so to do
that what we have to do is say the
amount is equal to itself / South
Vietnam currency is so if we wanted to
convert ten pounds into ten dollars what
does will do is it will convert the ten
pounds into whatever number of euros
that is and that's what I might will be
equal to and then we can go down
underneath here and we can convert from
whatever number of Yoos that we get to
whatever currency you want to go to so
what we're going to do is we're going to
say if two currency equals rose so if
we're converting from something in zeros
since we've already converted it NGOs up
here we don't need to do it again so we
can just print it out so we can return
whatever the currency is I'll just leave
that blank for now otherwise we want to
convert it so we'll say else return
amount times South ribs to currency and
that will do the conversion for us but
we're just going to print it out a bit
better so we're going to create a
variable to store the initial amount
because you can see that if the initial
currency if the from currency isn't
euros it's going to convert it so we're
going to lose the initial amount so
we're going to store that international
amount we're just going to set that
equal to amount we're just going to
return initial amount and whatever they
from currency was then we'll just return
an equals and we'll say a mind to
currency this is just for formatting
purposes and then down here we can do
the same initial amount from currency
equals amount to currency we should
probably just return the actual amount
and then leave the formatting and things
to another function but for simplicity
I'm just going to put it into one
function and then down here what we can
do is we can say a converter equals a
new currency converter and the URL we
want to pass is API defector that is our
latest well what I've done is I've
created a local URL so we can actually
just put in H TDP hi code /e X and that
will download the latest version of the
effects or io API and then once again I
can just paste in my test cases here so
what we do is we just run converted or
convert ways past you might we want to
convert our from currency and our to
currency and before you run that which
is
well that's wrong at your lib this is
your L open not open your L know we run
that and you can see all of our test
cases work you can see if I type in one
year OH - one year starter we got one
point one for u.s. dollars for one euro
run that here you can see we get one
point one three five three but we run
that up with one point one four so
