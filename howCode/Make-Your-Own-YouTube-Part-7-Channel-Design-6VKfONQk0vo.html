like I said in the last video what we're
gonna be doing today is we are going to
be creating the user channel pages and
what that is is it's basically sort of
like a profile page for a channel and
how that differs from the profile page
for the user is the profile page for the
user just displays things about our user
but if we were creating a channel page
it would display things that are unique
to not channel not these or the created
it so that would mean things like
description of the channel the channel
name they have videos on the channel
things I got so it's kind of like a
profile page but it's for the channels
so what I've done here is I've just
opened a few pages I've not actually
done anything to them yet but I've
created one you want called channel dot
php' and as you can see it's blank
so once you create that page what we're
going to do is we're just going to add
some PHP to it so we're going to in
we're going to include we'll just copy
this actually will copy everything from
the profile page and just paste it
across and then we will change username
to channel I will say get see check
channel so I went to do is just change
these variables of it check all right
select all from channels where okay so
I'm gonna check that row by going to the
channels table in the database and as
you can see it says channel name and
then creative coat so I'm just gonna
copy that and change it to our channel
name equals channel and then we need to
change this to check channel then we
need to we can recount on row the same
we need to change this to channel as
well
we don't need too many rows we can
change first name to channel name and I
created by and then we just need one
more row for the idea that was created
on so they created equals yeah they
created row and here we can delete all
that change it to well what I want to do
on the ad okay whoops
right okay so I'm just gonna print out
the channel name then we're going to go
to the before that I'll go to the
members page I'm will just create a link
to it so I'm print channel name
alright it says our channel name here
what we're gonna do is we're just gonna
say create a link that says channel dot
PHP C equals channel name and then we
want to end that and then just in here
say view channel so now if we refresh
okay so here we have the a view channel
link so if we click on this takes us to
channel page P question mark C equals
creative code that displays creative
code but if I was to type in a channel
didn't exist so oops
if I have to put on them some random
characters here and hit enter now what
it does it just takes us back to the
home page and that is because here we
just say had a location in the next up
page P if the user doesn't exist so
later on in the series we will be
changing this to htaccess so like in the
last series it will be instead of using
this as the URL to the do I get to the
users Channel what we would do is we
would say slash Channel / creative code
something like that inside of channel
dot PHP C equals creative code so it
just means the euros would look a bit
nicer but for the moment things will do
because it doesn't actually affect the
functionality of the website so what
we're going to do is we're going to go
to the channel dot PHP page and we're
going to end the PHP code here and start
a new block for the moment I'm just
going to hold put up some placeholder
text and instead of the actual variables
just to keep it simpler but that's
because we're getting a design nice so
I'm going to create a div of class
channel options
alright channel channel just a channel
options and in here we'll just set a
task for nine then we're going to do is
we're going to open up the the CSS file
so if we're gonna go to the CSS folder
and obviously we don't want to look for
PHP files so we have a site style let
CSS fast we can just open that up and in
here we just have all the default styles
for our site the other folders were just
for the menu to make sure they work they
worked in most of the browser's or at
least a so it worked in all major ones
so what we're gonna do now is we're
going to say
channel options here we're going to set
a background color for now we could just
cccccc so what's a good light gray gets
at the width to 300 pixels we instead of
setting a my definite height we could
set a minimum height so we could say min
height is 500 pixels we could set border
1 pixel solid around the edge which
would probably be being a collar nine
nine nine nine nine nine
man okay so we're gonna copy the colors
of the welcome Dave so the background
color of the welcome dave was this which
is an even lighter gray and it was
cccccc
which was the border it's not if we go
onto our website we click refresh so
what we're gonna do now is we're
actually going to make it a little less
wide so tattoo - let me see - 30 pixels
we'll set the minimum height to 100% -
the height of the menu which is okay to
get that we need to open it up so I'll
do that now so I just checked the menu
so CSS file and it's 39 pixels high
without one pixels border so that's 40
so what this should do is it should make
this okay maybe not so to get the height
100% to work we need to set the body
height to 100%
and that might work doesn't mean that ok
we'll also need to go in here we just
need to say HTML height 100% okay I
don't know why that's not working but
anyway we can just move on without it
doesn't matter so what we'll do is we'll
just change that too and we'll change it
to just instead of midnight we'll just
say height 100% so what this does is it
as you can see fills the page then and
what that means is Vilas I know you'd
probably hard to say but if I well since
I maximize the window you can say the
money college but the man who fills up
the whole high of the page so along this
side is where we're gonna have most of
our content and we're actually gonna
make this 200 because 230 still a wee
bit too wide so we're going to change
that to 230 that actually watches up
nicely with this menu item so that
worked out quite well what we're gonna
do now is where is it here we're going
to change this to a header to tag that
just says for now I'll just said John
iam mom we'll change that to the name of
the channel so it says channel name I
know it's not the nicest thing to look
up but you can actually change it so in
the CSS here we will just say dot
channel options h2 we can set the color
so it's a little less dark so we could
change it to maybe 3 3 3 3 3 3 now we
could say text decoration
numb and text-align:center so what this
does is it makes little less dark
text-align:center text-decoration:none
underlying like that oh yeah it's a
broader bottom not on your line so that
we can instead of copy now we'll just
change this to border bottom none so
there we have it says channel name and
on here's what we're going to have the
channel image so sort of just an icon
for the channel
so that's image source equals the image
source is going to just go nowhere we're
going to set a height of 170 pixels and
a width of maybe 40 pixels so that's
obviously way too small I don't know why
it was such a small one we will change
this to 140 this to 140
we will also Center it so here we just
go to the same thing again dot channel
options image text-align:center okay we
just set hotting zero pixels from the
top auto from the right zero from the
bottom and auto from the left
what should a center our image okay
maybe not change it to margin actually
yeah I have no idea why some reason
doesn't want to work well handi enough
we can just use this just Cheeta leave
it because I can't be bothered trying to
figure out why dot CSS isn't working but
anyway the image is centered and
underneath we want some random text and
this is a channel I know child profile
page and we will just copy this so I
know what this mean what this looks like
is yeah okay we can put another
paragraph break in between there what
this means this is just how our profile
is going to look on this side we're
going to have our videos so what we're
gonna just want to create a new div and
the div class is gonna be channel video
container and in here we're going to
have an image source of again and
nothing from omics we've no videos on
the if the dimensions were concerned
about here so height when we 50 maybe in
the woods could be I don't know 90 what
this should do is that belt
yeah we need to I push it over a bit and
that's a bit small so we're gonna copy
that
on this we're gonna sell float:left so
what this will do is it shouldn't change
here but what it will do is a loss to do
that we're not having to change or make
a separate div for the image okay so you
can see here the image is pushed to the
right hand side of our sort of bio
section or whatever description section
and since we did float to the left it
just makes it way easier for designing
our channel but I was actually doing
this to show you that it doesn't push it
over here because that would make it
look really weird because it would be
out of line with the rest of the site so
it just keeps it in the correct place so
now what we need to do is chain alright
sorry we need to make this bigger so say
100 tall I'm 180 wide so there's a good
size for our images and we're gonna copy
this if we already go down here we're
just going to say that dot we're just
going to say that the moment we're just
going to be creating you Dave called
image venue Dave and what we're just
going to do say potting you know whoops
five pixels everywhere and what we're
going to do now is to keep things even
simpler we are going to create a div and
hold every image inside of the div and
the dev is going to called whatever we
call that image - whoops image video
Dave I think so saying I didn't do
anything
what's at the margin also 35 pixels okay
and nothing you okay that just pushed it
done from you know top if you saw the
man you so that's not what we want so so
I'd fix that I'm gonna stop being stupid
and trying to do things easier and then
actually making them harder so what I'm
actually going to undo what I did delete
this Dave
just an image and then Heaney in here
potting ten pixels and that pushes it in
ten pixels and then underneath we could
um so here
okay now we'll actually need that I was
gonna put a title underneath but we
could leave it so add that the videos
don't display titles and then here just
paste it down a few times and as you can
see this fills the page really nicely so
I actually think this channel looks this
channel design looks quite good except
we need to have fix that but we do that
in the next video so for the meantime
keep it looking like whoops keep it
looking good
I'm just delete that and okay we'll
leave
for now so that's it for this tutorial
in the next one we will be finishing
this channel design by finishing our
fixing that we're not really fixing it
but making that display a real profile
channel lien thing that will actually
display real things from the database or
in description and I'm not sure if I'll
get the images working yet because that
involves uploading them and things but
we will also be affecting this in the
next part as well so at thanks for
watching don't forget to comment like

you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
