basic you can see here there's a keyword
called input and what it does is it gets
input from the user and stores it in a
variable this is similar pythons import
function so we're going to be just using
a keyword for now because we're going to
be implementing functions later on after
we have things like control flow like if
statements and for loops and wire loops
and things like that implemented so the
way we're going to do this is actually
really simple we can use more features
from Python specific to Python yeah by
that by which I mean we can just use
pythons raw import function so we go to
our lexer and we have to add a new
keyword so when we do this I'm just
going to remove the return tokens and
replace it with a return nothing and
then we're going to print the tokens to
make sure that it's being add that the
lecture is working correctly
so we're just going to copy this and
paste it down here all we have to change
is this two input and this two input I
mean we could just you know
automatically lure everything to
lowercase but I'm just going to leave
like this for now and we're going to say
input here so now if I run this actually
before I do that I have to actually use
the function so I'm gonna say this is
the a syntax it's gonna say input and
then we're going to provide it like a
string so if we wanted to say enter your
name
we would just say that and now we would
provide it a variable so whoops colored
need so we provide a variable after that
and that's how you're going to store it
so this isn't a function it's a keyword
we're gonna be doing functions later on
so this is the syntax and if I run this
we just get input so we're having a okay
slight problem so the reason we're only
getting the words input is because we're
having a problem here with a toque so
what we need to do is just say or toque
equals space-car space and then the end
quote so this is this means in a string
if the string and if they say F the last
character before the end of strings of
space and I'm ignore it so now if we
load this you can see we got input
string an to your name and then Varni so
as you can see it's not working that was
actually a bug with not just the input
also the print so if I used a print it
would also have that same bug so now
that we know our Lacs is working what
we're going to do is we're going to
whoops
turn the tokens and then in the parser
we're going to actually make it work so
if we go into the parser we can whoops
go in here we'll say I live and what
we're gonna say is toks I actually can
say just oaks i plus space plus 2 I plus
1 and I actually come down here and just
show you the syntax so this is going to
say input that we want to assess rain :
and then something anyway we'll just
leave it like that because it give me
any string and then we want and var :
with our very little something so that's
the syntax we want so this is the input
this is the space this is the string and
this is the last space and then this is
the variable so tokes I plus 2 and we're
going to say equals input string bizarre
so now if we go down here and action
before we do that we want to just to get
the first six characters in the string
again on the first three of the VAR so
and not two three and then in here what
we want to do get input because we're
getting we're retrieving import we're
adding input will not actually am i
signing anything or printing anything so
we're gonna say get input and we're just
gonna pass it the variable name so this
case it's gonna in this case it's gonna
be toks
I plus two cold on 4 or I plus two and
then we wanna just take that and put
that there
we want to start in the fourth character
and move on from there so we're just
passing with the variable value which is
the value you want to store the input in
actually want to get the string as well
so we'll take two parameters and the
string is just gonna give us a note
Alice what input to give to the user so
what we're going to do now is now we've
got the
get him pop what we're gonna do is get
rid of that comment we're gonna go up
here we're gonna say def get input and
here we're gonna say string and the
second parameter is the variable yes
we'll set volume so what we'll say is
set a equals raw underscore input and
then we'll say a string so this will
just print our print our string right
and store what we enter in the VAT in
the variable I then what we'll say is
symbols
ivar mean equals permit for the minute
we're just going to swim into strings
will say string and then we'll say plus
I so that should be all we need to do
that should be all we need to do so
we're just going to run this now okay
right but is not to find that's a Python
to function so I'll just change its
input and hit enter so now you can see
it says ante omnium so I'll say if
Francis and hit enter okay
all right we have a slight problem
doesn't seem just gonna keep asking us
for stuff so what we want to do is you
want to actually start in the seventh
character to get rid of the first codon
because I shouldn't see those codon at
the beginning of our list so we will not
now and we said it says add your name
cell says Francis I'm hit enter and it
still keeps asking us to enter our name
singer status because we need to
actually move on to the next token so
it's the I plus equals three because
we're dealing with three tokens so if I
run this and I said engineer in Francis
you can see the program exits because
all we're doing is getting me important
storing it in the variable name then
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set print
and then I should print what we enter so
I said Francis my clean okay it prints
it but it misses off the first character
so let's fix that now so the reason it's
cutting off here as you can see is
actually because we left out the quote
to run the string because as you can see
it is actually storing it correctly so
if we go up here and we just put a quote
around there
oops another one there and we put
another quote here and that should fix
our problem so if we run this again you
can see it Prince Francis so what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna say string
and I'm gonna say 1 minus 1 and this
should get rid of the two colons by the
two quotes or the string so I can see it
got rid of them and if we hit on our we
type our knee and or anything so I'll
say hard code as you can see it gets
stored in the variable and printed out
the knee
and we'll also do is I'll just for
aesthetics put in space so we run this
again now it says and rhenium we have a
space between the input text and the
cursor so if I said Francis I'm not
gonna main as you can see it prints it
out so that's it for this video don't
