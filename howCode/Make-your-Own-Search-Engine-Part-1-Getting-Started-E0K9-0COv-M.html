be doing is we're going to be creating a
really simple search engine
we're firstly going to be inserting all
the websites that we get from our
crawler in the previous series into a
database and then we're going to be
doing is searching through that database
to present you with the results I have
here so this search engines can be
pretty basic it's not going to have
pagination and it's not gonna be the
most accurate search engine ever that's
because there be another series for a
more advanced search engine for anyone
who wants to learn how to do that but
this search engine will be useful for
something like a custom site search for
your own website so you can see here I
have a query that says Q equals and I
can put in whatever I want I can say hi
code you can see it says 62 results find
and it's got all the results for the how
cool YouTube channel it's got different
YouTube videos it's got a link for the
hi code a URL shortener and if I pass in
a query say black query you can see we
get every result in the database these
are just Wikipedia articles I've got
some other websites with it like Google
YouTube at places like that so I think
this gives you an overview that you can
see sometimes we don't have a
description there's no description
available but we have the title and the
URL other times if I scroll down to the
bottom we start getting a lot more
descriptions you can see here Microsoft
provides descriptions and YouTube
provides descriptions for whatever
videos you're watching so I think you've
seen how it works so let's get started
actually building our search engine so
our search engine is two pages there's
the index page which is going to be our
web crawler and there's a search page
which is our results page we could move
this to another page call it crawler or
something and then have a home page like
Google does on their index page but
that's something you can do if you're
going to put this on your website
yourself so this is the exact source
code off the high code github that page
this is all the source code it's all
commented and we're going to be
modifying the web crawler slightly to
insert the links at finds into our SQL
database instead of putting them to a
file so the very first thing we have to
do is create a database so we have
someone actually store the website
results that we get from the crawler so
if you're using your local computer you
probably have access to PHP myadmin if
you're using something like xampp or
lamb or something like that and what
we're going to do is create our database
you can do it with pure SQL yourself or
we're going to use phpMyAdmin because
it's easier
so the first thing we have to do is
collect databases and we're going to
create a database we're going to call it
poly search what I'm going to do is just
click create
so our database has just been created
and here it is over here now we need to
create a table we're going to create a
table and we're going to call it index
and that's going to be an index of all
of the pages we have and the reason
we're going to call the index is because
when a search engine crawls the internet
it stores all of its pages in something
called an index so it seems fitting to
call our table index so we're going to
create six columns for our table so the
first column name is going to be ID it's
going to be a unique number that
identifies every single individual
result in the database we need to change
the index and set it to primary which
means every single ID is going to be
unique and if you see this box here it
says a underscore I that stands for auto
increment and that means that every time
we add a new row its ID will increment
by one so we're going to take that and
we're going to create another column
call it title it's going to be a
varchar' and we'll set it to a length of
like 200 you can specify this as
whatever length you want you might want
a shorter length or a longer length just
make sure if you set the tight length to
something short that you deal with a
property so that the titles aren't just
cut off whenever your database runs out
of characters for them to store in the
title the next one we're going to store
is description if the website has one
it's going to be a bar chart and we're
going to say that's equal to 200 as well
we're going to create another one call
it keywords this one's going to be text
and that's going to store all of our
keywords we're not going to specify a
length for it
the next one we're going to store is URL
and this one's also going to be text so
that we can accommodate long URLs
finally we're going to create another
column called URL underscore hash and
this is going to be a unique number that
is the md5 hash of every single URL and
this will mean we won't be inserting
duplicate URLs into the database so
we're going to create another varchar'
and we're going to set this lengthy with
a 32 because it's going
95 hash normally people say not to use
md5 but normally they just may not just
use md5 for password hashing things like
that we're just using it to make sure
that we don't insert duplicate URLs into
our database and we're going to click
Save
so we've done this video is go over
everything that we're going to be going
through in this series and we've created
our index and in the next video we'll be
modifying our crawler to insert its
results into our database and then after
that we'll be actually creating the
search engine so thanks for watching
