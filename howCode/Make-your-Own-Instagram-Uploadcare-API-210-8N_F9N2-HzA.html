can do is click on image operations and
we can see the sorts of things that we
can do with it so you can see we can
adjust the quality of an image we can
adjust how it loads we can resize images
crop images all sorts of things and
9-year we get into the effects we can
enhance the image so that if it's a dark
image we can make the colors brighter to
make it easier to look at we can sharpen
images but our images greyscale invert
autoroute images so if we take a photo
and it's rotated the wrong way upload
car is able to fix that we can rotate it
ourselves we can flip the image which
flips it upside down and we can mirror
it which just flips it horizontally and
we can put watermarks on images and this
one is quite useful we can determine the
main colors of an image and in fact
insta pick does that so if I go to insta
pick and I click on my profile you can
see it doesn't take that long to load
because we're using caching so if I
click inspect element I go to network
and I turn off cache now if i refresh
you see it takes longer to load but if
we look at the photos you can see now
they have these backgrounds and those
background colors are determined using
upload car to determine the main color
of the image and we'll use that as a
background color whenever the image is
loading so if I just do that one more
time you can see that all the images are
loading we have the main color of the
image behind it so we're going to take a
look at the upload care API so back on
the photo feed you can see here all of
the photos on my fade so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to drag this photo
into the address bar and you can see we
have one effect and it's to reduce the
quality to make the image load quicker
but because you can see we're only
showing the images at a small size on
the screen so we don't want to waste
bandwidth and take too long to load the
image so we reduce the quality but if I
want to get just to the base image I can
delete that another scimitar is no
effect on at all and you can see it's
much much clearer so because of the way
up load curve works when we build our
project we don't actually have to work
out anything whenever we are applying
effect goes to an apply and effect is
really easy if I look at an example of
fact let's say for example I want to
make the image grand scale all I have to
do is go to the image put a minus sign
after the name of it and then I say
grass give and I hit enter and now a
blue car has on the fly converted our
image to grayscale so inside in step X
all I have to do is change the URL that
I'm looking at so this is the URL we're
talking out here this is the same photo
this is the same photo with that filter
applied if I just drag this into the
address bar you can see here are all
these filters that we've applied so all
I have to do is delete all these filters
and you can see we get the original
image again but it's
extremely easy for us to fly effect
because we don't actually have to touch
the original image always to do is
change the source that we're looking at
it through so all we have to do when we
apply an effect is add the effect onto
the end of the URL in the source
attribute and the image will
automatically be updated the same goes
for invert I can say invert inverts the
image now you can see it's been
completely inverted so let's say after
inverting it I want to flip it as well
so all I have to do is say - flip just
like this hit enter now it's been
flipped and it's been inverted
so say I want to find the main colors in
this image I would expect some blues and
some white so to do that what I do is
just say - preview because I want to
preview the image and then I set the
main colors is the end point I want to
access and I want to retrieve two or
three main colors so I'll put in a three
so that I want to achieve the three main
colors in this image I hit enter we get
JSON back and these are four main colors
in the image we always have one main
color and then we chose to have three
additional main colors and what these
are are these are the individual RGB
pixel values so you can see I just
copied this color i pasted it in here
and you can see this is the color google
chrome thinks it is so we've got our
main color of in between blue and white
which can be useful for more loading an
image so to actually upload images to
upload curve what we want to do is we
want to use narrow widgets so whenever
we upload an image to in step X when you
drag an image in you're actually using
upload curves upload widget which makes
it really easy to upload photos because
they take care of everything so here is
their upload widget so to install the
widget onto our page so to put the
widget on our page all we have to do is
include some JavaScript under upload
care public key so the public key we get
from our API keys section here's our
public key this is the key we put on our
page and then this is our secret key but
we're not going to show that at the
minute so I'm going to create a basic
HTML page with the upload car upload
widget just to show how easy it is to
add it to a page you could use it for
anything whether you're creating an
Instagram clone or not but this is quite
useful to learn so we're going to create
a widget so to create the widget all we
have to do is copy this script tag
existed in there we don't even need a
valid HTML page we want to copy this
script tag we want to copy this script
tag and pasted here we want to change
that to our public key so we're just
going to go back to upload car double
click that get our public key paste that
in there and we have one more thing to
do so the weather widget works is it
will replace an element on a page it
will replace an input element in a form
so if I just copy this input type and I
paste it on a page above our JavaScript
and save that now you can see I've
opened this page up and we have a
file dialogue so if I click on that I
can drag in a file I'm just going to
drag this picture of clouds in and it's
going to upload that my upload camera
kind so if I click on this now there is
our photo and now if I go to our upload
Kara kind and click over view you'd see
I have one file stored click on the
files tab and there we have the file I
just uploaded I didn't have to do any
programming all I had to do was create a
really simple HTML page and this is one
of the reasons why I wanted to use
upload car for this series because it
makes photo effects extremely easy which
is really useful when you're creating an
Instagram phone as you can see and as
little as about three lines of code we
can have a file uploader on any page
that we want and we can also customize
it on insta pic the uploader is purple
so if I drag this in one more time you
can see the uploader is purple on insta
pick because purpley blue is the sort of
color scheme that I was going for so
