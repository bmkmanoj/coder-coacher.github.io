is we're gonna be doing the updating
automatically of our script so that's
actually extremely easy to do all we do
is we go back down to the bottom and we
use JavaScript special JavaScript
function called set interval so we just
say a set interval and we provide it
with an anonymous function
and then we printed with
primer which is leader the how many how
long the interval you want it to be so
my case it's 2.5 seconds which is 2500
milliseconds and what we're going to do
is pass the update function in here and
that should be it so if I load this
and refresh I'm going to open a new
window so Safari so here I have Safari
open I'm going to send a message what we
should get is the Google Chrome window
should update after - after a maximum of
two and a half seconds so let's say hope
you enjoyed the video the message has
been sent as you can see it showed up
here on the Google Chrome side and it
has also showed up on the Safari side so
that's it for this series you can see
that average and a half seconds were
sending a request you can see the
network having enough seconds we're
getting a request
so that is it in action so that's it for
this video don't forget to Like comment
favorite and subscribe and also you can
get the code on github before I forget
so the way you get the code is you go to
github.com slash hi code org you click
on messenger and here's all the code
from the whole series here it is here
you just click download zip and you have
the source code downloaded so that's it
for this video that's it this whole
series in fact I hope you enjoyed it
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
