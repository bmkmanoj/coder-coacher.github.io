remix of the how to make your own social
network series so today we're going to
be doing is we're going to be designing
the homepage so to design the homepage
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a table we're going to go down
here we're going to create a table and
we're going to give it a row pharming
Taylor rows within those team of lows
we're going to give it a table detail
which is just the basic layout of our
table so we're going to do up here is
going to set the width equal to 60
percent how am I going to go down here
we're going to create another table
whoops another table detail and we'll
obviously set the weight to 40 percent
then we're going to size be aligned I'm
going to set it equal to the top and
we're seve aligned we will top as well
in here what we're going to do is going
to create a header to tag and we're
going to say join find friends today and
then what we're going to say is we're
going to say good Miller h2 tag and
we'll say sign up below so let's refresh
the page so this is what we get now when
we refresh the page so that's just get
rid of that change that for an
exclamation mark and refresh again so
what we're going to do here is want to
create a form whoops just it this way so
it's quicker now we're going to set
we're gonna set the four
action equal to that just nothing my
method we're going to set equal to post
because we want to send data to the
server and that's it for the forum then
we want to create an input type of text
and we're going to give an Ian of
afternoon for first name we're going to
give the size of 25 on a placeholder
I'm word we're going to set equal to
first name
so let's refresh the page there's our
text box we can type in it Island a
placeholder stays and then go-to when we
type
so what we're going to do
just going to copy this here sir down a
couple of times that's probably too many
this is piece that many times probably
okay we're going to change this to last
name this to username this one to email
email to password password to and will
create one more input type which will
set equal to submit give it a name of
submit I'm gonna give it a value of sign
up so there we go there's our sort of
signup form and our placeholders all the
same so we need to change that but we
also need to add a paragraph tag at the
end of each of these to make sure that
there's a sort of space between the
bottom of each of them so let's refresh
the page now there's all our signup
fields maybe we could put another
paragraph tag see oh it locked in the
first one okay look any different so
let's just change these to break tags to
break tags should give us my sufficient
amount of space between each one and
then let's refresh and there we go we've
got my somewhere space between each of
the different fields we're going to say
a last name for this placeholder
username for this one let's just make it
all one word email I'm saying the
address email address repeat or we'll
just say again password say password
actually an N password again there we go
now we've got all our placeholders in
place now we're going to went to our
style sheet and we're going to just
create a new a new element our mean mu
staff her the h2 element I'm going to
set the font family equal to arial
helvetica sans-serif called size equal
to 18 pixels oops
potting equal to 8 pixels on color equal
to 0 0 8 4 c6 is the color values so
let's refresh the page now and as you
can see now our here's two elements look
slightly different and now we're going
to do is run a target to the input type
of text so with the input type equals
text which means it will get all of the
input all of the text elements on the
page we're going to set the background
color equal to white set the border to 1
pixel solid almost at the border a to a
color of e - e - oops
e - where is the file
sighs equal to 15 pixels we'll set the
padding equal to five pixels I will set
the width equal to 300 pixels the margin
at bottom equal to 300 pick our three
pixels I mean a margin top people the
three pixels as well and we're going to
say outline:none which means this means
that when we click on it it will go
armed so as you can see here if I click
on it it goes orange but it won't do
that if I tell it to get rid of the
outline doesn't see now there's no white
line on the text fees so now what we're
going to do is we're going to go back in
here we're going to say input type input
type text however so this means when you
wave your mouse over the text elements
we want to set the background color so
you see a black army need border color
the border color is going to be 0 0 6 FC
4 whoops let's refresh the page and as
you can see neither border color goes
blue when we wave our mouse over it but
as you can see what we did was we sort
of messed up the text box 9 so what
we're going to do is we're going to go
up here to our search box
and we're going to set the padding top -
let's see what we added once I see the
padding we used the tax box we use
margin top three margin bottom three so
we need to whoops out three more pixels
on each of these two margin top or
padding tabs give me nine and bottom is
going to be nine as well whoops okay
that's actually just out of margin of
zero and as you can see now everything
fixed and it's gone away so at what we
also want to do is we want to Center
this sort of this table so let's just
include in this div let's close the div
off below the table and whoops it's not
right let's actually just create another
div and go below the table close div off
um we'll say class let's see words
wrapper id equals Robert we're going to
use we're going to say class equals
wrapper as well actually I D equals
wrapper uh okay that didn't work so
let's actually undo that let's redo this
we will set the style equal to width
1000 pixels margin zero pixels Auto zero
pixels Auto which should a center our
div and as you can see it actually did
Sandra it here for some reason this
one's a little short so let's just come
in here we'll say style Eagles
background color I will set the
background color to something like black
so we can see how we're watching the
page that it starts and ends so here we
go here's the
with the table which isn't quite right
okay we only set the width to 100 pixels
that's why so we set it to a thousand
pixels and that should have fixed it up
okay let's just change make it easy on
ourselves instead of equal to like 800
not a standard are our page so now we're
going to do is we're going to set the
input type of submit we're going to set
our mean we're going to set some styles
for the input type of submit so what we
need is we set a background color 0 0 is
6 FC for border 1 pixel solid and we're
going to set that equal to 0 0 5 0 8 and
B now we're going to set the font size
equal to 15 pixels the color equal to
white the pot
25 pixels at the margin autumn equal to
3 pixels and margin-top whoops
it's going to be equal to 3 pixels also
on border radius is going to be 7 pixels
