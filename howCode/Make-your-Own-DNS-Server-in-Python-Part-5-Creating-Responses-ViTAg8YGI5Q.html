created a really simple UDP server and
in this part we're gonna start building
the requests that we're going to send
back to answer every DNS query so we
need to go into our text editor and
instead of just printing the data out we
want to send data back so Python has a
really simple function designed just for
this and the way we use it is we say
sock dots and - and we pass the two
parameters the first one is the data we
want to send back and the second one is
the address so the first one we're gonna
say hello world and the address is just
gonna be a DTR because we want to send
data back to the address of the computer
that sent us the request and send -
doesn't take regular strings it takes a
string of bytes so we need to put a B in
front of that so let's just run this so
we're gonna hit enter there we're gonna
run the server and now we're gonna send
a request using dig so we're just gonna
run that and you can see we've got an
error in dig dig returned an error
because the response we sent back isn't
what it expected because we didn't
actually send a real DNS response back
we just sent back the data the dig sent
to us and this is our server so it just
closed out as well and we're gonna go to
Wireshark and see the data that we sat
back so here is a Wireshark I'm just
going to filter it to the DNS server and
this is the request we sent from dig
this is the request we sent back and as
you can see it says malformed packet
because what we sent back wasn't a valid
DNS response but if we look down here
you can see it says hello world that is
the exact data that we sent back so know
that were able to send data back from
the server to the client we need to
start building the DNS response that
we're gonna stand back so instead of
sending back hello world we want to
stand back our DNS response so I'm just
going to create a variable called R and
we're gonna send our back to the client
and R is going to be our DNS response R
is going to be equal to the output of
our build response function
and build response is going to take data
as a parameter because in your DNS
response you have to retrieve some of
the information from the request such as
the transaction ID and things like that
so we need a pass data to our build
response functions who build response
can read the original request and
extract information like the transaction
ID and things like it out so we're gonna
go up here we're gonna create our method
we're gonna say def build response pass
it data and if we go back to Wireshark
we can see here that in our original
request so the start of our DNS query is
the transaction ID and we can check that
if we just click here you can see this
whole blue section down here is the DNS
query and if we collect on the
transaction ID the first two bytes are
the transaction ID so now that we know
that we can go back to our build
response method and we can say a
transaction ID is equal to data and this
data variable is a string of bytes so we
can access a subset of that string of
bytes using the normal ways you expect
in Python in this case to get the first
two bytes we can say 0 - 2 which means
get the bite of a 0 with index and the
bite of the first index we can also make
it even shorter and we can just get rid
of the 0 and say a couple on to you to
get the first two bytes what that lives
on is it will have gotten these first
two bytes be 5 6 9 and those are the
first two bytes of the DNS Hatter and
those are the two bytes that we need to
get from the actual query because we
need to send them back in the response
so now I'm just going to try and print
out the transaction ID so that what we
do that is just set print transaction ID
run the DNS server again and send the
request again close up because obviously
there's not going to be a response to
Daigle just keep trying to Sandy and ask
requests and we got an error because
essentially what happened was we tried
to assign the return value of build
response to the variable R so
essentially what that did was give R the
value of none and then essentially we're
trying to send on over this and two
method and that method expects a string
of bytes we can see if we go above the
error it says we got a string that says
0 3 and that means we have 2 bytes but
the terminal has tried to convert those
two bytes into action
characters try to convert them to ASCII
characters and that's why we got 0-3
there are actually two individual bytes
we can actually see the individual bytes
themselves if we say four byte in
transaction ID print byte
run this again and you see we got the
integer values of the two bytes if I
convert these bytes into hexadecimal
numbers run it one more time you can see
we got the hexadecimal number ayyyy and
then we got 63 if I go back to Wireshark
you can see here the transaction had it
that was set the most recent one is AE
63 so essentially what we've done is
grab the first two bytes out of the
request and we have Gotham dial we can
use them in our response so what we need
to do is we need to create a variable
called tid which is short for
transaction ID and that's just a regular
string and in here what we want to do is
we want to say t ID plus equals and we
want to pan the bait on you can see if
we print this now
you can see we got oh x3 B and 3b is the
first byte at OE x 82 and 82 is the
second byte we need to remove the O act
at the start first we can remove the
surrounding parentheses and then we're
just going to simply say start on the
second index and go until the end of the
string so it's just essentially getting
rid of the first two characters we run
this one more time and we have our bites
we have 49 and then we have 11 and
they're two separate bites and that is a
transaction ID if we go back to
Wireshark you can see the next part of
the query is the flags here are the
flags here and we need to set these in
our response so to do that what we're
going to do is we're going to just
instead of printing tid we're going to
go down here after we have the
transaction ID just create a comment we
have the transaction ID don't here we
want to get the flags and here we'll say
Flags is equal to get flags and we'll
say data we will pass it data then we
will start on the second index and go to
the fourth index the reason for that is
because if we go back to Wireshark we
can see that when we click on Flags
there are two bytes highlighted and
those are bytes three and four and those
will be indexed as bytes two and three
because strings and arrays and
everything allowed in Python starts from
0 so essentially what we're doing is
we're passing the third and the fourth
bite to the get flags method so that's
it for this video don't forget to Like

see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
