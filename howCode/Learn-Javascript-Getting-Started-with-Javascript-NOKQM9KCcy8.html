what I'm gonna be doing is starting a
new series called learn JavaScript and
for those of you that don't know what
JavaScript is it's just a programming
language that is run inside of a web
browser normally that is used to make
the web's used to make websites more
interactive and well for example it you
could use javascript to submit a form
without refreshing the page or you could
use JavaScript to I don't make a menu
that was that I'd fading animations and
things like that or you could use
JavaScript to do basically anything on a
webpage that looks cool you could even
use JavaScript with other languages like
HTML to make things like a video player
so you could customize HTML using
JavaScript and JavaScript just makes it
a lot easier to do interactive things
and make websites more interesting in
the phone so that's what I'm going to be
teaching you and as you can see normally
I use index dot PHP for my values but to
keep things simple I'm just gonna be
using H dot H or index dot HTML because
we're not using PHP in these videos
we're just using HTML and JavaScript and
the HTML is just to show you a basic
structure of web page the main focus is
obviously JavaScript so I'm going to do
is we're just going to create a basic
HTML web page or html5 web page whoops
so I'm just going to do it as quickly as
I can then I give it a title as well
okay so there's our basic web page and
if we refresh the page we can just say
it's a blank page with the title and
says learn JavaScript so the first thing
we're going to do is we're going to I'm
going to show you why it's about
JavaScript on a web page so normally you
put JavaScript in the head section of a
web page and you don't just start
writing it like that whoops
you don't just start writing it like
this and then just start writing
JavaScript you have to surround it in
special tags called script tags and or
you can include it in a separate file
called a JavaScript file but for this
video I'm just going to use the script
tags so the first thing we do is we
create a script tag and then we close
the script tag off and then what we do
is we say type equals text slash
JavaScript and that's it now we're ready
to start writing JavaScript and some
browsers as you might know old browsers
don't support JavaScript and some people
have it turned off so if you want to
only want your JavaScript code to add
turn up whatever the person's javascript
is on it's a good idea to do this to
surround it in HTML comment this way
only browsers that can actually
understand JavaScript will run it so I'm
just gonna write a hello world up to the
screen because that's generally what
people do and they start along and your
programming language so in things like
Python you can just write print whoops
print hello world in PHP you could write
that with a semicolon but in JavaScript
is a little bit different and I'm just
gonna undo these HTML comments just to
make it a bit easier to read so in
JavaScript all you have to do is write
document dot so document dot write and
this is a function where within the
document so you if you want to target
something in the document itself you
write document dot and then you tell it
what you want to do so in this case I
want to write some text out so I use
right or the right function and I'm just
going to write how to world and as you
can see
we've had a world I put into the screen
and now you'll also notice that all your
JavaScript code that you write is
visible in the source code of a web page
because it's it's executed on the
client-side it's not actually executed
on the server that's why you can turn
off JavaScript so what I'm going to show
you now is what it looks like when you
have JavaScript turned off so I just
turned JavaScript off and I'm going to
refresh the page and as you can see
nothing shows up because this is a
modern browser but in other browsers
what could happen is it would execute it
would just display all this text so what
we want to do is we just want to
surround these are.this in the HTML tags
as I said earlier and just to make sure
that in case the person is using an
older browser because as you can see now
I am using an up-to-date version of
Chrome so see I'm using chrome 27 or
whatever so that's why it displays our
dozens by the JavaScript code so the
next thing we want to do is I'm going to
show you how to include JavaScript from
an external file so what we're gonna do
is we're just going to say script we're
gonna use our script tags again and
we're gonna close them off and then what
we're gonna do is we're going to say
hitch RAF now we're just gonna say my
file is for JavaScript and we also have
to said type equals text slash
JavaScript so now we're going to create
that javascript file and I'm just going
to save it as a JavaScript files from my
file KS and here what I'm going to do is
I'm just gonna write document dot write
this is some some JavaScript code
running from external file
I know if we refresh the page whoops oh
I forgot to turn javascript back on so
didn't I so as you can see now if i
refresh okay we have a problem um okay I
need to change out the source so if we
refresh now we should whoops
noise from another video we should just
get ACTU Aqueduct the JavaScript code is
running from an external file and that's
exactly what we put in the external
javascript file so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to just do some simple
things with variables so what we're
gonna do is we're just going to create a
variable called my variable and the way
you create a variable in JavaScript is
really simple you just type the word var
then you give your variable in the end
which in my case is my variable then I
started equal to what I wanted to equal
so I just said test then if I want to
write that variable out I would just
said document dot write actually these
so what I would just write as a my
variable then I would save the file and
now I'm gonna go to my browser I'm gonna
refresh and as you can see we got a code
our test so that's it for this video
