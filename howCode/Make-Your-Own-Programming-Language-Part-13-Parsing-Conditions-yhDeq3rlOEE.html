able to tokenize this string here we
were able to recognize and if the NF
keyword the then keyword and the F
keyword and then the F condition in here
so what we're gonna be doing in this
video is we're gonna be setting up our
parser so that our parser could actually
parse this because at the moment all
we're doing is generating a string of
tokens as you can see here but right now
since all were doing is tokenizing the
string we're not actually executing any
of the tokens using the parser it
doesn't actually do anything so the
first thing I need to do is I need to
comment this return art that we aren't
returning nothing from the Mac sir then
I want to just I can leave the print
tokens in I want to return the actual
tokens themselves that whether we pass
to the parser and the parser will
actually of the parse the tokens so what
we're gonna do now is we're going to
come down here to the bottom we're just
gonna copy and paste this and we're
going to change this so it's gonna say
if we're actually looking our tokens
first so here we have if and then we
have our condition then we have advanced
diamond and a print that a string that
an and if so we need to be able to
recognize this whole string our list
whole set of tokens so we're gonna do
that is we're going to first look for
the if keyword so the first thing we're
gonna put in here is if then we're gonna
have our condition so let's go up here
it's what we could do is we could take
these three tokens and merge them
together and call it condition but what
we're going to actually do is just leave
it the way it is at the moment
to keep things as simpler so what we're
gonna do is we're safe and then we'll
send num equals equals num then so we're
gonna have five tokens here so we need
to say we need to get the first token
then we have the second one and the
second one is just numb so then would
let's go back to terminal so you can see
the first three characters is actually
the identifier of the token then we have
a colon that I won so we only want to
get the first three characters because
we're only identifying what type of
token it is at the beginning so what we
want to do is we want to get the first
three characters then for the equals
operator
if we go here you can see that there's
no coal on because there's no data
attached to the equals operator there's
only the actual name of the operator
itself so what we need to do is go back
to our tax setter so we can get rid of
this because we're not looking for the
first four characters of this token
because this is all this token is so we
can just get the whole token itself and
we're going to copy and paste this we
want to get the next number which means
we have to get the first three
characters again so we're going to go to
zero to three and then we want to get
the last cut token which is the van
token now we need to increment this by
one increment this by one as well and
then the last one since it's a bad token
as you can see there's no doubt attached
to the van token it's just the token
itself so we can take the whole token
mum we're parsing it here you can see we
are taking three tokens and we're
incrementing the instruction partner by
three but here you can see we're taking
five tokens you see one two three four
five so we want to increment this by
five to push it on to the next and we
want to move it on to the next token
after and then so what we're going to do
first is we're just going to print fines
and if statements so let's go back to
Python let's type Python type Python
three actually Python three basic type I
test start line hit enter and okay we
have an error so you can see here we got
an error the reason for that was because
if we go back to our file our parson
will set apart these five tokens then it
knows how to parse these two tokens but
it doesn't know how to pass the endeth
token so what we can do for now is we
can just delete the eyelift token from
our file and we run this again you'll
see now more hours disappeared that's
because our posture no he doesn't have
to deal with the end of token neither
we've identified our if statement what
we want to do is want to check the
condition so here what we're going to
say is if toks
I plus one and this time we want to
start from the fourth character and go
to the end of the string so we want to
get the fourth character to the N which
is
as we access the fourth index we put a
coal on that the after it but we don't
specify where we wanted to stop and that
means Python I'll just go to the end of
the string which in this case it means I
go to the end of the token so we want to
say if the token the first number which
is this one and we want to compare that
against this one I want to say equals
tokes
I plus three I want to get the fourth
character to the end again the reason we
want to we I go from I plus 1 to I plus
3 is because we have this double equals
in the middle which will be I plus 2 so
this is I plus 1 I plus 2 I plus 3 I
don't want to say is print find a match
that's just so true then we'll say else
and false let's cool now so let's just
hit and run we run it
you see we got true printed out to us I
go back to the file test along I changed
this to a 2 so and I'm saying if 1 is
equal to 2 and print on the world
obviously one does not equal two so we
should get false now you can see we get
false printed out to us so let's keep it
true for the moment what we're going to
say is we're just going to put the end
lift back in now so that's run this
again we'll get our error again what
we'll do is we'll go up here to the top
and the first thing we'll check for is
the and if so will say if tokes
I equals and if print find on and if
let's just change it I'll put the status
so let's run this now why are we
actually need to increment the
instruction pointer
so you can see now it says find an and F
and the average disappeared so what
we're gonna do is we're just going to
delete that print for now I'm just gonna
leave it like this so this basically
means that our end if there's nothing
but it prevents our arrow from
displaying we run it again you can see
we here's our tokens here's the result
of our F condition and here is what a
the next token in the list after our if
statement because we haven't actually
told it to run the code underneath yet
so either way if this is true or false
at the moment this code was done wrong
so that's it for this video don't forget
