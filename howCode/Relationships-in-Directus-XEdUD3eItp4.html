learning about relationships interactors
we're gonna be learning about how
jaraxxus makes it easier to create SQL
relationships because directors uses a
relational database and directors has
special interfaces that makes it really
easy to create and manage relationships
so relationships in SQL help maintain
the integrity of your data but directors
has multiple ways of implementing
relationships so for uploading files
you've probably seen directors file
uploader when we want to upload a photo
we had their file uploaded we could just
drag a photo in and it would upload it
for us that use one of directors as
relational interfaces which is called
the single file and it linked up with
one of your actresses internal tables
and that's what we didn't have to do a
whole lot of work when we implemented it
for multiple files there's a multiple
files type and for many to many types
they're a bit more complicated but we're
gonna explain those as well an example
of that would be if we wanted our photos
to have tags the way many-to-many works
is a photo can have many tags on a tag
can be associated with many photos and
that's a bit more complicated to set up
but it's really easy with tractus then
we have many two one
we have many to one type-ahead so we
used many to one when we associated
users with photos so we had this
drop-down box that we could use to click
on a particular user
the many-to-one type-ahead is the same
sort of thing except instead of a
drop-down box it's a text box that
autocompletes
with the name of the user so obviously
if you had a lot of users you wouldn't
want to drop down box so it's probably
better to have this many to one type
ahead because then you just have a text
box you could type in the user that you
want and we have one-to-many which is
just the opposite of many to one so here
I have my photos table on my users table
so I help my photos table on my users
table I'm gonna create a new table
called tags because I want every photo
to have tags associated with it so I'm
gonna turn off status because we don't
need it for this table
and I'm gonna call this table tags so
the tags table is gonna have obviously a
tag name and we're just gonna leave it
as a varchar' and we're gonna say it's
marks from length as a hundred so if we
save that and in our tags table I'm
gonna start adding some tags one for
HTML one for PHP and aloud one more for
Python so now we have three tags I mean
want our photos to be associated with
one or more of these tags so I'm gonna
go back to the admin settings I'm gonna
create a new table this table is going
to be what we call a junction table
because when we create a many-to-many
relationship we have to have this sort
of intermediate to reachable we
to create at once and we can hide it
after we create it so we're gonna do
that so we're gonna turn off status
again and we're gonna call it tags
Junction something like that just so
that we know it's the junction table
so in this table what we want is the tag
ID and the photo ID so if I click this
create a new column I call it tag ID
it's gonna be numeric and I'm gonna
click Save then we're gonna have the
photo ID it's also gonna be numeric and
I'm gonna click Save so now that we've
created that we're ready to go back to
our photos table and we're ready to
create the relationship that lets us
create tags so I click out and you call
them I'm gonna call this column tags I'm
gonna call this column tags and down
here I have our relationships so we have
many to many we already looked at the
single file relationship that's what we
use for uploading files and we already
looked at many to one that's what we
used for associating users with a photo
because many users can upload a single
photo but a single photo is only
uploaded by one person so we use the
many to one type for that many to one
type-ahead is just the same thing except
instead of the interface displaying a
drop-down we have a textbox that we can
type into so what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna click on many-to-many and I'm
gonna scroll down so this looks a bit
complicated but it's really easy so we
created a junction table earlier so I'm
gonna click on that and click tags
Junction so there's our junction table
and our related table is gonna be our
tags table so then we want to do is we
want to associate the idea of our photo
with the photo ID and then we're going
to associate the tag ID with the ID out
of the tags table over here click Save
for visible columns we have to put in
the column that we wanted to spend the
tag so that's gonna be tag underscore
name that's what we called it in the
tags table and then down here for a
visible column template we just want to
paste in tag name surrounded by these
curly brackets
that's just how we display the tag name
in our interactions templating interface
scroll down a bit more we're gonna
disable duplicates because we don't want
one photo having the same tag over and
over again click Save and if we click on
photos so now we're gonna add a photo
and some tags so we're going to click on
new item and we're gonna add a new photo
and we're going to drag this photo in
and for uploader we're just gonna leave
it as Francis and here we're going to
choose our tags so we're gonna click
choose existing and this is going to use
our many-to-many relationship that we
created using our tags table and our
junction table and it's gonna last to
select as many tags as we want click
choose and save that so now you can see
those the new item we just added and
because we never actually need to touch
our junction table what we can do is go
to our admin settings go to our tables
go to our junction table and we can hide
that table and save it and now when we
refresh now you can see our junction
table has disappeared because we already
need that behind the scenes to create
the many-to-many relationship so
hopefully that's a quick overview of
relationships Interactive's but that's
