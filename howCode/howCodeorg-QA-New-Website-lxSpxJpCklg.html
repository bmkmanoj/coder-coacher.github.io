is sort of an unusual video it's more of
an update video than an actual tutorial
so what I'm gonna be doing is I'm going
to show you about this new website I
just needed I'll hug code QA so what it
basically is is it's going to replace
the forums him because the forms were
basically rubbish I didn't spend enough
time making the forms I didn't do things
like use JavaScript and things like that
so for example and because even things
like that sister translate box I start
decided to start start using javascript
leaving out of the transit box just
makes the website look a bit better just
odd mix the wives whole thing just a bit
better and there was no JavaScript on
the forms at all they were bugging there
were problems and things there was
people were able to make accounts that
were it didn't have alphanumeric user
names and things which meant that user
drear that was a big security flaw I
wasn't sort of sanitizing the
information for whatever the database
crackling things I got and there was a
whole load of problems that luckily none
of them ever actually came to light but
some of them I'm surprised and didn't so
i decided i'm just going to get rid of
the form you can still use the form as
of today but you can't login anymore you
can't create post or anything like that
you can just view the posts that are
already there and add the actual form
itself and all the posts and users and
everything will be removed on the first
of January 2014 so you have until then
to you know like Steve whatever post you
want or do whatever you want I might I
may even just keep the form up as an
archive but as of now and always able to
log in or do anything on it so I'm just
going to show you this new website it's
a way better it works better it's more
secure it's just a lot better and so
what I'm going to do is this redesign
the sort of describes everything so
welcome to the brand new website
microcar code Q&amp;amp;A allows you to ask
questions about programming and help
other people by answering questions so
that's really all it is it's um for
example if I click on task question this
is a question I made earlier just when I
was testing it out as you can see you
this is the test question you can edit
it flag it as an appropriate
there's a tags so if you fit on ties
obviously is one post so there's one tag
so here's the one tag I'm it and don't
worry that change the friends that was
just a bug that I will get fixed soon
and you can add comments underneath
questions you can answer the question
you can view people's profiles do things
like this video activity things like
that you can edit your quiet or out of
your settings so let's just scroll down
here this is just the actual settings
you can edit there's Anna bug section
that's really it there's not much to it
you can ask questions obviously so if
you want to ask a question and take you
to this page here when it loads I just
made this to make sure that you when you
ask a question that is that already been
asking for and there's like re re
capture thing that makes sure that you
have to put in the words above it before
you can ask your question just to make
sure that you're actually human and
things like that I actually didn't make
this script I was going to make it
myself I was gonna start yesterday and I
was going to make spend the next couple
of weeks making it but then I just
decided why waste my time when there's
already really good scripts out there
that people have already written that
are very secure that have been tested
and things like that so i actually just
downloaded one and SAT it up myself but
i'm still going to be doing things like
posting updates and making changes to it
even though I didn't make the original
code that just means I didn't make the
foundation of it i'm actually going to
be continuing when i'm going to be
keeping updating it and putting new
features on i'll be doing that myself I
just didn't see the point in taking
couple of weeks or it could have even
taken longer had to make one other
there's the same standard is this when I
could just download one that's already
been tested and it's secure and things
like that so that's it for this video we
don't forget to tell me what you think
if there's anything you want me too hard
to this um yeah that's basically it so
one more thing before I go I'd says here
in the About section you may have
noticed that a conscious more compatible
therefore I cut them all across I
actually did that but there was a lot of
bugs in that so what I'm proposing what
I'm probably going to do is I probably
just delete everything from the older
concert start from scratch again because
there's a lot of spam accounts in the
old ones and there was a big bug with
the email that's actually carried across
so I probably be getting rid of all the
old accounts and they're starting fresh
with this new one but as of the moment
to read all the older phones still work
on this new system but they probably
won't for long
they'll probably be getting rid of
concern so that's it for this video
thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
