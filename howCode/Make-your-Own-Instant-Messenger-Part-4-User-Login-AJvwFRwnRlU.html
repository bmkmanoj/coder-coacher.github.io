tutorial is we're going to be adding the
JavaScript that will make the box show
up to force a user to pick a username if
they don't already have one so the way
we're going to do that is we're going to
go to our index page I'm going to open
some script tags so we're going to
create a function called check cookie
which will check if the cookie is
husband set which is the user name
cookie so you can see here we have two
functions that run when the web page
loads from the template we have the
check cookie function I'm with the
update function lately I leave the
update function alone for now we're only
focusing on the check cookie function so
the way the check cookie function works
is it sees if the cookies has been set
the way and the way it does that as it
says if a document dot cookie dot index
oh and here we gave the cookie name and
the cookie name is equal to a messenger
Union so here is the cookie want to
check for R we want to set it it says is
this function equal to minus 1 because
this means if it's minus 1 then the
cookie hasn't been set if it's not minus
1 then the cookie already has been set
for want to do here is one says show the
login page if the cookie is not set and
then if the cookie is that we want to
say hide login
so then we want to go up here and we
want to create that function so what's a
function show login and this function is
going to display the white BG on the
login box divs so we do that as just a
document dot get element by ID first one
is white BG I want to say that style
tops display equals inline block and we
just want to copy this and paste it
again and change this to login box so
now it's going to check is this cookie
set we upload this
refresh and you can see now our login
box has been displayed because locker
key hasn't been set
so now we want to do is we want to
create the function that lets the user
pick their username so the way that
works is if you go up here you can see
we have the button and it says on click
choose username which is the function we
want it run so we want to actually
before we do that we want to go up here
and really a lot of show login function
and change it to hide login and change
just change inline-block
to display equal to none I will and hide
the login information again or the login
box again so now we want to create a
function choose user name and we want to
create a variable called user and we're
gonna send equals a document dot get
element by ID I'm gonna get the same
user name element and we're going to get
the top value which means we're at the
value attribute from that element so you
can see here is the element we're
talking about
it's called it's got an ID of seeing
user name and we want to get the value
of that text box I want to store it in
the user variable then we're going to do
is when I actually create the cookie so
though we do that is we said document
doctor cookie is equal to and then we
want to say whoops master your Union
equals and then we want to put in user
then we want to run check cooking again
when we run check cookie this time the
Kugler been sat which means the hide
login function will run which will hide
the login script we can in JavaScript
you can omit the semicolons most of the
time but for consistency I'll just keep
the semicolon in so we'll just run this
line
we will refresh the page we'll choose a
username which is going to be Francis
we're going to click choose username you
can see the box disappeared the way we
can check the cooking is actually been
set which is obviously because the Box
disappeared but you can check with the
console ignore this error for neither
that's us quiz we comment to find the
update function the rate where we can
check is we just a document dot we'll
just actually copy this
document dot cookie dot index of you can
see it says 32 which means the occurred
in has been set because it's not -1 so
that's it for this video don't forget to
Like comment favorite and subscribe and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
