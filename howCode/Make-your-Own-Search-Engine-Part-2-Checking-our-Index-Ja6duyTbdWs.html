doing is inserting what we got from the
web crawler into the actual database
itself so let's get started so here I am
back on our old crawler and the first
thing we need to do is create our SQL
connection string so we do that up at
the top and we're gonna be connecting to
our DMS using a feature in PHP called
PDO
PD o stands for PHP data objects and
essentially what it is is a database
abstraction class and that means it'll
work was not just SQL but it'll work
with lots of other different types of
database that's not the reason we're
using PDO because we could just use the
built in MySQL I functions in PHP to
insert into our database because we're
using a MySQL database the reason we're
using PDO is because one of the best
features of PDO is prepared statements
and essentially what prepared statements
do is they prevent SQL injection so what
the way they do that is whenever you
insert your query instead of assigning
the parameters with the query as part of
the one string PDO will send a query off
to the database it will compile the
query and then it will send the
parameter separately this means the
malicious user accounts modify your SQL
query and delete all your tables or do
anything like that they can't modify it
the only other way they could use SQL
injection is if they used second-order
SQL injection which is where the insert
SQL code into your database and whatever
you're outputting it back to the user
you make a mistake and then run their
code by mistake so prepared statements
prevent the first form of SQL injection
but you always have to be careful when
you're putting any data from the
database to prevent not just things like
cross-site scripting but to prevent the
other types of SQL injection - that's
why we're using PDO because since
prepared statements mean we don't have
to clean our input we don't have to
worry about what the input is because
it's just treated as plain text the
reason we care about that is because
we're not actually taking user input
because we're not actually allowing
people didn't cert data into our
database but our crawler is it's
crawling websites and it's not treating
the titles cleaning the descriptions or
cleaning the URLs so if we crawl a
website and somebody hides some code in
the title if we're not careful and we
didn't use prepared statements that
could be aware that somebody could use
SQL injection against us so we're going
to create a new instance of the PDO
class we're going to say a PDO is equal
to new PDO
and we need to pass it a couple of
parameters the first parameter is a
string the tails it the type of database
we want to use the host name the
database name stuff like that then we
have another parameter which is the user
name for the database and then we have
another parameter which is the password
so in the first string we say MySQL
colon which means that we're gonna use
MySQL as the database then we say host
and we said our host equal to in this
case my local machine if you were using
an external host you would obviously
want to point it to that but since I'm
on my local machine I would only put in
local host for some reason when I type
in localhost it doesn't work so what I'm
gonna do is actually put in the local IP
that local host points to so that IP
address is 127.0.0.1 then we put a
semicolon and then we put in the
database name the database name we just
type in is DB name let me set it equal
to the database and in the last video we
created our database and called how you
search so we set how you search then we
want to go over to the next parameter
and we want to put in our username so
the username is going to be root and on
my local machine there is no password
for the SQL Server so I just put in and
nothing for the password so if I save
this we should be just connected to our
SQL database now
so what I'm gonna do is just comment out
this so our bot won't actually start
crawling and I'm gonna test the SQL
connection so I'm gonna say PDO query
and I'm just gonna say a select from
index and I'm just going to run this you
can see we got no eye pop we get nowhere
so therefore that means we should be
connected to astral database so what
we're gonna do is we're going to just
delete that we're going to just calling
that back in so this is the part of the
code what we're going to actually insert
things into the database so what we need
to do is just go down here and we want
to say critter verbal call details and
say details is equal to cat details
Oh which means we're getting all the
details and we're storing it in the
details variable then we want to say a
JSON decode to convert the JSON string
that we created in the first part of the
series to an array this is the JSON
string here and we're going to convert
it to an array we're gonna comment like
echo get details and now we have the
details stored in an array so what I'm
gonna do is print our details and then
put a new line at the end of it and
before we run that we need to just come
back up here and take away this comma
because that's making our JSON invalid
so let's just run this and you can see
here's the output of our crawler so what
we're gonna first do is check if a
website's already been inserted into our
crawler so to do that what we're gonna
do is we'll create a variable and we're
gonna call it rows and we're gonna set
that equal to P do and then we're gonna
access the query method and we're gonna
say select all from index initially then
what we'll say is rows is equal to P do
fetch column and then what we'll finally
do is set echo rows with a new line
before we can do that we need to just go
up here and make our PDL variable global
to give us access to it in the function
and let's run this now before we do that
we actually want to say rows is equal to
rows fetch column okay so if we just run
this now so we get a fatal error so for
some reason with PDO so I have to put in
a backward around table names and by
doing that the query will succeed so if
we run this again you can see we get no
iPod at all so I'll just stop this now
so I just stopped that the reason got no
white part is because we have no actual
goes in our table if I go and add a row
really quickly
just call it test and we run this night
what we'll get is one printed out so you
can see that's counting all of the rows
and the table
so in this video what we did was
connected to our database and then we
were able to find all of the rows in the
database what we're gonna be doing next
is expanding on this on checking if a
URL is already in the database so thanks
for watching don't forget to Like

see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
