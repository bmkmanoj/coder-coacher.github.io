today we're gonna be doing is we're
gonna be learning about object-oriented
programming using Python
so what object-oriented programming is
is just where you use objects in
programming to store things like data
and methods as opposed to just writing
them on with prestige as you would if
you were doing procedural programming so
a procedural programming is what we
normally do well not not like everyone
does it but it's what I normally do but
object-oriented sebat err way to do it
and some people think it's worse so
let's get started so well the way object
or any programming works is the object
get can hold data on methods and the
object gets the data on the methods from
a class so the first thing we need to do
is we need to create a class so if we
create a class and call it my class it
doesn't matter we call it and anyway we
can create a variable called I don't
know info we could say info equals this
whoops is an example of data within a
Python object and we could just leave it
like that and now if we create an object
so it's a create an object what we do is
we just create give the object to me and
like we were creating a variable so I
could call it my object and then I could
well the way we create the object is we
say equals and we set it equal to the
class so at my clock we could say my
object equals my class and I'm good we
have to put empty parameters or in the
class so this is how we create the
objects now if we save that and we hit
f5 obviously I won't do anything because
we've created the object but we haven't
done anything with it so if we would go
to could sorry if we were to go down
here and we're going to type my object
thought okay I never actually mentioned
that so now we've got our object created
to actually sort of reference the data
inside the object we just do my object
dots so we put a dot and then we just
but the name of whatever we want a
reference so info oops
so it's my object dot info and what this
will do is it will just print the
contents of this variable ID so we just
hit f5 again oh yeah I actually forgot
to actually get the contents of whatever
is in the object we I just said print my
object dot info Sam we had f5 and we get
this is an example of data within a
Python object because what we're doing
is we're printing whatever is returned
by this object so we are printing my
object on info so it goes today my
object object and I'm not sort of sounds
worried because I called it my object
but you know go with it so that we go to
my object and then we reference the info
and data which is just a variable called
in BO we could set this equal to a
variable as well so we could say I don't
know my variable I'll just say my bar
equals my object dot info and now if we
were to print my car instead we had have
five we got the exact same result so
what we can also do is we can create
methods so I still I know so a math is
just like a function so we just said
daffy as if we were creating a function
we said des we give it the math and the
names from my method it takes parameters
but for the moment we're just gonna
leave well it has to take one parameter
which means which is ourself and I'll
tell you about that later what this
method does is just gonna print you know
one plus one equals two
so now if we try and reference the
method out of the object so again we
just can do print so we don't need to do
that because we don't need print the cup
yeah result of the method because we've
got in the math we've already told it to
print one plus one equals two so here we
can just say my object dot my math did
since it's a method are not not data we
have to put parameters around it now I
respect my object wrong so we spelled my
object right we had a five okay we
deleted the object so we just needed to
find it all right
create the object so my object equals
and my class with her empty parameters
and now we try it again and we got one
plus one equals two because what this is
doing is it's doing the same sort of
thing as it does with the data
it was my object and then it looks for
the M it looks inside the class my class
because my object is equal to my class
so it looks inside this class and then
in the class it looks for the method my
method and I'll show you what happens if
we get rid of the yourself
we got an hour because what the s self
does is it just basically tells the
method to sort of be associated with the
class my class so I'm sort of that's how
we just get it to work basically it gets
the in assigned sort of the method to
the class which is assigned to the
object so with like the SL this isn't
gonna work
it's sort of sort of they are sort of
like saying inherits so it's kind of
like this method inherits this class so
that that way it sort of CATSA its
associated with the class and because we
used itself the math and becomes a child
of the class and that means we can use
the my method in the object because the
object is a link sort of to the class
so that's it for this video don't forget
to Like favorite comment and subscribe
and I know I started making a website a
long time ago on the job and actually
heard anything more of it but that will
be coming really soon because I recently
just sat up a Linux server and I'm gonna
be using that to host my website and
I'll have it all finished really soon so
you should see that pretty soon just
ignore the one at the moment it's
creative code dots yet or whatever it is
don't see the end up cz or whatever
because I'm gonna have a it's gonna be a
proper website with a proper tummy and
on a proper server that should all run
any fast and it should just work really
well so a thanks for watching don't
forget to Like favorite and subscribe
and comment as I said and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
