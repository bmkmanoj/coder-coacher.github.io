today what we're gonna be doing is as
you can see on the my messages page it
shows you the a body of the message but
it doesn't show you a Titan or anything
and if it's a long message it's gonna
you're not gonna be able to see it all
because we shortened it to only show you
150 characters by default so what we're
gonna be doing is starting a Titan
feeling that we're gonna get it so when
you click on say the title of the
message it's going to show you the rest
of it so first we're going to do is
we're going to go into phpMyAdmin and
we're going to go to the field are the
structure of the table private messages
on dodging tea I added a new cup row
underneath user to called MSG underscore
title um it's a varchar' of length 255
characters so just add that to your
table and let's move on so now that
we've added that if we go yeah okay send
a message to someone so if I go to
appearance and message and at the moment
because we've changed the fields it
won't work so I also have what so what
I've done to effects up is I added
obviously the message underscore top and
I got I added them a variable called a
mystery underscore title and it's in the
same places the row in the database so
that it like matches so and then all I
did was Emma's I created I just copied
the MSG underscore body variable changed
it to title and I just made attacked and
then put type of text well you can see
it for yourself the only job it's only
it's just a normal text field and its
name is MSG underscore title and
as about it is an on-click but its value
by default is anthem at the message
title here and it's on click values
nothing so when you check it it
disappears the reason this is all done
is because I recorded this tutorial once
and then some reason it didn't see if
correctly and a half now I'm recording
it so on the next thing I did was just
copy the body and check code again I
just copied this code paste it above it
and changed and I missed you a mask or
body to title and the messages that it
checks and gives you if you have an
error so just do that and then you'll be
ready to get into the tutorial so they
have the first thing we're gonna do is
and show the message title so when
you're going to copy this and I both
what we're gonna put in Ana's gender
score title we have to do this down here
as well so back up here in the unread
messages section we can just copy this
code once again you just get up here and
just change everything
Here I am exchange for tightly final and
obviously we don't need such a long
length so we can shorten it so now we've
done that whoops okay so now we've done
now we can just change this again to
underscore title now I just whoops you
see if I go to my messages and I am
refresh you'll see you don't but just
give you enough with too bad you won't
see anything be and you'll just see the
word sin
which is correct and that's because
we're telling it to get the amis genders
they get the data from the I was G
underscore title rule but as you can see
these two let's go back to de Vries so
add these two these two are sent before
we added the a mystery underscore title
and row so that means they're blank so
if we were to send something nice and
say I type in PI cetera I just put in a
message I never supposed to wrong with
the doesn't matter
so we send the message we refresh you
can see now we have another end message
this time we have a mystery Andrews
Courtney I'm exchange for tightly room
filled in with an actual data so to see
this I'm just going to log notice
Francis because in Santa message and I'm
a log in a cinema so we can see it so I
just logged in and as you can see cinema
has one message and it's from Francis
I'm the title of the message is
highsinger which is correct but as you
can see we can't see the actual message
so what we're going to do to fix up is
we're going to use JavaScript to a short
div underneath the message title so what
we're gonna do is create link I don't
know we can actually get I thinking to
get rid of this oh no I see no no yes we
can
so I'll just refresh to make sure yes so
we can I was just changing so I don't
know we just found the link and in here
we just put a hush or pawn son and there
that just stops it linking to another
page okay actually no we don't but we're
going to say JavaScript
and then simply just gonna set Tommy
okay so now we're going up we all Cheney
to also Korea ID and it's gonna be
display packs just set up so if we
refresh we see we have a link that says
hi cinema but if you click it we can see
nothing we do anything actually we can
just place the base in you so to fix
this well it's not really broken
we just haven't put any a decode for the
Devon yet so what we're gonna do is just
create a div underneath and it's going
to create a first octave so it's gonna
have an ID of toggle toggle attack and
it's style it's going to be an attack to
display you know what just means we
won't be able to see it until we toggle
it nor tell JavaScript either to it and
here we can just say MSG Dynasty on the
skull body so now we can just go up here
and then start putting in the JavaScript
code so if you've done any JavaScript to
know you have to include it in sort of a
JavaScript sort of block and we're just
going to get that knock so script
language is obviously faster we can the
script tag and in here we're gonna
create a function called toggle which
exam and yeah function down here which
is why it's JavaScript Tom JavaScript :
toggle it's just too
just at Allenwood function you so you
can ready call over here so we're going
to create a variable called and we also
going to equal document dot get element
by I think the element what I mean
getting is solving text just about that
home just by the wrong again so now I
finally spell to write so we're going to
copy this I'm we're going to create
another variable and it's gonna be text
but so I'll add don't worry you can call
that you want and this is gonna be
display text so now what we're gonna say
is it any which is the variable we just
created dot style dot display equals
equals which as equals equals is used
when you're comparing two things like an
escape in the two it's sort of similar
to PHP in that respect know most
languages like that and then we're just
gonna say tax dollar in HTML close show
and I actually got some the line we're
gonna fit yep looks really dark sky
taunt this day equals
and then we can lease a house now we
just copy these two guys Eastman change
display to block and clear the other one
I so let's go to the browser and see
does that work so if I click on my
cinema ok let me see what's wrong
okay so actually we don't need these
these hide and show things I'm just back
copy and I wasn't really concentrating I
did it already and I did it slightly
differently so um so I think I found the
problem so we had a double equals here
double equals is used for comparing and
sending equals is used for M assigning
values so let's see if that worked
so we refresh and now if I hit it or
click on it I shouldn't see now the
message is revealed then we click on it
again it hide it
see ok well there's a slight problem
yeah horizontal line is above the
message and that's like that's gonna be
use as a break to a hold underneath the
message so that's easy to fix
so all we do is copy this
so if we go back and refresh again we
shouldn't notice any difference start
but if we click on one yeah well yeah
well we can just pot ahem a break here
whoops save it and refresh and there's
our message so that's the well I mean
it's not it doesn't look very good but I
mean it's something to show you all to
do it I mean you could make it look a
lot better someone what's a bit of CSS
so well that's it so thanks for watching
them I know this is been shorter to
longer than normal but don't worry
there'll be more coming in the next
couple of days and we'll be way around
here but that's basically us almost
finished with the inbox system and so
don't forget to comment rate subscribe
thanks for watching and see you next
