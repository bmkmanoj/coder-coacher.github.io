and how to create your own es de vc type
website so in this video what we're
going to be doing is we're going to be
setting up the reverse dns lookup for
our domain so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to see you back into the bind
directory I'm going to list the flat
files and I'm going to open up name.com
local
so i'm going to set not own an com
telugu and i'm going to hit enter and
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
copy this file now I'm going to close
out of the file again and i'm going to
send nano i'm going to paste in this
file name and this will create the new
file for us once we see of it so what
I'm going to say here is I'm going to
create a comment that sat in the reverse
DNS zone for
our domain necessary then we are going
to say is I'm going to the outside again
I'm going to create another SOA record
so i'm going to say in SOA
then what I'm going to say is
instead of using the name server so
instead of saying a desktop tle hug code
org we're going to go to the NS so we're
just going to use the app domain name
itself then what we're going to do is
we're going to say we're going to
actually give the administrator email
again specific once's web size we need
to put a dot here then what will say is
Francis code org dot now we're going to
open up the SOA record again so again
this is an email address so we just
pretend that's first thought is an
outside then what we're going to say in
here is ok so in here we have to put the
same stuff again so I'm just going to
click ctrl x hit gas and then hit enter
then i'm going to set a CD zones
actually i'll say nano zones / tayo dito
code.org zone and I'm just going to copy
this here will call me that and then
we'll go back into the other file and
now you can press up on your keyboard
and it will go back through the commands
you recently used so I go back into this
file and I'm just going to go down here
and I pissed and the stuff of the SOA
record
now what I'm going to say is in and s
lips axia well okay what's the N and s
and s TLD I code.org dot and then just
ignore this we're just going to set for
in PT our tail d dot I code datel work
so just ignore that um the ef4 just
ignore that for now I was going to tidy
this up a bit
okay so we're going to hit ctrl x we're
gonna hit why I'm going to hit enter
again to see of the file next thing
we're going to do is we want to set non
0 / ET c / resolve without any comp so
it's re s.o.l v dot conf and in here
what we're going to do is we're going to
put in above everything when it says
search till the top I code.org
I see get rid of the dot when I hit ctrl
x y and enter again to see about
then we're going to say is serviced by
nine we start again we're going to hit
enter and the shoot restart everything
so we're going to restart with no errors
and that's it basically we're done so
