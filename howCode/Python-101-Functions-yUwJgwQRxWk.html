going to be doing is we're going to be
learning what functions in Python what
we're gonna be doing is first I'll be
showing you some of the pretty build
functions in Python and then I'll be
showing you how to create your own
function in Python so we're gonna start
with saying what if what is a function
and the function is basically just a
program that busily just a set of
instructions like any other program but
it just it's your program that's used
with interpreting your programs to make
your life easier basically so that's not
a very good explanation but I'm going to
show you one of the built-in Python
functions and so the function I'm gonna
be showing you does the same thing as
well like powers so for example 3 to the
power 4 you do like this give this 81 so
the way we do this with a function is
you just type in POW - parentheses and
in between the parentheses input two
parameters the first ones the number we
want to the first one in this case will
be the three and the second parameter
with four so the first one is what the
number you're starting with and then the
second parameter is how many times you
want to multiply it by itself or am how
many times you want to like the power
basically that was bad and then we just
type in print at the start taxi print
the result so now if we hit enter we get
81 so that's pretty boring because
that's just why couldn't we just do this
well we could have brothers a function
for it as well so to make this more
interesting to show you how to make your
own functions so in here I've just
created a new empty Python file and I'm
going to create a function so in PHP if
you're a familiar with it you'll know to
create a function you type in the word
function then the name of your function
and two parenthesis and in the
parenthesis any parameters your function
would require and then two curly braces
and this is how you create a function
PHP but in Python is slightly different
so in Python to create a function you
have to define it and defining and
creating a function or the same thing so
instead of typing in function like in
PHP we just type in Daffy
which means define and then we type in
the name of our function so in this case
I'll type in my function - parentheses
and in PHP you use two curly braces to
tell PHP when you're when you're writing
the code for your actual function and
when you want to stop which is what what
this print all right carly Bristow's but
in python that you don't use curly
braces it uses indentation so you just
use a colon to talat that's what comes
after this is gonna be what's in your
function and then when you hit enter
it's automatically indented it force
which tells python that this is the same
as b as if it was in PHP will be between
two curly braces and the way you finish
your function so if you wanted write
something after you defined your
function you just hit enter and you
delete the indent so python will know
that when you type in print and then
something hello I mean it will know your
function isn't just to print hello so
what I'm gonna do as I just want notice
it's indented so this is me writing
stuff for a function so just gonna say
return hello so now I'm gonna save it
and hit f5 or no way I actually have to
run our function not just define it so
now I've created our function we have to
run it so I'm just gonna set print my
function and then notice this is an
indented and this is so that's how
Python knows that I'm finished I'm
finished my function because this is
indented and this isn't but if this was
in it indented it would think this was
part of my function but I don't want it
to be so it's not and notice how the
color changed as well so that's sort of
an indicator that it's not part of the
function so I'm gonna hit a five and
should just say hello
down here so we've just run up created
our function that says hello but it's
pretty bad because it doesn't take any
parameters so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna say print or return that's what
this function is gonna do is add two
numbers together
so since odd doesn't exist in Python
library I'll just call it my function
but what it's gonna do is add two
numbers together so I'll send them one
um two then we're just gonna say I
returned home one plus num2 and then in
our function that we give it we've told
it it takes two parameters we need to
give it two parameters so I'll set three
and four on our function to give seven
because it should either two parameters
together and we get seven we can also do
things like return I don't know hello
comma and then we could just say name
and we could change our function so it
only takes one parameter and that's me
and so then down here all I do is give
it my name for one parameter I'm not
sure just say hello comma Francis and
there it is so I hope you I hope you all
right can you learn to speak I hope you
enjoyed this video
it was quite short but to the point
we'll be doing more things on functions
in the future and don't forget to like
the video and subscribe to my channel if
you enjoyed it and I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
