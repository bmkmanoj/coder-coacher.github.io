message to our BOTS so because we're
running our bot from within a cPanel
environment we can't actually listen for
Facebook requests when Facebook signs
requests to us we currently have no way
of you know viewing the requests and
seeing what they said so the way we do
that and with a cPanel server is we're
going to go to cPanel and I've created
whoops I've created a file called
Facebook txt and every time Facebook
sends us a request we're going to write
that request to a file and then we're
going to display that on the screen so
to do that what we're going to do is
we're going to say a file get oops file
put contents we want to add store it in
Facebook txt and the the data we want to
store is whoops on the data we want to
store is going to be file get contents
and we're just going to pass it this
string called PHP code for sauce forward
slash and then we're going to write
input so we're going to save that and if
i refresh this and load this you'll see
we'll get a blank screen because it
doesn't send the it doesn't protect the
headers of the request it only sends us
the body of the request which but that's
all we need for Facebook so if I go to
the Facebook page and I send a message
to the bottom I see a hello world and I
hit enter if we had a server running in
terminal for example we would be able to
see that displayed and straight away
because we can because we'd be listening
for Facebook to send us a request but
using cPanel I'll have to do is go
Raffaello and refresh this and within
Chrome I just have an extension this is
just a JSON extension because Facebook
sends us and JSON is the request and
then we have to process it ourselves and
then send mgs4 back so if I click raw
this is what Facebook actually said here
is the post version so as you can see
this is the text that I sent
and it's stored in this text file so
that's it for this video in the next
part what we're going to be doing is
we're going to be sending a request and
hopefully we'll be using the data that
Facebook's and us in this request to
send personalized requests depending on
what the user sent to us so thanks for
watching and if you enjoyed this video
