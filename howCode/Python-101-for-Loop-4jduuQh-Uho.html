about is for loops in Python so what a
for loop is is it's a way of iterating
or looping through a set of items so for
example I could have a list and I get
iterate through and like your kind every
add in the list so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to show you the difference
in a while loop in a for loop and a
while loop is a loop that can be run
forever and a for loop count for loop
will only run until against the end of
its list of items to everywhere through
so for example if I said while true well
I should also mention a while loop
iterates until its condition is false
and as long as we said true that means
its condition is true and it will never
be false because we haven't told it it
can never be false so it will always be
true so it will print forever so what it
says something
emergency it prints the word something
out forever
so what I'm gonna do now is going to
create a list and I'm gonna call it my
list then I'm gonna do is I'm going to
put items in it and I'm gonna call a
first one Python and the next one Sayed
and the next one peach paid and the next
one JavaScript
then the next one C++ then the next one
Java then the next one c-sharp
okay so that's a dancer in if we if we
say I print my list as you can see it
prints out are less done with seven
items in our list so what I'm going to
do now isn't going to use a for loop to
iterate through the list and count every
item in it so the first thing I need to
do for that is an integrative variable
to store the current the current the
count in because that's just going to be
incremented in the loop I'm gonna create
a variable called count that I'm going
to set it equal to zero then what I'm
going to say is for item in let my list
actually then I'm gonna say count plus
equals one
so our load are a for-loop just ran and
if we print current as you can see it's
a seven because it kind of every item in
the list so what's good about a four
loop is this variable here this variable
item we never declared we're never
declared it it just it's used by the
four to represent an item in the list so
for example I could say for sure I know
Frances in my list for is Frances
doesn't see it print every item of the
list because this variable is a
placeholder it's the name of the
variable doesn't mean anything it's just
used to represent every an item in a
specific item in the list and I just
used the word item because that's what
it represents it's a more descriptive
name than meinian because my name has
nothing to do with this list so thanks
for watching don't forget to Like

see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
