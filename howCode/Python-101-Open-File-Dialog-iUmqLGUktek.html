today we're gonna be doing in this
Python 101 video is we're going to be
learning how to open files using the
tkinter library so what I mean by that
is we're going to if I go to open you'll
see there's a file dialog there let's
lead oh sorry allows me to open files
I'm going to showing you how to create
one of those in Python and load the file
name into the program which is our
Python program so let's get started
so the first thing we need to do is we
need to import the tkinter library so
we're just going to set from tkinter
import all push it up for everything
from the tkinter library and then the
next thing we need is we need to create
a variable called route I'm going to set
it equal to T at T care and two
parentheses so this is just a function
with a capital T obviously because it's
case sensitive so just remember that's
capital T and lowercase R lowercase K
and then two parentheses obviously
because it's function and we assigned it
to the variable root so if I hit our v
what should happen is our alright window
should load because of our t ki variable
and just let so you should think of the
TK variable just as a sort of the being
window for the program so I'm gonna
close those I only have one more line of
code actually right so what this is
going to do is this is the line that IQ
opens the file dialog or actually if two
lines actually left to right so what I'm
gonna say is root dot family and this is
going to be the variable we're going to
store the file I'm gonna set that equal
to file dialogue dot and then the reason
it's a dot is because we're getting the
file dialogue class from the tkinter
library and we're getting leaf ask but
the ask open file iam function from
within that class so those are functions
we write it in parenthesis of the enemy
put parentheses at the end of the
function and then within this we want to
do is want whoops we want to say file
types and then we want to set that equal
to have more parentheses and then we
want to post peace there so there's a
bit more room and we want to create
actually
even more parentheses so we're going to
create another set of parentheses
actually two more sets we're going to
separate them by a comma and the reason
for these acts different these tragedies
within the parentheses is because each
of these is a specified file type that
we're going to load so for example you
could allow any type of file here you
can have an all files option here so
that's what I'm going to do I'm going to
create a high code files and then also
within these friends is I've had another
comma on a double quotes and I wanted
RHC so what this will do is it will make
it recognize files that end the doggie
extension and it will know they're
called five point five on the last one
I'm going to do is an old files one
which is actually really easy all with
this a as all files and comma and
another set double quotes and we just
popped and add all right asterisks and
then adopt run another i-strip so this
just specifies well I have any kind of
file and
to be opened are we actually put on
other aspects of the euro a lion file
add and edit our HC extension to the
opened so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to run the program again with f5
and as you can see we have our file
dialog if I click here it says high
profile stock HC and our files is also
another option so the final thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to
actually I record the name of the father
gets opened so what I'm going to do
there is I'm going to just go down here
I'm going to say a print and it's
censored Python 3 we have to use the
print function and as oppose use writing
a print and then double quotes so now
say print route dot file name which
should print out the result are the file
name of our file ok so what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to run it again so if I
head out 5 what'll happen is this should
run the program we have the two options
we can choose hi code files we can use
all files I click all files scroll down
to file here I have a file called text
txt if I double click on that as you can
see if we move into our the way I just
just closed it as you can see what
happen was it got recorded in the Python
terminal other reason is just txt that
takes this because I actually just
created a new txt file and call it test
txt so it's not actually but with our
code it's just I missing the file so
