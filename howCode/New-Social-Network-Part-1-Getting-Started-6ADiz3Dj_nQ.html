completely redoing and overhauling the
old high code social network series
that's because that series came out in
2013 as you can see here it actually
come out even earlier than that because
this video itself is a remake of the
original series and the original series
came out in 2012 slot series is almost 5
years old by now and because that series
has gotten old it doesn't follow
practices that are considered to bass by
today's standards so what we want to do
is completely remake it to create a
brand new social network that's really
secure and uses everything that's
considered best practice when creating a
website today because what I noticed is
this is still the most popular series on
the high code YouTube channel even five
years later so it's important that the
videos are actually teaching the correct
stuff so that when you're learning it in
2017 you're actually learning practices
that are considered the best practices
in 2017 this new series is going to be
created with loads of modules in the
last series you have to follow
everything of video to be able to
complete the series and you might have
only wanted to learn a specific chunk of
it like how to create user accounts how
to follow people hiatus and messages
things like that so this new series all
of the individual modules they're all
individual modules and that means that
you can learn the specific parts of the
series that you want to learn rather
than having to do the entire thing to be
able to learn a tiny chunk of it so
hopefully this is interesting and
there's not much more to say so let's
just get started so the first thing I
want to go over is the fact that if we
look at MediaWiki which is the software
the powers Wikipedia and WordPress the
software powers WordPress you can see
this is their index page it looks
nothing like our old index page where we
had our PHP code at the top we had an
HTML at the bottom the way these
websites work is when you create a big
software project you want to spit up
your design your logic and your database
into different sections to make it
easier to manage and that's what the
software behind these programs do so
whenever we're actually sticking all
these modules together that's what we're
going to do we're going to create our
own tiny model-view-controller framework
but because we're doing tiny modules one
piece at a time we're going to have our
HTML on our PHP on the CM pages and then
right at the end we're going to section
it all off the way it should be and that
makes it easier to learn what we want to
learn in each video so the first thing
we want to do is download the correct
software I've downloaded a software
called exons because I'm running it on
my local computer but if you want to use
digitalocean and do it live on a virtual
private server that's even easier all
you have to do is set up a lab server on
you going to and so here's my a
directory
and the first thing we want to do is
create our database and this database is
going to hold absolutely everything to
do with our social network so to do that
I have some software here called sequel
Pro this is Microsoft where if you
officially my admin that will work as
well I what we want to do is create a
new database we're going to call it
social network and those are database
created so the first thing we have to do
is create our users table so to create a
table what we're going to do is click
add it's going to be called users and
we're going to click Add
so we have our ID field we want to
create a field called user name the user
name is going to have a type of varchar'
and it's going to have a length of 32
certainty is just an arbitrary number
now we're going to create our password
field it's going to be a varchar' and
it's going to have a length of 60 that's
important because we're going to be
using something called bcrypt
to haj our passwords and keep them
secure so we're going to answer there
and then finally we're going to ask for
the users email and that's going to be
of type text so you can have more fails
if you want but for the simplicity of
this series we're going to keep it short
for the minute and then if we need to
add more we can add one later so in this
video we just went over the basic
introduction of this series and then we
created our table for our users and we
added the fields that we need for our
table so that's it for this video don't

enjoy the rest of this series so thanks
for watching and I'll see you next time
