what I'm going to be showing you is
about a project I've been working on for
the last few weeks called esbc and
you've probably already guessed that yet
what I wanna eswc is and what it is is
it free domain name service for anybody
but I made it particularly for any
subscribers so what it does is it allows
you to get a free eat da Tiesto Avicii
don't mean it you can register forever
it's free it's fast because the server i
use is actually fast it runs off
digitalocean servers so this'll should
give you an idea of how fast they are
which is actually pretty fast and you
can do all sorts of things whether you
can do whatever you would come with
normally with a dot-com domain you can
use your own name servers you can point
any swc domain to what your name service
or you can keep them at my am das de vc
name server you can also refer them to
your own website you can point them to
your own website that's absolutely
really easy to do so i'm going to give
you a demonstration of how easy it is to
do it and how everything works so i'm
going to log out and if i log in as
you'll see here this is the exact same
form as is on hi gorg so all your login
and information is the exact same so if
you have an account on hi gorg you can
login with it here i'm just going to
show you these pages just whatever
that's just the pages that I made and
i'll just say if i go to my card i have
four domains the first two are actually
critical track to making it work WWE
SMSes i can just use that i can direct
users from the uws WC to the actual
website so someone else can take a quiz
that would cause confusion and then
registry dot es MVC is used to host
files that and do things like domain
expiring things like that so they do
basic administration work for as on the
back end of the servers so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to give you a
demonstration of how it works so I'm
just going to register domain in so i'm
going to type in new dot eswc
just as soon as this one appear says
it's available if I click to register it
tells me the domain I want to register
it did I did the the registration top
place and the expiry date which is one
year from today it also gives me the
register on which is my username you can
also do things like doughnut and well as
you can see if I clicked on you and take
me to paypal and it allow me to donate
and things and what are the advantages
of donating is that not only does it
mean may be able to buy better servers
to make the experience better well also
it also means you get I just well okay
you see here I have 100 domains I can
use but I've regular user only gets 10
but if you don't you get 50 added on to
that so every time you don't you get an
extra 50 domains so the first time you
don't get enough sexy then the next time
you don't Neil have 110 on the next time
you learn and 70 and whatever or me 160
at so that's how it works and you can
donate as little or as much as you want
even if you don't eat at one pan you're
still going to get the extra 50 domains
any donation whether it's big or small
as appreciated as well so I'm just going
to go back I'm gonna register that
domain right now I don't want to donate
because it can already doing it to
myself so I'm just pick no and it gets
rid of that if I click confirm
registration it says that I have five
domains out of 100 use because
previously i only had four and that's
because my new domain is showed up here
so as you can say you have three options
you can add it away in date your domain
or renew your domain if I click renew
and you'll just notice that that went up
to 2015 so it added an extra year on to
my domain so this just means that I will
obviously if I keep plugging it won't
actually go up it only goes up as far as
2015 for now and then
because I off I want people to be
able to register domains too far
advanced if I click add it to me and I'm
going to show you some of the options
you have so here we have three options
we have point your card domain point
your nameservers unused esv eswc dns so
i'm going to show you the first one
first obviously so if i go to point to
your website i actually have to click
this circle or else I'm one actually
knew it so if i go to point to your
website and i set it to my website and i
go to haiku org and I click Submit says
do me an updated and I just fresh this
back here as you say it says the domain
goes to hi gorg so now if i type in you
dar es de bc it shows me up like a haiku
org but I'll just say I takes it does if
i click on about us or whatever the
address doesn't change because it's just
an iframe to have a your dummy and new
things why my actual domain those I you
want to use things like name servers or
eswc dns so i'm going to show you a name
servers first so if i go to point to
your nameservers here you have the table
or whatever and it says to me neum tie
points to or whatever so anything you
need to worry about is putting in the
name server so i'm just going to put in
a study swc which is the name server for
this but obviously I das VES the VC to
everyone actually do anything for you
currently so as you can see i have one
name server and this means that if i go
to a five-point might owe me another
name server i can use that i can use
that name server to host my domain zone
file which is sort of the file that
holds all the information without domine
so i can't really show you too much
about this but I will
but if you you know if put in the
nameserver some company whenever so if
you sign up to date and lotion and then
the interval we ns1 but AG lotion calm
and then click Submit at odds it and an
s2 and then an s3 honestly so if you
were doing this you would obviously want
to get rid of the first one so if you
wanted to sign up the digital ocean this
is all you do you will get rid of you
would get rid of the first one and just
use the bottom three times going to
delete those four line so now finally
we're going to go on to use esv eswc dns
and this is the one that sort of took
the longest to set up because it was
complicated so this means that you host
your dns with and when I eswc and what
this does it says host and that says uws
WC so if I leave this blank then I fell
all this in what it will do is it will
change the address that you don eswc
points are so so I'm going to do a
demonstration here I'm just going to put
in I'm going to do this command called
Anna's look up and I'm going to put in
the mirror minor moon so as you'll see
this is the address that it's pointing
to and if i put in if I leave this blank
and i set the TTL or the time to live to
1400 I mean 14,400 and I put a different
IP address which is say this one is the
IP for the hug goat CDN and I figured
record I shall see this as the record
but the DNS only refreshes once every 15
minutes so your changes can take up to
15 minutes to fact but don't worry
they'll always take a fact and also the
reason it takes 15 minutes is this
because I'm not sure currently how many
people I'm gonna be how many people are
gonna be you know using my project so I
want to make sure that it worked well
for everybody and then if it works
really if it works while under the you
know the amount of users that it uses
I'll be able to decrease that too maybe
it once every 10 minutes the DNS on
refresh and then you once every 5 i've
had it for the past two days running and
once every five minutes refresh or a DoD
Nasri sorry I dns refresh but that
really well but I was because it was
only using the website and there the
server so we'll just have to see how
things go so I'm going to go to this and
I'm just going to type them dead what it
does is it gives me the time so since it
does it every 15 minutes what it means
is it just refresh the DNS one minute
ago so hopefully we did this already
enough we added that new value we added
this new a record into our DNS quick
enough so let's try it so let's do the
anise luck begin and what it does is it
actually going to change because we were
too slow so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to remind me refresh the DNS just
to fit state of the video and I'm going
to run out of snuck up again and as
you'll see it says the address has
changed to the router we pointed our
so if we go to you daddy SVC yeah what's
happened is what actually happened was
this is the page that it uses to display
the eye frames for the refer and as the
browser's cache just hasn't refreshed
which is the reason he's down a struggle
no this chooses the changes immediately
which shows that it's not pointing to
this IP address so that means not in a
minute if I piss this in this is what we
should see when we go to us stunning ass
are you done eswc but we won't take
currently until the browser cache
expires ok and I'm gonna show you how
you can add a subdomain to your doom Ian
so I'm going to create a subdomain
called let's see the end and we want to
leave the dot off and then we want to
set the TTL to 14,400 we're going to
give it to CM IP address as this one
more like odd record so what this does
is does is actually that needs to UM
authorities it says sedi utsw see what
it did is it actually pointed it to the
exact same server but obviously the DNS
needs to refresh again in another 15
minutes so I'm going to do a manual
refresh once more what does is it
refracts the dns and now if i type in
CDN dot you taught me esta vc takes me
to the high code CDN as you can see that
was pretty instant that's because I mind
me to refresh the dns i'm also going to
do one more from the safe google and i'm
going to set 14,400 i'm going to point
it to this which is an IP address for
google if I click Add record and I put
in this address into bar takes me to
represent you to refresh the DNS again
soon questions refresh it obviously I
whenever you make a change you can make
many changes you want within the 15
minutes whatever it just means that
every time you make a change after wait
until the DNS refreshes again which is
every 15 minutes so it say for example
it will refresh @midnight them
15 is past midnight than half an hour
past midnight so that's how you could
sort of work out how long it's going to
take oh yeah and the reason I was just
see if I keep refreshing reason it's not
working is because neither browsers
cached and see if this sort of that it
can't connect to it so if I the only way
I can check this that it's worked as I
go do another nslookup I just put in
Google dot UDS WC and as you see it
points at that IP address but I'll
you'll also notice is there's a lot of
types you can use so you can use and any
DNS type for records to an ass ragged
you can also put in here if you want to
but that's there's no point because
there's a separate point in nameservers
option up here so um that's basically it
so don't worry about now you don't have
to do any of this DNS refresh me I just
do that so that the changes will be
instant because I didn't want to have to
wait 15 minutes between every update I
made you can also delete all the records
and then like this it just deletes
and all the rag are you willing to do
you
okay as you see it delivered to turn
white talk two attempts but it needed a
dart deleted the records and I'll just
say it's the points the swc dns so what
does means is your domain will not it
does this doesn't mean your domains
broken if you take them and your domain
I won't actually work i'll show you an
example so let's just create another one
called let's say he'd say just for hog
code now that's just register this one
really quick so there's a new domain
let's click add a domain and click here
now as you'll see it automatically fills
in this record so whenever you delete
all the records what it actually does is
it replete delete all the records and
replaces it with this ragged so that way
you don't me and we'll actually resolve
still so it resolves to the high code
servers as opposed to your own server so
even if i delete this just click just to
show you some reason it takes two
attempts but ok I'll fix a neutron and
but um let's just refresh the dns and
I'm don't forget I apologize there's any
bugs it's just this was a lot there was
so much back and work that I wasn't even
spend a lot of time on the front end so
there might be a couple of bugs so just
let me know if there is any by sending
me mother Frances of how cool org and
I'll do my best to fix all the bugs that
you guys find so I'm going to do another
Anna slug up now for each seed on eswc
and as you'll see even though I deleted
all the records its tell points 2 192
today at 12 296 so that's it for this
video it wasn't really a tutorial but it
was just me telling you guys but this
new project that I created that you guys
can use it's not only for high co2
scrubbers everybody can use it and also
anybody who wants to do me a con and
you'll be rewarded for your donation
with 50 extra slots for domains so once
again thanks for watching and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
