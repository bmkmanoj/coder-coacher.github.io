is the eleventh part in the end the
remix of the how to make your own social
network series and today we're going to
be doing is we're going to be learning
how to create the profile page so let's
get started so the first thing we need
to do is we need to include the header
file so that's the ink slash header down
in PHP and now what we want to do is we
want to paste in the code to actually
display the user from the database and
we need to get rid of this actually just
oh we're going to open a new PHP block
so you have to put a PHP tag up here now
we need to close it off down here so
what this says is if a sec got you which
means a for example if I go down here in
the browser if we go to proof of the PHP
question mark year we go to equals
Frances at whatever's after this equals
is what will is what gets passed into
the gap variable with if it says got you
so that means anything after the U
equals gets stored in me and got you
variable and that's what we're storing
in the variable username so then what
we're saying is um if the I username
we're actually just tagging the type of
the username to make sure that it's like
violence with atonia alphanumerics so
that way it can't be things like for
example hash the hash tags or commas or
comma a commas or things like that
because it was aren't valid things in
the URL then we want to do is want to
check that the user exists so we're
checking we're selecting the username on
the first name from users where username
equals username so that's just basically
pretty self-explanatory
it gets the first the username of the
first name of the user whose username is
equal to the username variable from up
here which is the anything after the U
equals in the URL then we're checking if
the numbers equals one swift if there
actually is a user his username is equal
to whatever the user name variable up
here is equal to we want to get their
their information like their username on
their first name
if there isn't one we want to echo that
user does not exist so what we're going
to do here is we're going to paste in
this here and it says profile page for
username first name
using our first name so this is just the
basic information we're going to display
about the user at the moment on the
profile but it's specific to every user
so every users at information should be
different so let's refresh the page it
says profile name for and firstly in
managing see since there's nothing
there's no u equals variable there just
like what if I set u equal sorry if I
put in a dollar oh sorry
question mark you and I say equals
Frances okay we have a problem and they
I think the problem is
let's go back to our header down into
PHP file and okay let's
well the reason it's not working is
because I copy this code from the
previous videos because this is a remix
so I just need a use default PHP tags
this time instead of the short PHP tags
so let's try again
jazz first name process profile page for
Francis and now if I put in a user who
doesn't exist so let's say I code so as
user does not exist so let's go back to
Francis so that's it for this video it
was short again but short videos are
easy to watch because there's it's not
so much information all at once but
anyway thanks for watching don't forget
