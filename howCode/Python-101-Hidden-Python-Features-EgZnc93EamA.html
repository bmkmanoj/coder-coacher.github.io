showing you is features in Python that
you may not know existed so the first
one is when you're importing a module
normally you have to well for example if
I was importing the date/time module and
I wanted to use something from it for
example I wanted to print the date I
would say they printed it timed out
did it start today obviously this won't
work because they haven't imported it
yet but that's how I would have to do it
if I imported it using the import
daytime keyword but once you can do is
you can say from the time import it to
import a specific module and I've just
imported that specific part of that
specific function out of the date/time
module and what I can do now is I can
say print date dot tie our deer dot
today and as you can see it prints out
today's did without me needing to the
deer time dot the adopted our deer time
to the beginning of it the next feature
you might not know is when you're
assigning variables normally you would
assign a variable like this
a equals ten B equals 20 C equals 30
whoops 30 and that's the way that you
can do it normally what you can also do
is you could say a comma B comma C
equals and you can just give it three
values so if I wanted to say 40 50 and
60 and hit enter and now if I print any
one of those values forgots for example
if I print a it says a is 40 if I print
feet whoops
if I print B it's 50 and if I print C
it's going to be 60 another feature you
might not have known that you've already
seen me use is whenever you do a command
so say I percent print hello world and
as you can see a printed dog what I can
do now is I can press the up arrow and
as you can see this cursor well it's it
moves around if I press up and down but
what you might not know is if I hit
enter whenever I have it over a command
it will pierce that command into the
sort of octave area that I can type in
and if I hit enter again it runs the
command like normal another feature you
may not know exists is the ability to
take a chunk of a list and assign map to
a variable so for example I could say
list equals shop that's a keyword so
I'll just say L equals it's on C C++ and
Java now I just print you'll get we
expect we'll get a list printed out but
what I can do now is I can say I said
piece
actually I'll call it just chunk equals
al but then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to give it the two indexes the
index I wanted to start on and the index
I wanted to end on so if I give it index
1 comma 2 what it's going to do is it's
going to take C and C++ and then it's
gonna assign map to chunk so I hit enter
I print chunk over whoops I actually
have to do I go to 3 because what I want
to do is I want to get everything in
between so I want to get C C++ and jet
are and I want to exclude Java but I
have to put in an extra one because for
some reason actually this should work
but it doesn't I mean it's not that it
should work in Python but if you think
about it this is the 0th element this is
the first element this is the second and
this is the third or this is the fourth
actually well the fourth item in the
list with the third element in the list
if you cut from 0 and what I did was 1
to 2 so this is the first and this is
the second so you would assume since it
kind of the first element they would
also cut in second but it off C doesn't
so you have to add on an additional one
and like if I print chunk as you'd see
it gives me there was two items so
another feature in Python that you may
not have known about is the ability to
start an HTTP server from anywhere on
your computer so what I've done here is
I've just created a folder of my desktop
called in hello and inside it I made a
file called index.html and if I just
show you that that's what that's all the
text in the file
just as hello from Python so what I'm
gonna do now isn't gonna start the HTTP
server on port 5000 and I'm gonna hit
enter and as you can see our are the HD
the HTTP server just started so since
this server started let's go to the bro
and let's look at that file so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna go to localhost
port 5000 and as you can see it says
hello from Python shows me that file and
I can prove that's the file by well I
can you can see in the terminal that
this is the request to the HTTP server
so what I'll do is I'll stop that for
now then what I'll do is actually before
I restart that I'm gonna go edit this
file and I'll just hold tags around it
so I can just I put that again you'd see
this is the new file now you start
server again and refresh let's can see
now the text is broken so that's it for
this video don't forget to Like comment
