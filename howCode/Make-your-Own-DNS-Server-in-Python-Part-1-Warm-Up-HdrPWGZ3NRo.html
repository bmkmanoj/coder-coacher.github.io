doing is learning how to create our own
DNS server so some of you are probably
wondering what a DNS server is if you've
ever gone on any website like haiku org
for example or Wikipedia or any other
website when you type in haiku org
you're connecting to another computer
the computer that hosts haiku org but in
order to connect to that computer you
need to know its IP address DNS is
pretty much just a big massive
distributed address book when you type
in haiku org DNS will go to haiku org
and I'll find the IP address of that
server I'll send it back to you and it
does this all behind the scenes and you
can actually don't even know what's
happening if we right-click on a webpage
we go to inspect if we go to the network
tab of the developer tools and we
refresh the page we can see all of the
requests that are made by the page if I
scroll up to the top here you can see
that haiku org is the first request and
everything else is just style sheets and
things like that and if I click on this
and I go to timing it shows the DNS
lookup and this is what happens in order
to find the IP address then we try to
make the initial connection and in hi
code.org case we try to connect via SSL
DNS servers are distributed which means
anybody can operate their own DNS server
and when you go to haiku org you go into
the hi code DNS servers and you're
actually going to collide further
because that's the company that hosts
the heiko DNS records but when you
connect to a website you're connecting
to that websites DNS servers so we can
create our own DNS server to serve
whatever we want so now we know what DNS
is used for let's have a look at a DNS
request DNS is different to other
protocols say for example he HTTP HTTP
is the protocol used by the web this is
it over here that is a text-based
protocol and to DNS is a binary protocol
so you're probably wondering what the
difference between the two are so I'm
just going to show you so if we go to
haiku org and we go to the network tab
again we click on the request that was
made to actually get the web page which
is the first one we can see these
headers and we can see actual text this
is what an actual HTTP request would
look like this is what an actual HTTP
request looks like it's not some decoded
version but to send a DNS request you
have to actually send the raw binary the
ones and zeroes and to get any sort of
output like this with the DNS request
you have to decode it so we can use a
program called a packet sniffer to see
what the DNS request looks like because
what it does is it records
every packet that's moving about on our
network so in order to get a packet
sniffer we're going to go to Wireshark
org and we're going to download
Wireshark it's really easy to install so
I'm not going to show you just a simple
installer
once you have Wireshark installed you
can open it up and this is what it looks
like if we want to monitor the traffic
that's leaving this computer that I'm
using no and it's actually going on to
the Internet we want to use the Wi-Fi
tab but since we're building a DNS
server on our local computer we want to
use what's called the loopback and this
is just essentially the traffic moving
from one part of my computer to the
other if you've ever used xampp or a
local web server you'll be familiar with
the loopback which is just your local
computer if you've ever used xampp and
you've heard of 127.0.0.1
that's your loopback address so if I
just double click on this so what
Wireshark is doing now is it's capturing
any packets that my computer sends to
itself so that I will actually leave my
computer and the way I'm going to show
this is if I go to terminal I have two
terminal windows the first one here is
where I'm going to open up the DNS
server that I created the prototype
version before this series and I'm going
to show you how it works and this second
terminal is going to be used to actually
send a DNS request so this is like the
client and this is the server so I'm
going to start the server I'm going to
type in Python 3 and I'm going to run
DNS pi if I run this I'm going to get an
hour you can see it says permission
denied that's because DNS runs on port
53 and we're trying to buy into port 53
and if you try to buy into a port less
than or equal to 80 it won't let you so
we have to type in sudo python 3 DNS
type a and put in my password and
neither server is running so now what we
need to do is send the DNS request from
the client so we do that using a program
called a dig so we're going to say dig
and we're going to type it into haiku
org and normally if I just hit enter
this is what this will do is send a
request off to the actual hike org DNS
servers and these are the actual live
DNS servers this is their IP address
that they've returned for haiku org but
what we want to do is want to send this
request to a specific DNS server namely
the DNS server I'm running in this
window which is running on my local
computer so the way we do that is we say
dig haiku org just like before but then
we put the odd sign and we say 127.0.0.1
if we hit enter this will send the
request to the server running on my
local computer if I hit enter you can
see we got a different answer the actual
answer we would have got is this these
are the two IP addresses Clyde where I
provide websites running on cloud floor
but the answer my local DNS server
provided is this one here which is
obviously a not correct is just a reply
to show that it's coming from a
different DNS server what's more we can
also have a look at the Wireshark I put
if I just stop that by hitting that I've
just stopped it capturing any more
packets and it's at one packet as a
request and it got one packet back as a
response but you can see the response is
bigger the length of the response is 77
bytes that the length of the request is
61 so if I open this it says domain name
system this is a decoded version of the
data that was sent and this is the
actual data that was sent well this is
the actual deal with sent this blue
highlighted by the other data that isn't
blue you know is just stuff that isn't
actually relevant to our DNS server and
this is a decoded version of the query
and this is the raw data but as you can
see it's it's a binary if I just convert
it into actual bits this is the actual
binary that was sent by the client which
is the program that I run here called
dig and here is the actual query that's
been decoded by Wireshark this is what
it actually looks like and now if I go
up to the top here and click on the
other packet this is the response we got
back which is the response that our DNS
server the DNS server I'm running here
that was written in Python actually sat
back and this is the raw binary that
it's at back so you can see here this is
the question stamp but here's the answer
this is what we got displayed in dig you
can see the IP address 255 to 255 255
255 so that's just a basic overview of
what a DNS request looks like and how
DNS works and in the next video we're
going to be starting implementing our
DNS server so thanks for watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
