how to create a really simple password
strength checker so you can see here is
my password box here is a progress bar
and as I type you can see it starts to
fill up so when we have one character
it's 20% full when we put a second
character and it becomes 40% full but
now if I put in a third character since
it's still only a ladder
the progress bar isn't gonna get any
fuller so we put in a few more ladders
you can see it doesn't change anything
but now if I put in a number you can see
our password got a wee bit more
complicated
and now the progress bar has increased
to 60% if I add even more numbers you
can see that makes no difference to the
complexity of the password and as such
the progress bar doesn't get any bigger
so what I can do is I can put in a
special character like a question mark
and now you can see that the progress
bar is that even follow to 80% now
because now we have an even more
complicated password and then finally I
can put in another character like an
exclamation mark and that's gonna fill
up the entire progress bar because now
we have a sufficiently complex password
so this whole system is really easy to
create it's built using just pure
JavaScript and it doesn't take very long
to do so let's get started so here's our
HTML page you can see we have our
password text box and we have our
progress bar and the progress bar has a
maximum value of 100 and a minimum value
of zero but what the actual work comes
in is down here when we create our
JavaScript so what we do is we create a
variable to store the password box which
is our input box then what we do is we
add an event listener to that so that
every time we lift the key up we're
gonna run this function called check
password and to that function we pass
the value that's been typed into this
text box then what we do is we actually
check the password so we check password
function takes the password that we
typed in the box it gets our strength
bar which is what we call our progress
bar which is this bar down here and it
sets a default strength of zero then
what it does is it checks to see if the
password matches this regular expression
and if it does it increases the strength
by one so what this regular expression
does is it says the first character of
the string has to be alphanumeric so
it's the edges add or zero to nine and
it can be upper or lower case that we
said there has to be at least one other
character
possibly more that's where the plus
means at least one and that also has to
be after numeric then what we do is we
match this regular expression
which matches the tilde the greater-than
less-than sign and the question mark and
if we see one or more occurrences of any
of these characters in the password we
increase the strength by one the end
what we do is we match another regular
expression and this regular expression
matches all these characters and if it
sees them and if it sees one or more of
any of those characters and increases
the strength by one then finally what we
do is we check the passwords length if
it's greater than five we increase the
strength by one then what we do is we've
run a switch statement on the strength
so if the strength is zero which means
we've typed a character but it doesn't
match any of these regular expressions
we're going to set the progress bar like
the progress bar is value to 20 if it
matches one of these regular expressions
we're going to increase it to 40 if it
matches two of them we're going to
increase it to 60 if it matches three of
them it's gonna be 80 and only if it
matches all the regular expressions
under the length is greater than five
we're gonna say the password strength is
100% which which in our eyes is the most
secure password we can have and
obviously you might want to change this
to suit your own needs but that's pretty
much it for the entire function it's a
really simple function and it's really
easy to implement and you can see if I
start to delete ladders and make the
password less secure you can see the
progress bar starts to shrink but that's
it for this really simple video thanks
