we're going to be doing is we're gonna
be creating the video watch page so that
that way whatever someone uploads a
video people can actually watch it so
let's get started so as you can see here
this is where we left off this is the
video watch page it just displays a hat
or to tag but displays the title of the
video nothing else we can't actually
watch it so what we're gonna do first is
we're an upload a video because at the
end of the last video before I give out
the source code I just deleted it so
that could I could have shrink the size
of the source code so that it wasn't
uploaded RM including random mp4 files
from the tutorial so we just need to
read upload one so that we actually have
a video to watch so I'm just gonna go to
upload dot PHP I'm gonna give it a title
of this is my video this is just a short
description to tell you want my video is
a bite keywords don't matter at this
moment just say this is my video this is
I don't know we don't even need to use
them again that have a keyword my name
there I wouldn't set it to public Elmi
you'll click Choose file so we click
Choose file and we upload it okay this
is it okay we've I used our own errors
and our checking against us so we just
need to delete this and then come back
and try it again so this is my video
this is just a short description let's
just leave it at that
and keywords we can just take them again
public on choose file it's not like
upload the upload was successful and we
refresh the videos table and then go to
the prize cut our table we can see that
we've got one row and here's our new
video
I don't we check and it's been uploaded
because it's stored in our file here so
what we want to do is we want to
actually display it so what I'm gonna go
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna copy the
video ID I'm gonna go to watch dot PHP
question mark video ID equals and paste
it in so now I this loads up the video
page for our video on it says this is my
video so that's how we can check so what
we want to do is we want to actually
display it so we'll come down here it's
where everything gets displayed and
we're gonna use the HTML the html5 video
tag for now and we're gonna use
JavaScript and things in a few later
videos to actually make the player
custom so that it's our own player so
we're gonna do is we're gonna put in the
video and another video tag and then
we're going to do is want to set the
width and the height so we'll set width
equals 320 or a floor eighty on the
height 320 so that's just a standard
video for a sad 480p video okay so I'm
it's not actually that it says 640 by
480 okay so I actually made a mistake
it's actually for our F for any high and
if 260 853 across what was actually 853
point 333 ever occurring but 853
so what this means is it's for any high
so it's for any pay is like the pixel
resolution the width is 853 pixels and
what this does is it sets it in a 16:9
aspect ratio so if we were to keep this
at 640 it would be like a square so it
would be a four by three aspect ratio
and we want a widescreen so we do this
so that it's sixteen by nine and then we
would do is we set source SRC here we're
gonna put in the a source of the video
so we need to just add a new variable up
here so then you source equals row I
think I called it file location so then
we just go in here we echo it out
it's not about echoing it it's just
going to take the value from the
database and place it in the source and
then the video tag on the word luck for
the video and we also have to specify
the type so since mine's an mp4 it's
video slash mp4 and that's it if we want
we can have multiple sources so that if
a browser doesn't support video before
playing we can use a different video
source but to keep it simple I'm just
going to keep it at before because that
would mean we'd have to upload multiple
versions of the video would convert them
in things which will make things a lot
more complicated we might do that after
the series is over just add some more
extra things to it but for now I will
leave it at 40 or adding that before for
the video type and what we can also do
is we can say leave a message to say
that your browser doesn't support html5
video if the users browser doesn't so
what we do is we just come in here and
set the video tag and say your bra's
your browser doesn't support whoops the
html5 video tag so what does well the
reason we put it inside the video tag is
because then that means that lonely get
it'll only be displayed if the users
video tag if it only be displayed in a
browser that doesn't display the video
tag and then the actual source will go
on top of it if the a browser does
support it so let's go into the browser
and refresh and here's our video it
starts to play but we don't actually
have any controls or anything and the
reason we are seeing the black bars is
because I've shrunk down my actual
window to the size of 480 by 863 it's
for the YouTube video so if we want to
we can expand it and okay
the reason okay so it's probably just
doing it because the video itself might
be at a weird resolution so it doesn't
matter for now we'll leave it if it does
actually cause problems we'll fix it
later but it's probably just because the
video I uploaded it is bad so let's move
on so we need actually add controls to
this video player so when you just go
over here and we say controls and we
don't actually give it a value or
anything we just literally write
controls and we refresh and here we see
we have the video controls and now we
can click play and it plays we can click
this and it makes fullscreen and it just
allows us to play the video ok so that
just to make sure our video doesn't take
up so much space I'll actually shrink it
so it becomes 320 by I don't know 240
maybe just to make it really small okay
there you're not that small 480 by 320
and then that's a I suppose it's big
enough so now what we want to do is we
want to add the description here so
let's do that now just create a div I'll
set the style equal to salute laughs and
we'll just say this is some text okay
add that because that's doing that
because this is float:left and this
isn't so ensure that if we bring up the
a given chrome dev tools it's actually
pretty cool what we can do is we just go
inside the wrapper and as you can see
here we have our div here that says
float:left and we have our video
container here so what we can do is we
can let's say change this to right and
it puts it over there and on the other
side of the video but that's what we
want so we want to do is we need that a
left and then what we're gonna do is
we're just going to copy this div and
put it above here and then close the div
here so what this does is it makes them
both float laughs so let's do this now
another description is on this side but
the reason I brought up the dev tools is
also because we can do some really cool
things CSS and it makes them way more
interesting to actually do so what we
want to do is we're going to add some
more style to it so we're going to set
up margin:0px with zero pixels zero
pixels zero pixels so as you can see now
that
see the point is that a zero pixel
margin around the edge of the day
because it already does have a zero
pixel margin but we want to do is we
just want to add a pixel margin to the
left-hand side which is here so we're
gonna set a five pixel margin on the
left and just in case you're wondering
this is top this is right this is bottom
and this is left to a goes clockwise
around we hit enter and for some reason
let's see okay so for some reason we
have a margin okay it's because the
video messed up it's actually because
the player actually extends all the way
over and you can see sort of it's kind
of difficult but if I pull this down you
can see sort of that this sort of goes
all the way up to here which is that why
we have these sort of it looks like we
have a margin but we don't actually just
again because of this rubbish video so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna add
the margin on so I don't know why that
didn't work the first time but let's try
it again
so let's just go in here and actually go
in here actually and say I'm margin they
were pixel zero pixels the pixels and
then five pixels and as you can see that
sort of pushed it over you can see even
more if we go unchanged up to fifty it
we change this you can see it moves so
I'll leave it five we'll set a border of
one pixel solid and we will set the
color of the border to a gray and then
hit the yes there we go a lot of a movie
a dining do another one so we're gonna
do is we also change the background
color so background color is equal to
four now we'll leave it at f2 f2 f2
because it's a light gray and it's sort
of much as the other things we've done
and we allowed the semicolon and moved
on and some more so I'll add some
padding normal ads and padding
everywhere that's a five pixels we will
set a minimum height of 100 pixels ice
about tight wrong minimum height 100
pixels whoops
width and the way it's gonna be in our
of 200 pixels we actually how we have a
bit more room for more so we'll set 300
that's about it so what was theirs we'll
just copy the Styles so we'll come down
here and we'll just paste them in here
we'll leave them in line for night it's
not that important at the moment I mean
but use if you were gonna put us on your
website you would probably want to put
them in an external style sheet and just
because it makes things load faster and
it makes things tidy or and easier to
work with but for this tutorial it's
already that important so what we want
to do what we'll do now then just acts
out of the developer tools or one just
refresh and as you can see the change we
made stayed because we added them to our
actual file and then we want to do up
here is instead of saying this is just
some text we're gonna copy this and then
paste in the description so video
description so it just
description this is just a short
description we're also going to some
some just some text above it to say what
it is so a paragraph tag then make the
text bold in your description and then
here's our description so one more thing
we'll do is we'll add the when you call
them tags to the venue alright just put
all the description so we'll just copy
all this video tags and then change this
to keywords I think okay I'm going to
change a couple of things about this
which isn't gonna be that hard really
so we'll just get rid of the paragraph
tag and what we'll also do is change the
CSS so we'll do that inside chrome again
because it makes it a wee bit more fun
and it's easier because we can see
everything in real time so the only
major thing we need to change let's come
down here is the minimum height we can
actually just turn it off and see it
goes away and it looks a bit better and
here what we want to do is we since we
set the border up here we can also
override it below it so we can have
override specific parts of the border so
for example we can overwrite the border
top and saying none and what this will
do is it will remove the border on the
top but it'll keep all the border styles
for all the other and the left right in
the bottom borders so that's it and what
we'll do is we don't actually need to
copy that
we can just delete it in here so over
here we remove the minimum height
and come over to the border on say
border-top:none and refresh and our
changes have stayed so that's basically
it for the event for this video what
we'll do in the next videos will
probably be probably be doing like
comments or something for videos so I'm
making a button to subscribe to channels
or something like that to make the watch
page a bit better or even video views
which we could actually do now so what
we'll do now is video views actually
before we go
so I'll just say copy this and paste it
in and say video views okay that's not
actually a variable whoops that's just
one of the tabs stopped working so I
would open a new one um so it's just
views actually what will get a code out
is just a number zero which is over
there so what we want to do is we just
want to display it in light or and we
just make it easy ourselves let's write
it in another Dave set the style equal
to salute laugh clips and then close the
Dave okay don't you just put a break
tiger paragraph tag in here just for
simplicity whoops my game um okay let's
just go into the game of chrome
developer tools again and we'll see
what's going on and we'll fix it in real
time so we'll go open all these up
so here's the views one we'll just click
on here and we can add it the style so
I'll set the width to 300 pixels and
there we go it's and we've done so well
that we can even okay now I'll be fine
for nine oh no and we have font size
could be 16 pixels to make it big and we
could say I'm margin on again we want to
fight pixel margin from the right and
also whoops font-weight:bold and
sixteenth of a big maybe so like 14
pixels so that's good let's keep that
we'll just copy this I'll keep doing
that sorry
and okay so what we want to do is just
delete this and paste it in and I'm just
eating it up we've it okay and what we
want to do is just say video views or
the whoops
it just says zero views and pub views
after it so there it says the zero views
and what we want to do is when we open
the pointer when we actually go on the
page we just want to update the database
and set views equal to views plus one so
that's really easy so we'll just create
a query called update views and set it
equal to MySQL query update videos set
the views equal to views plus one
we're video video ID equals video ID so
that should work when we refresh the
page this should not whoops I should run
that it should just update our videos
all right very views for that video so
we should just say it
say one when we refresh and then two and
then three so let's refresh okay so it
didn't update let's just set it to equal
to one and we'll change this to video ID
without the underscore okay why it's not
no more okay so I find the error we can
actually put that back that wasn't a
problem and we can set us back to views
plus 1 the problem was if we as you can
see here I just put in the MySQL error
just on the end of the query so we can
see what was wrong with it and here's
the problem it's looking for the column
with the title of the video ID which is
incorrect we want it should be actually
looking for okay so know what the
problem was was just because we didn't
surround that in quotations or a single
quotes so if we click it now when we
refresh okay and the reason that it's
not actually updating is because for
some reason it doesn't like views +1 in
the query so what we'll do is we'll just
say new views and then here we'll just
say new views equals views
one so now if we refresh it says five
years six view seven views news and as
you can see our view contour is working
so that's it for this video don't forget
