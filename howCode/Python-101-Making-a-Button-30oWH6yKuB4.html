video so basically before you start I
just want to apologize further being
such I am a big gap between add Python
videos because it's been something
ridiculous like seven or eight months um
and the reason for that is a rush isn't
really good reason I just decided to
focus on other series is like series
like YouTube
I mean how to making on YouTube or learn
JavaScript or learn PHP or something
like that as opposed to the Python one
so for that I apologize and I'm gonna
start making these videos again um
because I decided whenever I made the
how to make your own domain extension
series that I kind of wanted to start
doing your old series that I did again
that I didn't want to just make how to
make your own YouTube videos along with
other ones so that's what we're gonna be
learning in Python today how to make
your how to make a button for your
window like we in the last video we
created our own window and in this video
we're going to be adding a button to
learn new and also this video is in 720p
like all the rest of my videos have been
recently so this is the first Python 101
video in 720p HD so this just means that
I can make the text bigger and it should
be clearer overall one final thing is
I'm using Python three point three point
two as opposed to Python 2.7 and that's
just because the last the reason I
decided to use Python 3 2.7 in the last
and the last time into videos is because
I thought there was that better well
there is actually better a library
support in Python 2.7 but Python 3 is
where we don't wait by thon 3 is going
to be the new standard shim so we have
to start using it and also we're not we
don't actually use any libraries really
in these videos so it doesn't really
matter to us anyway so let's get started
with the video today so today we're
gonna be doing is creating a button on
our a window in Python so that's what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna type in from
take a enter which is the library import
all or which is do we asterisks and what
this basically says is just import
everything to take into your library and
the last
video I made and on Python the on Hana
make a window and Python CIT can or
think how to capital T because in Python
2.7 has a carbonyl team like this but in
Python 3
it's a lowercase T then we want to say
is a creative are called master and set
it equal to Tk so just ignore that for
now that doesn't really matter
not just basically means this is like
the TK sort of just our window thing but
like that and then the master is just
variable we're assigning to it and then
we want to say is we want to set button
equals the button function and the
button function has a capital b and the
button function is three parameters the
first one is master which is the
variable we created up here second one
is what we want the text on the button
to me to say so what I'm going to say is
text equals close window and then
finally command equals a close window
and what the command is just a function
that we want to run whenever the buttons
click and then what I have to do is I
have to say I add button dot pack which
is adds it to the window that I have to
save me and loop which is just a
function called me and if that I want to
run which basically just means that
program is going to run and then up here
I actually have to define the function
close window so I say def close window
and then what I want to say is X Z so
what this does is it creates a window
but the button on the window that says
close window whenever I click the button
it runs this command which is a function
called close window it exits the program
so I hit f5 nine as you can see now we
have a window in the corner of here oops
just bring this time and if I click on
close window shows you sure when it
close the program still running click OK
and it exposes everything I so that's it
for this Python 101 video I know it's
been quite short but that's all we
wanted to cover in this video it was
just how to create a button on your
window so once again thanks for watching
don't forget to Like comment favorite
and subscribe and I will making way more
Python 101 videos and once again I
apologize for the lack of videos the
last couple of months on Python 101 so
once again thanks for watching and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
