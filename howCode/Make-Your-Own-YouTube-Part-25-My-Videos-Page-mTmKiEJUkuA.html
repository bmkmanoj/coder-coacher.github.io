get into this video I just wanted to
apologize for the lack of videos for the
last and month and a half nearly the
reason for that is because my I bought a
new computer because the old one was too
slow and I couldn't make HD videos on it
so I bought a new one just so I can make
better bit better videos and things on
everything worked great for the first
week or whatever and then the computer
seems to just die and I fixed it and
then it broke again and then I fix it in
Bergen so then I decided to send it back
and then I got a replacement just but
they only got there isn't a couple of
days ago so and I could have made videos
but I could have but I would hide to use
the old one which would mean going back
on what I said in the new video is were
everybody was gonna be 720p and I would
have to go back to for 480p so I didn't
want to do that so I decided I'd leave
it until the new one Kian because I
didn't want to upload videos now warmed
in HD anymore not because of that
there's been images with no videos and
that to sort of I'd like to just
apologize for that also from now on I'm
gonna try and upload way more videos
than used to do I'm gonna try and upload
a lot more every week and I was
previously doing and apart from that
well that's really over the night go to
settings before we get started so let's
just get into this video so today we're
going to be doing is we're gonna be
doing two things we're gonna be starting
off with the video watch page like on
YouTube and we're also going to be doing
a thing called them well we're just
going to be making something called the
vanity URL which is basically just for
example whoops if you come to my website
here I'll show you what want what I've
got any beer rallies so and here's my
website here and if we click on library'
and then go to learn HTML or whatever as
you can see now it says hi code for size
learn for - intro to HTML and this is
called a vanity URL because whenever you
click on these these aren't actually all
different pages if you're if you're
familiar with PHP HD access and things
you probably already knew that but these
aren't
individual pages these are just dynamic
pages that
that I gave better URLs because it
looked better in search engines and it
just makes the URL look nicer so that's
we're gonna be adding to our video
website we're gonna be doing creating it
so that we can do /watch forward slash
and then the video ID so my keys let's
go to this video it's copy and then this
is what it would look like and then this
would take us to our video so that's
we're gonna be doing first so as you can
see here I have a new file and I'm just
going to save it in the folder and I'm
gonna call it ok we actually have a
htaccess I should have checked first so
we have whoops that's just my website
doesn't matter just go into tutorials
video box and here's our he axis I
didn't realize we had one okay um oh we
already did this so we're gonna just
change something we're going to copy
this we're going to say slash watch
slash watch stuff PHP or incest watch
and then over here we just me change
this from channel to punch out PHP then
we're gonna go want to do is we want to
come into the washed-up PHP page there
it is and we're just gonna drag it in
here and it says video ID so this is
what we need to copy I'll just close up
and then we just change this from say to
video ID because this is the argument we
want to pass tonight if we go type this
in we hit enter
hopefully it okay yeah it worked it
brought up our video and it has a value
around the line and obviously you can
change this to whatever you want you
don't even have to use the watch you
could literally get rid of it and just
keep it like that but I think it's
better to have a watch or video or
something and in front of it so now
that's done we're gonna go on to the
next part of the video which is creating
the end my videos page we won't get the
whole my videos page done in this video
but will hopefully get some of the time
so we're gonna save this on my menus
HP
and then the first thing we need to do
is when you did include our RM our
header file so we're just going to pick
a page challenge something and drag it
in and then we're just maybe Hatter I'm
not echh so the first thing we want to
do now that we've got a header in place
is we want to create a MySQL query and
we're just going to say get user or mean
I get videos equals maestro underscore
query select all videos were uploaded by
equals and then oops the user variable
is the variable that way I passed from
the header file so if I go to includes
and I click on the header click and drag
there if I act go there and I you'll see
we have we assigned the session username
variable to a variable called user
so now that we've done that we want to
first want to get the mice the odd
number of you know sorry we want to get
the end a total number of videos the
user has uploaded so that's easy the
first what we have to do is really just
say if 0 and we want to just echo
we'll add kill the page so say die you
haven't loaded video yet now the other
thing I wanna say is else and this is
where we run the journey about code then
we need to assign the knock'em da sorry
can't talk to ya we need to assign the
number always variable 2x0 num rows get
videos and then what we want to do is we
just want to otherwise echo videos so
let's try it now what we should see his
videos
oh yeah I didn't see it says videos we
change this mm to zero just to see what
the other code would look like we just
change it change the meaning of it nun
says you haven't uploaded any videos yet
so that's good and we want to keep that
as equal zero and then we want to do is
come in here and then create a while
loop
now we're gonna loop through all the
videos we find in there yeah videos
table so we're gonna say in row equals
MySQL fetch Assoc eight is already and
we're gonna say yet videos and then we
want to do is we just want to say video
slash probably title equals video
alright time it's probably that I can't
remember since if it's so long since I
made a video then we're just gonna act
title for each one of them and because
there's more than moment I'm great
timing so as we can see when we can it
just makes it easier to read for us so
we refresh ok on to find the next tile
so obviously in the videos table title
is not one of the column headings and
it's actually video underscore title
doesn't see it says test video and
actually we only have one video I just
realized we only have one video in the
database but as you see it is showing up
so let's get in here
whoops
so what we want to do is we just want to
get the other rose from the table so
let's just is this a couple of times
you
so um let's go back here oh yeah we
actually need to get the column on the
column headings so the first ones video
description and the video keywords and
all the middle ones so let's just just
I'm just a shortened to the ESC and
change this to sorry video description
and then video keywords changes to video
keywords uploaded by purse and you have
loaded so
and then we're just going to leave it at
dinner uploaded ok so then obviously
won't see any change to the page so what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to say
a coup
all right let's add the ESC
I'm also going to hand on a break tag
you
so there's our video in our video
description our video tighten our video
description showed up okay so that's all
I can also only gonna say in this video
because unfortunately I wanted one of
the new things I want to do is I want to
keep all the videos in and around
between 10 15 minutes long and I don't
want to make half an hour and on videos
because people obviously I'm gonna watch
them all because they might not have
half an hour to watch them so I'm gonna
keep them short of shorter than they
used to be my gonna upload more
frequently to make up for two there
won't be any less content it'll just be
more saturated a wee bit so and that's
