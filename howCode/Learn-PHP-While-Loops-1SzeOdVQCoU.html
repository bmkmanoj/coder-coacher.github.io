the title suggests this is a learn PHP
video so it's been a long time since i
made a learn PHP video but i'm going to
start making them again soon well
hopefully let me make all of me a few of
them by the time you see this video and
i will also be making more of the
questions answered videos I'm just
having a chance lately so I without any
further ado let's get started so I have
a blank PHP file apart from the opening
and closing PHP tags and today we're
going to be learning about is wild
statements so what this stuff means is
while something equals are a while okay
while something is something then we do
something else so for example while 1
equals 1 you can get your wire loop to
do something and since one always equals
1 it will just live forever um okay I'll
just tag it started with an example so
um so let's say while okay we could get
it to print using a while loop winging
out our bringing a page Peter print out
a sentence as many times as you want or
we can get it to do something as many
times as we want or until something
doesn't equal something any anymore
which what I mean by that is if we did
one equals one would loop forever but um
that's what it's designed to do so if we
if we don't want to live forever we have
to change we have to make it so that
it's false because of a wild loop equals
true then it will be forever if until
until the condition equals false so that
was probably too complicated I didn't
really understand it myself but I'm just
going to show you an example so if we
create a variable and create a string
inside of it called my string
and inside the my string variable I'm
just going to put a string and I'm just
going to say this is my string so I'm
going to print it as well so if i print
my string we at printed out this is my
string or echo I've been doing a lot of
Python programming lately so i use back
of our print a lot but a CO and print
print in a core basically the same
except echo is a very very very slightly
quicker so I just use it instead usually
but it doesn't really make firm conduct
conventional purposes they're basically
the scene so here's a here's my string
printed on the page once because Iraq
without the page once because that's all
I told it advice to angle it I don't
know how many times is that six times
and refresh the page you can tag about
six times what we could do that with a
while loop so now what if we wanted it
to print out six times that were really
easy with a while loop because all we
have to say is while and we could set
wild current is less than sex then echo
my string whoops my string on just to
make it a bit easier to read we're going
to append I'd break on the end of it so
now we're going to so i hear what we're
going to do is we're just going to go to
the we're just going to go below the
string variable that we're going to
create a new one called cunt now we're
going to ask that that equal to zero so
um imaginary let's just see what happens
nine so you can see the page takes a
long long time to load and I'm not even
sure if it will
because the reason is because current
equals 0 up here and we've said while
conscious less than six but we wanted to
print it out six times but we haven't
done anything to make kind more than six
so it's just going to keep going and as
you can see it won't stop loading so to
fix this all we have to do is say kind
plus plus so what this does is whatever
this mile loop executes it says is
comment vas than six since up here we
set it to 0 0 is less than six so then
what we're telling you to do is increase
count the count variable by one so a
manacle my string of the break at the
end so what this means is when we
increase it by one the next time this
while loop loops it's going to say is
kind less than six and icons going to
equal 1 1 is less than six so that we
yeah so then we run this loop again and
it's going to do that until can t equals
six okay here's our result as you can
see since it looked forever the only
reason it stopped is because I told it
to stop reloading the page but no
actually see it prints it six times
because what it does is it says is car
less than six when current equals zero
yes then we move on and I can't equals
since we increased it by one current at
this stage canticles 11 is less than six
then we do it again so now count equals
to 2 is less than sex and it keeps going
until whoops until the count variable is
equal to six we can prove this by saying
a space then good just echo count aside
my string so as you can see my string 1
2 3 4 5 6
and if we said less than or equal to 6
we'll just echo one more on top so
that's really it for a while statements
and may not sigh what they are usually
used for for checking something a lot of
times and things like that but well
they're use not for checking things but
they used for whenever we want to loop
over something certain number of times
we do something like this with a while
loop may count variable and then we just
increase it every time we loop it until
we get to our desired number so that's
it for this video don't forget to

see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
