learning about a really special feature
in directors so directress is a built-in
dynamic thumbnail so what that means is
I upload one image I upload say for
example this large image here it is here
if I click on that you can see this is
the size of the image it's quite big but
what I can do is I can dynamically
generate a thumbnail which is a smaller
version of this image that's going to
use less it's not going to take up any
additional space and it we done
instantaneously for us by directors so
I'm going to show you how to do that in
this video
so the first thing you have to do is go
into our configuration file so we go to
our configuration file and then we
scroll down
keep scrolling down until we find the
part of the configuration file that
talks about our thumbnails so you can
see here we have an item called
thumbnail and here's where we have all
of our settings for dealing with
thumbnails so the first one is the 404
image location so this is the image
that's displayed if a thumbnail doesn't
exist so if I type in slash thornmail
and I hit enter I didn't want any of the
correct parameters in so you can see we
get image not available this is the
image that's displayed when we when we
try to access a thumbnail it doesn't
exist
the next part is the supported thumbnail
dimensions so these by default are all
commented out because there are non
supported by default for security
reasons so what we want to do is we want
to enable the size of a thumbnail that
we actually need so what I'm going to do
is just enable a 300 by 200 and one cool
thing is directors will never stretch or
distort your thumbnails either which is
also a really nice property of directa
system nearer the next thing is the
supported quality tag so we can choose
per good better and best and you can see
here are the values beside them so if we
wanted to see if bandwidth we could
choose poor and we and if we really just
cared about quality and nothing else we
could choose best and we could also
define custom words that map to a custom
number so for example I can have a
number in between 50 and 75 and I can
have another word that map stood up the
next thing is the supported actions
because when you have your thumbnail
with two actors you can choose whether
to crop the thumbnail or to contain it
was just amused to shrink it down so if
you contain the thumbnail you have a
couple of extra options you have an
option called resize canvas position
resize relative and canvas background
have a crop you have the option to
choose a position so for the position
all that means if we were to crop the
image it would crop from the center of
the image so resize canvas means if you
get an image that is weird to mansions
that don't really fit into the 300 by
200 that we've allocated what dragged us
will do is to make sure it doesn't have
to resize your image or stretch it what
it will do is will try to fit your image
within a to 300 by 200 block any bets
for the rays in action image will have a
background color of gray in this case
you could choose another color if you
wanted to position just means
whereabouts on the image it gets resized
from so in this case it's going down
from the center so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna actually take a look at
this so we have our image here and what
we want to do is we want to specify the
dimensions of the image so in this case
it's going to be 300 by 200 because that
is the only dimensions that we enabled
next we have to choose whether we want
to crop the image or contain the image
so I'm going to choose crop and I'm
gonna choose a quality of bad
so now if I hit enter you can see we got
our thumbnail and a stroke down to 300
by 200 pixels what I can do now if I
change the quality from best to per
we're gonna see a dramatic decrease in
the quality of the image so you'd see
now the compression on the image
increased a lot so the image itself is a
lot smaller but the quality is also a
lot worse so now we're gonna change our
image to contain and you see the image
quality we still have set to power but
you can see continue is containing the
image if I was to choose crop you'll see
it'll change now you can see it's cut
off the corners of the image so we're
going to do is change that back to best
I have a really high quality thumbnail
and finally we're gonna look at our last
image and if I change it to something
maybe not maybe not per maybe I want to
change it to too good and you can see
the quality dropped a wee bit but the
image size is also shrunk quite a lot so
that's what a really quick look at the
directors thumbnail er so before we go
we're gonna add a new excepted thumbnail
dimension so we're gonna allow
thumbnails of 100 by 100 pixels so in a
configuration file we go into the hop
scroll down and you can see at the
minute we only allow 300 by 200 but
we're gonna do is allow 100 by 100 we're
gonna save that so now I'll make it a
bit more obvious when we crop an image
so you can see here I have a full size
image so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to crop it to 100 by 100 pixels so we go
to slash thumbnail we pass in our
dimensions which is 100 by 100 we pass
in the function we want to do so we want
to crop it and then we want to pass in
the quality so I'm gonna say I want it
to be the best quality we can give it
and I'm going to hit enter and you'd see
what it did was a cropped our image down
to 100 by 100 pixels it didn't stretch
or distort the image and you can see
that because you can see the monkey here
is touching the edge of the image but if
we go back to the full size version you
can see there's a lot of grain to the
side of him so you can see the crop
worked as expected hopefully I find it
really useful in projects I know I
certainly will but that's it for this
