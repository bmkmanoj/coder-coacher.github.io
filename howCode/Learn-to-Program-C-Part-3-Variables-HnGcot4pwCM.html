learning about variables and see so what
are variable a's is it just a way of
storing data within a computer when I
create a variable in my program what I'm
doing is I'm assigning a chunk of the
realm and the computer's memory to be a
certain value so whenever I use an
integer on my computer I'm assigning
four bytes of memory to store whatever
value I put it in the variable and
variables also have types the reason
they have different types is because
different types of represented different
ways in mammary if i try to store an
integer in memory it's going to be
represented differently that if i try to
store a billion in memory even if i take
two data types with the same size so
vitac say a signed integer at an
unsigned integer even though I'm storing
the same weight of data each time the
weather stored and represented in memory
is different which is why we've
different data types so let's create a
variable so I'm going to create a char
so I'm going to type the word see here
JR and then I'm going to give it an IAM
that i'm going to set it equal to some
value that is one character long so i'm
just going to put in an f for the value
I can't store more than one character if
I try to put in Fr it's going to give me
an hour because a char can only store
one character and at a time each tour
can restore one character because a char
is one bite in length and a character is
one bite in length characters in utf-8
can be more than one bite in length but
the standard characters in you give it
that have been carved across from a ski
just use one bite so we can put a knife
in here and it'll take one bite of the
computer's memory so I'm going to do now
is when I put this I'm going to put a
percent see in here because seeing is
how we are putting how we format a
character using printf and I'm going to
give the variable we want to I pot and
then I'm going to real miss so we're
going to type GCC learn c 0 and i'm
going to give it the more learn so we
run that we don't get any errors or
warnings so now if we type / learn
you'll say we got the letter F printed i
toast if i try to store let's try to
store
in a char you will say we'll get an
error so I got to compile this you see
multi-character constant is why we're
getting a warning that's because the
store character we use single quotes or
string we use multiple quotes that's
what this first error is about and then
here we're getting the error because the
character constant is too long which
type because we're trying to store more
than one character in a van in a data
type that can only store one character
at a time so let's try on store an
integer now i'm going to say int let's
say test is equal to the value 10 i'm
going to say printf and format is a
decimal and i'm going to print test out
so that's just compile this and you see
we got 10 printed out to us what I can
also do is I'm sayin test is equal to 10
plus 5 or 10 plus 5 and we will get the
result of that mathematical operation
which is 15
then what we can do is we can actually
create a short in which is an integer
but it's smaller than an integer it's
only two bytes in size we can we can use
this syntax here short int or we can
just use short because it's the same
thing so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to store the value 30,000 in this short
you see we got 30,000 aqueduct just so
later on Python I said print two to the
power of 16 you see that's the maximum
value we can store in a short so you can
see here we got minus 1 the reason for
that is where using the wrong and print
a formatter sweeney change this to a
hitch you that's just the for my code
for printing out an unsigned short and
we print that out what will happen is we
get the value wanted we also get the
minus 1 here because what happened was
our short overflowed its value so we
need to print it out as an unsigned
short to get the maximum value possible
you'll see if we change this back to a
decimal and we change this to say 32,000
we should get the exact value we want
you see we got 32,000 that's because by
default and values in say our short
sorry values and C are signed and then
to I put them as on sign values we are
it's good practice to do on sign before
the value and then to also i put it as
an unsigned value all formatting it and
see when you have a sign data type that
overflows its value it's called
undefined behavior which means you don't
actually know what it's going to do but
if you have this set unsigned and then
you format it correctly you get the
value wanted and you don't have to worry
about undefined behaviors
so let's move on to the next one let's
move on to double let's create a double
called day I will set it equal to
100,000 let's print this you just use
the decimal air for matter for this one
and we run this so the reason we've got
this warning is because doubles can fold
floating point values and we're trying
to put it as a decimal value which means
it can't be floating point so that means
we have to put a % f in here to format
as a floating point number let's run
this run oops don't clear it I want to
run the program you can see we got
100,000.00 zero and a double is accurate
up to six decimal places so finally what
we're going to do is we're going to
learn how to create a string in C so if
I try to create a strain called test
isat an equal to strain like a wood and
Python for example oops and I print this
out as a string and I give it the name
test you'll see we'll get an arrow
select at GCC learn c dash 0 learn c we
got an error that's because string isn't
a data type in c there's no identifiers
called string so the way we do it is we
create an array of characters so you'll
see here if I go into Python and I
create tests on a Saturday equal to
hello world I know if I try to print out
test you see I get the entire string
printed out but if I want to print at
say a single character in the string the
way I do that is I say a print test as I
would render the entire string but here
i use the array syntax and i just put in
the index of the character i want to
print out so i would print the first
character i want to get the character
with a zero index in the array which in
this case i would put a zero in here to
access the character at the index zero
in the character array if i hit enter
now I got hitch printed out to us so the
same is a truancy so the way I create a
character array and see is a create a
regular character
using the char keyword but I just create
an array so i put the arrest syntax
after the name of the variable and i use
this syntax the double quotes to create
an array of characters I could do this I
create it like this i'm not going to do
all the characters where you see the way
you do it you create an array and you
can fill each individual item in the
array like that or you can use this
syntax which is probably the easiest to
create an array of characters one out
the other that's what the double quotes
mean NC so if I print this now if I say
GCC learn not say minus 0 learn we get
no errors and if we try to run this you
see we got hello world printed out to us
so that's it for this video don't forget
