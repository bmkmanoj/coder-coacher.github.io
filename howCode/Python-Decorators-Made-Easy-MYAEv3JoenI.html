learning about decorators so Jack raters
are a part of Python that you might not
have used before but they can be really
really useful for extending the
functionality of some of your functions
so I've got a function here that's
called my funk and if I run it it's
gonna print out a world so as you can
see it says hello world so what if I
wanted to extend this function well if I
wanted the function to print something
else I could go into the function like
this and I could manually change it and
now if I run it you can see it prints
something else but to change that I had
to go in and modify the function so
let's say I change this example and I
have a function that divides some number
by another number so if I run that
everything works fine but if I was to
change this five to zero
we all know we can't divide by zero so
if I run that now you can see we got an
error so one way to fix this would be to
add functionality to our function by
going into the function itself and
adding a check to make sure we're not
dividing by zero but another thing that
we can do is we can use jacker aiders so
decorators let us extend the
functionality of one of our functions
without actually modifying the function
itself so here's how we create a
decorator so we're going to create a
function and it's going to be called
check and it's going to take a function
as a parameter so I'm going to call that
func so it's going to take our divide
function as a parameter so in Python we
can create nested functions so that
means we can define a function inside a
function so I'm going to create a
function called inside and it's going to
take two parameters which is a and B and
those are the two parameters that we're
gonna pass to our divide function and in
here is where we're going to check that
we're not dividing by zero so to do that
we're just going to say if B equals zero
we're gonna print an error message and
we're gonna return out of that function
so if we were to run this now nothing's
gonna happen because all we've done is
define a function which isn't going to
execute it and all we've done inside
that function is to find another one so
what we need to do inside of our nested
function is after we do our check we're
just going to run func and we're gonna
pass the air parameter and the B
parameter so this is going to call
whatever function we pass into our check
method I'll wait to find this inside
function but we haven't tried to execute
it so to execute the inside function
we're just going to return inside so now
what I call the check function it's
going to define this function inside of
it then it's going to execute the
function I pass to it whatever we finish
the check function is going to
returned which means it's going to
execute the inside function and then
that will in turn execute whatever
function I passed to check so if that
doesn't make any sense hopefully an
example will so to actually add this
functionality to our divide function
what we do is we create a variable with
the same name as our divide function and
we set it equal to the check function
that we created up here now what we do
is then we pass the divide function
inside check function and what that will
do is it will add this additional
functionality to our divide function so
now if we just run the exact same divide
underneath that we did previously you
can see now it says can't divide by zero
but if I take this line out you can see
we got an error so this is a really
common pattern in Python so what Python
has done is it's added a special syntax
so instead of this really repetitive
pattern underneath your function what
you can do is you can just type in an
out sign above it on the name of your
decorator which in this case is called
check so that's that function up there
so now if I delete that because we have
our decorator above the function if I
was to run this again you can see it
says can't divide by zero so that's how
you use decorators to add additional
functionality without modifying the
function itself so that's it for this
