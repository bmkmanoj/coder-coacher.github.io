doing is we're going to be learning how
to upload profile photos so we can
already upload your narak photos but at
the moment we just have the default
profile photo that we give to every user
but what we're going to do is we're
going to be able to click on the profile
photo and then we can drag a photo in so
let's get started so with the minute we
can click on this photo and this box
will appear and we can drag in our
profile photo into the box and this will
send an ajax request off to our server
but we haven't set that up yet so we're
going to do that now
so one our urls we're just going to add
a new URL ajax CF photo and it's good
and it's going to go to the view called
edge acts here photo and it's just a
regular Ajax view like one of the ones
we normally create as we create an
instance of Ajax here photo we pass our
post data and we make sure the user is
logged in that's where we pass the
request our user variable so then on
formance we have to do is create this
class so one form is we're going to
scroll down and we're just going to add
that class so here at this class is very
similar to just uploading a regular
photo the difference is that it's a bit
simpler so what we do is we get the URL
and the base URL and we need both of
them to make the request a valid request
but we're only actually using the URL
we're not touching the base URL so we
check if the users logged in we check
that the image they're uploading is
coming from upload car and then all we
do is receive that user from the
database we set their profile pic to the
URL that was uploaded and we see of the
user and then we tell them the profile
photo was uploaded so we just need to
add a new URL so I'm going to paste this
in here and this URL is just Ajax chat
profile pic that's how we set the
profile picture then of course we have
to create the view which is going to be
a jacked set profile pic and in our
views we're just going to paste this in
and this is just a regular edge axe view
that we've already created multiple
times all we're doing is we're creating
an instance of Ajax set profile pic and
we're passing the post request and we'll
making sure the users logged in that's
what we're passing the request user
variable as well so now if I save that
and try to run this so if I click on
this profile picture and I try to upload
a photo
I'm just going to
see if photo and this should update my
profile photo and now you can see that
photo was uploaded and now my profile
photo is the high court image that I
just uploaded and if we look at our
users table you can see there is our
profile image there and I could have
added a fact to it I could have done
anything I wanted so here's our profile
photo and if I click on the homepage you
can see now I beside my name I have my
custom profile photo so that's it for
