finishing off our search box at the
moment we can type in the search box and
that will return any posts that match
our search query
but what we're going to do is we're
going to enable it so that when you
click on a post it's going to take you
to the profile page of the user who
posted it and it's going to focus on the
posts that you clicked on so let's get
started so whenever we type into the
search box we get this response and it
returns this JSON I'm one of the items
that's returned that we're not actually
displaying is the username of the person
who wrote the post so that way we know
how to get to that users profile because
we have the username so we have our
index page open here and I'm going to
scroll down to the JavaScript so here's
the JavaScript of our search box and if
I scroll across here you can see here is
the last item that were displaying in
the search box so we're going to put a
link in here
and the lengths going to go to profile
dot php' question mark username equals
and here what we're going to do is we're
going to put in our eye just like before
when we retrieve the body but this time
we're going to retrieve the username as
you can see here we're going to go to RI
dot username so now if i refresh and I
type in hello world from you can see
these are no lengths and if I click on
this link it takes me to the profile
page of the user who wrote that post but
what we're going to do now is we're
going to shoot down to the post that
these are clicked on so to do that what
we're going to do is go to the profile
page so what we're going to do is we're
going to give every single list item an
ID so we're going to say ID equals and
we're going to say ID is equal to the
post ID so to do that what we do is we
just put in the two double quotes then
we put in the two single quotes to split
the string and then know that right side
the string we can use the variable so we
say posts index and we want to say posts
index dot post ID just like we did here
so now every single post will have an ID
of whatever it's post ideas so in the
case of this top post the ID is 37 and
the sacrum on the ID is 34 just depends
on whatever the posts ID actually is and
what you can do in the HTML when you
have something is ID is you can put in a
hash and I get too harsh one and that
will take me to the post with the ID of
one so if I hit enter you can see now
it's taking me to the bottom of the page
because that's the purpose with the ID
of one but what we can do is really make
it look a bit nicer so we're going to go
back into a JavaScript we're going to
scroll up and we're going to define a
function so I just got this function off
of Stack Overflow I'll include the link
to the page I got it from in the
description so all we need to do to make
this function work is just delete that
bit and just replace it with the
variable we copy the name of the
function and inside of our document
ready and then inside of that we have
our Ajax request so we look for the
success method which is here that means
after we get all the data back from the
edge ax request we scroll down to the
bottom of that and underneath that we
just piss in our function and then we
write location dot hash and you see if I
type in location hash we get nothing at
the minute but if I type in location on
hash after I type in hash one you can
see we get hash one printed out so we're
just passing that to our scrolls you
anchor function so now we're going to
run this I put in hash one and now I'm
going to refresh the page and now you
can see we got zoom down to the bottom
of the
edge which is where the post of the idea
of one is so what we're going to do to
finish off is we're going to go back to
index and on the search page we're going
to go to profiles up HP question mark
user name equals user name and then
we're going to say hash and here what
we're going to do is put in the post ID
so to do that we just we just put in our
I we aren't returning the ID yet so what
we want to do is go to our API and you
can see here is the search part of the
API and what we're going to do is we're
just going to say select posts dot ID as
well now we save that we go back to
index we access the current post and we
access the ID fields that the ad
corresponds to the name of the field we
got from the database so now if I go to
the index page we try this out so they
say hello world from I click on this it
takes us to the profile page and it
Scrolls down to hello world from post up
