learning how to mansion other users and
posts so for example I could say at
higher code and say hello world
if I click post nice as app how could
hello world but it doesn't actually
create a link so what we're going to do
is create a link whenever we see an out
symbol in a post so to do that whenever
we post something we're going to start
on the user's profile page to begin with
whenever we post something we want to
check if the body contains any out signs
so we're going to run a function called
we'll call it link art or something and
we'll paste it down here and then up
here what we'll do is we create that
function
and we need sad yourself to make sure
that we're getting it from this class so
what we want to do first we'll just
return the text I will just run this and
see nothing should have changed so you
can see nothing changed so we could use
regular expressions do this or we could
just do something really simple we could
say for each text as word in other words
for every word in the text we're gonna
say if sub s TR word 0 1 which is the
first character of the word equals an
odd sign then we'll act with that word
and before we can get it to work we need
to say a text equals explode on spaces
text to convert it to an array and down
here when we return up we want to
convert it back into a string so we'll
say implode text on spaces so there are
everything we everything works the way
it should everything's back to normal
but we have a high code printed right at
the top so we're adding that word so
what we want to do is we will say new
string is an empty string for every word
in that string is we will say string dot
equals word to append on the new word I
will say a parent on a space at the end
of that and we new change that to new
string actually what we want to do now
is we will put this in a house statement
and then otherwise what we'll do is
we'll say new string dot equals word
just like before but what we'll do is
we'll also append on a link to the
user's profile that was referenced and
then what we'll do is we will say pack o
new string so here you can see the new
strings echoed on this new string has
our link in it but that link won't work
when we run it through the rest of our
page because the rest of our page uses
his email special chars to prevent
against cross-site scripting and things
like that so what we want to do is when
we return we want to return a new string
and we don't need to implode it anymore
because it already is a string so you
can see those are in length it hasn't
actually printed the link it's just
printed out the HTML that's because if
HTML special chars so what we want to do
is remove the hasty our special charge
from the outside and we want to run it
on each individual word so here we want
to just say HTML special chars just like
that
and what we'll do is we'll run this now
and see what happens and it should work
fine so now you can say if I scroll down
the old HelloWorld in bold doesn't work
but if I scroll up our length that we
generate the points to high codes
profile page works exactly as we would
hope that what we're gonna do is we're
going to actually point to their profile
so we'll say a profile that PHP equals
and the username is going to be equal to
a string which is going to be substring
word and we want to start on the first
character and skip it and get all the
other characters so we're leaving out
the out sign oops it's so vast er you
can see we have the link hi goodnight
and if I click on it it takes us to
Howard's profile page and then again
because we have the post form up we
can't actually use it if I click that
and click post you see us as incorrect
user but whenever we finish the actual
design we're gonna be deleting this sort
of thing to make sure that it actually
looks more like a social network and it
doesn't confuse users into thinking they
can post on other peoples pages so the
next thing you would have to do is
create a notification system and the
notification system would be how you
would tell someone that they've been
mentioned in a post that's a very
complicated system and we're going to be
doing that in a later part of this
series but that's if this video don't
forget to like comment favorite and
subscribe don't forget to follow us on
Facebook Twitter and rat it and I'll see
you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
