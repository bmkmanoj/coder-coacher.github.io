created a database table so now we're
going to do is handle creating new users
so we're going to go to our text editor
we're going to create a file called
index.php and we're going to create a
file called login dot PHP now we're
going to create a new file called login
dot PHP we're also going to create one
called create a count of PHP
so now what we need to do is connect to
our database and we're going to use a
special function in PHP called PDO PDO
stands for PHP data objects and what it
is is a database abstraction layer
that's a much better way to connect to a
database so we're using PDO because the
MySQL a functions that are built into
PHP aren't designed to be accessed
directly the really low level which
means we should be using some sort of
database abstraction to access them and
that's what PDO is so we're going to
create our PHP tags and we're going to
create a variable called video and we're
going to set it equal to a new PDO
object inside of the PDO object we have
to pass it a string the first thing we
have to do is tell PDO the type of
database we're going to use so we're
going to use a MySQL database then we
have to have a codon and then we have to
tell PDO where we're hosting the
database in this case it's an localhost
which is my local computer so we're
going to say host equals and you could
type in localhost
like that but sometimes it doesn't seem
to work so if you put in 127.0.0.1
that's the IP address local host
resolves to it seems to work fine then
we tell our database name we say DB name
is equal to and we call our database
social network
and then we tell PTO the character side
of our database we said charge that
equals and we're going to say utf-8 and
utf-16 the web then we simply pass PDO
the username which in this case is root
and the password in this case there
isn't one next we need to do one more
thing we need to set PDO and we access
the set attribute method and we need to
do this for PD it was error reporting so
we just need to set P do an t TR
underscore e RR mode and then we just
set PDO air mode exception and that
should be us connected so we're going to
save that and then we're going to go to
our file and we're going to run that
script oh my got no errors so that means
we should be connected to our database
so what we want to do is create a simple
form
soum acid is just going to be the
current page and the way we do that is
we can either leave a blank or we can
just say create account cut PHP
we need three inputs we set input type
text we want to call it user name
placeholder it's going to be user name
and we want to do this for all of the
form fields
and then finally we actually seem to put
in our submit button
and I will just preview that in the web
browser so know what we need to do is we
need to create a function that runs when
we submit this form will say if is that
post
create a current at the forum submitted
then we need to grab the values of the
username the password on the email and
we're going to do it like this
so now we've grabbed the username the
password on email and we've stored them
in variables so we're going to do
something to make our lives easier now
we're going to create a new file we're
going to call it DB and it's going to be
stored in our classes folder
this is going to make it a lot easier
for us to access our database so what
we're going to do is set class DV and
PHP tags we're going to create a private
static function called connect and we're
just going to copy and paste our PDO
scripts from here and then we return P
do the static just means we don't need
to create an object of the DD class to
be able to use it so here we're going to
set public static function query and
this is how we're going to interact with
our database so here we're going to
write the code to actually query our
database
you
so what this function does is it takes
the query we want to run takes the
parameters for our query it connects to
the database it proposed the query it
acts Acutes the query and I guess the
data from the query and returns it so
we're using built in prepared statements
because the reason we're using this
query function is because we can reduce
a query down to one lane whereas
otherwise we'd be running all of these
lanes every time we wanted to do a
single query so now that we've done that
we want to go back to this file and we
want to include it and I always included
it we can use our database so what we're
going to do is really simple we're just
going to insert the data into the
database so the way we do that is we say
DB query we pass it our query which is
going to be insert into users and values
username password and email whoops we
just need to put this in here primes
equals an empty array by default and
then here what we want to do is want to
say array to pass our parameters and our
parameter is going to be using a
password an email and we want to say
username which corresponds to this
username and we use this equal sign grid
it on to say username is equal to the
variable username password is equal to
the variable password and then we set
email is equal to email and then just
underneath that we will just set that
the query was successful so sir echo
success I won't run this and see what
happens and we're going to click create
a code and we have an error that's
because of our ID field in the table so
we actually just need to create Nancy ID
field we're going to get an error
because
when we try to fetch the rose from our
query that doesn't work with every type
of query so we're just going to comment
that out temporarily and we also need to
pass our parameters to our execute
function otherwise you won't be able to
insert any data so if we run this no
we're going to get an error so what we
need to do to fix that is we need to
change all the words in the values
section to not match our columns because
if we go to our table you can see there
match our columns and that's going to
give us problems so we're just going to
put in codon before each word that means
that no longer matches our table columns
and we shouldn't have any problems and
we're going to run this and we're going
to click create account
so it says success we go to our table
and we refresh and you can see there's
no Donna it's been successfully inserted
so that's it for this video in the next
video we're going to be doing our
validation and inserting users but
that's it for this video don't forget to
