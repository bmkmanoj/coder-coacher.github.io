the Python 101 video series and as you
can see all I've done is created a blank
Python file called how to Python but py
and well just create a file in the
Python idle line you'll be ready to go
so once you've done that what we're
going to be doing today is we're gonna
be learning about modules so what a
module is is basically just a file with
pre-written code the you can import into
Python there Python comes with some
pre-built ones but we're going to be
creating our own basic one today so if
we go to the Python shell this is it I'm
just going to import a Python module so
I'm going to say import and then I'm
since Python I'm just going to sent math
but I can't send maths and I say math so
we import math or math and then we can
do things like sign or anything so I'll
leave that for now anyway
so but that's what it does is when we
import a math module it allows us to do
special functions so we'd say I'm math
dot floor and then we just put a number
and so I don't know six and it gives us
an answer but we have to have the math
part the math dot just tells python the
module we're the module he needs to log
in and then the floor part just tells
python which part of the eye for it
tells it once it's locked in the maths
file and tells us what it tells it what
to look for and then ok lets us use it
so we're going to create our own so
actually mistake we have to save go to
file save as and we have to save up our
module in the
Python 2 7 folder and we just save it in
here and I'm going to call mine hallo
Python I saved in my desktop by accident
so I have to make sure you see it in the
Python 27 folder because this is one of
the places the Python labs for whenever
it looks for custom modules so I just
saved my module hello python we're just
going to create a function for it so I'm
going to set DAF what we're going to say
is you could say I def hello I mean we
could take one parameter so it could
just be me and maybe and then down here
we could just say return hello
plus mean so what this is just going to
do is say hello and then
okay what's the hello comma it says
hello comma then whatever the user put
into the Union parameter okay so there's
our a function of a Python module so if
we save that and we go to the Python
shell on we say import okay if we were
to type in now hello
I have Python dot hello and I have to
put in my name you'll notice we get an
error because hello python is not to
find so what we need to do is we just in
the same port hello
Python so now once we've done that we've
imported our module and then I'll then
we can do things like hello python dot
hello so now if I hit enter okay we're
having a problem
okay so what turned out to be the
problem is um I just had to close idle
and reopen it for some reason I'm not
sure why but it's probably because I had
idle open whenever I saved the method
are they okay yeah it was there because
whenever I saved it to my desktop if
you'll remember to start the video I
went to save Oz and I saved it in this
folder but I'd already opened the idle
and in Python if you if when the I'll if
the idols already started and you create
a module they won't work and if you
change the module so if I was to change
this now and then re-import it wouldn't
work either that's why we're saying the
hello attribute didn't exist so we're
going to do now is we'll just type hello
iPhone dot hello and then we need to put
my name in so I'll just pop my name and
there we have it it says hello Frances
we can create more modules so we could
are not modules attributes so we could
say I don't know add now we could just
give take two arguments so num1 num2 so
then we could just return num1 plus m2
so now where we have to close the python
shall again so we close it and we hit
have whoops f5 which should bring up
another one so i'm not going to bother
resizing it i'm just going to show you
if we say import hello
python and we hit enter we get no errors
and you can see if we import one that
doesn't exist we can error so ours is
definitely imported correctly and what
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
type in hello python odd and we took two
/
and we added them together so three and
four and we gets added so that's it for

or comment like and sub or a comment

I'm favorite I would really appreciate
that and there's more PHP videos coming
soon and I will see you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
