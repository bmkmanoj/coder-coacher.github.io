of the how to make your own social
network series so today we're going to
be doing is we're going to be learning
how to make the register form work by
actually registering users so let's get
started so the first thing we're going
to do is we're going to open a PHP block
up here we could just use the same one
but I'm just going to open a new one for
simplicity so the first thing we're
going to do is we're going to kissed in
this well I'm going to paste it in to
make the video quicker so the first
thing we're doing is we're trying a
variable called rag we're assigning it
equal to the post of two am like post of
where is it
this we want to say this actually to rag
so we're getting the so this basically
means whenever this is posted so
wherever rag is posted whenever they
form is submitted we assign the likely
data from the form equal or equal to the
rag variable this odd sign just means
that whenever the for example if I was
to a coup I mean if I was to actual rag
nog before um before the form is
submitted
we would get an undefined variable error
but now if we use the outside at get
sort of the error and then these are
just variables specifying the just
different fields so f at or just
actually we haven't even specify the
fields here we're just declaring them as
so that we don't get any undeclared
variable errors so now we're just going
to paste in this an action that fight
one there's actually you check which
check to the Asian name exists which is
also just defining the variable no
declaring the variable and before we
need it to that way we don't get any
errors when we want to use it no word
date what we're doing here is we're
signing the variables equal to
and we're citing the variables equal to
the field name so for example this is
after name and if we scroll down here it
corresponds to here which is also
athlete so these are corresponding on
this is just posting the data and
storing it in a variable so whatever I
put in the VAR in the Athenian field
which is first name so whatever I type
in here will be stored in the afternoon
or the FN variable
whenever the form is submitted these
strip tags just strips hit or hast of
all tags and things so that way it's
just a form of security to prevent
astral injection into the database
there's a lot more we could do but
that's just a very simple method of
security the other odd signs are also
just to prevent undeclared variable
errors because there's no because these
are already being assigned regardless of
whether the form has been submitted so
we want to surround them or what
happened outside in front of them the
dit or the D variable was declared up
here as well
but it's not getting any data from the
form the D variable is just equal to the
dead function and then it says your
Monday which just means this is just a
formatter what's the date will be sort
of stored so it gets the date from the
server stores it in this format whatever
format we add Tala to in here and it
stores it in the D variable so here's
some more code we just paste it in
so what we're saying now is if drag
which means if the form is submitted we
want to run all the code in here what
we're saying is if a male female 1
equals email 2 which means the two
emails are equal which the point of that
is just to make sure someone doesn't
type their email in wrong we checked
twice so we're checking if the emails
are the same which means the user wasn't
typed it in wrong then what we're going
to do is we're going to check the user
already exists in the database
so what we're doing is we're saying
select username from users where
username equals u n which is the
variable that is against the variable
that stores the username so for example
if I was to put in Pontus into here and
I click to sign up it would store
Francis in the U n variable and then
what it would say select username from
users where username equals Francis
then what would say is if the number of
rows returned doesn't equal zero or
equals zero then that means we can't
sign up the user if the F they are
number of rows returned doesn't equal
zero there's already one in the database
called Frances so it's already a user
name in the database or user who's
usually manage Frances in the database
so we don't want to set up two users
with the same username so we tell them
they can't turn up so then that's what
this that's what this does this says
check equals equals zero so what Jack is
equal to is the masculine um rows of
this query so if this query equals zero
rows which means the user username isn't
taken then we want to assign the user up
now we want to do is what a check of all
the fields have been filled in which is
all these fields here so we're checking
if first-name lastname etc etc on 0 so
it means it or not no then we want to
say we also want we've checked whether
there know so it means that they have
been filled in we want to check out the
two passwords of the CM if the passwords
all the same we want to do another check
which checks the maximal length of the
username first name and the last name
you make sure it doesn't exceed 25
characters so that's with the asked
airline function does it just checks if
the at the length of the string is well
it just basically finds it the length of
the string and what we're saying is if
the length of the string it's greater
than 25 characters in any of these three
fields we want to echo maximum limit
fusion and first and my last name is 25
characters and we don't want to send a
user up until if it's not error okay and
then we want to say is else so if the
username or the first name or the last
name is less than 20 men characters we
want to check the maximum length of the
password does not exceed 25 characters
and it's not less than 5 characters so
if it is either more than or less than
or if it's more than 25 characters or
less than five characters want to stop
the user from signing up and tell them
that their password is too short or too
long and then if the passwords okay the
usernames okay we want to encrypt the
password with md5 and then we want to
say is insert the user into the database
you want to insert or want a semi-circle
query equals insert into
users the values and then the first ones
blank cause its ID and the IDS auto in
four minutes we need a blank deposit
automatically goes up by one every time
the user registers this second one's
username first name last name email
password get this signed up and active
and these all off the car spawn to the
or to the fields in the database like so
they all have to be in the same order as
the fields in the database and then what
these are well these are just sort of
the actual checks so up here we're
checking if the passwords match and then
down here we're saying if the pop we're
just finishing off the query so
basically what I'm saying is if the
passwords match do all this and then if
the passwords don't match I tell them
they don't match and then stop them
signing up and that's the same for all
of these if the they don't fit on the
fields how laughs they're using to take
and tell them that email so much time
than that so let's try and sign up now
with all this code already in so that's
just refresh so I'm going to type try
sign up so sign does not comee
have my user with Francis as the hi gorg
to gorg add set password for my password
and I click Sign Up okay so it says
please fill in all of the fields so
we've got a problem
so basically what's happening is one of
the sides one of the fields isn't filled
in so the problem for that is probably
there we have password both of these
fields are called passwords we need to
set that one equal to password too or we
want to color give it to clean the name
of password too so that way the fades
button so that way it thinks all the
fields have been filled in so I'm just
going to refresh and resend the data
watch it harden let's try it again
actually
let's just type in password on let's hit
sign it up and it says welcome to find
friends and we click on browse and we
have one user in our database the shine
updates recorded the passwords recorded
their emails recorded and everything
about them is recorded as we expect so
that's it for this video don't forget to
