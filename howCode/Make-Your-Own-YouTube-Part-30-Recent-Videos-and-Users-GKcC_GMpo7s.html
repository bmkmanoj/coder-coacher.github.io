we're gonna be doing is we're going to
be doing two things
the first thing we're gonna be doing is
we're going to be increasing the PHP
maximum file upload limit or file up
size upload limit to AG what we're going
to be increasing it is then the default
actually only two megabytes so we're
going to be increasing that to a cafe
gigabyte or something so that way we can
upload videos that are more than two
megabytes because a lot of video is on
our a lot more than two megabytes and
two megabytes for like a long video
would mean the video would have to be
really bad quality the second thing
we're going to be doing is we're going
to be working on the latest videos page
so the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to add at the PHP dot ini
file and that comes with your PHP
installation we're going to be updating
the I mean increasing the maximum
allowed file upload our file size upload
so to do that what you want to do is you
want to go into OS which is just C
driver when I run Windows and you want
to go to excel on mark after what
applications anyone able to excel I know
when you get this folder and what you
want to do is you want to go to the PHP
folder and you want to just click
anywhere and press P and it should take
it on to the first file that starts with
B then what you want to do is you want
to go and find PHP dot ini so this is it
here and we can check that by going to
properties and as you can see it's
configuration settings and then it says
dot ini is the extension so what we want
to do is we want to just drag this into
sublime text and then we want to do is
we want to press ctrl F or command off
on a Mac or whatever and you want to
type in marks file or marks underscore
file and click find and what it does is
it finds and the part of the file that
specifies the maximum allowed file size
that can be uploaded so what you want to
do is you just want to change this from
two megabytes to I'm going to increase
it to half a gigabyte but you can
increase it to whatever you want so I'm
half a gigabyte isn't 500 obviously so
it's 512 because a gigabyte is 1024
megabytes so it's 512 megabytes
changing it to obviously you can change
it to whatever you want but this will
just allow us to upload videos that are
and more than 2 megabytes in size then
we've done that we just want to close
this we don't need it anymore and we're
going to go back to our project so what
we're going to do is we're just going to
create a new file and we're going to
save it
okay so we need to go to our htdocs
folder here it is in here so what we
want to say is we want to call this
latest video stuff HP and we also need
to go into here so okay so here's our
project on before you go to news videos
there is our file we also want to drag
in the popular page as we can use to a
lot of the code from the OP and on in
this video is page so the first thing we
can do is we just copy the include
header file
all right include header function and
then we want to do is we want to do
exactly the same as this one so we'll
just copy everything for anion we'll
tweak it to make it suit the latest
videos
so instead of order by views what we
want to do is you want to change it to
order by let's see if we recorded e
added so let's go into videos
it says da top loaded so we're going to
order if I get uploaded not sure it work
because it's not a number but let's try
it anyway so I get uploaded and then
descending which will cut to the video
but that was that most recently uploaded
at the top then we want to do is we just
want to go over here and we want to go
to the latest videos page but obviously
we haven't created them a link for it so
we're just going to type it in okay so
here it is it's a order of videos in
order of when they were last uploaded
let's see there's actually not a whole
lot we need to change we need to add a
link to the users channel that uploaded
and we also need to create a link to the
actual video so let's go to the image
and let's create a hate rap I will set
this equal to upload by so we just need
to echo uploaded underscore by and then
close or I mean put a semicolon there
and then we want to do is you just want
to end the link with the closing new tag
so then we want to do is just refresh
and I just see a link should appear as
you can see these are not clickable and
I can click on the let you take me to
the channel of whoever made it obviously
we don't want to take it to my profile
we want to take it to the channel not
upload it so occupy just leave it as
yeah uploaded by for an eye and I
noticed this isn't why so just worried
about we'll leave it uploaded by and
then we'll sorted out what will change
it to channels in another meeting
because that would actually require
actually a lot of work because we
haven't recording it we haven't been out
recording it whenever the video but
uploaded so at what we need to do now is
we need to go into the header file and
we just want to drag this header into
the project and then we want to scroll
down now we want to find these videos so
now we've done that we've actually I
have a lot of time left so that we've
now we finished the latest videos and uh
PHP page so what we're also going to do
is run a semi list underscore members
we're going to do that one too because
that's actually an almost the exact same
so what we're going to do is run a click
file new file and we're going to see it
latest underscore members HP now what
we're going to do is just copy all this
yes it in this one requires a bit more
tweaking so obviously we want to change
this to users we want to get the
registration date if we recorded that so
let's go back to our database I mean our
table or no our database and then go
into the users table let's see so we
didn't actually record the date they up
they joined so we're going to do that
now so we're going to say structure
we're going to add a new row at the end
I will say click underscore join set it
to a bar chart we'll set the length to
the maximum of 255 and we'll set the
index to primary an auto increment to on
index primary or the primary index just
means that whoops are we want to do that
actually I don't know what I'm thinking
so let's just add it again let's save
our char I will set it to 255 and hit
enter and let's shoot and work then we
want to do is want to I go to our
registration page so let's go to this
and let's go to join the page page and
we just want to get the date the user
joined so let's go down here add a new
slot so our new space or whatever I will
just say I did now we want to go up here
and let's go above all this so we go
above everything we're just going to set
dipped equal to and then we're going to
use the get function then what we're
going to say is let's say let's get the
month for so month and there so why
let's try it out
this just gets the month in and dad in
the year not sure if it'll work let's
give them the go so now we want to do is
just want a log ID and create an account
again so unexpected okay I think I left
Santa code on low I didn't I need to
sign this in a double quotes because
it's a string contained within the
function parameter so let's try this I'm
gonna try it again so just time in my
name let's just put in whatever just
give it a password password let's just
put it in my mouth oh it's probably has
to be another statistic about um
creative college this has registered
successfully and let's have a look on
what gets entered into the database
nothing
you
okay so let's go down here and let's do
some from I suppose you say debugging
find out what's wrong with our code so
let's say MySQL error let's try it again
kakaw client doesn't March value out
remember one what this means is we've
got let's go to structure this means we
have ten add different rows here so then
it means we obviously don't have ten
rows here so let's count them two one
two three four five six seven eight nine
and then we actually have another one
add in here so see what it is it's
profile pic so let's just leave it blank
for now and let's try it again
let's just put whatever we want and
let's click create I give it our your
some tax okay
let's go on find the problem I just
hacked out a code
so hopefully three times should be
enough just wanna see one let's get
creative can't be in and see it says
registered successfully and I just read
I just found registered wrong as well
gets added to the database on the get
join gets recorded so what we're going
to do is we're going to use change
they'll actually registered successfully
just found the registered right and then
we want to do is we want to order them
by it joined let's change this to get
okay we'll just use some of the built-in
functions within a sublime text so we're
just going to cut ctrl F and we're going
to type in get lit on the control app
control are okay and you know let's just
defined please control eh actually and
then we just say got underscore videos
and we're going to place it with cat
underscore users I would click replace
all then we want to say is no no users
and we want to change this to user mean
that's all we'll do for I will keep the
rest time so we'll just get the user
name out of the database and we'll just
say echo so what you can a go to user
name let's go whoops I will put a break
tag underneath it just so that we get
them all on a new line
so if we go to latest videos we want to
go to that we want to go to latest
members I can see it orders the members
I joined obviously using the HJ just was
they are the last person to join so it
added them first but the others don't
have this either date joined is actually
blank so this means that they're just
ordered in whatever random order either
just probably order the older they can't
come out of the database so if inter fum
we're actually using this for real I
would work it's just because the other
fields were blank and that's it for this
