to create a really simple laravel
project we're gonna create a random fact
generator that will automatically
retrieve a random fact from the database
every time we reload a page so if i
refresh you can see we've got a
different fact if i refresh again we're
gonna get a different fact and you can
see it's just going to keep randomly
picking a new fact out of our database
so this is really easy to set up so
that's what we're gonna be learning how
to do in this video so in the last video
we had our hello world project and we
have a folder called routes that's
really important and we have a folder
called app so this folder contains our
models and our controllers and there's a
folder called HTTP and within that
there's our controllers so a user is our
model and our controllers are in our
controllers folder so a laravel
automatically generated a user model and
within our database folder we have our
migrations and it automatically
generated two migrations to create a
users table and to create a password
reset table so I'm going to delete those
migrations because because I don't want
to create a user's table and a password
resets table for this video so we're
going to delete those and we're also
going to delete our user model laravel
also comes with our fanta Kishin
built-in but we don't need it so we're
gonna delete that as well so what we
need to do first is create our database
and we called it Lara Val in our
configuration file you can see there's
our database it's called Lara Val so I'm
going to create a database called
laravel so now that we've created a
database table we want to create a
migration that will create our facts
table to store all of our facts so to
create that what we want to do is we
want to use our design and we want to
piss in this command we said we want to
use PHP artisan that we want to say make
migration because we're creating a
migration we're calling our migration
create facts table on the table we're
going to create is going to be called
facts so if I hit enter now you can see
I created a migration it created a new
PHP file for us I know this is our blank
migration so I'm going to modify this
PHP file to change the table that gets
created when we run the migration so to
do that I'm just gonna say a table and
I'm gonna add a string column which is a
VAR char and it's going to be called
fact and that's where we're going to
store our facts so now that we've done
that we want to say a PHP artisan
migrate as you can see what it did was
it created our facts table for us so if
i refresh we're gonna have two tables we
have facts and migrations migrations is
one that larvae created for us and facts
is the table that I just created so you
can see I've added four random five
and that's going to be our dataset for
this video so laravel follows the MVC
pattern so what we have to do is create
a model and a controller so if we look
at our two side you can see there's Mik
and within Mik we can make a model and
we can make a controller so we're going
to say a PHP artists on make model and
we're going to call our model fact
because we're retrieving random facts so
we've created our model and now we want
to create our controller
and we're going to call a controller a
fact controller so now that we've
created our model on our controller what
we want to do is create a route so we go
to our webpage P file in our routes
folder and you can see when we send a
get request to the route of our website
we return the welcome view so if I were
to change this say hello world so we're
just going to return hello world we're
not going to return a view and I was to
go back to our website you can see we
just get hello worlds printed out so
what we want to do is we want to call a
controller whenever we access a route so
we're going to delete this a part of the
function and we're going to put a comma
in here and we're going to say that we
want to go to the fact controller that
we just created and we want to go to the
GAT fact method so here's our controller
and here's the method within it so we
scroll up and you can see here's fact
controller here this fact that PHP file
is our model as you can see it extends
model and fact controller is our
controller so what I create a public
function called get fact and we're going
to just return hello world with an
exclamation mark so now if I was to
refresh what we would get is hello world
with an exclamation mark but what we
want to do is we want to have some logic
in here that queries our database so to
do that what we have to do is we have to
say it use app slash fact to use our
fact models so that we can query the
database that's our fact model down here
it's in the app folder so we're going to
suppose we have to say use app slash
fact and what we want to do is we want
to return the fact then we want to use
The Awl method to get all of the facts
that we want to narrow it down to say
random because we want to pick one of
the one of the facts out of the table
that random and we only want to limit
that to one fact so now if I was to
refresh you can see now we have raw JSON
returned to us and if I was to refresh
we'll get a different fact and you can
see laravel did all that for us and all
I had to do was one line of code so
instead of returning the facts in this
sort of format what we're going to do is
we're going to create a view so we're
going to say instead of returning the
fact we're going to return a view and
we're just going to return the welcome
view that's the default view that
laravel created and if we go to
resources and we go to views the rows
are welcome to play HP file and that's
our view so what I did was he overrode
the view was just some custom styling so
what I did was I
style the hitch one tag just to Center
it make it a bit bigger make an italic
and here what we did was just place the
h1 tag here and we used the blade
templating language to print out a
variable called fact so if I was to run
the star we get an error because the
view doesn't have any variables called
fact so what I want to do is put in an
array as our second argument to our view
function and we want to say our fact
variable is going to be equal to hello
world so now if I was to refresh we're
going to get the design I just pasted it
in but we're also going to get the hello
world variable printed out you can see
now we have hello world printed out on
the screen but of course we want to get
that from the database so what I'm going
to do is instead of printing out hello
world we're going to print out fact and
fact it's going to be equal to our fact
model which is how we access that table
and we want to say all then we want to
pick one of the items from the table at
random but you only want to pick one and
we want to make sure we close off our
array and now if I save that you can see
we got everything printed out from the
table you can see that this square
bracket means it's in an array and then
we have the fact element within so to
access a single fact we just want to
access the first element in that array
and then access the fact property so you
can see we access the first element in
this red because this array only has one
element and then we access the fact
attribute so if I was to refresh now we
just get the fact printed out and if i
refresh again we get a different fact
printed out and i revell did all this
for us and all we needed to do was just
two or three lines of code so that's it

and reddit but that's it for this video
and I'll see you next time
