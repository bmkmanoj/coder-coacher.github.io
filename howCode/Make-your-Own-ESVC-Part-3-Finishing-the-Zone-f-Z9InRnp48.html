series on how to make your own es la vie
c-type website using bind and today what
we'll be doing is we're going to be
setting up these own files for our
domain because in the last video we left
off we finished writing RM making sort
of the references in the name comp local
file but there's also why something else
we need to do we need to affect the name
de compostela cool file because there
was actually a typo i remember now so if
we type in CD to change directory then
we type in / ET c / buying / actually
that's it and then just hit enter then
we say at nonno to use the Nano text
editor and then we're going to say named
comp out local I missile open the file
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to go down here and I'm going to
put in a semicolon at the end of each of
these as zone declarations so just make
sure you put the semicolons and we left
them on the last video so we're going to
click control x we're going to hit Y to
save it and then we're going to hit
enter to say this is the filing we want
to save it as which is the same piling
ones we have at the moment so now we're
going to
create a folder called zones so we're
going to say Mick there and then one
says zooms not to make dark- creates a
folder and then we're telling it to
create the folder zones so let's add a
lass into that we can see we have the
zones folder i click CD into that zones
folder and if we ala ask me to see
there's nothing in this folder so we're
going to do is we're going to create a
new file so we're going to say a nano to
use the Nano text editor then what we're
going to say is at t LD micro dot org
dot soon
and then since this file doesn't exist
this will automatically create it for us
once we save it so if we hit enter it
ones up there black 5 it says new file
underneath
so the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm just going to put a comment up here
we do that with a semicolon let's start
the line and we're just going to set the
zone file for Toledo to org so this
doesn't obviously get run this just gets
ignored because it's a comment
so we're going to do is we're going to
go down here on we're going to say
and we're going to say a dollar sign TTL
I'm going to set that equal to 1 400
so just ignore without that just stands
for time to live average signal that 49
then what we're going to do is we're
going to put a knot sign in then we're
going to tab to make some space and then
we're going to say in SOA which is this
is sort of an SOA record it's called
and then we're going to say is an STL di
code.org so this tells it this is the
name server we want to use for our do me
and this is called a glue record up here
and then we're going to say is
actually we need our net with a dot and
then we're going to put the email
address of the administrator for the for
the domain so we're just going to put in
Frances dot polka dot org and this looks
like a subdomain but it's not this dog
gets turned into an odd sign whenever it
gets sort of processed so just put a dot
here that's what you're supposed to do
but just brigmore it's not actually
subdomain it's just an email so we add
that with a dot as well and then we're
going to put two parentheses here and
here and there inside here we're going
to put in and some information about our
domain so we're going to come up here
and we're just going to put in the first
one which is the serial which is the
sort of there's nothing really important
about this just convention basically so
so every time you add it your domains in
file you're going to increase the serial
number by one so since it's the first
time we're editing it the serials going
to be one so the next time we added it
we're going to change that to tell you
don't know if you have to it's just
convention sort of it's not really that
important i'm going to say one and then
so we know what it is we're just going
to put a comment the side that says
cereal then what we're going to do is
we're going to go over and we're going
to put it in the next piece of
information which is the refresh and i'm
going to set out to eight hours that
means that every time someone tries to
query the dns server sort for this to me
and it's going to refresh the dns every
eight hours so that way if i update the
zone file and someone tries to access it
the longest the lever the longest amount
of time will ever take for everyone to
how the most up-to-date version is eight
hours i'm just going to write refresh
besides out
then I'm going to put retry and I set
that equal to two hours and this just
means that if the sort of if someone
turns connect you to me in the camp then
it's going to wait two hours before it
tries to get a new zoom file I tried
like the most up-to-date on file from
the dns server
and then expire I'm going to set it for
weeks which means that when the DNS
server gets sort of when it gets queried
and it gets the zone file its going to
wait for weeks it's going to cash it for
four weeks basically so it doesn't look
for a new one for four weeks
so I'm going to say expire and this busy
means that after four weeks the DNS
server is going to be forced no matter
what to get the most up-to-date version
of the zone file from the DNS server
then in here I'm just going to put in
one day as I'm going to set that equal
to minimum teeth are going to set
minimum TTL which is the minimum time to
live that our lips
and I'm going to set that equal to one
day and i'm going to send minimum I
tedia which is the minimum time to live
for our domain so now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to set til the doc
buckled org and then end up with the dot
and i'm going to say in n and s i'm
going to say and asked at a lead on my
code not alone and what this basically
does is it sets up the name server for
our dummy and so up here I was sort of a
glue record and I'm down here we're
telling it that the name server 40
leader hi gorg is a nasty lead on how
gorg and what I've actually done is
already is I've gone to the haiku dogs
on fire I've added a subdomain TLD
obviously and then I pointed that sub
domain ah and I've given that an NS
record and that points to a nest
italiano Korg and then what we're doing
here is we're just saying the same thing
again and I actually so we're going to
do here is we're going to go down I'm
going to say NS
I'm going to say NS in oops capital I in
a now we're going to say so we're going
to do here is we're just going to paste
in the IP address of our server so I'm
gonna put in the IP address of the
server here then what I'm going to do is
I'm just going to create a separate test
domain so i'll say test and i'll say in
a I'll set that equal to 19 actually
i'll set it to the same thing so this
will just point test tle tohoku org to
our server so what I'm going to do is
we're just going to see if the files
going to side control x y enter to save
it and i'm going to say a service bind9
restart whoops
now what I'm going to learn what I'm
going to do is I'm going to do an
address lookup on the domain so if i go
back into the file
like a you can see here in our file we
have a subdomain called test so what I'm
going to do is going to say NS lookup
test t le hago org I'm going to hit
enter and as you can see it says
non-authoritative answer it says the
early name of it is at tacit ele tohoku
org and the address is 19 to 24 30 to 32
e so that tells us that our domain is
working so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you that in the live
browser so what I'm gonna do is I'm is
going to open up the browser and as you
can see we're on the domain test tldr
co.org and you can see we have the ph to
spread to us that shows us that our
domain is working but obviously this is
a really really long extension but the
same thing applies to anything so this
is the same as the SLV see it's the
exact same way of doing things so that's
it for this video don't forget to Like
comment favorite and subscribe and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
