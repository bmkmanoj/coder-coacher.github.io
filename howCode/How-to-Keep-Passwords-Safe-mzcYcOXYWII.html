this isn't a video that's going to be
part of a series or anything it's just a
random video that sometimes i'm just
going to make to them I don't know sort
of mix it up a bit because it would get
kind of boring if all my channel did was
making a social network under a few PHP
tutorials so um today what we're going
to be doing is well i'm going to be
teaching you the how to keep your
password and then part of your pop we're
going to greater here so I'm it's just
maybe where I will call password on yeah
and your support will connect wit okay
so here we have just the word password
obviously unda we already made um
Charlie crucial mistake so at Osmos
you're already you know your password
isn't a secure password which before we
done anything to make it more secure
we're already sort of putting ourselves
at a disadvantage so it's better to them
sort of think of a password that no one
uses I know you're told this like all
return or even if you were if you said
password but even if you put your date
of birth or whatever at the end of it or
your first name or I don't know you're
straining I'm giving a drift by doing
right you've made a more secure already
that's not what we're going to be
teaching so what I'm going to be
teaching you how to do today so I'm
going to create a new variable on the
new possible that's set fixed for and
it's going to equal swords
so now we can stack o fixed password
instead and I'll just say there's no
difference because at the moment text
faster just equals password which equals
the worst password so I advocate or what
I'm gonna do is I'm going by my first
name at the end of it because it's
already more secure on and the first
thing we're going to do is we're going
to obviously the cryptic so the standard
way people encrypt things is md5 so if
we do that and refresh the page we get
extreme that is a 32 characters long I'm
in the am defo edit this 32 Cocker long
string is the md5 as a string password
or of the strong password Francis but
this is really on secure even with the
md5 encryption because you can declare
25 at the next thing we're going to do
is we're going to add another level of
encryption called sha-1 and we're going
to put that around it so now the first
thing it's going so I now this function
is going out of function now the
variable fixed password is the md5 the
password and then the sha-1 of the
password as well we will get a new md5
string that the main difference between
sha-1 and md5 is well it's really
complicated it doesn't matter all you
need to know is sha one is more secure
than md5 but if we are if we were to use
both of them at the same time well
that's just even better so fresh and we
get the md5 string of the sha-1 of the
string password Francis but we kept we
don't need to stop there we can M do
this thing called salt
I'm basically what salting is is when
you add like a random ring onto the
password so instead of possible rather
rude out of stock we could even on a
very immature stalker here so it's just
a string up and answer to know at the
okay actually that's just it's easier to
expand by doing it so we're going to
create a new variable called and it's
going to be equal to mV 50 m string
salsa just up so now if we were to pack
of salt and actually get the brake tag
so this is our salt this is our password
with md5 and sha-1 encryption on it so I
basically what we're doing is adding
this on to add the word password so many
before it's encrypted we're going to 50
right there so I had to do this what
we're going to do is just very simply
and put dot and then just the word salt
and fresh on this should change and as
you saw I did change which is because
the sha-1 value of salt the F original
variable is different to miss variable
plus this variable and to keep it even
more secure we can add and we could add
another salt the start of the word this
could just be anything for the lot
result could be Frances oh we could also
sha1 this solves on the panned and salt
tariff on to the start of the password
now if we echo it out we got another
sha-1 value but if we copy this line and
we are change it to connoisseur finished
on we just remove this and refresh all
round of course we need to a quad on so
I let's copy this step down and here is
our finished password before it's
encrypted with envy five and then let's
not a break I'm back to another one so
this is the finished string that we are
going with it if you are adding this to
a database this is a lot more secure
than just using the original string
that's way more secure than job using
md5 sha-1 to M do good I'm cryptic so um
you know you understood everything so I
just think is I didn't explain it
solving is your process of adding a
string on top of another one and can
make it more secure again by packing or
whatever so I hope you enjoyed this
video don't forget to Like and favorite
the video if you enjoyed it and
subscribe if you haven't already and
they don't well that's it so
see you next in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
