create controllers or our routes next
we're going to be doing is learning how
to create views so in the last video we
made a create view function but it
doesn't actually do anything so for our
create view method we could do something
like overriding it and the abideth
controller to display the about us view
but we could also do something more
simple we could just set about us which
is the name of the view we could say a
contact us for the other view this way
we don't need to overwrite the method in
its controller because we can just
access it from its base controller and
here what I can do is I can just create
the variable that stores the view name
which in this case is going to be Union
and then here what we're going to do is
we're going to load the view so what I
need to do is create another folder call
it views and inside views you want to
create a view for about us we want to
create a view for contact us so now we
have two views created and what I want
to do in the controller is I want to
include the view so I want to say it
require once views /v Union I know if I
run that what we'll get is nothing
printed out just because we don't have
anything created in the views that's
over unless on the next page you can see
there's no actual route for the index P
H so we get nothing if I go to about us
you can see it's run but we got an error
because we try to open about us we
didn't include the file extension so we
just put in dot PHP but on the other
problems because we're going upward to
actually to find find views but now
because we're accessing it from the root
directory we're getting an error so we
just need to change that to just a one
dot slash views to make sure that we're
accessing it from the correct directory
or we could just delete that entirely so
we'll just run this this will work you
can see we get nothing printed out
because the view is empty but if I
include a header about us and I run that
now we get about us printed right if we
go back to index we got nothing printed
out so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to copy the header for a wider space
when the contact of change that to
contact us and I'm going to create a new
route and this new routes going to be
for index so I'm going to copy that
paste it here and we're going to set a
route called in next up PHP and it's
going to go to the View index we don't
need to call the index on the create
view the exact same thing it's indexed
up PHP because that's what got your I
will return so we need to call the route
in next up HP but we can call the view
just index if we want and then here what
we want to do is want to call that index
for our index controller and then back
here and controllers what we'll do is
create the index controller
and we'll just copy contact us piston
here then we'll create a view for index
and we'll go to about us and we'll just
copy and paste that in there and that
should be it so now if we run this we
get a welcome message as we go to about
us we get about us printed out and if we
go to contact us we go to contact us
printed out and these views are entirely
separate so we can put absolutely
anything we want on the history mount of
this page and you can see up here
there's no title that's because all it
is is literally this HTML page we're not
actually just including like a string or
something we are including the entire
page and we can make it anything we
wanted but as you can see from this
series that our logic goes into our
controllers and our HTML goes into our
views so we've already split all that up
and we're not ending up with PHP up at
the top some huge amount of metal and
some PHP down at the bottom so that's it
for this video now we've been able to
create controllers create views in the
next video we're going to be learning
how to get data from the database and
display it using the controllers and the
views so that's it for this video don't
