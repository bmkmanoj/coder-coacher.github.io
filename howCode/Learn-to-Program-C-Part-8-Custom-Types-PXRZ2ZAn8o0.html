learning about a special feature in C
called typedef typedef allows you to
define your own custom data types within
see so you may be familiar with the
integer data type now charted a type etc
but we can create our own data type so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a string data type so at the
moment of ICS string test equals hello
world and I printer I hope test you'll
see we'll get an error let's run there
so you can see I have an error it says
undeclared identifier string so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to declare am a
type called string so the way I do that
is I said typedef this is another
keyword and see I say typedef char and I
put asterisks here to make it a pointer
I don't worry about this from now we'll
be getting on that later videos the
reason we're not doing it like this
and saying like 10 is because the nut
would make every one of our strains have
to be that would mean every one of our
strings will be 10 bytes in size and we
don't want the every string of the same
size we want to be able to have variable
sized strings so we create a pointer
don't want to buy pointers for now we're
going to be getting onto them and more
videos soon but if we run this now we
should get our string aqueduct to us so
we run this
as you can see it composite no errors
and we learn learn the binary on we hit
enter you can see we got a hello world i
go dye to us so what we've done is we
created our own type called strain so
this means we can just create a string
and say like we count on any other
language so i can say string save
Francis equals include org let's just I
put this
as well
and you can see notice what hello world
huh go to work
so that's it for this video don't forget
to Like comment favorite and subscribe
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
