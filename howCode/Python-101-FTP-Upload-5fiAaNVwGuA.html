video so obviously I'm using a Mac
instead of a PC this time and the reason
for that is just because they prefer
Mac's 2 pcs I have for ages I just
decided I'm going to finally go get one
so I go to mark instead with PC and but
other than that the video should be the
same
also since I'm using Mac now I'm sort of
getting used to the different like
settings because the software things I
use for videos now is obviously
different so I leave a comment or
whatever just let me know where you mail
me or whatever just to let me know at
what the audio quality is like and the
video quality is like because obviously
I've done loads of checks myself and I
think it's sympathy more better as what
it was but maybe I'm wrong I don't know
so just let me know in the comments or
an email or whatever just to make sure
that I can make the video is the highest
quality possible--
uh not let's get there let's get started
today we're we're
we're going to be learning how to upload
a file using FTP to a remote server
using Python so let's get started so
obviously I'm using Python version 3.3.4
I have a file called test HTML so if I
double click this it says this is a file
uploaded using Python but obviously it
hasn't been uploaded yet because it's on
my local machine so now I'm gonna close
that you can see now I'm on a page at
haiku org called test on HTML but it
says it's not find and this is just to
prove that it hasn't actually uploaded
yet so I just refreshed it hasn't been
uploaded so that's what we're going to
be uploading to our servers
and I'm also using the interactive
Python shell because it allows us to see
the eye part of the command as we do it
instead of having to write some code and
then go over to terminal and execute the
code so in Python there's a library
called FTP libs so obviously if we want
to use FTP we have to import not a
library
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a variable called
filename and I'm going to set that equal
to a test dot HTML and what this is is
this is the file name of the file once
it's been uploaded to our FTP server
the next thing we're going to do is I'm
going to create a variable called FTP
and it's going to hold an instance of
the FTP Lib class so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to say FTP Lib dot FTP
which is in Kyle capital's FTP is
because it's the kiss sensitive pipeline
functions are case-sensitive and this is
a the function and in here what I want
to put is I want to put the host name or
the IP address of our FTP server so if I
have to put in the IP address I would
say one ninety two dot one dot two ten
whoops
- ten nine six because that's the IP
address for the server that haiku org is
hosted on but if I use the host Neil I
can say FTP dot o code.org my hand enter
whoops
FTP lib okay I spelled FTP lib wrong so
let's just say FTP equals FTP Lib dot
FTP FTPS I good org and it should not
work that time the reason we didn't work
is because I said FTP here but I said
FPT up here I just add spelled it wrong
so then what we need to do is since
we've a connected to the server we need
to log in to the server so we say FTP
login and because we starts because we
stored it in the FTP variable we can
access it using the variable name login
so if you use the different variable and
if you use something other than FTP up
here you would have to change FTP down
here to whatever you called the variable
up here
and obviously I'm not going to use a
username and a password that I'm going
to keep on the server because obviously
people could then just upload things and
delete things from haiku org so what I
did was I created a specific user name
and a password for this so the user is
password armed and Python on the
password is password if I had Android
should log since oh it says user Python
logged in
and then know what we are in is we're in
the default route of the FTP server
which in my case is slash file size www
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
CD into the hi gorg directory so what I
need to do for that is I can't just say
CD hi code hi gorg because it says
that's not the way you do it in Python
you have to execute the command within
the python ftp library and then that
will allow us to change directory so
that's easy to do all we have to do is
say ftp dot CWD and what we want to do
is want to put in the directory name so
in my case it's haiku dorg it says
command successful so that means we're
in the high-caloric directory nine
and now what I want to do is I want to
send my file equals and I will say open
and this is the file we want to upload
so we have to give the full path name so
I can't just say desktop slash the file
name so I have to say slash users slash
Frances slash a desktop slash test dot
HTML the open function is nothing to do
with the FTP library it's just a
built-in function in Python
so now if I whoops I almost forgot we
need to add the extra parameters for
whether we can read it in things so what
you want to do is you put an R and a B
and the artist means read and then the B
means buffer so it means we can send it
as a file instead of just a string of
text because you can't upload just a
string of text via FTP so let's hit
enter and that was stored successfully
in the my file variable so now we want
to actually upload the file so we want
to say FTP not sto our lines and then we
want to say is we want to say sto R
because that's a command in FTP and we
want to append the variable name a file
name so I wanna say + find new we want
to add another parameter to this and we
want to save my file so what this
basically says is I store the file name
which is test on HTML some stored test
on HTML and then we want to where we're
going to get past that HTML from is
we're going to use the we're going to
get the file from the my file variable
and we're going to upload that and store
it in the add we're going to get where
on and upload it and go to file new of
test HTML so let's hit enter
it says transfer complete which means
the file was uploaded successfully if I
go to google chrome and i refresh now it
says this file is uploaded or this is a
file uploaded using python so that means
our file was uploaded successfully and
then we want to do finally is we want to
close the connection to the ftp server
if you want to say ftp quit
and then it says goodbye it not means we
VAT is connected from the server so
that's it for this video don't forget to
