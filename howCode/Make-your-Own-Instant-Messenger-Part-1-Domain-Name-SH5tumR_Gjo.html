is we're gonna be registering our domain
name so you can see here I have the
domain messenger not a stubby see what
I'm gonna do isn't gonna register a
different domain name for the actual
tutorial so I go to my domains you can
see I have the domain MSG at ESWC which
is just message for sure I'd say a short
for message what we're gonna do is one
two point in a bad space so what we do
that is we use NS records so we're going
to create an NS record and it's named
it's gonna be hot because if I did for
example www that would be that would
mean that they told me in WWI MST ovc
points the best base but if I put an ad
sign in what it means is I want to point
the whole domain which is MSG Donnie's
that we see towards bass face so when I
I put an art into the name of the record
I choose NS as the type and I put NS one
topping is clogged at CEO and I add that
name server record then we're gonna do
is gonna put another at sign in and
another NS record for an astute opioid
CEO because that is the second best base
name server so if I go over to cPanel
and I just put an ad on you can see that
here it is I don't know me and shows up
spike for the card on domains it takes
me to this page and I'm gonna choose the
domain I want to add obviously I want to
add MSG to at ESWC so I'm gonna type MSG
down ESWC into the domain name the
subdomain just that doesn't matter and
then the document root is gonna be
subdomains
slash msg that ESWC Sabu means is a
phone where I already have created and
that's why I store my subdomains in this
account so that's wrong restoring the
files for an estate at East IVC so what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to click Add
domain so you can see here
the main MSU Nadezhda BC has been added
to my cart if I click back that we just
it just says reusing our maximum number
of domains so what I'm gonna do is gonna
go to that to me and night so here I am
on the home page of MSG de esta BC and
you can see it says index of blank
that's because we haven't uploaded any
files if I go to FileZilla you can see
it's just a blank directory so what I'll
do is let us create an index page then
we're going to do is I'm going to create
another page called to get messages up
HP then I'm going to create another page
called update messages dot PHP and those
are all the files that we need for this
whole tutorial series
so I just refresh you'll see one of the
black page nine so that's it for this
video don't forget to Like comment
favorite and subscribe and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
