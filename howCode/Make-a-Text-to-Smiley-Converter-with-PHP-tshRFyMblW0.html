creating attacks to smiley converter
using PHP before we get started you need
to have an image that has all your smile
and I know this is what mine looks like
this is it zoomed in a lot because
they're only going to be smaller but
yeah this will all be in the description
with the source code so you don't need
to worry about finding your own Smiley's
and so I know I don't know this guess
easily get started so the first thing
we're gonna do is run a credit form on
the form action is going to be index dot
PHP on the method he's going to be post
because we'd be posting data to the
script to a PHP script so the first
thing we need is an input type of tax
the name doesn't really moderates so we
just call up everyone on the value we're
gonna leave blank so the next thing I'm
gonna do is we're gonna do input oops
input type submit the name is song misc
in this case I doesn't matter but I'll
do submit again and the value is that
going to be convert okay so we're going
if we go up here and we click refresh we
have a form of the textbox and button
this is convert and it does nothing in a
minute so what we're gonna do is we're
going to create our PHP script and what
it's gonna say is we're gonna create a
variable called text box which equals
host textbox and we have to put the odd
sign in front of it in case we get
errors and basically this textbox
I just contain are this variable just
contains the data from the textbox so I
would have some types in the textbox so
what I'll do is that I'll say echo
textbox and what this will do is
whatever I type into the textbox would
get accurate above so I'm just typing
around the string text and it gets a
quit above what we're gonna do is we're
going to get it so it changes this
instead of adding it above it's gonna
echo an image of a smiley face so to do
this I'm gonna say I'm gonna create an
if statement actually it's gonna save
tax box equals so I if the tax pot if
the string that comes from the tax box
is equal to this which is in this case
the smiley face then we're gonna use
we're going to create a variable called
output and up here we also want to do I
take another variable iPod okay so what
we're saying is it's gonna equal the STR
replace function and this takes three
parameters the first one is what you
want to replace so in this case we want
to replace the smiley face second one is
what you're gonna replace it with so
I'll just happy and then the last one is
more you want to get it from which in
this case is text box and then
down arrow we have to type in is I put
so react with the iPod below the tax box
so now if we type in the smiley face
then we hit enter it says happy if we
type anything else it doesn't do
anything ok so that's what we go on one
of those we'll change this to a div div
style is going to equal a class called
happy and it's going to so that we can
actually see it it's gonna have a space
in it just one space so now I am moved
or not we're gonna include this style of
CSS file so there's Simon link rel
equals stylesheet type equals text slash
CSS and it's RAF which is the location
equals style top CSS because it's in the
same directory as you can see up here
and so just in case you were wondering
if they adopt the forward slash is the
same as just putting up it's just a
different way to do it so now we still
now we've included the class we actually
need to create it so I'll say it dot
hoppy background-image:url the
background image URL is going to equal
images forward slash Smiley's dot PNG
and the reason it's my stop nu is
because in the images folder we have a
PNG file called Smiley's and the next
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna say
height 20 pixels width 20 pixels and
background position and they're the
width and height 20 pixels is because
each smiley is about 20 pixels so I'm
we're just going to give this the two
parameters of zero because the happy
smiley face is here this is what we're
going to use so we don't need to move
the background at all it's just going to
show us this one so let's try this no
before you refresh the page and we type
in this mining base okay so something's
gone a bit wrong so to fix this we go to
view source and so the script is working
because we have a Davis not hoppy and
all word the style set the hoppy the CSS
is working so what I'm gonna do is just
copy this and make sure that this is
going to the right file
okay so the problem was instead of
writing div style I should have written
div class because um the class is called
thought hobby and the if I used style
then I could just put CSS you're not the
actual name of the class so now that's
fixed we're just gonna go back and
refresh and then type it in again and we
get the a smiley face so what we're
gonna do is we're copy this I'm gonna
say house I will just change this to a
different smiley face and we'll just
call this one ecstatic so in here what
we do is we copy the old hoppy style
again and we change it to ecstatic and
I'm gonna change this value to minus 20
to go 20 pixels to the right so let's
refresh again and then type this one in
this time and okay we get the wrong
smiley face so we got this
one instead of this one so and one more
thing for this to work in Firefox and
opera we need right background
attachment fixed and then when we do
that then we need to put it back down
here so what this is probably gonna do
is it's gonna move the images so when i
refresh and yeah we get a messed up
image so I what I'm gonna do is use
trial and error to fix this I'm gonna
make sure the other one works so as you
can see this is changing okay so what
I'll do is I will say for this one to
ten and then this one's ten and we'll
try it again so that looks more correct
but still wrong because it's the wrong
one
because we were trying to get this one
but our this one but instead we're
getting this one so I will come back
when I have the correct numbers okay so
after messing about with the numbers for
at a good bit these are the numbers that
work for the Hobby one we move it eight
pixels to the right and minus ten pixels
which means and sort of like ten mixels
up but since the images were painting
kind of it's sort of hard to understand
but when you mess about with the numbers
you'll realize and the other ones is
minus 12 minus 10 and I can prove these
work by typing in the first smiley face
let me get that one yeah a regional one
and then we type in this hack I'm gonna
get this one okay so I'm not gonna waste
20 minutes of a video showing you every
single smiley face because
I've showed you the first two so anymore
you wanted all you'd have to do is to
the same thing I just did but just get
it so um think of it like a square and
you're trying to get the square to go
over the specific image kind of part of
a so the first score if someone types in
this then you want it to go to this
square you want the square to go over
this image and if they type in this then
think of it like whoops square that you
want to go over this image so you just
if you think of it like that and you can
just move a imagine moving a square and
position it on top of each of these
images are twenty by twenty pixels
square because that's the size over the
div height north of the div so that's it
for this video I hope you enjoyed it
