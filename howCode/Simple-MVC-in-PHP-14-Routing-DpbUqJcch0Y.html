learning about MVC which stands for
Model View controller MVC is where you
split up your design your logic and your
data into three distinct parts so for
example at the moment
you can see we have some PHP code up
here and here's some of the logic for
our application here and then right
below that we have some P HTML some more
logic it's all mixed up together and
when you start create really large
projects this can become difficult to
maintain
so MVC solves this problem by splitting
your PHP code into your controllers your
HTML in your views and your data which
is what you get from your databases into
your model so we're going to make a
really simple MVC application and we're
going to use this for our social network
series so let's get started so the
reason I have this page in the
background is because this is what's
currently powering haiku org haiku org
uses MVC in the background if I click on
this index page you can see it looks
nothing like our current index page
which is full of HTML PHP and it's
really messy so here all we have are a
couple of variables we have this special
function here that auto loads are
classes for us it's not that important
to model-view-controller we just need to
remember to do it the first time we set
up a project here what is important is
this file called routes and routes is
how we now get around our app so if I
want to create a new page I have to
create a new route through the way
model-view-controller works is we create
our index page and we modify our
htaccess file so that any page someone
requests we send them to the index page
and we pass a URL parameter which tells
us the page they wanted and that our
index page handles the request so for
example if I go to a haiku org and I put
in absolutely anything and I hit enter
you can see it says invalid route
because our route doesn't have a page
for that but if I go to about us you can
see it just about how cool it doesn't
actually do anything in a minute but you
can see that's a valid page so if I go
to includes we have our classes here we
ever gave this class our login class
request class things to get out then we
have our controllers and we have a
controller for every single page the
controller is where our logicals
so in the case of the user profile page
at the minute all we can do is get user
details and we printed out to the screen
where it starts to get interesting is
when we have routes and views if we go
to views and we go to our about us you
can see that's the page that I just saw
that's the view that was just loaded
when we had to about us and then routes
is probably the most complicated here
when we want to create a new page we
create a new route we have the default
route we have about us and then we have
couple
one so in this video we're going to make
a really simple MVC framework and to
start off we need to create a htaccess
file so here I have a simple project
called simple MVC and we have a blank
index page so now what we want to do is
want to create our htaccess file so
we're going to create a new file and
it's gonna be called htaccess so I'm
going to cheat I'm going to go to the
high code one and I'm just going to copy
the HD access file from there because
all we need is this line here so we said
rewrite engine on and we paste in this
room and all that does is every time we
go to a page it will send us to index to
PHP
what does do to prove that is I'll just
echo cat URL so if we run that you can
see we got index.php if I type in such
about us we get about us return to our
index page knows what page were on no
matter what and it can handle up so the
first thing we want to do is want to
include our routes so let's say require
one I'm gonna create a file called
routes to PHP then we'll create a new
file we call it routes so now that we
have a routes file we can start putting
routes in here so we could say something
like route set and then here we get the
route an e/m so I'll just give the about
us route in them and then when we access
the route we can run a function and
we'll just pass the function in there so
we're just going to say echo about us
but as you can see we're going to get an
error because there is no route class
and there is no set message so we need
to create that first so to do that we're
going to create a folder called classes
and within classes we're going to create
a file called route for our route class
here what we could do is we could
include the route file but what we're
going to do is like I said on the last
one we're going to go to our index page
and we're going to auto loot our classes
it just means that we only have to do
this once so I can just copy this
function and it's a special function in
PHP that when I paste it in here it will
auto load our classes for us and we want
to auto load our classes from the
classes folder so it's actually just
means we don't have to include the
routes class specifically so now that
we've done that when you create the
routes class we'll say class routes and
then we'll say a public static function
set
and we'll just give it to parameters P 1
P 2 so we don't get an error
so our Sat method is going to be simple
in this video all we're going to do is
have a variable up here called valid
roots and it's going to be an array and
then the first thing we'll do is we'll
change this to root and we'll change
this one to function something about so
I'm just going to change that to public
static valid roots and then what we can
do is we can simply say South valid
roots equals root and then here I'm just
going to print our self valid roots so
we can see all of the roots that get
added so now if I run that you can see
if we have an about else root and if I
go back to roots and change that to
something like contact us
you can see no they're as frigid Oh
twice but the second array has all of
the roots in it it has the contractile
sweet and husband boat Oh through so
we're able to store our roots in an
array and then therefore we can say
whether or not a route is valid or not
so that's been a simple introduction to
MVC and routing in the next video we're
going to be learning about controllers
and views and then we're going to be
adding it into our social network series
later on but that's it for this video
