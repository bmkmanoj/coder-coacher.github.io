third video in the Python 101 video
series and today what we're going to be
doing is going over what variables
aren't how to use them so actually let's
just get started
so the first thing you probably gonna
know want to know is what is a variable
so a variable is basically just a
placeholder for it value it's used in
programming quite a lot and it's in mods
as well so the best way to explain this
is probably just with an example so we
could create a variable called my var
which means my variable and well look at
sky she start so if we're if you're
familiar with something like PHP you'll
know that to create a variable type in
my bar equals oops
my bar equals this is my variable so
this is how you create a variable in PHP
one in Python it's different because
well it's a different programming
language so in PHP you declare that it's
a variable you're going to create
because of the dollar sign button Python
you don't need to do that some Python
all you have to do is type in my bar
equals there's just a hello morons and
we don't need the semicolon because it's
Python so we hit enter so now what i've
done is i've assigned the place holder
was just a word of my bar the value of
hello worlds no one ever I just say
print
I've our Python knows that I'm trying to
print is hello world so the way you do
we're declaring a variable works is you
give it a place holder so I said gnome
one which is what I want the variable to
be called then to assign it m to assign
a value and in most programming
languages to assign a value in most
programming languages it's just a single
equals then the programming language
knows what's directly after the equals
is what you want to assign so as you can
see
the technically this is a sentence hello
world because there's a space and his
punctuation and things in it so that
shows our own programming that means
basically we have to surround our
sentence in single or double quotes and
then programming it's called the strings
so whenever you see a string it has to
be surrounded in single or double quotes
but with a number since the numbers
obviously not a string because there's
no spaces in a number and there's no
punctuation in a number all we have to
do is type in the name of the number or
the number directly after the equals we
don't need to include you know a single
quotes or whatever so as you can see
I've just assign the value 31 to the
variable num 1 so now I asked before if
I type in print num 1 it gives me 31
variables you're probably wondering are
you probably thinning yourself they're
pretty pointless because yeah there you
can assign by our values to them but one
would you ever need it why wouldn't you
just type in how to work our print hello
world
I mean print my VAR and print print
hello was I mean that was the same thing
apart from mine after that yeah
exclamation mark but I mean you're
probably thinking why would you bother
using it in a variable because even what
the very much probably worked all that
it was slower because I had to declare
the variable up there and then I had to
print the variable words here all I did
was print the word
so I mean you're probably thinking
there's no advantage but variables are
good whenever you're well well if you're
trying to do a dynamic program so if you
wanted to take input from users or take
input from databases and things you
could store the information and
variables until you were ready to use it
so it's useful for things like that and
if you were to use the 1 value over and
over you can just use a variable instead
of the 1 value so that if you ever
wanted to change the value it will just
change
automatically for all of the times use
the variable so as I said good use of a
variable is when you're getting input
from a user so let's try that so I'll
create a variable and call it user I'm
gonna sign it a function called input
and in here all I'm gonna type in is
what's your favor number so now if I
just hit enter as you can see it says
what's your favorite number because this
is what the function does and then
directly after all I have to type in is
whatever I want so I can just type in
seven and hit enter and what it does is
it assigns the variable user the end
yeah value of seven because it is you
got the input from me so now if I was
just a print user it gives me seven and
you can add things to get other
variables so if I was to add num1
Faustus yeah just add num1 plus user
gives me 30 hit because 31 plus 7 is 38
and if you watch the other videos and
you'll know that if you if I was to add
7 plus 8 point or 89 point for no way
that's a body's helpful if I was to var
to divide 7 by 7 by 8 so is 7 by 5 that
won't give me an even return so if I hit
enter it gives me 1 and obviously 7/5
isn't one it's just one point something
so I'm and if you watch the mods want to
know we have to type in seven point not
divided by 5 and it gives me the real
answer which is 1.4 so with a variable
it's the same so if I type in 1 num 1
equals 5 and then on 2 equals 6 and then
I was to say
num to divide ie num1 it gives me one so
if I was I have to type in I'm for this
to work I would have to type in num 2
equals 6.0 then I could do nothing
2 divided by num1 isn't 1.2 so you could
oh yeah I never mentioned now you can
read re assign variables so if I was to
just say here num 1 because 1 it's just
a 1 4 9 and then we're down the script I
changed my mind and I said no one should
actually I've been sat to to either do
is said num 1 equals 2 will I read
declare the variable all right reset its
value but for any any code up here that
already thinks that number 1 is 1 it
will still use no more nos it was still
taking on 1 as 1 until I actually
changed it which is down here so
anything above this will still think
number one that's equal to 1 so that's
it for this very video don't forget to
