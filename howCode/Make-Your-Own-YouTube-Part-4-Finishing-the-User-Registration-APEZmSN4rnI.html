today what we're gonna be doing is we're
going to make finishing the user
registration if we have time we may do
some other things with the profile mutti
but the main thing we're going to be
doing in this video is the user
registration so this is where we left
off last time it would we could check if
the fields had been filled in so if I
talked to the fields away it says last
thing you cannot be left empty and the
Wicker that's because of these else
statements here so I if we had took away
every field and we deleted the contents
of them all it would tell you first and
cannot be left empty and if we took away
everything first name yeah it tells you
last things we just moved on the fields
until every field has been filled in so
we're gonna go up here and we're going
to say strip underscore tags and that
we're gonna surround the contents of the
first name variable in that so this just
stops and tags being sent through so
that prevents things like ask your
injection and other problems I got so
I'm just gonna paste this in and then
we're just gonna end it here okay so now
I've done that um tags shouldn't be able
to get through so that's just a security
thing so now we've checked if the fields
have been filled in the next thing we're
gonna check is if the username has
already been registered into the
database so I'm just gonna put a comment
here inside check and username oops
doesn't already exist
so what we're gonna do is we're going to
say create query that says cut sorry
we're in a quick cut now we are going to
create a query in the it's gonna be
called check username and it's going to
be equal to a MySQL query we're just
gonna set select username from users
where username equals username on
username is the variable of whatever is
in this field here so whatever is typed
in this field here is checked in the
database like to see if it already
exists or not
so what we're going to do is we're gonna
go down no we're just gonna send um rows
usually in those last num rows check
username and then we're just gonna say
if oops if I'm Rose username equals all
right doesn't equal zero so if these are
exists we're just gonna say error equals
that Union has already being registered
and then we're gonna say else and then
we're going to continue on with the
registration process so as we're just
gonna say I usually name okay let's just
set up so now if we refresh the page
okay we'll just click on it again
so if I type in a username like the one
that doesn't exist in the database you
can see the only username that exists is
Frances
so if I had a type one that doesn't
exist them to create a card okay
that's nothing it's just the function up
here it's not strip tag it strip tags so
let's try it nine so we'll type in
usually in the doesn't exist and will
click create your car okay so we're
having a problem okay yeah okay so what
I found out was it actually is working
it's just I was being an idiot so um if
we type in Frances we got that user
names already registered but I typed in
my user name the didn't exist I was I
wasn't sure why it said user name okay
but the reason it says that is because
it doesn't exist so it can matter some
register the user so now we've done that
what we're gonna do is we're gonna check
we're going to check the password exists
all right we're gonna check yeah email
isn't already used so we're just gonna
copy this again
and paste it down here and then we're
just gonna say house and then do the
same thing again so register the user
basically so we're just going to change
this to check email we're going to send
on those email let's just say that
emails are even registered so now we're
just going to check select email from
users or email equals email so I norms
on that if I type in this Union here so
I'm just going to copy it
oops okay so if I type in this email I'm
a random user mean if I took well if I
type in the email it's already used done
around them username what it will do is
the first check I'll pass
so basically it'll move this check will
be okay so we'll move on to this one it
should say mails already been registered
and there it is but as you can see if I
type in a username that already exists
on an email if it doesn't what will
happen is that any chat will fail it
will a stop the whole thing there so we
should just get a code that username
already exists or has already been
registered so there it is so those are
checks for the username in the email
the next thing we're gonna do is check
the password so we're going to say it if
password equals all right doesn't equal
password repeat then we're going to UM
register or no we're going to stop the
stop the registration now we're just
gonna say error goes beep passwords
don't do much and then we're gonna say
else and then we're going to register
the user so I just threw the user and
what we're gonna say is up here we're
going to change the value of these
variables so we're gonna create a
variable called salt 1 equals okay so
what we're saying here in the salt 1
variable is we're just gonna put around
them word and so
I just put my a.m. in and then we're
going to do salt 2 equals another random
words um I don't know
Cokie I don't know any word and then
we're going to put a third salt on so
salt 3 equals I don't know PHP so
there's our three salts which are am
just that words that help make our
passwords more secure and what we're
asking to do is we're going to reassign
the variables salt 1/2 md5 salt on and
we're just gonna copy this for all of
them and then just change it to two and
three what we're gonna do now is we're
going to say yep password equals
password and then we're going to append
these salts on so we're just gonna say
salt 1 dot password we could say salt
oops
wicked as a salt 3 and then we go down
here and say password equals password
doc salt 2 so that should make it pretty
hard for someone to crack and in case
you didn't already know what salting is
is basically adding a word onto a
password and then encrypting the
password oh no
yeah a salting is just adding the words
the password so that if someone was to
guess the password they wouldn't be out
of login until the guests see a solved
I'm on your three salts so that should
make it pretty hard to get so that's
what stalking is just adding a word onto
a password to help make it more secure
we just need to do the same thing for
our repeat pasword so uh oh we actually
need to say md5 I know md5 is not the
best way to encrypt passwords but with
the salts that are already encrypted in
md5 hopefully I should have sort of make
it okay whoops so what we're gonna do
now is I'm just gonna do the same thing
for password repeat so um just change
all these so there we have it and then
now we can check to that work so if we
refresh all right just go back on the
page and we type in for the password I'm
just gonna type password password again
we should get act with nothing okay it's
probably because it's you see okay it's
a password one and password to no
password repeat so we're just going to
change that so I just miss these here
and then change
if statement so now we can try that
again
so I type in password and then my sword
will get out good nothing so it's a good
sign if I type in password and Google we
get the passwords don't match so that's
good that means our whole thing's
working so yeah not we're gonna do is
were actually going to register the user
so as you can see we have one two three
seven that fails it fails if you include
the ID so we need our query to of it it
I need to query arose otherwise it won't
work it just will insert so we're just
gonna say register equals mysql query
insert into users values so we have
eight things so I'm just going to do
this eight times
let me see that's it so uh so I'm just
gonna type in nothing for ID because
it's auto increment unset to the primary
key the next one was first name last
name username huh all right that's
probably email password date of birth
locked so we need to do date of birth
unlocked for the moment we cannot leave
those empty now we'll just see does this
work so to check if it works we're just
going to say I registered successfully
so
now we're just going to cut create a
cunt we're going to get property this
time so Francis a username I'll just do
creative code email I'll just put
anything does matter password I was a
sad - password and then password again
and like create your account so it says
die or it says register successfully and
everything's disappeared so that means
the die functions work but I'm just okay
password so for that might not have
worked because it's not password its
password one so let's just try it and
might have worked but it might not okay
so it did work even with the a password
not working because we still supplied it
involved so that's probably why it
worked so we're gonna fix that well we
have fixed it with possible one so we
will try that one more time so I'll just
put anything in these fields it says
registered successfully so now if we go
to PHP myadmin and we refresh okay so
something has okay yeah it did work it
worked because like I didn't think it
works because it said to totally when I
remembered I'd already admitted the last
room so I didn't say no the password is
an md5 encrypted string instead of the
word password so we need to change that
with the login otherwise the login won't
work and date of birth unlocked need to
yeah done well locked is easy I want to
do is type in low because by default the
users account will be unlocked but did a
birth but you need to set it equal to
date of birth so what we're gonna do is
we're going to click create your account
I'll create the kind and when you're
going to we're going to create a
drop-down so in here at the bottom
above the create account button we're
going to say option and we're going to
okay so that's actually select select in
here we're just gonna say option option
the volume of the option is just going
to equal first it's going to be a date
so a dam so one and then it's just gonna
say one so let's refresh we can see one
drop time with a 1 in it so we're just
gonna copy this we need to go all the
way up to okay no an easier thing to do
is actually I'm just a have a tax box 3
tax boxes I'm the user types in there
dance to see have us waste in time so
there's our three tax boxes so I died
months mine year the volume is going to
be empty
we're gonna get rid of the P paragraph
bricks beside it and then st. noise so
we have three input boxes and we're
going to say size equals 5 and we will
say the first box shrinks a lot the same
with this one so size equals let's
actually said 3 no the month one should
be pretty long so it would say 6 for
that and this one should be 3 and then
the Year size can be number four
so at Molly the way it works is the user
puts in the death they were born so I
could say 411 or F for November a man
out of the year so I'm that looks about
right so what we're gonna do is gonna go
up here to the very top I'm you have to
do this quick because it looks like
we're gonna out of time so we're just
gonna copy and paste this change this
today month I'm in year and for security
we're actually going to set the max
length to because it's the only it's
only two numbers long and then two for
that and then four for that because
we'll change it so after you use numbers
so now if I'm not we're gonna go to the
top we're gonna change this today year
and then bingo baby equals mom year so
we can try that and I let me see let's
go over a bit we need to make this
compulsory so I just sat here just at
three times
so today equals zero it's month goes
here onf year equals nothing the day you
were born
what's wrong down here
the day you were born
cannot be left empty a month you were
born
Janabi that's empty and the year you
were born
cannot be left empty so that's true
whoops there so let's try it now
create a kind and this is just gonna be
anything just longer that doesn't matter
either that doesn't matter password
password so just follow for Aladdin
and then I'm saying 1900 if we really
wanted doesn't matter so create a
contrast stirred successfully users wave
three rows
it's all working correctly the theater
berth is formatted correctly and um the
lock is working and everything seems to
be working okay we can make sure I just
make sure something didn't get cut off
okay that's so glad that the it's been
cut off so we need to make that it
longer so it whoops we go to structure
and date of birth we just need to change
the length to ten characters and that
shouldn't matter anymore the only reason
it got cut off was because of the the
forward slashes and made it two
characters too long so now I that should
work nine
