implementing if statements in our
programming language so you can see here
I'm on the basic Wikipedia page and you
can see this is how the DEF statement
looks in the basic programming language
so we're just going to look slightly
different it's gonna be a variant of
this so without any further ado let's
get started so if I come to the terminal
and I just type in Python 3 and I say
basic PI and I'll give it the file test
outline you can see it says androoni and
my type in Francis McNamee and you can
see there at Aqueduct for us so we're
gonna do is we're gonna come in here
when it's leapt out and we're just gonna
create an if statement so f stim is
gonna look like this it's gonna say if
and that is gonna have a condition and
our condition is gonna be something like
1 equals 1 or 2 is less than 1 or
something like that so a condition is
just anything like is so test people -
hello
that's the condition this part in here
is called the condition so in our
estimate we're gonna have the F key word
then a condition so let me say 1 equals
1 and if you go back to the Wikipedia
page you'll see that you can pass an
operator in basic there's just a single
equals but in our version of basic we're
going to have double equals that we're
going to said then and then what's the
end if done here and in here what we'll
do is we'll actually just say print
hello world so here's the syntax for our
if stem and it says if then followed by
a condition then we have the van keyword
then we have the body of the F statement
and then we have the closing and if
so if I go into basic top pie and I
create the new F keyword so all we have
to do is copy this and paste it down
here and we get just type in F here and
we type in the lowercase version I'm
gonna type in if there so what we could
do instead of having two separate
versions we can just make everything
case-insensitive so we'll do that into
the end of the tutorials but for now
we'll leave it as it is what we want to
do is we want to stop the rest of the
interpreter running we want to just
print out the tokens so we return 0 or
we return an empty string which means
the if we go down here the parse
function has nothing to parse so it'll
just exit straight away so that way we
can exit the interpreter after you put
the tokens and here we're just printing
the tokens out so if I go back up here
and just run this again you can see it
says if equals equals and then it stops
because it doesn't oops and then it s
stops because it doesn't recognize the
end keyword so we have to do is just
come in basic top PI and we want to add
the Dan keyword so we just copy this
again mr. deer change this to then
change this to then and change this
today I run this again you can see now
it says if equals equals then one time
11 so you can see we're having a problem
recognizing the number because in our
program what we said was 1 equals 1 but
what our laxer did was it didn't know
how to do that so it just took each of
these equals individually and then what
hard left was two ones and out of them
together for me at 11 so what we have to
do is we have to come up here towards as
equals and we want to have a special and
double equals so what I want to say here
is if tokens whoops
minus 1 is equal to equals bammel said
tokens donna pan equal
we'll say a qaq for double equals and I
will say else and no more ham this
equals here it's what we're doing here
is we're checking if the last token in
the tokens list is unequals already then
we're just going to append equals equals
actually we won't want it we don't want
to do that we want to say tokens minus 1
is equal to equals equals that's because
I'll show you actually so if we do it
the other way and we run this you see
this is what we get we got F equals e QE
q then and then we have the rest of it
but we want to do is want to take this
and put it in there we don't have to
equals so what we want to do is just so
tokens oops minus 1 to get the last
token is equal to e in QE q and we run
this again notes as if you equ then and
then we have the number as you can see
here we have F which is correct then we
have equal EQ EQ which is correct
because we're recognizing the double
equals but before this we have to have a
number and then after we have to have a
number and then that will get rid of
this number so what we do that is we use
an equal sign as in telemetry so what we
can do that is we have to make an equal
sign on a space a delimiter we just copy
this up to the F state or from the F
part of it and we come down here and we
say if we see in equals so we just paste
it in here run this you can see if num1
is equal to or equals equals then we
need to get the other one so the way
we're going to do that is we're going to
use and then also as a dimer so we're
going to look for the van keyword and
we're just going to make that as a
limiter
on this you can see nice as if num 1 is
equal to num 1 then so we've got the
first line correct we're parsing the
first line correctly then what we want
to do is we'll get the print hello world
so let's just print hello world on its
own run that you can see we can
recognize those tokens correctly so we
don't need to do anything to that but
for some reason our van isn't working or
for some reason your print isn't showing
off to the van so what I'll do is I'll
just go up here and put it on the same
line and run at night now you can see it
is working there's something in between
the van keyword and the print keyword
that's stopping it from showing so the
way we can check this as we just put in
a new line in and we save it and we run
it again you can see now it's working so
the only difference between what we have
known when we had originally was there's
a table here so if I get rid of if I put
a table and you'll see it won't work
because our our interpreter can't
recognize a table so we do that is we
just ignore tabs so we just come up here
we just come down here and say Elif toke
equals backslash tain which is a table
character then we said two equals
nothing we reset the token variable so
we run this now you can see now it says
if M equals 1 or if num 1 is equal to
norm 1 then print string hello world so
that works the only thing left we have
to do is to recognize the end if keyword
so we just come in here like we did
before copy and paste this change this
to end if turns this to end it and
change this to end so what we need to do
actually is we need to make sure the end
F is above the if otherwise our token
our laxer will recognize the s before
the engine so we're just pasted above
the F and run it now you can see now it
says if num 1 is equal to number 1 then
print string hello world and if and
that's exactly what we wanted to say so
if we come to our file you can see that
is exactly what is written in our file
so that's it for this video don't forget

in the next video we'll be getting our
parser to be able to parse if statements
but for now thanks for watching and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
