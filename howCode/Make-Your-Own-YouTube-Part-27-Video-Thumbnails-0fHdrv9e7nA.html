today we're going to be doing in this
video is that we're going to be doing
what I said in the last one where we're
going to be finishing off the videos are
the up my videos page because as you can
see the my videos page it looks a bit
power and then the last video we did was
that we designed it so what we're doing
today is we're going to add things like
buttons to the my videos page so that
you can do things to your videos like
edit them and delete them and things
like that and then we're going to be
also adding the image so we're going to
do the image first so let's get started
so let's go in here into our my videos
page and we actually need to whoops on
the rump this so let's just go back in
here and then here's our coding and so
what we're going to do is we're going to
11 thinking of that we're looking for
the where is it the page that lets us
upload images so it's probably don't you
yeah upload image stop PHP what we're
going to do is we're going to open that
we're going to upload add a video dub HP
okay actually I will make a 7-inch point
so I'm going to create a new page or a
new file or whatever and then I'm just
going to save it as upload thumbnail
okay so now we have our upload thumbnail
page to page p and literally all I'm
gonna do is copy and paste uploaded
image and you sit in here and then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to change
channel pic two thumbnail so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to press ctrl f
and since I'm in sublime text I can
whoop sax another item to i need to
replace it so i need to go up to find
and then replace it so control huge and
then what i'm going to do is I'm going
to put in channel pick and I'm gonna
replace that with some and then what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to click
with baseball and now it's our replaced
all instances of challenging with
thumbnail for me okay so now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say we need
to change at this part that says data /
user / images / icons so what this is
doing is it's checking of that file
exists and we need to change this
directory because this is all our
thumbnails are going to be a balloon to
a different directory so let's go into
our website's files again now we're
going to go to add data users and then
we're going to go into videos set of
images we're going to go into videos and
then what we're going to do is want to
create a new one a new folder called
thumbnails
so then what I'm going to do in this in
the videos folder is I'm going to create
a folder called thumbnails since we're
on our film nails are going to be stored
and okay yeah we can leave all the rest
of it and what we need to also do is
just copy this means they think this is
a in the simplest twice so let's find
our worries here it is and let's just
piss in here okay and then what we want
to do is we can leave all these
variables the scene because we're never
actually going to change you change them
if you want but it's not really required
so I'm just going to leave it and then
what I'm going to say is update the
table videos set thumbnail equal to or
profile think okay we'll leave it a bull
chains are more actually so set that one
equal to some okay and then what we want
to say is were a video that's actually
going to our database make sure he is
right so we're in our database now we're
going to go to war let's go do this two
more video ID there that's when we wants
we're going to go we're just going to
stay at war video underscore ID equals
let's see just a video ID we're going to
get the video ID variable from the added
video page so let's go back to our root
directory we're going to add a video to
PHP and we're going to drag that into
sublime text and we're going to get
video ID from the URL
we can actually get rid of uploading
stuff HP night I will just piss in
videoid here okay so what we're going to
do now is we're going to
oops okay so what we're going to do now
is we're going to or is it I think she
should work so we need to go into our
videos table we need to add a new row so
one out this row at the end of the table
and what it's going to be called is some
set it equal to just a text to make
things easier I want to click see if
there are videos are our videos tables
been altered so then what we also need
to do now is we need to go into edit or
yeah we need to update the my video or
the upload videos page and the added
video page so it's uploaded up page
mooney change that one so let's go in
here and say at the very end we're just
going to have anyone leave it blank for
now okay actually will say images / um
not PNG oh I will leave that like that
for now because that's the default and
we'll just copy it and go to add video
to PHP and we don't actually change this
so we'll leave that like that and that
should be it so let's go to the end the
new page we just created to upload
thumbnail upload from you top HP video i
G equals and then when you get that from
the database so those are video ID and
I'm just going to paste it in here
so here's our upload image
our upload image file uploader so just
go to choose file um actually I'm gonna
find more than a comeback yeah what I've
found it I don't know i'll just to go to
upload one from the tutorial so let's go
to images and that's uh put that one and
click upload image and now what we're
going to do is we're going to go to up
here and we're going to go with you data
users videos some nails and now
nothing's here okay that's not entirely
bad bob h Nemechek did it i upload to
the videos table i no it didn't so let's
see why that didn't work okay
you
okay okay so as the problem was the
forms uploading to the wrong position
CSS upload image nori and we were trying
to upload it to upload thumbnail so you
go back to upload company of the PHP and
oh yeah we have to also include the
video ID and then we want to do is want
to come down here just in here and we
change this to work whoops upload
thumbnail stop PHP video ID equals and
then PHP echo oops video ugly okay so
let's try that now so let's just refresh
pictures file upload an image upload a
compliment she says I've been downloaded
successfully run the same URL and if we
go into thumbnails now we have our image
so I can as you can see how we can see
that there at what I can actually just
go it straight into it so I could go to
slash data and then I can just go
through all them so click users and then
videos and thumbnails here's our image
and here's our image uploaded the Anax
probably check is dead again associated
to the video and you can see here that
it did so there's our our thumbnail and
upload f function is working so let's go
back to my videos another we've got that
working we can actually display it
so I'm going to copy the title and then
I'm just going to say a thumbnail I now
we've got the a thumbnail we can
actually use it so what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to create a div here
create an image when hit with HTML and
then set the source April to data / user
/ videos / thumbnails for Tosh oops a
pitch p whoops sorry you do not echo a
some meal and then we want to say is
just a style equals gotta keep sorry i
do not have float left okay so am we
also need to add change the size of it
so I just SAT with a maximum width of I
don't know 200 pixels and then that's a
fresh so here's your video I image is
probably a bit too big let's set it to
150 will set the height to what's at the
height to 80 maybe am
looks a bit weird but that's just
because we didn't find the proper
perfect image for it so that's it for

what we'll be doing is we'll be adding
buttons and things along the end of the
side here or the bottom or whatever that
would allow you to add videos and upload
