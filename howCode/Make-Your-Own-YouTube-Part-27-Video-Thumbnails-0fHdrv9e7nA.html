today we're going to be doing in this
video
is that we're gonna be doing what I said
in the last one where we're going to be
finishing off the videos are they on my
videos page because I've been seen in my
videos page it looks prepare and then
the last video we did was that we
designed it so what we're doing today is
we're going to add things like buttons
to the my videos page so that you can do
things to your videos like edit them and
delete them and things like that
and then we're going to be also adding
the image so we're going to do the image
first so let's get started so let's go
in here you know our my videos page and
we actually need to whoops I'm in the
wrong place so let's just go back in
here and then here's our code again so
what we're going to do is we're gonna
one my thinking that we're looking for
the where is it the page that lets us
upload images so it's probably don't you
know yeah upload image stuff PHP what
we're going to do is we're going to open
that we're going to upload add a video
dub HP
okay actually no one makes an inch more
so I'm going to create a new page or a
new file or whatever and then I'm just
going to save it as upload thumbnail
okay so now we have our upload thumbnail
page type HP and literally all I'm gonna
do is copy and paste upload image and
it's sitting here and then what I'm
gonna do is I'm going to change channel
pic to thumbnail so what I'm going to do
is I'm going to press ctrl F and since
I'm in sublime text I can whoop socks
now that I mean to you I need to replace
it so I need to go up to find and then
replace its foot control huge and then
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
in channel pic and I'm gonna replace
that with something and then what I'm
gonna do is I'm just gonna click with
baseball and now it's have replaced all
instances of challenging with thumbnail
all right okay so now what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to say we need to change at
this part that says data slash user
slash images slash icons so what this is
doing is it's checking if that file
exists and we need to change this
directory because this is all our
thumbnails are gonna be able to move
into a different directory so let's go
into our website's files again now we're
going to go to add data users and then
we're going to go into videos set up
images now we're going to go into videos
and then what we're going to do is want
to create a new one a new folder called
thumbnails
so then what I'm gonna do in this in the
videos folder is I'm going to create a
folder called thumbnails so this is
where on our film needs are going to be
stored and okay yeah we can leave all
the rest of it and what we need to also
do is just copy this because they think
this is in the same list twice so let's
find out where it is here it is and
let's just use this in here okay and
then what we want to do is we can leave
all these variables the same because
we're never actually gonna change and
you change them if you want but it's not
really required so I'm just going to
leave it and then what I'm gonna say is
update the table videos set thumbnail
equal to words I think okay we'll leave
it a full chains on we're actually still
set that one equal to something
okay and then what we want to say is
were a video that's actually going to
our database to make sure it is right so
we're in our database now we're gonna go
to were let's store just to video ID
there that's when we wants we're gonna
go we're just gonna say I wore video
underscore ID equals let's see let's
just have a video ID we're gonna get the
video ID variable from the Edit video
page so let's go back to our root
directory we're gonna go ahead and video
dot PHP and we're gonna drag that into
sublime text and we're gonna get video
ID from the URL
we can actually get rid of uploaded and
stop hp9 I will just piss in video ID
here okay so what we're going to do now
is we're going to
oops okay so what we're gonna do now is
we're going to or is it I think she
should work so we need to go into our
videos table we need to add a new row so
one out of this row at the end of the
table and what it's gonna be called is
some set it equal to just a text to make
things easier
I wanna click see if there are videos
are videos tables been altered so then
we also need to do now is we need to go
into edit or yeah we need to update the
my video or the upload videos page on
the add a video page so it's upload top
page mooney change that one so let's go
in here and say at the very end we're
just going to have a new one leave it
blank for now okay actually will say
images slash um not PNG oh I will leave
that like that for now because that's
the default and we'll just copy it and
go to edit video to PHP and we don't
reckon you change this so we'll leave
that like that and that should be it so
let's go to the end the new page we just
created so upload thumbnail uploads from
the top PHP video IG equals and then
when you get out from the database so
there's our video ID I'm just going to
paste it in here
so here's our upload image
or upload image file uploader so just go
to choose file arms actually I'm gonna
find one and then I'll come back yeah
when I find it I don't know I'll just to
go to upload one from the tutorial so
let's go to images and that's a put that
one and click upload image and now what
we're gonna do is we're going to go to
up here and we're going to go to data
users videos thumbnails and now
nothing's here okay
that's not entirely Bobby's new check
did it upload to the videos table I know
it didn't so let's see why that didn't
work okay
you
okay okay so as the problem was the
forms uploading to the wrong position
CSS upload image nor and we were trying
to upload it to upload thumbnails so you
go back to upload thumbnails of PHP and
oh yeah we have to also include the
video ID and then we want to do is wanna
come down here just in here and we
change this to whoops upload thumbnail
stop PHP video ID equals and then HP
echo oops
video okay so let's try that now so
let's just refresh pictures file upload
an image upload a backup blue game and
she says I've been job loaded
successfully run the same URL and if we
go into thumbnails now we have our image
so I can as you see how we can see that
there at what I can actually just go it
straight into it so I could go to so I
start and then I can just go through all
them so click users and then videos and
then thumbnails and here's our image now
here's our image uploaded the next
problem you check is did again
associated to the video and you can see
here that it did so there's our our
thumbnail and upload F function is
working so let's go back to my videos
another we've got that working we can
actually display it
so I'm gonna copy the title and then I'm
just going to say a thumbnail I know
we've got the thumbnail we can actually
use it so what I'm going to do is I'm
just gonna create a div here create an
image when Kate with HTML and then set
the source equal to dollar / user /
videos / thumbnails for Tosh pitch P
whoops sorry you do not echo add some
new and then we want to say is just
style equals gotta keep sorry to do
another half float
okay so um we also need to add change
the size of it so I just sent it with a
maximum width of I don't know 200 pixels
and then that's fresh so here's your
video I can image it's probably a bit
too big let's just set it to 150 we'll
set the height to look at the height to
80 maybe
looks a bit weird but that's just
because we didn't find the perfect image
for it so that's it for this video don't

subscribe in the next video what we'll
be doing is we'll be adding buttons and
things along the end of the side here or
the bottom or whatever that would allow
you to add videos and upload custom
thumbnails and things but we did get a
lot done in this video so thanks for
