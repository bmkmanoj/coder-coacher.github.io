doing is we're going to be making our
print statement work with numbers
because at the moment we can only print
strings and not show there's an example
here but and the real basic you can
print numbers on strings so we're going
to be able to do that for this video so
inside of our basic pie we need to
change one thing first
because if we go here and I type in
print practice and the print is
lowercase and then I hit I all right run
out you can see here that it didn't get
wrong and if I change this to uppercase
you'll see that it does get wrong so
what we want to do is we just want to
let this work with lowercase as well so
the way we're going to do that is we're
just going to go in here we're just
going to say or tok equals lowercase
print and we're going to hit enter as
just see now it runs so the way we're
going to work with numbers is that we're
going to treat every number as an
expression until we work we're going to
say that every number is an expression
until we decide we actually work out
that it's a number so what I mean by
that is if I come into our file and say
I just do a simple math expression so I
said 10 plus 2 so this is an expression
and I just put in the number 8 that's a
number but a number could we could what
we're going to do is we're going to
assume if we see a number we're going to
serve as an expression and then we're
going to check whether we see a plus or
minus or divide or multiply sign and
after the number and if we do then we
know it's an expression if we don't we
know it's a number so that's what we're
going to do it so it's going to be kind
of similar to strings where you do
States so that whenever you see the
first double quote then you know to set
the state to 1 and when you see a second
one you set the state to 0 and then you
know you've left the string so what
we're going to do is we're going to go
down just after the print and I'm going
to say LF tok equals i'm just going to
say 0 for now and i'll actually do a
little mysterious will say toby was 0 or
tok equals 1 we could use a regular
expression but
I'm lazy so I'm just going to use the
simplest statement or choke equals 3 or
2 equals 4 on this carbon paste it to
make it quicker so 5 6 7 8 9 and then
that's it because there's only we're not
going to add do anything with
hexadecimal numbers at the moment so
we're just going to come down here and
we're going to press the colon buttons
that were inside our head statement and
I'm just going to say a print number so
now if I just go over to that second
print I'll just put in any number so say
this
we should get number printed i'ts
however many times that is yes we got
number printed out once that's because
we need to set toque equal to nothing we
have to reset the token variable and as
you can see now we at number printed out
wherever many times we see a number so
if I just put in 93 so we get two
numbers we read on that we're going to
see we get number printed twice so what
we want to do is want to create a
variable called exp our started so
expression started we're going to set
that equal to actually we're going to
say expression plus equals tok now we're
going to have a variable called exp r
we're just going to hold our expression
so exp R equals we set that to nothing
and then what we're going to do is we're
going to also go up here I'm going to
create a variable called n which is
going to stop for a number so now what
we're going to do is we're going to come
down here before you return tokens we're
just going to print exp our so if we hit
enter you can see it prints out 93 so if
I just put any number and load that says
94 it says whatever number cut in if I
put a plus and all this other stuff in
as you can see okay it doesn't put that
in that's because we haven't actually
told it to do anything whether there's a
plus or not so what I'm going to do now
is I'll just
LF toke equals plus we'll just do plus
firm I will say X PR plus equals plus or
plus equals toka actually and that was a
said to equals nothing so as you can see
now whatever expression I put in is
saved as an expression so vie so 10 plus
2 and we also ignore spaces in
expressions because that's just a waste
of space in the memory as you can see it
says 10 plus 2 that's our expression but
we've no at the moment of distinguishing
between an expression and a number so
we're going to do up here is we're going
to say I when we see a new line we're
going to say if oops expression doesn't
equal nothing so if the expression is
not empty and we're going to say print
expression and then we're going to say
exp R equals nothing's we're going to
reset the expression 2 and then we're
just going to run that now so if I just
get rid of this print expression down
here and I redo this okay we don't get
anything ecwid itís so the reason we
didn't get anything accurate is if I run
this as you can see we're waiting for a
new line in the code agency it says here
if token equals new line so if we just
put a new line in there media hit enter
you can see we get our expression
returned to us
but obviously we don't want to just wait
for a new line so what we're going to do
is okay so here's what we're going to do
we're going to say if a token equals new
line or taupe equals and we're just
going to say and file and this is the
special token that I'm just going to
create now so what we're going to do is
we're going to come in here and we're
just going to say and we're just going
to pend and file on to the end of it so
it said data plus equals and a file so
now what we'll do is when i refresh i
will reload this and as you can see it
says 10 plus 2 and we didn't have to put
a new line at the end if i just put in
and you like no it will still get
tableaus too so we have our expression
and now what we want to do is we want to
find out if it's a number or not
so we're going to do here is we're just
going to say is exp R equals one it's a
boolean we're going to create that's
going to be 1 or 0 is against PR it's
going to be 0 to begin with so if we see
this + or a you know an egg our - or
something like that we're going to know
that it's an expression and then if we
don't see one then an e is a is exp our
will be 0 so we'll know that it's a
number so what we're going to do in here
is we're going to say if exp are doesn't
equal 0 or doesn't equal nothing and is
in expr equals 1 then we're going to
print out expression then we're gonna
say else we'll say actually Aleph expr
doesn't equal nothing so if there is
actually a number there and exp our our
is exp R equals 0 then we'll know it's a
number to a print expression plus realm
I'll just do this Prannoy this is just
for debugging and we'll say exp are and
we also have to reset it both times
because even though we call it an
expression internally we're going to
know that this is a number this is an
expression so if I just come up here and
reload this in see it says templates to
exp our if I just get rid of that and
say 10 as you can see it says 10 num so
now we can define we can tell whether
it's an expression or a number so what
we're going to do now is we're just
going to say we're going to append the
expression on to tokens list so when I
say tokens dot append and with the print
one we just appended the word print but
with a string we appended string and
then the value so we're going to use
that same format for expressions so
we're going to say exp are : and then
we're just going to put the value which
is divided with a variable exp are in
after it and we're just going to do the
same here except we're going to send num
we're not going to be worried about
integers and floating point numbers and
things we're just going to call
everything in number and whether to a
float or an in for whatever so what
we're going to do now is we're just
going to come down here
and print tokens okay a list out of read
that's just because down here in our
parser our parser doesn't know what an
expression is I don't knows how to print
strings it doesn't know how to print
anything else so that's why we're
getting this list out of range but if
you ignore that for now you can see up
here we have our tokens it says print
string expression so if I just come in
here and I say I print express our print
before that you can see if we just close
out it says print string hello world my
says print expression and if I change
this to say 10 it will say print num 10
