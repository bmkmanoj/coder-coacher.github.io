we're going to be doing is we're going
to be learning how to send SMS messages
using PHP before we started I'm just
also going to say that I'm not using the
localhost and using xampp I mean I'm not
using X I'm I'm using my actual server
and that's because for this to work you
need to have curl installed on the
computer or the server you want to host
it off and my computer doesn't have it
because xampp doesn't come with it and
so you need my actual web server does
have curl so I can use it off there but
um if you don't worry about Carl because
most why opposed to actually come with
it even if they're free web hosts or a
shared web hosts that cost money and but
if you go and sign up the desi lotion
now and you choose a not bound to VPS
server yeah you have to choose there's
like a little different options and
there's no Bunty option so I'm going to
choose that you should be okay and you
should have a Carm installed your
computer as well so let's get started so
at today we're going to be doing is
we're going to be using a website called
clockwork
it's actually an SMS gateway I'm what an
SMS gateway is is a just allows you to
send text messages and to mobile phones
over the Internet so I'm if I go over to
clockwork here you have to actually
create an account and so I'm just going
to log like let's talk more so I
probably an SMS gateway so here's
clockwork SMS don't need what the reason
we're using this is because the messages
are cheap to send on it's really easy to
actually do so what you're going to want
to do is you want to go to sign up and
you want to guy just create an account
so once you've created an account you
just want to login and here's your
account it actually should come with ten
pay of credit but mine comes with five
figures I tested it out earlier so the
first thing you want to do is that you
want to go to sanding and you want to go
to from address you want to put in the
sander you want to be of the message so
that when the person receives the
message that you want this will be the
sort of the name of the person who chose
about so you can put in your own name or
whatever and then that means any message
you sent from clockwork would have your
name as the sander so I just put in how
cool it is and obviously since it's
coming from I vote org we want to sa
high code then you'll I get an API key
automatically when you start create your
card so here's my API key we need to
keep that because we need to use that
whenever we're creating our script and
that's basically everything I need to go
over the start so now we're basically
ready to actually start writing the code
it's actually one more thing we need to
do we need to go back to clockwork we
need to get the or PHP wrapper so
you just want to go to this website I've
just pasted it in you'll probably be
able to find it by just going to add
clockwork SMS and typing in type in
we're guessing that speech for your
offering Google but I'll just show you
how to go how I got to that you just go
down here click on documentation then
you go to code wrappers and you click on
PHP wrapper and then you just click
download PHP robber and this you just
click download zip and Loyola let you
down on the PHP wrapper so once you have
the PHP wrapper down or did you want to
open it up so here it is here here's the
extracted version what we want to do is
we just want to copy a class Clockwerk
the PHP in class Clockwerk exception PHP
just want to copy them
and as you see I volunteered them in but
that doesn't matter just piss them in
here in your directory and then you're
ready to actually start going so then
what we want to do is you want to
actually use the PHP ties and create
your script it's really easy to only
takes about long take about a minute
really too light so the first thing that
you want to do is you want to create a
variable called API key I want to set
that equal to the API key we get from
clockwork so I just have to go back to
clockwork SMS I want to relogin again
then I want to go to API keys and I want
to copy my API key and then we want to
do is one actually require the clockwork
class so we probably want to do that at
the top actually so just put in a
require class clockwork da PHP there
that's just the file in here this is the
spot we don't need worry about this file
because this file talk work or class
clockwork exception is actually included
inside of class clockwork top HB so we
don't need to worry about that then what
we want to do is want to create a new
instance of the clockwork objects we
just want to create a new clockwork
object so we want to create a variable
called clockwork or whatever you want
and we're going to set it equal to MU
clockwork and then we just want to set
in here we just want to paste in a piece
in how we want to put in the API key
then we want to do is we want to create
an array so let's go over here and
create an array and we're going to call
it a message I'm we're just going to set
this let you set this equal to an array
this is so easy it's just exactly what
was on the clockwork documentation the
first one was set to and we want to
assign not equal to add the number we
want to actually send
the tax message - so I'm I actually
obviously have to put in my number so
I'm obviously going to feed this side so
that way obviously I don't want my
number all over the internet so I'm
going to put my number in and also you
have to put in the area code as well and
to make sure that it works
okay so I've just put my number in so
just make sure you put your own number
in and then just make sure that well
that's basically just make sure you put
your number and you may put it
incorrectly with the area code at the
start then what we want to do is we
actually change that the single oops
then we want to say is when I put a
comma and we want to say message I want
to set that equal to and this is
obviously just a mess you want to stand
so I'm just going to say this is a test
text message from uncle org and that's
been almost it there was only one more
thing to do you just want to create a
variable we can call it whatever you
want we'll just say done equals
clockwork and then a minus sign and then
an R which just means we're using the
clockwork object and we're getting a
class from it so in our case it's send
and then we just want to say we actually
want to change it on a sectional data
graphic changes to a variable called
clockwork which is our instance of the
clockwork API so our being the clockwork
object so then we want to say in here is
just a message so this ends our message
so at now I'm going to run the EM and
upload the script to the server so I
just look over here and I want to upload
all these files and I'll be back when
they're done
okay so now those files have been
uploaded I just want to refresh the
directory and I just say I want Everett
refreshes it's a bit slow I don't know
why and we have a problem with that
let's just go over to the folder and I
stated it upload so you can see our
files did upload and now I'm going to go
to my phone and I'm going to put it on
the screen so that everybody can see
that the mass is actually gets sent and
received so okay I've got my phone up so
just turn it off and on so I'm just
going to click on indexed up HP this
will run the script it takes a couple of
seconds because it's obviously got a
toss to communicate with the clockwork
server and everything as well as just
the regular high code one as you can see
it loaded with no errors or no problems
or whatever and as you can see our
message a shows up on my phone if I just
open it up
you can see it says this is a task
message from haiku org so i'm that's it
for this video whoops that's it for this
video don't forget to Like comment
favorite and subscribe I hope you
enjoyed it and also am if there's
anything else you want to learn if you
want to see a more in depth video about
how this actually works without using
the simple robbers and things from a
clockwork or another SMS gateway just
let me know
i'ma make a video about it so that's it
for this video again as I said don't
