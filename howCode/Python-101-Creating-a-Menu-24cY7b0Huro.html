video so today when we're learning about
is how to create a menu in Python like
this man you see here we're going to be
creating one of these in Python and as I
said in the last video all these new
videos are we're on all these new Python
101 videos I'm using Python 3 as opposed
to Python 2 so just make sure that to
make sure that everything works for you
that you're using Python 3 so let's get
started so the first thing we need to do
is we need to save from take inter
import all what this does is just get it
says from the tkinter library import
everything and what we also need to
remember is that in Python 2 it's
tkinter with a capital T and then Python
3 it's T kender with a lowercase T now
we want to do is run a create a variable
called window
I want we want to set equal to the
Quique variable notice it's capital T
and not a capital K and so what this
basically does is just think of the TK
function as the million window which is
why I called it window now obviously we
need the Magna bar so we're going to say
menu bar equals menu and we obviously I
need to give it one parameter which is
window so this just says basically that
the menu bar belongs to the window so
then what we want to do is you want to
say menu bar dot odd underscore cascade
and then in here what we want to say is
label equals file then we want to also
say we want to set menu equals and we're
going to create this in a second so
we're just going to call it file menu
oops up on file menu so then up up here
what we want to say is a file menu
equals menu then we want to say is menu
bar so that way that we're basically
saying the file file menu belongs to
menu bar
now we want to say is tear-off equals
zero so don't worry about tariff equals
zero just remember that you need to have
this or won't work and won't actually
display then we want to say a file menu
dot pad underscore c'mon then we want to
give this a parameter the first one is
enable there's the first parameter where
it's going to suddenly continue I would
like to set it to equal to close because
that's what we're going to get it to do
now we want to say is command equals
clothes and the clothes is just a
function that I'm going to create now so
what we're basically doing is we're
going to say menu bar add command which
is basically just a menu item like these
here so in this new window is a manual
item and open is a menu item and
whatever so what we're doing is we're
creating a menu item come close and
we're giving it a command that it sends
close so now here we want to say def
close and we want to set it equal to
exit I mean I want to run up when the
function runs we want to exit the
program so we give it the exit command
the next thing we need to do is we just
need to say window dot config then in
here what we want to say is menu goes
Maggie bar and then finally we just want
to say whoops window dot me and loop and
what the main loop is is it's just a
continuous loop that runs so this is
basically like a little of the main loop
runs whenever the program is running and
it stops when the program stops so let's
see that this works so let's head f5 see
we made any mistakes or not and as you
can see we get our window and we click
file we have the clothes
menu item we can click close and it says
you sure you wanna kill the program we
click OK and it works it kills the
program so this has been a really simple
example of how to create a menu at a
menu bar in Python and so thanks for

you are telling me of whatever you want
to see so if you want to see something
in particular just let me know and I'll
do my best to make a video about it so
