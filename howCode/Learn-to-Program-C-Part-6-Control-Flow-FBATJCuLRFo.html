learning about f statements and see so
what an F stimmen is is it's part of
something in a programming language
called control flow or decision-making
it's the way a program can make
decisions and do different things based
on the ipod of those decisions so for
example i could say if today was
wednesday do something or else do
something else so then depending on what
day it was the program would do
something different so i can make the
program do different things depending on
whether the condition is true or false
so what we create an f stem is we create
the f key word then we put two
parenthesis and in here we put our
conditions are just right condition for
now then we surround it in curly
brackets as you do a function in c so we
surround our if statement and curly
brackets and in the first set of cardiac
'it's we say if the condition is true
then we run here so it was just right if
true then we'll set if we want the
condition to be false which the cells
and then we say if false so this means
if this condition evaluates the tree
will run this chunk of code and if the
condition of eyes to false will run this
chunk so let's say if one equals one and
we'll say print ass crack and then we'll
say f1 doesn't equal one print off
incorrect so obviously since one equals
one warning I see correct but if for
some reason it wasn't we're going to see
incorrect but for now with the seeker
act when we run this source at GCC oops
learn c dash 0 learn you see we get
correct equity to us if i change this to
f1 doesn't equal 1 which that's going to
make this first condition false which
means we're going to run this second
condition so this also brings us on to
operators and see there's different
types of operators there's the equals
sign which is used for assignment
there's a double A equals which you use
for comparisons there's the press the
exclamation equals which is used for a
comparison that you want to be false
there's also less
are greater than equals and there's less
than equals so you're comparing if
you're comparing two numbers for example
there's also less than and greater than
on their own and there's also ordinary
operators like + minus divide multiply
and there's also binary operators but
we're not go on to that at the moment
we'll move will move on a later so as
you can see here's our condition when we
run this what we should get is incorrect
aqueduct you can see it's as incorrect
what you can also do with an F statement
is you can have nested if statements so
if this is false we're going to run this
else block and then within this house
block we could have another if statement
says if two is great let's take greater
than one now we'll run this so set
printf correct second block this will
tell us that it's the second block that
round we run this we got interact let me
get cracked second block we can also
have an else statement here so let's say
print out another incorrect answer run
this again we got to see my putters
before
but if we change this to the last time
sign this first block will evaluate
false so we're going to roam the second
block which is the ice block you can see
we got in crack then they get another
incorrect answer printed out to us city
has more than just if statements for
decision making it has something called
a switch statement so we use the switch
statement like this so in the switch di
mean you put your condition up here and
then you put your case statements below
so you said kiss and say let's say kiss
one now we're going to run this go to
print off this one and then we're going
to say kiss too whoops printf kiss too
then finally we're going to have a
default kiss so what this does is if the
condition evaluates to 1 then we run
this first kiss if it evaluates to 2
then we run the second case and if it
evaluates to neither of the first two
now we'll run the default case you also
have to put a brick tag underneath to
brick each case because otherwise when
it runs the first case it'll run all the
cases below it and if it runs second
case and run on kiss below it unless we
break out of the switch statement
the default case you don't need a break
statement because since it's at the
bottom of the switch statement it'll
automatically the program will
automatically break out of it anywhere
but you can't put it if you want but
it's bit redundant in the default case
so let's have a condition that evaluates
to 1 so let's say 10 minus is a 10-9
I'm up will get is one swing a kiss one
will run in CSS case one that's sick
tan- it will get to
letzte 10-3 will get seven which is none
of the first two cases so we'll get the
default case which is default so what I
want to do now I'm going to remove these
brick statements and show you what
happens
you
whoops we need to change this so we're
going to make it 10-9 to run the first
case so you can see around the first
case but it didn't react out of the
switch statement so what day it is
around the second kiss and then around
the default case so you need to be
careful when you're using a switch
statement because if you're even if your
case runs if this case is below it or
there's the default case that hasn't run
yet these will just follow through it
will just keep running them as well so
you need to make sure you put whoops you
need to make sure you leave a break tag
blowies kiss unless you specifically
want each case to run unless you want
more than one kiss to run at a time
there's also one more way of doing
decision-making and say this is sort of
a shorthand if statement so we can say
at 10 equals 10 then we have a question
mark then we have our first okay okay
I'll just it like this soul of an if
statement and we'll set 10 equals 10 or
else I will have a print off in here
printf a correct about the wrong doesn't
matter false just doesn't matter and
then down here we will work shop here
will have the other if statement so
there's sort of a shorthand way to write
an if statement which is you put the
condition here then you put a question
mark and then you put your first block
which would be the correct blocks with
the addition of ice too trill run this
expression so they print F correct the
one crack and we want we actually want
to sound cold on and then once have a
coat on and i will say 20 incorrect and
that should be it so what we're going to
get is we're going at both of these
printed out at the same time because
we've got them both running so let's
print this real nice imprint in see we I
cracked be one and we get correct below
that's because 10 does equal 10 so this
first condition of this first expression
is being executed and this second one
isn't if I say 10 doesn't equal 10
you'll see we'll get the second
expression instead of first once we get
correct then we get cracked because this
one is complaining completely out soda
has nothing to do with this first
expression these are just two different
ways of writing makes me the same thing
if I change this to equals so these
basically are the exact same they're
just different my Soraya this is just a
quicker shorter way to write an F stem
and C and this is sort of an easier to
read version that's longer right and it
just depends on your personal preference
which one you're going to use so that's
it for this video I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
