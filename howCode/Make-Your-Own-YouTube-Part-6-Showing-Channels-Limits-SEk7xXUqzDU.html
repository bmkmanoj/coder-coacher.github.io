we're going to be doing is we're going
to be finishing off the channel creating
mechanism thing for our website and I
thought what I mean at what we're gonna
be doing is we're going to be imposing a
limit on the number of channels that can
be created so maybe we'll allows five
channels to be created if a channel if a
user has a channel we remove this
message and replace it with something
else if they have the any channels they
all will be displayed here and once they
reach the maximum number of channels we
will stop them being able to create
anymore so let's get started so if we go
to the database you can see in the
channels table I kind of click on browse
because there's nothing in the channels
table so so what we need to do is we
need to create one so I'm going to click
click here to create one which means
click here to create a channel okay so
we just find a problem Channel okay okay
so the reason now we're getting this
error is because well if you go to the
database we can see we have a channel
that was created but the channel hasn't
has no need the reason the reason that I
went through in the insert it to the
database is because we've said if is
that create channel so if therefore if
that or is it this form is submitted so
if the anything is submitted on the page
we inserted into the database but if we
go back to the members page I'm gonna
click here to create one we're still
sending data to this page because this
is just a submit button that submits to
this page so it was just a simple way to
I got it to take us to the page but it's
given us some problems so we need to fix
those 9 so the first thing I do is I'm
going to go back to the video box and
Rueter acting the database I'm going to
empty that
and now we can just refresh so what
we're gonna just want to put a check in
so we're gonna say else if so we're
gonna say if channel name equals nothing
so if it's empty which is what it was at
the minotaur which is what we didn't
check for which is why and the form was
being submitted properly we're just
going to naku we're just gonna echo
nothing for now anyway and what this
will do is this should actually just
stop our problem so if we look if we
click here to create one now we still
got the undefined in next challenge but
if we go to the database and click on
structure and nothing was inserted so
that means we've stopped the channel
name being inserted and what we're going
to do is we need to just define the
variable so channel name is the variable
so a simple thing we can do here to
remove that error is just how to not
sign it from the post or the a dollar
underscore post and then if we go back
to members and we click here to create
one there's no errors given to us and if
we refresh the structure and nothing's
inserted because that's still at block
and I kind of click on it just a little
link so back here what we're gonna do is
we're going to create our channel so I'm
gonna create creative code and I'm going
to click create channel so as your
channel is created successfully and
we'll go to members and click structure
and if we go here it's now we can click
on the channels so it says one total
which means our channel was inserted
successfully so on the members page what
we need to do is we need to create a
list of the channels so what we're gonna
do here is we're going to remove this
form
and we're just gonna say we're going to
open a PHP block and we're going to say
a channel we're gonna create a okay so
we're gonna check create a variable
called channel check which equals mysql
query select channel name from charles
wire created by equals user which i
think is the variable we used for the
username of the add login user so what
we're gonna say is 'numrows 'numrows
underscore CC for channel check equals
MySQL num rows channel check whoops
and here as usual we're gonna say number
if num rows CC equals equals zero then
we're going to act will create your own
channel so we're just going to say echo
nothing for the moment okay put a
comment here that says they don't have
any channels so they need to create one
and then here we can say else so if they
have some channels that we want to pick
up those channels so what we're gonna
say is wild row equals mysql fetch
associative so I can talk basically and
numb whoops channel check then we want
to just say
channel name equals row channel yeah and
then here we can just echo channel name
and then what we should be activated
with is creative code and we are so that
query is working so what this is doing
is it's saying if they have a channel
we're gonna create a while loop which is
just gonna loop through everything it
just basically loops through forever and
ever and ever so what does is it loops
through every row in database that
matches this query so what it means is
every time it sees a channel with the
created by a column equaling the
username of whoever's logged in it's
going to take the channel name from the
channel name row and it's going to store
it in a variable called challening so
that we can echo it out basically so now
we've got the channel name Aqueduct
we're gonna do is we're just going to
say your channels and we could actually
just put this styling here so we could
say bold to make it bold that's what the
channel name stands out a bit better and
then we could put a paragraph break in
at the end so there it is it says your
channels actually up here on the car
after break-in as well so now if we
refresh says your channels creative code
now if I go to create channel HP again
and I create a new channel so if I was
to create a channel called Francis and
click create channel and says your
channel was created successfully and if
I go to check on members it says we have
two channels Francis and creative code
so what we want to do now is we want to
create our limit for the amount of
channels that can be created so that's
really simple so what we're going to do
is we're just going to say here we're
going to say echo long Roos underscore
cc and now we're going to go fresh the
page and it says two so that's just the
total number of channels that have been
created so what we're just gonna say is
now we can just copy this all right cut
it and paste it in so we're gonna say
'numrows of five channels created so
what this says is two of five channels
created if I create another one so I
create channel DUP HP and if I give it
any name it doesn't matter so Google and
I click create channel good numbers it
says three of five channels created so
don't we need to do is we need to impose
a limit on number of channels I mean
that can be I created the way we're
going to do that is we're going to go to
the create channel the page pay page we
can actually copy this query here we're
just going to paste it in now we're
going to say we can keep all that the
same but we're gonna say here if num
instead of if num rows equals zero we're
gonna say F numbers equals five and then
we're going to to like that and we're
just gonna surround all of this in that
if statement so this way if numbers
equals five it shouldn't let us
we should actually say if numbers
doesn't equal five because okay is that
less than or equal to five
okay so we actually want to say as if
numrows is less than five so if they
have less than five channels created
then we want to run this code or else we
want to say you can only create five
channels at will check five channels per
account so if we delete that so now if
we try to create a challenge it still
let us create two more channels so
create Java PHP and now I'm going to
create another one so I could call this
channel and HP and then create channel
your channel was created successfully
create another one called HTML my
channel was created successfully
and now we can actually just go to the
manage page that says five or five
channels created so now if we go to
create another channel and we try to
create one doesn't matter what's called
it says you can only create five groups
you can only create five channels part
 if we go back to the eyebrow
section here just refresh that we go to
members here and no new channel has been
added we can check here it says five
total rows so if that had gone through
it would be six as you can see the new
channel we try to create wasn't put
through so I chose our limits working
and yeah I will put a little bit only we
can only create five channels and every
channel has to be unique and we fix the
original problem so we're going to do on
the members page quickly is we're
to say if num rows equals zero then
we're going to close off the PHP code
and open a new one we're just going to
create the form again the form action is
going to be created on top HP method
owes lucky we can get rid of the method
because we don't need it we're just
going to create an input type of submit
in equals I don't know go to channel
create then the value is gonna be create
my channel and above the form we're just
gonna say you haven't need any I don't
need any channels yet click here I click
the button to make some adjustments to
make one and then now if we refresh the
page nothing will change because we
still have five channels but if I was to
go back to the root of the value box
database and enter the whole table and
now if i refresh says you haven't made
any channels yet click here to all right
cut the bun to make one create my
channel creative code create micro
channel and there we have one channel
created for this user so that's it for
this video don't forget to comment like
favorite and subscribe and in the next
video we'll be probably creating channel
page
and things and I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
