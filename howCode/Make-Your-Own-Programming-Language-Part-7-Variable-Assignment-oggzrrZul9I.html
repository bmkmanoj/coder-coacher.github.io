able to evaluate expressions using the
Python eval function for our interpreter
and what I've done here is I've created
a file called checklist txt this is
actually nothing to do with the actual
programming language itself it's just a
way of us to keep it's just a way for us
to keep track of what we're doing and
what we need to do next and in the
language so as you can see here we have
you know headings and subheadings as we
see here it says print and we've done a
number of strings and expressions and
the next thing on the list is variables
and the first thing we have to do when
we're starting to work with variables is
assigning variables and that's what
we're going to be doing today so the
axis in the box is just moved on them
and this is empty because we haven't
done it yet so that's what we're doing
today so what we're going to do first is
we have to allow the lecture to identify
variables so if we go over to our source
file I'm going to show you the syntax
that we're going to use for a variable
so we're going to copy PHP so we're
going to say variable equals and then
we're going to add a value so hello so
the syntax for a variable is a dollar
sign followed by a string of characters
and just sign a variable we're going to
use the equals sign and then we're going
to use you know we're going to give it a
string or we're given a number or
expression or another variable so that
we're going to get we're going to do
that so the first thing we need to do is
we need to make our Lexor recognize
variable names so if i go up here to our
Lex function what I'm going to do isn't
going to print tokens and I'm actually
going to go down here and for the time
being I'm just going to comment that out
and a little turn an empty string so
that that way the program will then the
rest of the interpreter won't run so
it'll just print out and the tokens so
if I run this you can see we get the
token print expr or we get print and
then we get the expression token but we
don't get is the token for a variable
but that's because we haven't told the
laxer what a variable is so what we need
to do is we actually need to come up
here and we're going to go down here
just above this and say I
toque equals a dollar sign and state
equals zero this means it's a dollar
sign and a tight side of a string this
means that we're going to save our
started closed form up here we're going
to create a variable called var started
actually given lowercase I'll set it to
zero by default and whenever we see a
dollar sign outside a string we're going
to know that that means we're starting a
variable so what I'm also going to do is
I'm going to come up here and say var
the string and what I'm going to do down
here I say var plus equals taupe and
then I'll set taupe equals nothing so we
have to reset it after each each time we
work out what a token is we want to AB
the token variable so that we can make
room for new tokens and we want to enter
the token variable N and then we can
identify more tokens so here what we're
going to do is we're going to say if our
started bar started equals one then
we're going to set bar plus equals tok
oops tok and then we'll say add taupe
there's nothing so that what we're doing
now is whenever we start a variable
we're going to keep adding the
characters to the VAR variable so that
way when we first see the dollar sign
we're going to know that means we start
the variable until we keep seeing all
these characters so we know that's part
of the variable mean and then we're
going to wait till we see an equal sign
to know that that means that's the end
of the variable name so the way we're
going to know the end of a variable name
is either by an equal sign or a newline
so we're going to go up here to the
newline and we're going to say in here
Alif var start our bar doesn't equal
nothing and we're going to say var
equals nothing I'm
what we do that we're going to say
tokens start append bar and then we're
going to append the variable var to get
the variable name so at the minute the
way we delimit variable names is with a
new line so if I go up to our file and I
just put in a new line what should
happen is we get the variable name and
we got a new token in our tokens list so
as you can see it says var variable so
we've a new token know that knows and
variable means so what we're going to do
is we're going to come in here and we're
going to recognize a variable assignment
so the way we do that is we just simply
come up here to in here we're just going
to set Elif tok equals equals state
equals 0
then we'll say tokens dot and equals
that was a tok equals whoops taupe
equals nothing
and we'll say var equals nothing and var
started equals zero so we have to reset
the variable name just in case there's
one that has been created and we have to
also reset the bar started variable so
now it should be delimited by an equals
as well so if I come up here and hit
enter you can see we haven't recognized
the equals as well on this string hello
world or just the string hello so we're
having trouble identifying the variable
need so we actually just want to put in
here fr oops if bar doesn't equal
nothing then we want to reset it so if
we come on come in here we'll just do
that now if we run it you can see now it
says print expr equals var bar variable
and strength the reason equals is first
is because we have recognized it first
it's what we're going to do is we're
just going to cut that and we'll paste
above so now whatever we
see an equal sign we're going to check
for a variable first and then we're
going it's going to up and out to the
tokens first so now we have them in the
correct order it says print expr of our
variable equals string hello that's the
syntax we want to know our lexer can
recognize a variable assignment so now
we're going to do is print acts and not
come we're done for the lexing part so
in the next part we're going to do is
we're going to assign the variable to a
dictionary so we're going to map all the
variable names to dictionaries or to one
dictionary in python and that's how
we're going to keep the keep track of
all the variables and store their values
