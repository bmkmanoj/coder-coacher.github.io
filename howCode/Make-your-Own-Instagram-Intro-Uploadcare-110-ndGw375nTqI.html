be learning how to create our own
Instagram from scratch we're going to be
using the Django Python web framework
and we're going to be using upload care
which is a smart content delivery
network a blue car is more than just a
content delivery network it allows us to
apply effects to our photos on the fly
which is why it's really suitable for
this series so I'm going to show you a
quick demo of what we're going to be
creating so here's our login page and if
I click create account you can see this
is our login form it has three fields so
I already have an account so I'm going
to login with that
so you can say I'm logged into my
account so you can see here's our photo
fade it shows all of the photos that
I've uploaded and all the photos from
someone I'm following so in this case hi
code if I click on this this is the
profile page so here's my profile page
with my photos if I click on a photo you
see those photo just loaded and I can
like the photo if I want and I can see
the caption and there's the photo and
this photo was loaded from upload cars
CDN so what I'll do is I'll try to
upload a photo so I'm going to try to
upload a photo so what I'm going to do
is just drag it in
now you can see that photo is uploaded
to upload car I can add a caption I can
say hello world I can add a filter
I can enhance the photo let's say I want
to enhance it
there's the enhanced filter has just
been added you can see it got a bit
brighter we can see everything a bit
better and what I'm also going to do is
I'm going to make it gray now it's black
and white and now I'm going to save that
photo now you can see there's the photo
I just uploaded we have our caption and
we have our new photo and if I drag this
into their dress bar you can see this is
the upload car address and you can see
here are the effects that were added on
but we're going to cover these in
another video so let's actually start
our project so the first thing we need
to do is download Python so we're going
to download Python version 3.4 point 4
because that's the version I used for
creating the series in the first place
and I know what's going to work the
reason we're not only the latest Python
is because by downloading a Python 3.4
point 4 we're able to use Amazon's
elastic Beanstalk at the end of the
series to get our project online so
double plays on three point four point
four here are the download links just
install that and you're ready to go next
what you want to do is create an account
on upload care so click sign up you can
create a free account you can see for a
free account you get 500 uploads per
month 500 megabytes of storage and 5
gigabytes of bandwidth so my cards just
been created I'm going to skip that and
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a new project so a projects going
to be called insta pic and there's our
project created so now we're good to go
on the upload car side of things now
what we want to do is set up django so
you can see if I type in Python I get
Python 2.7 point 6 so what we're going
to do is we want to create a virtual
environment so we're going to say Python
3 to use python version 3.4 point 4 then
we're going to say m v and v we're just
going to call it env for our environment
hit enter and what that's done is it's
created a virtual environment you can
see there's the file there so what I can
do says source env /bin such activate
and now we're running inside the virtual
environment so if I type in Python again
now we're using Python version 3.4 point
4 and that's the version we want to use
for this series so next what I want to
do is we want to install django so to
install django I'm going to set pip
install django while running inside the
virtual environment
so now that we've installed Django what
we're going to do is create a Django
project so we're just going to say a
Django admin start project and we're
going to give it a name of insta panic
so if we look in that folder now we have
a new folder called
insta pack we go inside that so to see
what that looks like I have to do is set
Python manage the pie run server to run
Django's web server so just ignore this
error for an eye and what we're going to
do is we're going to open that up so
local host port 8000 is where django
runs by default and here is our django
app running so that's it for this video
in the next video what we're going to be
doing is we're going to be learning
about the upload car api and the things
we can do with the upload car CDN in
terms of photo effects and lots of other
interesting things like facial
recognition and things like that but
