today we're going to be doing is we're
going to be F moving on to the next step
and make our own DNS server and then
being also able to add make our own
domain name extension so the first thing
I'm going to do in this video is a we're
gonna ignore putty for a second and
we're just going to click on start I'm
going to go to the control panel then
inside control panel what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to click up here
and search and type in adaptor then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to go down
to view network connections and I'm
going to right click on the wireless
network connection and what does it
bring up is the wireless network
connection properties what I want to do
is we want to go down to Internet
Protocol version 4 and I want to click
on properties this is where we change
our computers dns to lie us to connect
to our DNS server and use our custom
domain so in the alternate DNS server
I'm just going to type in 8 space it
means 8 space it and what this is this
is the address for your ghost Public DNS
server and this is just Google's Public
DNS because if we just use our own DNS
we would only be able to connect to
websites on our own server we wouldn't
be able to connect to anything else so
we need to have an alternative DNS which
is the Google and Public DNS so I'm
going to do is amend double-click on the
IP address of our our server and I'm
going to click on the properties again
I'm just going to paste it in so now our
computer is going to be a total connect
to our DNS server so if I click OK and I
pick the clothes you shouldn't actually
see any difference if I try to go to I
don't know haiku org it should still
connect my business I take a second the
other it is it still connects everything
is exactly as it was so now what we're
going to do is we're going to go to
we're going to go to a directory called
ET c / bind which is the bind folder and
that gets created will we installed it
then I'm going to type Alice which means
list so I mean well just means
eyeglasses and show all the files
now within the bind folder and then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to create
an amazing mcdr command and I'm going to
type in a zones because everything every
time you make a new domain extension or
new website or whatever the DNS in the
DNS it will have its own zone file so
then what we're going to do is we're
going to open up this this file here
named comm thought local so I'm just
going to type in Nano which is a text
editor built into terminal because this
is exactly sort of what we're using the
moment we're just using probably be able
to see it so we're typing in name our
Nano space named comm dot local and then
we're going to click enter and it's
going to bring up the file and you can't
click on this file and say you have to
use the arrow keys okay so I move the
our I've moved the a green pointer down
here this is where I'm going to start
writing the different things in our zone
file okay so what we're going to do is
we're going to create something called a
zone which is worthy address or where
the m website is actually or the a dns
information for the website is actually
stored so instead of creating it for a
website we'll be creating it for an
extension so we had to do that what we
have to do is just type in the word zone
then we type in inside a double quote to
type in the name of our extension if I'm
going to do doc HC so my extension is
going to be it C and then we use that
curly brackets and we should run the
zone with party bracket so everything in
between
LM is inside the zone just like a
function sort of in PHP also you have to
at the end of the second curly bracket
dupatta semicolon then we want to do is
want to type in a type master this just
makes the add zone file authoritative so
this means this is what we need to do to
make it work with the extension or a
Civil War then we want to do is want to
type in file on that we give it a file
location which is the location of our
actual zone file this is just our
reference to the zoom files for that the
s server knows where it is so then what
we want to type in here is /et see slash
buying
slash zones which is the folder we just
created and then we're going to create a
news
called sctv well that's what I'm going
to create but just call it whatever you
want just for simplicity I'm calling it
the same as my actual extension and then
you have to use the dot DB extension at
the end of it then we have to do is we
have to create a self thing called a
reverse loom because in DNS you can also
instead of just from going from IP to I
mean from going out from the domain name
to the IP address you can also go
backwards so you can use an IP address
to work with the domain so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to do the
same thing again create a zoom hours of
reference or whatever and then I'm going
to come up here and I'm going to type
this is a lot more specific so what
happens is you type in I'm just going to
like this 3.2.1 - in and oops no - dot I
n - e DD r dot R / and the three to one
we have to change that in a second but
what happens is when you get our IP
address which is this and I'm just going
to put it above it so I'm going to move
this here so what we have to do is we
have to here's our IP address listed the
way it should be and then the way reason
I said three to one was because we have
to do the IP address backwards from the
back to the front so at what this means
is you type in one for 1.9 a dot two for
three and that's what we have to put or
that's the name we have to give our zoom
file and then what we have to do is we
have to go underneath and we also have
to do that type sorry at type master
then we have to specify the file
location and then underneath this I
don't know we actually own the work and
we have to give it the file so it's also
it's the same thing again / UTC flash
buying / zones / and then this time it's
our evening docked and one for one
dot 9.2 43 obviously you want to change
this to your IP address of your server
or drop it or whatever when you don't
even have to use digivolution is just
they're a really good company for
hosting so I think they're good and I'm
gonna use it so that's our
alright reference file setup so what we
want to do now is we want to copy this
and we want to cut ctrl X and click yes
or mean press Y and then press Enter and
that'll save the file then we want to do
is we want to add CD into these illness
directory and then what we want to do is
we want to create a new file so we'll
just type in Nano and then we create the
file that we I referenced in the last
one so if I press the up arrow and I go
back to Nam Kham local I actually have
to put a top top forward slash here
because we're in the zones directory
instead of just the buying directory so
I had an internal it'll tell us what the
file we called it CTV so now if I go
nan-oh it CTV this will create a new
file whenever I save it it actually
hasn't created it yet and then what
we're going to do is we're going to say
a dot T army not dollar side TTL one
image which means one hour so that means
what time to live one hour what that
just means is M not whenever I make a
change to this on the DNS server it'll
be cached for one hour and then they'll
have to be changed so I'm just going to
then the next thing underneath it is HD
dot and this is just our extension and
there's no cheap stuff in this file that
I probably won't make much sense but you
don't even need to worry about it just
ad copy what I do and I'll tell you by
the important things you actually know a
lot so the eye n next thing we need to
do is press or leave some white space so
I just press tab and I typed in I n and
capitals now you made another at Tom and
I my type in SOA and then I'm going to
type server dot you can see at and then
a dot a cue afterwards so just do what I
do instead of HC you replace it without
your extension then we want to do is
type admin server not HC so what this
basically set is saying is this is the
name server for the cert for the end dot
HC domain extension and the name server
is just this actual server we're
creating here this is called the name
server and then the admin dot server the
HC is actually an email address but we
have to use a dot there so what the way
it's interpreted the way it's
interpreted
is admin art server on Etsy but it also
doesn't have to be severed I hate to use
whatever you want but I'm just going to
keep it as sohc then you want to do is
to is you want to open some parentheses
and in between them there's a lot of red
stuff here you don't actually need to
know what it does it's just it's just
required to make it work so the first
one is a timestamp which is whatever you
added the file you have to use ty a time
stop so what I'm going to do is after
typing 2013 which is the D it and I have
to type in oh nine because it's
September and I'm so type in twenty-nine
because it's a 29th of September and
then I have to type in the addit number
which in my case is the first added so I
type in zero one so that's what this
number means and then underneath it the
next number it doesn't matter so just
copy what I do I'm going to type in to
idiot zero zero now you can look these
up on the internet to find out exactly
what to do and three six zero zero then
I'm going to type in a 64
oops at 6:04 eight zero zero and then
finally I'm gonna type in three eight
four zero zero so after this is actually
the last thing so that's the end of the
things that I you don't need to know
about they won't understand or whatever
because they're actually really awkward
and weird understand so down here is a
bit more it's going to be a bit easier
to understand it's a we just type in our
extension name which in our case is dot
hits or hit C dot then we type in in
space our mean and power table and then
an S which means mean server and then
server dot can see dot then we want to
do is if the first the next we're going
to do is want to type in a server and
we're going to type in it in and then
we're going to type an a and then we're
going to type in our address of a server
so Mike is going to use my the one I use
for hi code which in my case is one
ninety two dot eight one two ten ninety
six which is the address of the our hi
code server and I can check that by just
coming here and pissing that in and it
might be to 10.1 okay note that said
it's a 102 ten so at neither we've done
that this means that whenever I go to
whenever I type in server dot HC into my
web browser and the domain is going to
take me to my website the final one I'm
going to type in is just a test space
clean space a space 192 dot get one a
210 196 and this is just another domain
name that work you can also put using
external and zone files but for the
simplicity of this tutorial I'm going to
keep them in the actual add only an
extension zone file I'm going to hit
control X Y and I'm going to enter to
see of it and okay so unfortunately I've
run out of time in this video but in the
next video which is probably the last
one in this series that we're going to
be able to finish off the DNS server and
we're going to actually have something
to show it for it which is already an
extension so thanks for watching don't

seen fruits of only react but you will
soon so thanks for watching don't forget
