I know it's been a while and it won't be
this long between videos in the future
but today what we're going to be doing
is as you can see whenever someone opens
a message it does nothing while it opens
and shows the message
so rather today the first thing we're
doing is whenever someone opens a
message we're going to go to our
database and we're going to add a change
the row opened to yes instead of another
one then the message will show up in red
messages and it will be removed from
unread messages so that's what we doing
to start with enough wave any time left
then and I will do other things so I had
to do this we're going to be going back
to the end me and doc jazz file we
created ages ago and we stopped using
and we're just going to modify it so
last time we told it to s and just
submit the form data to a page called
signpost that PHP and this time what
we're gonna do is change it to my
message part which is a parse is just
the word that's used for M sort of when
did it it basically means we did is sent
to a PHP script the PHP script parses it
which means it like it handles it it
does things with it basically that's
what it means
so we've said that we're going to send
the data to a page called my message
parse on the element by ID we're going
to get is what we haven't created yet so
what she will do not not so down here
we're going to change this and to a
button that's gonna submit a form okay
so I've just changed my mind about the
way we're going to approach this I've
got
slightly different idea so we're
starting to create a form on the method
is going to be both the action going to
be okay now actually the one we don't
need the form I don't believe this time
let me think okay so actually we will
need the form the way I've just thought
about doing this it's completely
different to so we're going to need this
mn dot JS file because I just changed my
mind about how we're going to do it so
the action of this form is going to be
my messages WT the form name is going to
be Paris G underscore title it's not
that way to make each time so wet well
that means that when you open the map
you're using this form that won't open
every message you've got it'll only open
the one you'll actually want to open
that make sense so we're gonna have that
two bodies they're both going to be
seven equals submit the first one is
name is going to the open master
dreaming okay I straight up straight off
the value on the bottom is going to the
MSG underscore title um we can get rid
of this moving so why we can just
actually copy all right cut the link
we don't need not so we go back to here
we hit my messages now we have a button
that looks like the end well it looks
like any other button but it has the
title of hi cinnamon which is the air
message title
and what this is going to do is I work
on this maybe I'll just tell you we're
going to an on-click function of a comic
strip taco which is a the same thing we
didn't last one except for changing you
track your honor because we're using a
button and you'll understand why we're
using a button in a minute
so now if I hit - amok it shows the
message look the message doesn't stay so
we could change this to a type thing my
messages
anon stairs so because of we just change
the type it doesn't look like a button
anymore well it doesn't look like it's
time it doesn't use the styling before
because a submit button and an input
type of submit and then if our type of
button even really make the same thing
pretty much are two different things so
I'm gonna open the a CSS file I'm gonna
open me in dot CSS and where we change
the input type for submit we're going to
change that and we're going to copy it
actually and it missed it for the lot
name but type of button so here it is
we're just gonna copy this and paste it
below unchanged input type equals submit
to button
now if we go to our page and just reload
it hmm okay so I got it working as you
can see and the reason wasn't work I
don't actually know why it wasn't
working for some reason
even when I deleted the whole stylesheet
it would uh unrefreshed the browser
still thought i had the old style sheet
I think it's just because the pH has
been cached or something I don't know
well it doesn't matter so all I did was
I created a new I see it I went file see
of Oz unchanged the name of the style
sheet from me and not CSS to start site
style dot CSS and I just changed the
stylistic sheet it looks for know that I
didn't change anything or not works and
it looks the way it's supposed to but I
shouldn't see it it looks kind of odd
because these are on different lines so
to fix that we can just copy this link
and paste it right above they get button
and let's see we've got those know
they're in line with each other okay and
if you wanted you could make this link
about in as well which I might mmm
no actually I'll leave it I'll leave
that up to you so we can copy this
actually you know okay I'm contradicting
myself a lot so we can't cover that
because we're doing with different names
outside its name is going to be set open
sat opened or MSG on the sports item
that's just so that it's a unique
actually as well and you'll find out
about that a bit later on so go for this
going to agree and the press button or
submit button say and it says that I
just I've read this then now when you
refresh mmm okay that's because of this
comma these are separated by commas so
thanks
stop the it thinks that it shouldn't
take any data after this point because
it thinks I've told it to stop but I'm
here because of the apostrophe so all we
do is put a risky character which is a
box lost right before the apostrophe
refresh mmm okay
so because do this it's a forward slash
actually yeah okay that's not working so
what we all we can do from what we can
do is replace this with them double
quotes of the back slash in front of
these not you work there we go I've read
this so we want it so that when they cut
thought it will look whatever it'll
change the value of open to yes and then
um we can move it to the read messages
section okay so that's pretty simple
actually so I'm gonna come up here and
we can actually okay we can copy the
neatness and the volume here come up
here that says a post and I'll just
paste that in and we and give it a
normal car D bracket so I can just a
query writing text is a test just to
make sure it's submitting correctly let
me refresh okay so if you get that error
as always just pop on the back
assignment from the oven from the dollar
sign on the post that goes away so now
if we click I've read this mm-hm okay so
we just need to copy the name of the
form
so I know why it didn't work so I'm
because we had em when you use the
message tightened to make our or snip
with uniquely time very specific message
but the message title contains spaces
which I forgot so what we're going to do
is this to is title because it's a
number when they take messages on accept
okay it's not spaces so we were freshens
it's like I've read it
so the reason that didn't work because
um they put the dot on the apostrophe
the apostrophe on the priority name
backwards and if you're putting if
you're using a variable in between two
apostrophes Sophia like I've read this
we get this is a test which is the text
we want to show up which shows the form
those being submitted correctly so the
next part is quite simple so just make a
comment and say okay ethically private
messages collisions on I don't know
so what we're gonna say is that opened
query that close my query update um DVT
underscore messages or
knock it off the Pvt underscore Matthews
mm sad open equal to gas or let's see
the name of the thing so the name of the
famous passage title you can set one I
missed you record title equals a message
and a short title which is our variable
and then we could just tap around the
echo oh no we don't need to because
we'll see the result on the if we
refresh once one more time and we click
yeah as you can see if we click then it
was the message we go
but if we click I've read this so we
could just know say or die I asked your
era and see what the problem is okay
yeah I would say it says update and it
wasn't it's meant to say update so we're
gonna change that yeah we can try again
hopefully that works we clicked I've had
this know underneath in my read messages
to chose up let me just check
99 I said yeah it should have
disappeared up here so it looks like we
just left something simple okay so it
just needs to it just takes the user to
refresh the page so I'm gonna try that
again so I just log out and log in my
other account on sell myself to messages
so as you can see here we took the
messages hmm we'll just find a bug let
me click this message it works when we
click this message it also opens that
message and let me see that's because
the element by ID ID display a text
um it's there's only a they can only be
one app if we if I go to view source
you'll see yeah they're both or is it
the ID toggle text is the same amount to
split taxes this year so yeah
it can only be displayed once so this is
pretty simple I think to fix so we'll
just move this down and in here we only
should be dogs open to you and in
between will be it's this don't you your
contacts from contacts to our from
toggle tax to toggle tax ID that's
striking and hopefully I'm just changing
this to title text and
okay so this current solution now is
also not going to work so we can just
top it again on let's just start pasting
it in here and I'm just going to change
all these to my single quotes then I'll
come back what I'm doing
so ignore what I just sad about um me
theoretical here and moving the double
quotes I just thought of a better way so
what in your we just put this back where
it was and then we change the function
name okay right I believe as well we're
not doing backward
so no evac we got and we then this is
the next several thing we can do is I I
need a large cargo we use should work so
we refresh this and see how it's working
so what this code actually does is as
you know it says toggle five which M is
what we want
um is no way in Archie yeah it works and
there that's because we've changed this
so each time the actual function is
different you see how you can see it
shows the function yeah sorry I'm in
this ready body what it does is it gets
the function and it sort of piston in
each time the messages there's a message
so for every message it just in the
function self there's three masts use a
little paste in the function three times
and I will
prove that noise so I'm going to knock
out and send another message so I just
found another message as you can see all
third message and if I click number one
it shows up number two it shows number
three
it also shows up and we can select this
you want to drag it to French and it
shows up down there we click this again
I was like this and it shows up but if
we take it multiple times
it only shows up once because I can only
change the value once like I can't
change it from you ask then change it t
as in Jinja t ass because um if it's all
ready to chase at the yes and you child
to change it des it will change it from
yet it will change it yes but I'm gonna
make any difference because it'll change
it from yes to yes is it so now we got
that working we can M copy our code from
up here and paste it down here so we
don't need to type it out again and
refresh and all these all look the same
so actually we can change this to delete
and we'll actually do that next video so
