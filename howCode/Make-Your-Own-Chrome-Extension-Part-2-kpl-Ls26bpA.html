how to make your own Chrome extension
and series of videos so in the last
video we left off just with this button
in the top of the browser we click it it
did absolutely nothing so in this video
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to be actually making our button
do something and what it's going to do
is when we click on it it's going to
make a pop-up show up here and it's
going to have a web page in it that does
something that we choose I don't do
anything we want so to do this what we
have to do is we're going to go into our
manifest.json file we need to add a new
entry in the browser action part of the
JSON file the new entry flips the new
entry is going to be called a pop-up now
we're going to set that sorry how we're
in set that equal to
oops yeah I almost forgot we need to but
uh okay what's called actually a caller
that's what it's called
and we want to specify the add page over
the pop-up ways so I just say my pop-up
HTML and what we want to do is we want
to come back here and instead of
clicking load unpacked extension again
because I just see a become on it does
absolutely nothing but we don't want to
keep reloading the extension so we just
have to click our reload or press ctrl R
as you can see that reloads everything
we click on it see and I just say
probably nothing happened probably due
to the fact that we haven't created that
page yet so let's create that page now
so what this page is just going to say
is this is a pop-up and my Chrome
extension oops and we want to set this
equal are going to assign this linear my
pop-up HTML so now if we click on it
still doesn't work so let's reload it
again let's click on it died and still
doesn't work okay
try changing this from pop-up to default
pop up and then let's reload our
extension again so let's click reload
click on our extension I should say we
have a pop-up now so obviously we want
to specify some things about our pop-up
if you want to make it a bigger
obviously because it's pretty small so
let's go into our my politic HTML page
and that's credit did I want to set the
a style this is equal to width 300
pixels height 200 pixels and let's just
say this is my papa
so let's click this and as you can see I
made our pop-up bigger because not
published around it in Dave so let's
let's actually set it to the size we
want it to be at so I'm what I'm going
to do is I'm actually going to need all
this and I'm going to two things right
and liquid doctype then I'm going to
just create a basic HTML page to a
container pop-up and then I'll just give
it some attributes and in the head we
don't want to title obviously those
we're not mistake it's not a white page
so I'm just going to create a style
block and I'm going to set the type
equal to text slash CSS and we want to
set the body equal to margins on the set
them equal to zero we want to set the
padding of the body also equal to zero
pixels we want to set the font family
equal to arial helvetica sans-serif
we're also set the size to 13 pixels
while here so what that will do down
here is you'll actually but I will just
create some text so let's say is now we
also made our div again so we'll give a
class this time we'll set it equal to a
pop-up container div and in here we'll
come up here we'll just type our we'll
just put it in here dot pop-up container
Dave wood we'll give it a width of maybe
let's say 350 pixels and then now it's
set in max we'll set a minimum height of
maybe let's say 150 pixels i will also
set a maximum height so that it can
expand but we don't want to expand
forever so we'll set the maximum height
able to say 700 pixels and then in here
what I'm just going to say is this is my
popup div so we shouldn't have to
refresh for that and we didn't imagine
see our pop-up now shows up we've set
the styles of it and it should actually
expand as well so I'm just going to test
that I know so I'll just copy and paste
this oops a couple of times
so that should be enough what should
happen is we should get a scrollbar
so I just say when you get a scrollbar
and that shows me maybe our problems too
large so I set the mother up here and
I'll set the maximum height to six on
the car to us at 550 550 pixels is the
maximum height that our pop-up can never
get to I want to do that so let's just
try this again straight 250 see if that
makes a difference
okay so as you can see the marks on
height obviously doesn't do anything
with the extension so that's okay I will
just Carol I we don't need it
because Chrome automatically puts in the
scroll bars regardless of whatever you
tell your extension to be out so we just
have to be careful of that so we can
we'll just have to be careful without
when we're making all right our
extension so just cover all those keep
one of them let's just refresh it as you
can see we got this is my pop of Dave
Bach so that's it for this video don't
