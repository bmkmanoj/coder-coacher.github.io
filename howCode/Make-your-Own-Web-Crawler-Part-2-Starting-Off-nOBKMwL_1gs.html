basic stuff that we need to learn before
we can actually implement a web crawler
and in this part we're going to start
actually implementing the actual code so
if I go to the web browser and I we
don't need this page anymore this is the
actual page that runs the bar to go back
to the tax adder you can see this is
index dot PHP and this is index dot PHP
too so we're not actually gonna be using
the web browser for this series to
actually see our PHP script and to run
it because when we're running our bot
because it runs forever it's not
actually going to stop the execution so
we're never be able to see the I put on
the web browser so we have to run it
through the terminal and by running it
through the terminal will be able to see
VI put as it's actually I put on the
screen and we won't have to wit like we
normally do when we run a PHP script on
the web site so you have to have PHP
installed on your computer for this if
you have ax amp installed you should be
100% fine so you can see what version of
PHP you're running if you just type in
PHP dash B and you can see this is the
version I am running PHP 5.5 so that's
actually quite I did a version of PHP
but it's actually fine for this series
so I've tested it in PHP 5.5 but I've
also tested it in the new PHP 7 and it
works completely fine in both versions
so this shouldn't cause any problems
whatsoever so the first thing we need to
do after we have the URL we're going to
crawl is we need to create a function
that will actually do the crawling for
us so we create a function called follow
lengths and then down here I'm just
going to run the function follow links
and the function is gonna take one
parameter and it's going to be start
which is going to be in the URL we want
to start the crawl on I will actually
change this to URL so the first thing we
need to do is we need to go to this URL
and we need to get all of the links on
that page PHP has a built-in class
called Dom document which allows you to
parse HTML pages so we're gonna say a
dark is equal to a new instance of the
Dom document class and then we're going
to use is the built-in method in the Dom
document class called load HTML so we're
just going to say
Dark Lord he HTML I didn't here what we
do is we pass it some HTML so we could
just literally type in our HTML like
this but what we're gonna do is we're
gonna get the haste amount from this
website here so we're going to use page
space file get contents function now
we're going to pass it the URL so what
I'm gonna do is we gonna go back to the
terminal and I'm gonna type in PHP and
next up PHP to run it and I'm gonna head
out ER you see we got no eye pop but we
get no errors so so far so good the next
thing we need to do now that we've
loaded the HTML is we need it log for
the links so we're going to create
another variable call it linked list
which is going to contain all of the
links on the page and we're going to set
that equal to dark get elements by tag
name because each one of these links is
created using an air tag so we're going
to log for those tags on the page so we
just said tag name and the next thing we
need to do is loop through all of the
links that we find we're gonna save for
each linked list as link which just
means for every link in the list we're
going to refer to it as link then what
we're going to do is we're going to
actually retrieve the link so if I go
back to the web page you can see that we
have the tag here that is a then we have
this that says href this is called an
attribute and we need to get the value
of that attribute and that's what we're
going to get the links so we do that by
saying link get attribute now we're
gonna say hitch ref what we're gonna do
pretty much is just equal that out we're
gonna put on a new line at the end I
will see what we get back so if we run
this you can see we get exactly the
links that we find on the page and if I
go back to the page these are exactly
what we're in the hitch rafts so what
we've done is we've gone to the link
which is the starting point then we've
got the contents of the html5 download
the content of this file to the computer
and we've pulled out the all the values
that are contained within
the Acacia have attributes of the links
on the page so that's it for this part
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
