doing is we're going to be getting more
done on our interpreter so in the last
video we left off we we were able to
work out what a print was and what a
string was so now what we're going to do
is we're going to create a tokens list
so what's her tokens and we're going to
create an empty list so when we find a
string what we're going to do is we're
going to we're going to set tokens dot
append then we're going to say string :
now we're just going to append on the
value of the string so in our case we're
just going to use a string variable then
up here we're just going to change from
find a print to tokens dot append so now
if we just come down here underneath the
loop and we'll just print out tokens we
could enter as you can see it says print
and that is a string hello world but as
you'll see it
we're messing we have a problem we're
missing the space and the hello world so
what we need to do is we need to say if
when we are when we're ignoring spaces
we only want to do it when the state is
equal to zero because that's when we're
looking for keywords to want to say if
state whoops equals zero and tok goes
nothing else to equals space so let's
just run this again okay we still got
that problem okay we still got that
problem ma'am
okay so what we need to do is just as it
turns out to tok and if we refresh or
not refresh from doing websites you can
see now we have the space but we only
have one semi core one double quote
dermal messing it double quote at the
end it's what we need to do is just pull
simply append a double quote onto the
end of that so as you can see there we
have a print and then we have our string
which is we have our two tokens
if I come underneath and I said print
something else hit under okay so I think
to fix this problem were only seeing
things on this line we need to ignore
new lines as well so what we're going to
do is we're just going to come in here
I'm going to say I left tok equals a new
line we're going to say total equals
nothing then what we have to do also is
just come down here and said to equals
nothing and let's try that so as you can
see now it says print string hello world
print string hitch so that seems to work
so now we've done that we can let's just
comment that on it because if we can use
that because it's good for debugging we
can say return tokens so now what we can
do is we can say a parse I mean use our
parse function we'll say let's say
tokens let's just say take our and
isotopes equals that so we'll say tok
somewhere past tokens to the parse
functions we'll say I define parse and
we're going to give it talks and I will
say just hit print tok just to make sure
that it works so you can see we get the
same result so that means it's worked
which pass them to the parse function so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to say I will call die and it's
going to be our iterator or our a sort
of instruction count what we're going to
say is a while I is less than a token
that's a toke stop like I think it's
talked about the size actually then
we're going to say I plus plus an amber
will do it also is just we can see
what's going on we'll say print I okay
you can't use I plus plus and Python you
said I plus
equals i all right plus equals one I
mean so let's try this
okay there's notes outside it must be
length okay that's not right either so
let's just try the normal land function
in Python so let's try that and hit
enter so you can see it says three well
that's four numbers that means our
iterator went four times and if we check
we have four items in our tokens array
or tokens list so what we're going to
say is if a tip talks I plus toks
all right let's say plus space just to
make it easier to read plus tokes
i plus 1 equals print screen' then we're
going to say print find string then
we're going to say will actually go take
that out of there and we'll just say I
plus equals 2 because what we're doing
is we're incrementing I by 2 because we
have two different items in our list so
we'll just we should get fine string
printed out place so let's try it up
okay we have a problem let's just try
this I plus equals 1 I plus equals 1 the
reason this didn't work well just get
rid of all this rubbish the reason it
didn't work is because if we remember we
also assigned the variable of this or
the value of the string to the string
token so if I print this you will see as
you can see it says print string which
is correct then it has the string a
painted on the end of it that's what we
want to do is we want to say
I just want to do is we want to get the
beginning of the string so we just want
to say 0 6 so we got the first six
characters of the string token then what
I'll just say is I plus equals 2 and
this should work suppose you can see it
says fine string fine string now we want
to do is we want to print out the string
itself so our print stalks I plus 1 and
then we'll just say 6 this colon just
means sort of a means start from the 6th
character and just go on till you end of
the string so we're not giving it a man
a until we said 6 10 it would go from
the sector character of the 10th
character with which was 4 we just want
to go to the end so we'll just go to the
codon so if we hit enter as you can see
it says hello world and it says here so
we actually want to add one on because
we have the same eco and we have the
other column to get rid of so there we
go
we have a print hello world and print
each so if I do print my name is Francis
and hit enter as you can see it says my
name is Francis so that's it for this

forget to follow us on Google+ and I
hope you enjoyed this series don't
forget to let me know in the comments
below if there's anything in particular
you want us to add to the interpreter so
just let me know thanks for watching
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
