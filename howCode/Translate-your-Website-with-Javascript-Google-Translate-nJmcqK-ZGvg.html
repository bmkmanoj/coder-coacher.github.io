what I'm going to be doing is gonna be
showing you how to put the Google
transit widget onto your website and
actually how to hide it so that it
doesn't look like you're using Google
Translate to transit your web page so
what I mean by this is this is exactly
what I did on haiku org so as you can
see here I'm on my website and if I go
down here and click change language we
box pops up and if I put in if I click
only non Spanish it takes me to a
different subdomain that says es dejado
org and I can see everything
automatically translated to Spanish and
it works with any one of these five
languages
I can put more on as well it's just
eight works with any language that
Google Translate supports so it just
took a while but it doesn't usually so
here it is it's a translated to Italian
it says appear as well and if I click X
here it stays translated so the way this
works is it uses the Google Translate
widget but it's actually hidden on my
website so that it it just makes
everything look better and the way it
automatically sets it is it sets a
cookie that gets automatically set using
javascript and jquery and like jquery
plugin and based on the subdomain in the
address bar so what we're going to be
doing is well obviously that so let's
get started so the first thing you want
to do is you want to come over this
website called transit Google comments
manage your slash website sashad and you
want to add your website obviously so I
just put my website in I actually put
this one in just because I put the city
under high water again because that way
it's a different website to the one
that's originally on because originally
I have 500 gone so I want to put a
different one in so that I can do it so
you put whatever you want here it
doesn't actually matter and just click
get code and here is our two pieces of
code we need so what we want to do is we
want to do exactly what it says and copy
and paste is usable snippet of code and
on our web page so that one goes up
there this one goes
down here and this is where the Google
Transit weather gets displayed so let's
go over here let's say fresh and as you
can see the Google Translate widget
showed up and we have all of our
available languages so what I'm going to
do is I'm just going to put in some tags
and say this is a test website and what
I'm going to do is I'll refresh and I
will make sure it's working so I'll just
put in French for example and as you can
see it transited the website so
obviously we got this blue bar at the
top of spoke Chinese for example as you
can see we got this blue bar that we
didn't get on my website so also I'll be
showing you how to get rid of that so
what we want to do after this is to make
the translation automatic so to do that
what you want to do is you want to go
over to let's actually just go back to
the English version so at neither we're
back on highway or gonna take a view
page source and as you can see we have
these two lines of code one is for
jQuery and one is for the plugin so
obviously since I didn't make this vlog
in this jquery.js plug-in oops there I
didn't make this plug-in I obviously
can't redistribute it and give it out in
the source code so what I've done
instead is I've uploaded it to well how
good has two servers ones for storing
downloads and files and things and the
other one is for actually hosting this
website and on the other website it's
actually hosted at this address
it's cool to see and the haiku org this
is the address of the second server what
I'm going to out of done is I've
uploaded those two Jack those two
JavaScript files to this so that you can
use them you can yeah I just like go to
and host them off of my website so you
could instead of hosting them off let's
go to it here I can see this one's
coming from Google so you can host it
off of ha gold instead of your website
so that we're after
I can't since I can redistribute to
people to you guys in the self I can on
posted on my website and like you use it
free because and well I can't really
stop you I thought it was a good idea
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
go to the CDN website and I'm going to
go to this address so this is the
address where the the plug-in is stored
on hi code on the Huggle server and what
am I going to do is just copy all of
this so what I'm going to do is I'll
just paste this in whoops line it up and
what we want to obviously do is you want
to get the cookie file or the air cookie
plug-in from the hi code server so
instead of putting in Sarge include
chest jQuery cookie dough Jas we're
gonna paste in this year which is zero
that are toasted on on the high court
server I'm also going to go up here and
I'll put in jQuery dark moon Jas which
is the second file it's actually hosted
on Google so you don't actually need to
use the one I've put up but I'll just
put it up as well just am so the number
of coming from the same place so now
that we've done that we can use we can
make use of the jackaroo UJS library I
mean a plugin on in the jQuery library
so what we're going to do now me to go
back to the high code source code
and we're going to scroll down and we
see here we have this line of code so
what I'm gonna do is we'll put it up put
it in here
and I'll actually just put in the body
sauce it I need to open in your
JavaScript block so when you script
block and I need to say the type equals
text slash JavaScript and obviously we
need to leave the source blank since
we're not giving it any file we're just
including code so what I'm going to do
is paste this in here and this is what
sets the gook trans cookie which is how
Google draw the Google Translate widget
works so if I go to translator as you if
I click on a language here what it does
is it actually sets a cookie called goog
Tron's and it sets it equal to the value
of what I willing to settle vise at
French we set the value of the cookie to
en /fr and which is a for example that's
what I do on the French version of the
haiku website so what I'm going to do is
I've set it to Spanish maybe I don't
know anything that's not English on
will refresh the page as you can see
what automatically happened was the
cookie got set using JavaScript on the
plug-in library and it's translated into
Spanish the only other things we need to
do is hide the a TM hide for example
this blue bar on this and Google
Translate widget which is actually
really easy the Google Translate widget
is really easy to hide you just add the
style attribute to the Google Translate
element and you say display:none
and this just hides this widget so let's
refresh the widgets gone and obviously
it's gone but this blue bar still
appears and that's slightly more
complicated to hide but it's still
really easy just come back up to the
high code source code and find it it is
literally just CSS code here it is and I
just copy that and I go back up here
paste it in and there it is so just do
exactly as I did and also I'll put all
this source code in the description I
mean in I'll put up for download and
they'll be linked to it in the
description so now if i refresh the page
everything chain
to Spanish and there's no evidence that
there was that it was done using Google
Translate the only other thing I did on
the awkward web site was I used PHP to
get this part of the yard whoops
to get the this part of the URL the
first two characters of the URL and then
I sat the first two car I faced the
first two characters of the URL in a
variable and I put the variable in here
that's the only other thing I did so as
you can see if I put in that's a type T
for Italian and I hit refresh as you can
see it changed again this is now in
Italian using the Google Translate
widget on the hour and jQuery and jQuery
puppy plugin so that's it for this video
