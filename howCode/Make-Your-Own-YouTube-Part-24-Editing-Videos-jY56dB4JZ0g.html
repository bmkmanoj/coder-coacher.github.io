we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be
actually allowing users to edit the
videos they upload because at the moment
as it stands you're only able to upload
the video once and if you see whatever
you set the title as a mime the
description and everything like that and
when you upload the video is what it
stares out forever
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
fix that in this video and we're gonna
allow people to be able to edit their
uploads because I'm not only do people
want to be able to add at things like
the M they can set them as private or
public they also want to be able to fix
things like typing mistakes or whatever
if they made a mistake when they were
uploading it so that's we're gonna be
doing today so let's get started so as
you can see here I've created a new page
called edit underscore video dot PHP and
if you go into my directory it should be
here now there it is elevated of PHP and
as you can see it says it's 0 bikes
because it actually is just a blank file
and that's what we're gonna be working
on in this video so the first thing we
need to do is we need to actually get
sort of some tablet things from other
files so what I'm gonna do for that I'm
just gonna go down to the washed-up PHP
page I'm just gonna drag it into my text
editor so here it is here in my text
editor and as you can see we have the
include line for the header file so
that's what I'm gonna put in nice I'm
just going to paste it not include
function for the header file and if we
come over to our edit video page 9 we
have a blank page but we have our header
file that we added in so let's go back
into our file and to see if copying
everything over and over I mean writing
everything over and over again I'm just
gonna copy some things over so for
example the video ID we're gonna use to
uniquely know which video we want to add
it and then what we're gonna do is we
can actually copy even more code from
here so we're gonna copy this code here
from the watch page because what the
code from the watch page does is it
selects the it selects all the videos
from the videos table where the video ID
matches the video ID from the video ID
we are variable which is passed in the
URL whoops
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to since we've copied all this I'm
actually open another file called upload
dot PHP so if we just find that yeah
there it is upload up PHP and we drag it
in and we can see I here's our upload
file our RM upload page and what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna copy the upload
form and I'm gonna paste it on the add
video page so this page is sort of just
a combination between the I watched a
PHP page on the upload dot PHP page and
well there's a few differences but it's
quite similar so if we come over to our
added up our added video dot PHP page
and we refresh we get a syntax error so
let's have a look okay we're just
missing a party bracket so if we refresh
now I we won't work probably yeah we get
undefined index video ID that's because
we didn't supply an argument I'm just
going to get the video ID out of the
database so my open videos and go over
to video ID copy it whoops some of that
copy that on pasting here and there the
error goes away so what we obviously
don't need is the upload the upload
input so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna get rid of that nice so I'm gonna
get rid of the file the other things
we're going to what we're gonna do is
that we're gonna take values from the
database so I don't know just whoops I'm
gonna click value up here and inside the
value inside like the value for the key
value value I know it doesn't make much
sense but inside here where we normally
put the value of the
fail I'm just going to echo and the
video underscore title and I what we'll
get is the video title and filling up
the text box and obviously the upload
files gone away so now what we want to
do is we want a copy this what we want
to do is come down into the text area
and paste it in here and change this to
video underscore description then we
want to come in here again and then
video keywords we want to change this to
M video underscore keywords um and we
want to get the privacy value from the
database but for now we'll just leave it
like this because that's a wee bit
slightly a little bit more complicated
than the other two but here we have a
video or a test video as a title night
and then video description is being
filled in as well but here we have a
problem so what we're gonna do is we're
just gonna come in here and check what's
going on and a pot okay we just need to
close that off
oops and so now if we come back into our
app a jinan we refresh that should have
sorted itself out okay now we're gonna
do the privacy options so we're gonna
fill in whatever one of these is enabled
in the actual video so in the video it
says the privacy is set to public so
that means what we want by default is
the public and radio button to be filled
in like this so that's not actually that
hard to do it's quite quite simple
actually to sort out so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna come up here and what
we're gonna say is if the variable
privacy and as with every variable just
whenever I use the variable privacy just
think of it like as since I showed you
the video is Providian privacy is
actually set to public so anytime I use
the word the variable privacy
just like in in to yourself think of it
using public so what I'm really saying
is so what I'm really saying is if
public so in this case if privacy is
equal to public so if it's public to
equals then we want to do is want to set
the radio button with we want the radio
button with the value of public to be
set as filled in so what we're gonna do
is we're actually going to give each of
these radio buttons but we're just going
to actually write check ting in here I
just see now if I put in checked equals
true the public radio button will
actually you know be FL okay maybe not
okay so the problem was I just about
checker on so if I change this from
check to check and I go back to our page
and refresh the radio button is now
checked in so what we want to do is we
just want to set checked equal to our
variable which we're going to set now
we're going to set this equal to C and
we're just going to put that in there
and then what we're gonna do is we're
just gonna copy all of this we're going
to go over to the other radio button
we're gonna set checked equal to c2 so
we're just going to do sort of the same
thing we did in the last video but the
like and dislike buttons mmm so what we
want to say is see if privacy equals
public we want to say C equals true and
c2 equals false and then what we want to
just do is a copy this love a copy this
part of it and then just say else
and what we want to just use the
opposite so we'll just set naught equal
to false and c2 equal to true so now if
we I hit enter what we should get is
okay we have a problem we have so what
I'm going to do is I'm actually just
going to change this to checked and
leave this one blank and then change
this one to blank and then change this
one to checked because that you can
actually just use the word checked
instead of whoops
instead of saying checked equals and
that might work better um so let's just
go over here and do the same thing again
so let's say I've come over to our web
browser and refresh and as you can see
my public is a filled in so now if I go
over to our our table again and I change
this to private and I refresh what will
happen is a private dialog changed so
I'll just leave it to private for an eye
and what we're gonna do now is we're
just gonna actually take the information
and we're gonna be a live user to post
it so what we're gonna say is an if is
set host let's say submit because there
that's the submit button well that's the
name of it then what we're just gonna
say is if
we're just going to actually get the
data from the fiends so we're going to
say is very very underscore title equals
hos video to underscore title we're
gonna do the same for description just
just shorten it with the SC and then
video description on line keywords
obviously this is check is it key okay
its video underscore keywords I'm
finally I'm the underscore privacy which
is going to be the privacy of the video
as is just privacy okay so now that
we've got the data from the from the
forum we wanted is we want to check it
so we're just gonna say is if the
underscore title or the underscore DSC
or the underscore keywords equals equals
nothing so it means if the fins are
blank so if any of the taxpayers are
left blank then we're just gonna give an
error
aren't you in a diet just to kill the
forum so are to kill the scripts we're
just gonna say I'm chomp and
it's blank and then what we're gonna say
is else and then we're just gonna do
simply my SQL query to update the
database so we're just gonna say update
videos set video under Chimel title
equal to V underscore title comma video
underscore description equal to whoops
V underscore DSC and then another column
and video underscore keywords equal to
the e underscore keywords and then we
just need to finally so on down we also
need privacy so LM finally pro sequel to
privacy equal to have V underscore
privacy and then finally we just need to
finish this off with them a final part
of the query that just says we're video
underscore ID equal I mean video ID
equals then you D let's just check okay
that looks oh we actually need to put
another school here so that should be
okay and then what we're going to do is
we're just going to die success um we're
just gonna change this to edit video
so let's try that now let's run our code
and see what happens so let's hit enter
and refresh I don't get everything shows
up properly we got no errors so I'm just
going to change this to edit 8 with you
I'm gonna click Edit video and what's
going to over that didn't work what did
is it ok the reason it didn't work is
because we actually have the form
submitting to the wrong page so it's
actually added on the store video dot
PHP video ID equals echo video ID it's
not should be it let's try it again
let's go back now let's try this again
so edited video and let's head out a
video well you can't leave any fields
blog so we have a problem
ok we're that's just check the names of
the themes that looks fine and so ok an
easy fix might be just to change this to
let's just cut this and oops let's just
say copy-paste and let's change it to
DSC we also actually need to say it was
nothing or just change this to you can't
leave the title field blank and this to
the description
famed blank so let's just see what
happens
um let's try it again that's just it
video okay we got success that time
stuff is good but we didn't actually
change anything so we don't reckon you
ever worked so I'm just going to change
this to edit a video enter just to
submit the form we get success we go
back and load the page and it says
edited video is a showing up so and we
also need to actually just do this for
keywords so we underscore keywords
becoming the keywords field blank so
let's try changing some other things so
edited video this is an edited
description so we're just gonna try to
edit the keyword so I say I whoops
on it save it so a test one looks on
that test too let's just change it to
public had a video and everything saves
and went through I know if we go back to
our watch page what we'll see is whoops
what we'll see is the actual edited
video so now it's has added a video and
it says the description this is an added
a description and video tags this is our
new video tags are different so that's
it for this video don't forget to Like
