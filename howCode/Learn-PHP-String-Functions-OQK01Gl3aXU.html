learning about is string functions in
PHP so what string functions are are
they're they are helpful functions built
into PHP that help us to work with
strings so the first one we're going to
look at is called STR land and what it
does is it gives us the length of a
string
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a variable called my string and
I'm going to set that equal to string
hello world then I'm just going to actor
without whoops I go my string first of
all
I'm gonna go to the browser and refresh
and as you can see we get the string
hello world aqueduct to us so now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to use the
Astroland function to find the length of
the string
so to do that what I'm going to do is
I'm going to say STR land
and I just put the only parameter I have
to give it is the string I want to find
the length of so now if I go to the
browser and i refresh the page as you
can see it tells us there's 11
characters in that string
the next function we want to look at is
called STR paws on weight what it does
is it tells us why they're a substring
is present in a string so what a
substring is it's a piece of a string so
in the string hello world a substring
would be the word world
or it could be any ladder so it could be
this letter R would be some string over
the string hello world so if we were
looking for the substring oh what it
would do is we're turning a number four
because it would say this is the 0th
index this is the first index this is
the second this is a third and this is
the fourth and this is the first
occurrence of it in the strings we would
ignore the other Oh
so STR pose is a good way of determining
whether a substring is present in a
string because if it's not it returns
false
so I'm just going to try this function
right now so I'll say STR pose and my so
the string I want to give it is my
string and what I want to look for is
the letter O
and as you can see it returned for
if I give it a string that didn't exist
so say I was looking for the word
Frances and I didn't see that's not in
this string it'll just return false what
I won't actually Akko anything all right
but it would return false and if I was
looking for the word world
it would return six because that's the
position of the of the word world in the
string that's the first occurrence of it
so we could use STR pose to find whether
a string is present in a have a
substring is present in a string simply
by doing this we could say if
Str pose my string we need to give it
the string luck for and then we are they
string that we want to search in and we
want to give it the string that we want
to find so we'll send a word hello and
now we're going to use the identity
operator which is three equals and we're
going to say a false so if it equals
false which means if it's not fine then
echo couldn't I just couldn't find it
else we're gonna have to find it
so I can see it says find it because the
word hello does a car in the string here
so if I give it the word Frances
it's going to say I couldn't find it so
as you can see there I couldn't find the
word Frances because that's not present
in this string so that's been a quick
tutorial on PHP string functions so
thanks for watching don't forget to Like

see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
