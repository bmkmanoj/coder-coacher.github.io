so sorry haven't made one in ages but
yeah it's really awkward to make them
all on the Mac because I always do the
voiceover sab early but this time it's
live so this just makes the actual
making the video is quicker so I can
make them more often just make more of
them so as you can see here we have this
error um so let's just fix it so this is
because of this time here and the error
goes away if we log in as you can see so
the arms go on top so that's just shows
that just makes it easy to figure out
what the error is so you just need to
make an X thing it says if if is sat
session use your login then the variable
user is going to equal Saturn login or
else we're just going to that user is
just going to equal these are just
opposed nothing
so how the error is gone
oops the logins the works yep okay so
that's the first problem
second one is it was pointed out to me
by subscriber because I didn't realize
as you can see they're just weird bar
and this pushes everything off to the
side so we're just going to fix stop
though this is another pretty easy thing
to fix so we change we get rid of that
well we don't have to get rid of that
boat Jennifer want we get rid of border
left and right we get rid of overflow
autumn oops so um that's it really
refresh it's all fixed the only problem
is this I'd be interested to know if
this happens for everybody or is it just
because I've got a small screen so just
check yep okay so it's I'm not sure
because it wasn't happen on when I had
the Mac but maybe I changed something
but I forgot to make a video about it so
I'm just going to fix that as well so
say 60 column on 4 rows let's just see
yep that's Vic that's fixed it okay um
another thing we have to fix is the
registration because it was pointed out
to me that I forgot to check whether the
email had already been registered in the
database and if they are registered
twice and when I get login so let's fix
that I already told the subscriber who
pointed out but I'll just I taught I
told them I make a video about it to
show everybody so now we're going to
create our called each act goes - clog
query snacked and email
we're demon equals DM on the variable e
M is the email field first email field
so this will just put a comment in here
as well
check
why other email okay so that's the first
part on a non we just need to count the
number content um of roser time so put a
little variable in it check
she was - num rows a check which is the
variable we just created up here which
is the query then underneath our
password check just cannot if Stevens Co
hold a mail check as you can see this is
pretty similar to the password check we
did so you may I mean you probably could
have worked it out yourself so
underneath here we're just going to
write else
I need to put whatever you wanna say I'm
sorry cause already use up you know flea
we get any errors we did 87 that
probably will fix it but yeah well gas
that was fine so now if we try to sign
up using a username that doesn't exist
the UK and just show you as you can see
I'm actually pretty quick
I'm way quicker typing on a laptop
keyboard than my car because the I don't
think the numbers of the keys are
smaller they're closer together makes it
easier to type so um in the users table
this would load it's pretty old on top
alright now you can see we have two
emails that exist some email and some in
warm so if I type in some email some
email again and then I type in something
for the password hopefully it should
registers cats wrong let's just move
this here piece this year they're
neither should not if we refresh this
you'd say sorry I've look like so I'll
use that email we type in two so we
change the email this time within the
user name field we change it to
SiC googled oh no a user militant never
click signup we should get yep okay this
is working I think so if we're making if
we just type in good for the user here
and then just give them the game to the
password
yeah let's should register this so those
are that's a few problems fixed
whoops and don't worry I do listen to
what you guys think and what you ask and
I will be adding comments and things to
the post forms of those I got because
I've been asked to my ass my people so I
will but first see let's create a new
file and we're going to before we do
that we're just gonna cheat we're going
to do something a bit different for a
bit and next couple of tutorials maybe
we're going to you I add some accounts
and so so called icon settings dot PHP
and we include our header files things
like this come to think of it I don't
like such a stupid nyan our director for
a file because it's so that's so
commonly used I don't know why I put it
in so many directories well it's a bit
lien I so let's just create a h2 block
let's just say edit your settings below
and if we go to this page now there we
go but I should see I'm not logged in
because of the menu and we don't want
people who are I don't have who don't
have a consort logged
editor setting soon since we included
the header file we can use this variable
user so we can say if you use your which
means if session username exists so if
they're logged in we can just do nothing
and then if they're not logged in will
either act with something or just kill
the page we same guy and then we can
just say you must the two there so
license we're not logged in we should
get that error yep
wait first I need to make those links
actually so back into the header file
down and first I'm just going to make
crunch settings link to the account
settings page I'm going to make that
whole site ah
not only that I'm not unique Knox yep
making both a go to the PhD or action
second thought sorry bus you just put a
slash in so instead of just it let's
just go to the right directory which is
fine friends so if we fresh oops
react I'm not on server so actually I'll
just put this back you do that you put
the slash in if you're on the route and
back to your app so as you can see look
and most would be my website was a
website and see I bought a directory
called tutorials and then I get another
one called fine frames so it won't work
for me
but it will work for you if you're on
the root directory of your wife
so what Oh page so if I cite if I log in
with my account
that's it logged in I'll go to settings
ok so now we can see it see our con
settings okay so let's make some
settings basically alright so the first
one we're going to make is we could say
or change your password alright we don't
need these actually I'm too lazy to
style them so just put it in some pack
of tags oops
same result as you can see but it's
moves down a bit so for here we can
actually just put a hitch our tag might
be style it yep okay so I'll just make
styles I can copy the style from another
HR or from some other CSS we used for HR
tags these tutorials so you reckon is
this
if you sit on and we just remove that so
it targets all the HR tags fresh that
were you that looks a bit better what
you're not mind those are working theory
I'm so just making this tutorial up I
normally climb them but um with maybe in
busy I already at time and I just wanted
to make one well I was good I'm gonna
actually make a few nine but so what are
screwed anything hot phase type tax name
the close old password and ID so equals
old password so we could here just put
here your old password
actually I'm school break tag here give
it time
oops sorry
jeans the length 230 that's not length
sorry
sighs my almost regal story so you can
probably tell this isn't planned out
this tutorial because it normally wrote
well I like to think it normally works a
lot smoother yes can I say your new
password let's change that to the new
okay so be this line a new password too
so we can say repeat password just to
make a man out to that I mean like if
you were if you're doing this yourself
you can make out look better if you want
so it's not exactly very good doesn't
look very good but it's gonna work so um
let's move on I'm going to make another
one this video is just going to be
mostly adding the failed form then the
account settings page the next video or
next couple of videos will be actually
making it work so you can say update
your up to your profile info and we can
create another but this time yes we'll
attacks the near movie f knee firstly I
hide a will also be F knee sighs I think
third is not gonna do 50
that's too big actually
Oh God so let's change it to 40
I used to mean I used to care about how
long these are but I don't really mind
care if it's a 40 minute tutorial good
because afford exam a 40 minute tutorial
doesn't it only takes me about 40
minutes to make ours before our Savin
rate and it's a toy would take me a
couple of hours to make so I don't mind
making longer tutorials on the more
frequent making them more often so we
can just write first me these fields are
going to have value or just for the
minute we're just going to write first
name but oops let me get onto it we will
change that to have to automatically
fill in with your first name so whatever
the user first name was
I'll just change out to last
um right so for the minute I'm not going
to put in I change user name field but
and depends whether you actually want
one so just look right leave in the
comments or leave me a message or
whatever saying whether you want me to
make a change username option you mail
mean you should be older to yourselves
but as always if you want if you want to
see it then I'll make one so what else
is there
okay that'll do for now we can almost
put more in oh wait actually there is
more left
I actually want to put in this one's a
little bit different so it's 5io for
biography so oh relaxing goodbye to you
some a text area
it's name is going to be bite you call
let's say seven rows let's a.m. but save
sixty it's not maybe I was a little bit
yeah not maybe should Rose yeah so there
we go that's a bit too big still catch
it okay so as you can see I'm probably
eating partly to I'm getting bit lazier
as we go further through the tutorials
but whatever we can all stand it
yourself so I just
my goal is mean is to make a social
network and teach you how to do it but
the medium is actually just to teach you
how to do it so that you can make it
yourself so and what do you think of
these new type of scores because I'm
actually I think I'm getting better on
it I mean I get easier to make them one
make lemon I don't know when you get
subscribers in the music even if you
want to get one this is Ike I'm quite
small I've only got 40 subscribers but I
mean a month ago I had button home so
that's pretty good for me oh I almost
forgot like the most important part
click another HR on finite form adamant
submit button send via ID like oh send
data this volume is you willing to be
send not like it oh and updating for me
so we have most of the fitness that's
gonna fail to a minute okay so we can
start with the change password and I
almost forgot
put this in a form so it's of self
submitting forms what's going to this
page itself the method is obviously
going to be both we and the formed on
you and then I noticed in the last two
tours I didn't really explain almost
most of the part so there it goes it's
submitted so I didn't really explain
almost how these form how it all works
so it's what I'm going to be doing so
I'm going to spend more time doing that
in these videos so actually I'm just
going to create a new PHP block oops on
just so you know if you ever run into
problems using my code and as you can
see I use these I just use it for my PHP
tags I use the shortened version last
and sign on the question mark if you
ever run into problems with
compatibility it's so it's not working
for you you can always just try putting
in the PHP bit because it's more
compatible as to better to do
oops I prefer to do the short way
because it works for me so we're going
to create a variable called send data
it's going to equal if are not equal
post and you know which is our button so
now we can just say if so if the button
if the form is submitted like then we
yeah say I leave a comment of the form
else so we can just we usually believe
this blind but just to make sure that
our form is actually sand it there to
make sure our sandhya variable works we
can just say please set sub some data so
now since we have one our fractions we
haven't submitted the form we should get
a message saying oops saying submit
please sit
okay so we get time to find index Ian
agency and is working so let me just fix
them okay so I just thought actually
instead of what we can just say copy dot
put in there well you will still get
this right if you have to good place to
end this tutorial so once for watching
don't forget to comment rate like and
subscribe and also I never mentioned but
since unloaded people on YouTube now I
have the ability to make stores on the
channels I'm actually gonna make one and
I'm gonna put things on it by I don't
mean code Africa out all the code will
always be free I just mean like t-shirts
or pans or whatever
and they're not just gonna have like an
ass on it first anyway they're gonna I
don't know they're just going to be fun
they're gonna have like funny slogan
phrases or whatever so non-store come
when the store actually comes out you've
got like a bit of money lying around
it'd be really good great if you could
um get a t-shirt ever like I don't mind
if you but whatever so thanks for
watching difficut comment subscribe like
it already sad and I see in the next
