questions answered series so at what
this series is it's not really me
teaching programming or anything it
shows me answering questions that people
have with problems they have when
they're making the when they're making
their websites are following my
tutorials so without any further ado
let's get started so that so this first
question says hey please I need your
help i have x ubuntu on my computer that
HD access is not working thank you so
unfortunately I can't really comment on
ubuntu because i don't use it but at
what I can't say for my experiences with
Mac and I don't know if it's the same
because I know they're both unix-based
is a unmarked by default dot H the ACT
there are files with a dot in front of
them don't show up so I'd you need to
that's justice adding you need to change
so i would just google it and then it's
probably just something example you can
type in the terminal and then it should
probably fix it if that's what's causing
the problem so next question so this one
says all of your videos are perfect
thank you but i think there's a short
problem the registration and login
process is very simple no email
activation after registration what about
cookies is there any possible to see you
fixing this thanks well it's I did that
intentionally because it's kind of an i
don't know i don't i don't like signing
up to websites where you have to
activate your email so i didn't really
want to do with mine but if you want to
see a tutorial or not after the series
is over I will probably do extra
tutorials i got so that people who are
following the series and don't want
those extra features can move on to
something else at the same time so yeah
I probably will do that sort of thing
eventually but
um you know I probably do it off to the
series and so in the next question this
one says hey you have good tutorials and
I have some questions hope you can or
hope you apply thanks unfortunately I
don't have time to chase after everyone
to try and find out what the questions
are but if you have a question you want
to ask you to send me a message but um
I'm sorry but I don't want to chase
after people to find out what the
questions are so I just if you have a
problem is to ask me the actual question
and i'll give you an answer so the next
one is this one says okay seriously I
need our I need help whenever I try to
go on to local o / PHP myadmin it never
let me go in it says cannot open web
page blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
so uh this person actually SAT me like
two men or three messages and on the
third one it looks like they might have
fixed it but I don't know so I'm just
going to answer it anywhere and I think
the problem is in one of the master news
he mentioned or he mentioned that he had
a load of code showing up on his page I
load of PHP code and I wasn't actually
yeah processing properly what I believe
that is because of that because of all
the other problems so actually i'm going
to start from the a very beginning
problem first so the first problem okay
so the first problem I think you're
having is because of something called
xampp well it says it's not responding
but it doesn't matter so um what acts up
is is basically the thing the program
that allows me to write PHP code on my
computer similarly to if you if you
watch the Python series you know you
have to download and install Python
because computers just don't
automatically recognize PHP I'm
iphone and things so you have to be
installed on the package I chose to
install PHP is called xampp and the
reason we chose that is because X arm
doesn't just have PHP it has mysql and
apache as you can see and i think your
problem was even if you installed xampp
it's not that maybe it's not that you
didn't install xampp maybe it's because
you didn't start the party and the mysql
modules because as you can see mine say
running beside them in green so by
default this has start as you can see
down here but if you wanted to actually
start them all you have to do is click
start and then it takes a few seconds
and then it actually starts them and we
like MySQL obviously you can't use MySQL
and without Apache you can't use
localhost and there the next thing I
think your problem was is when you said
all your code was being a displayed not
actually run this could be because of
the same problem with the xampp not
being installed maybe or it could be
because of this as you can see it's this
file saved on my desktop and on the
htdocs folder in the axon directory
which is where all of your PHP code has
to be stored for taxi be wrong because
if I just right click PHP script we all
have to say is echo whoops hello in
world as you can see this is just a
normal PHP script but but it's a saved
on my desktop so since it's not in the
AG subdirectory I won't actually run and
as you can see it just gets the split as
text it doesn't actually get wrong so
that's why you need to put in the acts
I'm directory the other reason I think
are not really reason but
way you can fix this is if you don't
have X on when you don't know where to
get it just Google X on or go to the
website Apache or just go to this
website and then as you can see it has
all the stuff you need so when you get
to this website all you have to do is
choose your installation method I just
choose math today with the Installer it
thought of the installing just run it
and should be you fixed and sorted and
so it's probably time for the next
question so this question you says
please upload all the SQL files I only
have post start SQL and users don't ask
you out and files are missing so this is
in part 38 of the social network series
so I know if one of them I made a
mistake and I messed up the source code
so if this is a think I have a feeling
that this person might be wrong but just
in case they're not I just go to the
part 39 or whatever and Donald it the
source code and you don't have to use
the source code all you might need to do
is just insert the SQL files because
they should all be there because this
this is at the last question level of
time for today and it says in part
through well it says where did you get
the search underscore white top PNG
image and this is for the search suit
are the sign at the social network parts
that are part 3 video and you learn how
to speak so I have no idea it was months
ago that I made those videos so I've no
idea and I'm sorry I can't help you now
with that but if you just search google
for a question mark icon and you just
use something like photoshop or gimp it
said like a free alternative to
photoshop you should be able just to
make em any icon whatever color you want
so if you just get a blocks magnifying
glass just delete the background and
then just change it so that it's white
if that's what you want so that's it for
this video don't forget to
like favorite and subscribe and I'll see
you next time and also don't forget to
keep sending in your questions and if i
don't answer them by masoj I'll Daphne
ounce or I will try to answer them in
this series thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
