we're going to be doing is we're going
to be finishing off to my videos page on
our website and we're also going to be
and starting to display videos on the
channel pages if we have time so well
it's all beer that's all I have to say
the beginning so let's get started so
here I am on my videos page so what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to go over
to the actual my videos page in the web
browser and as you can see this is where
we left off the last video and what
we're going to do is we want to put some
links underneath here that said things
like I added video and add thumbnail and
delete video and things like that so
let's go into the my videos page let's
find this div and then underneath here
what we're going to do is we're just
going to create a new div and then
insider we're just going to create a
link to start with whoops um and the
link is going to say edit video so we're
gonna go to edit underscore video dot
PHP we also need to put like a question
mark and then an argument but we'll
leave that leg up for now and we'll just
added video then what will say is space
and then we'll put one of these sort of
straight time horizontal arming vertical
lines and then we'll put in another link
and for simplicity to start to see if
time we're just going to copy the
existing one so I pasted it in twice and
what I'm going to do is going to change
this one to add it thumbnail and change
this one to
I delete video and then I'll just change
this to delete I will just get rid of
this one with the add this heart or
vertical line at the end and we will
come back to our page and see what it
looks like okay so we obviously don't
want them down here we want them inside
this div so what we're going to do is
we're just going to bike over here and
we're going to say we're going to select
all our in a copy it and then we're just
going to paste it above the keywords
and that's what we wanted we wanted it
to be above the key words but as you can
see we've pushed the key words out of
the way so what we're going to do is
going to use the chrome developer tools
to fix this and see what we're doing
wrong so we're gonna do is we're just
going to expand this div by clicking the
arrow run a scroll down and then in here
it says video tags what we're going to
do is actually will go up to my video
dave and will increase the height of it
some 100 pixels so one wonders and just
press on the I'll borrow and it's just
increasing the size to the size that we
would want and it's probably decided one
is 115 so that means we have to come
into our CSS file so if I go back to our
sublime text file and then I come out up
here into the marketing video box folder
and then we want to do is wanna look for
the CSS folder and then we get
stylesheet the CSS and we drag it into
the text editor and scroll to the bottom
and we increase this from 100 to 115
just like we did in the chrome developer
tools so as you can see it looks like
it's perfect in a minute but I know if
we refresh what might happen is it
should it on do but since we added the
CSS file it wouldn't but just I said
that because sometimes I when you added
a CSS file you have to actually go to it
before and it gives you the run for
example me see if I go to the CSS
directory and I go to Stassi that's the
our site style of CSS and scroll down as
you can see up here our stash sheet
updated but as sometimes when you're
doing it on a production web server it
doesn't actually update it because it
saves a cached version of it from the
last time you used it so it just makes
your site load quicker so because
there's something to cast version
whenever you updated it doesn't actually
update straightaway so you have to go to
at first but since run a local machine
is probably why it didn't do it so if we
go back to my videos we have all our
lumps know that at Alice we can that I'm
analyzed to do things that I shouldn't
see if I click on edit video it gives us
a little dinner because we didn't
actually specify a video to add it and
what I also want to do is we want to
actually go back into the chrome
developer tools actually when I right
click over the link and
spec element and then here's the dev we
created I want to want to do is we want
to add a margin on the top of it so
margin top of that 10 pixels as you can
see what this does it does is it pushed
everything down so I see
let's try margin bottom let's just
decrease this ok so the quickest thing
we can actually do is you can just come
in here back into my video is the PHP
and we at just put that back online army
I create or we just add a break tag in
here
listen to that pushed it down but we
still have this sort of gap underneath
and this doesn't work this time so what
we're going to do is to fix that
so what I want to do is I want to go to
the my video is Dave and I want to open
it up but the we are so I just click the
arrow to expand it and I go to the tags
div and I see the height of the div okay
it says it says it as a margin top of 30
pixels so what I do we want to do is
decreased art so decrease that too let's
see looks right it's true I will change
that to 15 so we're going to have that
margin so we can back into our site
style at CSS and we go to let you see
what it's called my videos at Dave
underscore tags may go up to that up
here and we'll just look forward to my
videos div underscore here it is so just
like that t rid of it and change this to
15 pixels so what I want to do is I want
to go back to our web browser I want to
close the chrome developer tools and
then I just want to refresh
and as you can see everything looks to
the pattern I so what we need to do is
we need to change the add a video added
thumbnail and delete video buttons so
that they actually work so what I'm
going to do is going to open up the I'm
gonna go back to video box I'm going to
open up the added video page and sublime
text will go back to sublime text whoops
a sublime text that I open this on I
drag it in what I want to get is the
video ID attribute so what I want to do
is I want to come back to the Edit video
to PHP page and then I want to do a ?
video ID equals and then I want to
create a PHP block and what I want to
echo is the video ID so we're not
actually guiding the video ID from the
database yeah it's what we do is just
copy the thumbnail row here sit below
and change this to video ID I think it's
an underscore so let's just have a look
um so square the database open the table
I'm video ID so it's video ID with an
underscore so what I want to do is just
ack without so i just a cutie a variable
video ID without an underscore Leslie
variable ok for sometimes it i'll just
add another shmuel and now if we refresh
the page click on edit video and it
takes us to our video and we're with
added it the next thing we want to do is
you want to do the exact same thing for
added thumbnail so as since we just
included the video ID from the database
we should just be able to copy and paste
this in we've pasted that in we're going
to go back we're going to refresh and
we're going to say does that work so we
click Edit thumbnail as you can see
object not find so that's obviously not
the name of the page so let's go down
into a folder again it's a upload
thumbnail of PHP is what we called it
I'm just going to open it straight away
just have a lock and it is actually
video ID that we need to get from the
URL so the only thing we need to change
you're going to change it from added
thummel to upload thumbnail we want to
refresh the page want to click on edit
thumbnail and as you can see it takes us
to our all right upload thumbnail page
the final thing we want to do is want to
actually allow users to delete a video
so to do that what we need to do is we
need to go to structure and then we want
to do is we want to click on go we want
to click on at 1-1 tie been deleted I
want to go to bar char and we just want
to set it equal to three so it's a yes
or no then we click on enter to add that
to the table and then we also need to
change a couple of things so when you
actually back into the structure as a
thing I forgot we need to check on
change I click on default as defined on
Saturday equal to know what this will do
is every time a row is inserted into the
RTA was inserted sorry a video is
inserted into the database what it will
do is it will satra moved or deleted
equal to no automatically so that way
the video doesn't appear to be actually
deleted
and then what we want to do is we need
to change the upload video to PHP page
because if we don't change that we're
gonna get some air when we try to upload
a video so upload dot PHP drag that in
go down to our query reinsert stuff into
the database we want to change this we
want to just add an extra row on we
could leave a blank or we'll just put in
though just and just to make sure we
know what I've hit would sweet it sort
of make sure we know what everything
does and then now we've added that you
wrote what we can do is we can get it
from the database so i can copy and
paste that in time and deleted deleted
and then what i can do is i can come
down here and say if deleted equals
equals no so if the video is not related
then we want to show up show these divs
at or else we want to do is we want to
share else and then echo and nothing so
we act or nothing so that the other
video doesn't show up so what I want to
do now is I want to go to I'm gonna
create a new page actually it's a new
file and we want to see if it as a
delete video at delete video to PSP I
want to create some PHP tags and then
we'll come back into the my videos page
scroll up copy the header then what I
want to do is you just want to say a
center actually a keeping simpler what
I'm going to do is it's just gonna say I
I'm going to actually copy where is it
upload thumbnail I want to copy video ID
from this and I want to piss it up here
and then what I want to say is a MySQL
query
to do is I want to say update videos set
deleted equal to yes for video
underscore ID equals and then I want to
put in here video video ID and then what
I want to say is a derp location my on
the score videos HP and then what I want
to say well actually should work so what
this will do is whenever we click on
delete video on the my baby was page
what it'll do is it'll take us to the
delete video to PHP page will update the
database estimated equal to yes and then
i'll take us back to my videos page I
know we're not actually deleting the
video file because we actually want to
keep those things and sort of as archive
we saw just want to archive them when
you can delete them if you want and you
just add a line of PHP code I will just
remove the five if you wanted to but I'm
keeping it in the database so for now
I'm just going to decide to keep the
video files ok now we've done that we
want to do is want to check test that
out so i refresh this page ok we have a
problem if the lead was no
let's check the database
okay and the problem is deleted is empty
because we didn't set the default first
so what do you do is edit this come down
here set deleted equal to know and what
I want to do is refresh we got our M
video back if I click on delete video
what should happen now if i refresh is
nothing so let's have a look let's just
check this really quickly and deleted
equals no still so obviously our query
field okay let's just see let's try this
for die maestro whoops error remove the
header function 49
will click on delete value which it
takes to the phd says you very masculine
tax
okay so something wrong with
okay here's the problem we just need to
add another a single quilt are we will
put the hatter back here try it again on
this time it should definitely work my
videos duh PHP we go back to it we click
on delete video and as you can see our
video got deleted if we go back to the
database now we can on browse we
scrolled over Tess deleted equals yes so
