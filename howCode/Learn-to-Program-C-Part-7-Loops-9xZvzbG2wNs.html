learning about loops so loop is just a
way to make something around multiple
times within your program because if
we're using an if statement or whatever
we want to print say we want to printf
and say hello world and say I want to
print this multiple times the moment I
have to copy and paste this multiple
times for each time I wanted to run so
that's what I have a look for so and see
there's two types of loops well as three
types of loops there's a for loop there
that looks like this there's a while
loop that looks like this and there's a
do-while loop that looks like this do
this while so these are the loops in say
these are all the loops RFC is a really
small language that it only has two
loops it's basically like two and a half
loops because I do while loop and a wild
lipper almost the same thing so we're
going to learn about the 41st so in a
for loop we use the for keyword to
create the loop we put parentheses here
just as we did with the F statement and
we put a block below it and we in this
block is what we put the code we want to
run multiple times in the parentheses we
put a first we put our iterator so we
say int I equals 0 this is our iterator
an iterator is just a number that
increments each time the loop runs and
that's how we exit the loop we have our
aerator then we have our conditions so
we'll say I is less than 10 and then we
have our incrementer which is just I
plus plus
so I plus plus just means i plus 1 so
instead of writing i equals i plus 1 or
i plus equals 1 we can write i plus plus
these three things are exactly
equivalent to each other they're exactly
the same thing they're just different
ways of writing it so what we're doing
is we're creating a variable called I
we're setting it equal to zero then
we're comparing I with is we're
comparing Iowa stands we're saying is I
less than 10 the answer is true so we're
going to run this block but before we
run this block we're going to increment
I by 1 so what I'm going to do is win a
printf hello world hello world and what
this is going to do is it's going to run
the loop 10 times because each time it
runs the loop is going to increment I by
one until I is less than 10 so let's run
this so it's a GCC learn dot C minus 0
learn ok that was just my text editor
did that so we senioritis comma run this
and run that you can see we got word
hello world printed out 10 times so
let's loop will run until the condition
is false if I want the loop to run once
I can find a break statement here it
seems kind of pointless why would you
create a loop if you're going to exit
out after the first execution but you
can do that you can run this and you see
we had had a world act what I once we
could also have an infinite loop which
is a loop that runs forever and then
will we do that if you just put a cooler
a semicolon here and then semicolon here
so what we're basically saying here is
we're not creating an increment we're
not creating a condition to test and
we're not creating a variable that's
going to be incremented so basically
we're just leaving this as if it's blank
except we're just leaving all the
conditions in a blank which means this
is never going to a false condition
which means that the run forever
providing we get rid of this print
statement so this will run forever let's
just run this snow and I can exit it
with the ctrl C on the keyboard and this
will exit the execution you can see no
the program executed loads of times i'm
scrolling up here and you can see it
doesn't look like it but it's scrolling
up massively we could also
have a variable say int I equals 0 we
can declare right here and then in here
we can just print hello world space and
we can increment we can print out the
number the loop is on so we can print
oops stay for decimal and then put an
eye here on increment the eye each time
we run the loop and we will get the
number of times the loop is wrong beside
the string so let's run this you can see
it's just run 545 thousand times in the
time let it rock me to press ctrl C when
you want to loop until a condition as
false is when you would use a while loop
so we use a while loop like this
technically a for loop could be used for
both but a while loop is sometimes more
appropriate so while loop just a while
you just has a condition so let's just
put a condition here and let's just
print F our world let's just said 10 is
less than so one this is now we're going
to run because town is not less than 1
so we're just going to get no I put to
the screen so you can see we've got no I
pot right what if I
sign around you can see we got an
infinite loop because so I want this
loop to roll until the condition is
false i just i is so it doesn't equal 10
i will say is i plus plus each time and
up here i'll say i equals whoops int I
equals 10 actually almost 10 and then
what we'll do is this a run 10 time so
this is basically the exact same ways at
my for liquid run it runs 10 times
well as you saw earlier if my condition
is never true my while loop will never
run this is where I do while loop
crimson so if I ever do while loop here
and I'll say 10 equals 11 print off
hello world again what will happen here
is even though the condition is never
true this while loop will run once
because the do-while loop will allow as
one wants no matter whether the
condition is true or false it will run
one it'll run first and then it will
check the condition so if we run this
you can see we got it aqueduct once so
that's it for this video don't forget to
