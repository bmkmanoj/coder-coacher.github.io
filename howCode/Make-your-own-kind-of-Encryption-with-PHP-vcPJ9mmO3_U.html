we're going to be doing is going to be
creating our own form of encryption so
as similar to that of md5 so I'm going
to show you an example so I have to echo
the result of the function md5 and so if
I still echo this what we'll say is a 32
character long string that is the
encrypted version of this is my string
using the nd 5 encryption algorithm so
here it is here here is the md5 version
so what we're going to do is we're just
going to create our own version of that
of M it's not our own version value 5
it's our own version of encryption so
let's do that so here what we're going
to do is we're just going to create our
functions obviously I'm going to call it
encrypt and what we're going to do is
it's going to take one parameter called
string ok and then now what we're going
to do is we're just going to first echo
strings so it will just basically echo
whatever's been answered into it at the
moment so we just made our function and
now we need to actually do it I run it
so if we type encrypt then we give it a
string now we'll get a good straight
line so at if we go here we can see we
get a quid string so obviously this is
pointless because it doesn't do anything
it just act as what we enter into it so
now what we're going to do is we're
going to say string equals STR
underscore ode RT 13 which is just a
function that shifts every alphanumeric
character 13 characters further in the
OP or M every character in the alphabet
further 13 characters further along so
so as you'll see now if I was to say a
and I was too echo string what we should
get is am or an even so what it gives it
gives us and so it shifts the ladder a
13 characters further over in the
alphabet so what we're going to do we're
going to change this to string and what
this is going to do is it's going to
take the word string and move it 13
characters over in the alphabet so
there's our string so far and we want
obviously to be all lowercase what we're
going to do is not say string and close
STR to lower string and it makes
everything lowercase so there's our
encryption so far it's pretty weak at
the moment I mean that wouldn't take
anyone that long to crack so what we're
going to do now is we're going to say
we're going to say string equals STR
underscore replace a with a one and and
the only is just in the string string so
what this does is it says it just says
strung equals the STR replace which is a
function that says replace air with one
inside the string string and string is
whatever is entered up here so what this
will do is it won't actually do anything
because we don't have any A's in our
string so I'll just say this is a string
so there it is now it's all shifted over
and it's encrypted
sort of so let's see wherever we can
find the one is wherever the guy was so
we're going to copy this
do it a few times so we'll say nice be
with a to see the three and we'll keep
going actually so we'll just line on
this up so we'll just change all these
ladders so see the e F and obviously
when we change all these four five six
seven eight nine and then zero so now if
we refresh it gets replaced with numbers
now we're going to replace every space
with an ass so what we're going to do is
just copy this again replace a space
with an ass for space and then what
we're going to do is we're going to
actually use an b5 so we'll say string
oops
string equals md5 string so now we get
the md5 of string and then we're going
to run more things to it or on it so
we're going to copy this again and paste
it down and now what we get is a weird
whoops a weird a version of it so the
next thing we're going to do is we're
going to shift another 13 characters
which actually you know that just puts
it back to it was it forget about that
then we're going we're actually going to
say copy this
unguent I'm pasted again but we're going
to change this so this time we turn as
edge until one that why we're just going
to do it backwards without YX w u T so s
are we're going to change our rx
marching click here then we'll get rid
of the space because the md5 version
won't have any spaces it's been get rid
of that and now we're going to change
this or our fresh actually and as you
can see it's all been changed into a lot
of numbers and what we're going to do
now is we're just going to md5 it one
more time and then we're going to shift
all the characters one more time and
then we're finally just going to well
actually I know we will get this and we
will change characters into a non
alphanumeric ones so let it redo so
we'll change a na into a last on sign
going to be into a greater than sign say
you into a semicolon and we'll actually
just
check pick random matter so set em we
will turn into a square bracket and add
into the up opposite and we will do one
more
so we'll just change a and one F into a
not sign so that now if we refresh we
have well square brackets and things so
we're going to do and we're going to do
one last thing which is md5 and shift
all the characters 13 cases over one
more time and there we have oh and we'll
actually also shorten it down so we
could say string equals sub STR string
almost a 5/10 so what this will do is
just pick five let me not actually give
it more we have to put a semicolon there
so maybe we'll make it a bit longer than
that so we'll say but we could say 5 to
16 or I don't 15 and we'd say actually
300 should do a so this does it gives us
a 15 character string so that's it
really for this video we can actually
just get rid of the a cantar so now we
have our own type of encryption so we
can encrypt our own string so we just
echo it okay um and we'll say turn
string and there we have
our string approaches that what we can
do is we can even encrypt anything we
want so we could say creative code
encrypt that so and this is what it is
so that's it for this video don't forget

hope you enjoyed it if you have any more
if you have any questions about this or
anything in general just have a message
or leave me a comment I try my best to
get to them but sometimes I don't I do
read them but sometimes I don't get
chance to reply but if you'd like to
learn more about encryption or anything
like that just let me know and I'll make
more videos about it and as I said
before over it's like favorite comment
