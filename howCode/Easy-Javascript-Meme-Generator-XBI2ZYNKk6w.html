how to create a really simple meme
generator so what we can do is we can
add text to the top on to the bottom of
our image so if I says something like
hello world this is a test you can see
the text is filled in as I type it and
it's defaulted to this image here and
here's that image here here's another
image I have and what I can do is then
click generate meme and you can see this
image below is created so up here what
we have is a div with some text over the
top of it and then down here what we
have is an actual image if I have to
drag that image into the address bar you
can see this is an image that I can now
download so that's we're gonna learn in
this video so let's get started
so we're going to be using a library
called html2canvas that's the library
we're going to use because the way it
works is we take this div and we pretty
much just convert it to an image so what
we're gonna do is convert the
hitch-mounted to an image and we do that
using this library so what we do is we
click download and you want to download
html2canvas jas so after you've done
that what you want to do is go into the
file and here it is here so you can see
here it's called meme generator I just
have a bit of CSS up here it's not that
important but what we notice is the
width of the image is 300 and the height
is 400 because that's the width and
height of our div and then down here we
set the image width and height to 400
and 300 again I'm by default I've just
said image 2 is the default image that's
this image here what I could do is I
could change it to image what if I
wanted just by changing it to image and
then going in here and changing the
value of our text box to image and now
you can see here is our new image so
this is actually really simple the way
it works so the first thing we do to get
this effect where I can type and I can
change the text as I type is really
simple all we do is every time I left
the key up I run a set top function or a
set bottom function set top changes the
text on top set bottom changes the text
underneath and all I do is lease at the
HTML value of that div so the div that
holds this text up here on the tip that
holds this text up here is set just
using this line of JavaScript here and
then what we do is we have this sort of
I put div and this is the div that holds
the image that huge amount accomplished
generates for us so whenever I click on
generate what we do is we grab the
generate button we are to click event
listener to it
so whenever I click on it we take the
value of the top on the bottom and the
URL which is the value of the image here
so in order for this to work your image
has to be stored on the same domain as
your server so you can say I'm on the
tutorial dot local do me and it's a
local domain set up on my computer and
if I was to drag this image in here you
can see it's at the same to me and you
can also see it's in the same folder so
that's why it's on the same to me and I
couldn't drag a file off the desktop
because HTML to canvas wouldn't be able
to work with it because of restrictions
in the browser so just a to keep that in
mind so the URL is just the URL of the
image but it has to be on the server
that I'm using so that's why it's just a
relative URL it doesn't have a HTTP or
anything is just the name of the file
and what we do is we grab the element
meme and we set its source equal to the
URL so this image here is the image with
the ID of memes so if I scroll up you
can see there it is there's the image
here and there is it side a so we're
targeting that image and we're setting
that to whatever has been typed into
this box whenever I click generate then
what we do is we run here's tml to
canvas before we can run it we obviously
include it just like we would any other
javascript file so we include it into
our project and then we run the
html2canvas function we target the meme
container which is if we scroll up is
this element here so we wrote a function
and what we do is we go to the output
image we set its source item its source
attribute equal to canvas dot to data
URL and we convert that to a PNG so what
page to man through canvas does is it
grabs the mean container converts it
into a canvas and it takes that comest
and generates an image and that's all it
does and that's why it works as expected
all I have to do is say for example put
an image to hello world and I just click
generate meme you can see that image
changed and then straight after that
html2canvas generated our image so let's
