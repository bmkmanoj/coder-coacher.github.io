how to actually use directors and
hopefully you'll see way directors is so
much better than working with MySQL
directly so first start we have users so
I have my admin user and I can create a
new user so I can give lots of people
access to my database but using
directives I can control their levels of
access so I have complete control over
who can access my database so I'm going
to create a new user and I'm going to
generate them a password and I'll give
them a name user two and I'm just going
to see if that so now we have two users
and what we're going to do is create a
new database table so to do that we go
to admin settings go to tables I'm going
to create one so directors has lots of
cool features we have the sort feature
the letters sort or columns so what the
status option does is it means if we
accidentally delete an item in our
database an administrator can come back
and bring that item by so it deletes the
item from the database for everyone but
it's still somewhere in the system so
administrators can use your actors to
bring it back but for this table I'm
going to turn that off and I'm going to
create a table called users so now we've
created our table but there are no
columns in our table apart from the two
columns the directors creates for us so
we call their table users so we're going
to create a column called user name and
you can see the name of the column is
username all lowercase but direct us is
automatically given us an uppercase u so
that in the CMS we're going to see this
nicer version which is user name with a
capital letter and we can choose the
type of user interface we want the admin
area interact us to display so because
it's user name I'm going to create a
text input and the data type is the
MySQL data type which is going to be a
VAR char and we're going to say user
names are going to be twenty characters
long so I'm going to click Save we have
our username column created I'm going to
create one for password it's going to be
a password so the interface is going to
be password but in MySQL it's still
going to be stored as a varchar' so we
save that I'm going to create one more
column and it's going to be if our user
is verified so Twitter has verified
users so we're going to have verified
users as well and verified is going to
be a numeric type and it's going to be a
toggle which means directors will
automatically give us a switch in the
interface that we can use to verify a
user so if we save that so now I'm going
to click into our users table and we
don't have any users at the minute so
I'm going to create one as you can see
as I type direct just automatically
tells me how many characters are left I
can provide a password I'm because it's
a password I have to confirm it or
directors can generate me one so lets
rector's generate me a password
and here is the toggle that tells us
whether the user is verified so I'm
going to verify that user and I'm going
to click Save I know you can see we have
one user and the admin area was
generated for us depending on the fields
we created so I'm going to create
another table and it's going to be
called photos and we're going to include
the status feature this time we're going
to click OK so we're going to add a
column called photo and we're going to
create a file so we're going to be able
to upload files because we've selected
the file interface and now if I click
Save now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to associate a user with each
photo so I'm going to set uploader which
is the person who uploaded the photo
we're going to go down to relations and
we're going to click on many to one
because the MySQL you can have
relationships and interactors we can do
the same so I'm going to click on many
to one because many users can upload a
photo but each photo can only be
uploaded by one user and what I want to
do is I'm going to relate the table
photos to the table users I'm going to
click Save so now we have to pack a
column name so I'm just going to call it
user name and underneath here we provide
a template string which inside two curly
brackets is going to be user name so
this is going to grab the user name out
of the users table and it's going to
display it in our drop-down so now if I
scroll down and click Save and I will be
upload a photo we could drag a photo in
but now we have this option called
uploader and has one field called
Francis and I got that from the users
table so I just uploaded a video
thumbnail and I'm going to say it was
uploaded by Francis that's the only user
I can select I'm going to click Save now
you can see with one photo uploaded by
Francis if I go to users you can see we
have one user if I create one more user
I'll say the user is Connor they'll
generate a password for them will say
that user is verified as well see of
that now we have two users and if I try
to upload a photo
we have two users to choose from what
you can also do with the status column
is you can click on it and then
interface options you can click on
status mapping and let's say I just
paste in this example so now I'll be
able to choose between drafts active and
deleted statuses so in the status column
if I go to interface options and I just
create another option this option I'm
going to call number 3 and it's going to
be called under review so if I save that
and I go to our photos table now you can
see we have the option to make the photo
active make it a draft or put it under
review and we can add as many of these
statuses as we want and this is
something that should be really useful
for your workflow so in our file library
now we have this one file that I
uploaded and if I click on that we can
see the file another actress will let us
edit the metadata of the file we can
also store files in Amazon s3 we don't
have to store them on our local server
and direct this also has this feature
called global settings which allows us
to customize directors to suit us we can
make it lock whatever way we want it to
look directors also has what are called
group permissions if I click on manage
you can see we have two groups we have
the administrator and with the public
group the public group tails directives
what did it will be available via the
API publicly what we did will require an
API key and you can see at the minute
it's all private but if I was to click
on users know when there's a blue check
in the box
that would mean anyone could access the
API and read data from the users table
without having to be authenticated so
here so we can control access to
different tables and directives so we
have the administrator group that can
see everything but if I create a new
group I just call it the basic group
a I'm really fine green control over who
can view add edit or delete items out of
specific tables just by associating them
with this group so in the basic group
I'm going to say you can view photos and
you can view users but you can't add you
can't add and you can't delete and I'm
going to choose a user and I'm going to
add user two to that group so now user
two won't be able to add edit or delete
anything but they can read from the
database so I fix it and you can see now
it in the basic group we have one user
and now in the administrator group we
have one user because user two was
removed from the administrator group
whenever I added user two to the basic
group directors also lets us message
users so I can send private messages to
other users on the system so that's it
pretty much for the basic feature
overview of directors there's a lot of
things that I didn't cover but that's it
