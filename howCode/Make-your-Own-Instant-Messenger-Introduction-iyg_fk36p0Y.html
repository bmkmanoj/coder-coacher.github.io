doing is we're going to be learning how
to create our own messaging application
sort of similar to the way Facebook or
whatsapp or whatever would do it except
it's going to be a website so what it is
is it's a website as you can see
messenger gaudiest at lycée is what i'm
using so the first thing it says is pick
a user name so the user names are stored
in a database they're just saved in a
cookie so people can have the same user
name but if you're going to use this for
your own sort of website you would
probably want to use database instead of
a cookie based system but I'm using a
cookie based system because the primary
focus of the tutorial isn't the login
registration it's to do with actually
sending and receiving messages so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to log in
and I'm going to just pick a username
call myself Francis I could choose
username and I've logged in Anakin's you
can see whenever the cooking is set that
box disappears and your are able to
actually interact with the interface so
because it's the messenger app I need to
two different browsers to show you in so
if I go to Safari you can see I'm logged
in and Safari as well so what I'm going
to do first is I'm just going to move
this off to the side
and you can see here it says add your
message press ENTER to send the message
because you can see here there's no sand
button you just press enter so I'm just
going to say how the world on safari
whenever I press enter what's going to
do is going to send my message so if I
click enter
so if we go back to Safari first of all
you can see that the message was sent by
haiku because that's when Leibniz and
you can see it has a blue background and
it has this is supposed to be an arrow
if I go to Google Chrome you'll see here
there's the arrow but I didn't show up
correct in Safari and because this is
just you know this the template doesn't
actually affect the functionality I just
left it alone so you can see here on the
window that I send it from the message
appears on the right-hand side and it's
in blue but if I go to Google Chrome you
can see that since I'm logged in as
Francis it says sent by hi code and it
shows up on the left-hand side and it's
great so that is sort of the way
Facebook does it so what I'm gonna do is
gonna send another message I'm going to
say my name is Francis I don't click Sam
and you can see it says my name is
Francis it says set by Francis and it's
blue because that's because I'm who I
send it I sent the message myself but if
I go over to Safari you can see the
message has been received and it's on
the left-hand side because it wasn't
sent by the Safari browser if I'm going
to send send another one say go to haiku
org hit enter you can see that it's blue
here I'm Safari and it's already showed
up it's gray on the Google Chrome window
I'm going to send one more message I'm
going to say at youtube.com slash I code
just so you can see in the Chrome window
how quickly the messages appear so if I
click enter that the message is sent and
there it's been received in the Chrome
window and there it has been sent in the
Safari window so the tablet doesn't
affect the functionality it was just to
make it a bit easier to see which masses
were sent from which browser so the way
this works is when you send a message it
sends requests obviously to the server
that stores the message in the database
because I can refresh the page and you
see the messages are still here but the
way we update it so for example whenever
I send a message from Safari I send
another one I'll just say 1 2 3 4 5
click enter it's been sent and there
it's been received the reason the way
the Chrome browser knows hiding
when the Safari browser sends a message
is because it's sending a request to the
server every two-and-a-half seconds to
see if any new messages exist so if I
could inspect element and I go to
network you'll see every two and a half
seconds it sends a request this request
goes to gap messages that PHP and it
takes the parameter of username and that
username is who have you logged in us
and you can see every two and a half
seconds
it's engineer ik West and here's the
size of the request it's to 370 bikes
the reason why you know I didn't set the
time to you know one second or whatever
is because if you're sending 378 bytes
that might not sound like a lot but if
you're sending it every single second
and say someone sits on the webpage for
the whole day then you might end up
using an awful lot of bandwidth by the
end of the day so that's why you want to
you want to sort of compromise between
sending enough requests to update the
users page quickly enough but you don't
want to send too many where it puts a
lot of stress on your server that's what
we're going to be doing in this area so
if this sounds like something you want
to learn how to do stick around and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
