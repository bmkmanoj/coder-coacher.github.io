learn how to create some apps for
etherium so in case you don't know what
aetherium is aetherium is like a big
massive distributed computer and to run
your program on aetherium you have to
spend some money because it's running on
somebody else's computer so they have to
be paid for that and to do that Ethier
um has its own currency called ether
just like bitcoin has bitcoins and like
coin has like coins aetherium has ether
so absolutely theorem are called smart
contracts I'm working to learn how to
create - smart contracts in this series
we're gonna learn how to create our own
currency and we're gonna learn how to
create our own lottery so the way the
currency works is you send some ether to
our smart contract and it sends you back
some coins from our currency and you can
stand our coins to other people and you
can receive them so it works just like a
currency to make our coins worth
something you can withdraw them to get
your ether back so our coins are backed
by ether so that gives them value so
we're gonna be able to generate coins
the way lots of cryptocurrencies
generate coins is by mining but what we
are going to do is we're just gonna
allow you to buy coins but one of the
things that mining does is it limits the
supply and the supply grows over time so
we're still gonna have that our contract
is only gonna let a certain amount of
coins be brought up at any particular
time so there's multiple ways to develop
for aetherium you can scroll down in the
etherium website and you can download
the etherium wallet that takes a long
time and takes a lot of hard drive space
so instead what you can do is you can go
to aetherium ide which is called remix
so just go to remix 33 org so using this
idea you can run your code and you can
actually send it straight to the
etherium network but in theory 'm has a
couple of tasks networks that allow you
to get 1/3 for free and to test out your
contract before you send it on to the
relay theory of network and that's what
we're gonna be using so in order for
this to work you have to download a
chrome plugin called madam asked so just
download the plugin and add it to google
chrome and you'll have this icon in the
corner here you can see here is my
account and if I click on this you can
see there's the main etherium network
and there's this task network there's a
couple of task networks but we're gonna
use this first one which is called Rob
stone to start with you're gonna have 0
aether so because this is on the task
network we can get some aether for free
so if you go to this website here it's
called a faucet if we type in our
etherium address we can send ourself
some aether and that will let us test
out our contract so now if I click on
madam asked you can see the amount of
ether I have is increased by 3 because
the
facets at me some ether so now we're
gonna create our contract so etherium
contracts or programs are written in a
language called solidity and this is the
first sign of every solidity program it
tells a theory on what version of
solidity we're going to use then we have
something called a contract and we call
our contract whatever we want I'm gonna
call it hi coin so this is sort of like
a class in another language but within
the contract we then have kind of a
constructor for the contract so we
create a function with the same name as
our contract and we're gonna say it's
public and this function is gonna run
when the contracts deployed so the first
time it's ever sent to the etherium
network this is gonna run but rather
than type the whole contract I'm gonna
paste it in one that I created earlier
and we're gonna explain that because
it'll make it easier to understand and
we're also gonna have the source code on
github so you can follow along in your
own time so I've pasted my contract in
here and if I scroll down you can see
it's about 100 lines long so here we
created our contract I've called it
haiku and that's we're gonna call our
cryptocurrency then we have this mapping
at the beginning this is like an
associative array in a normal
programming language it maps a user's
address to their balance so in Bitcoin
you have a Bitcoin address in aetherium
you have an aetherium address and in
high coin which is powered by aetherium
we use aetherium addresses to track
balances so then I have the name of the
coin which I'm gonna call high coin the
symbol of a currency which is just a
chaw W and the maximum supply so this
looks like a massive number so here we
have 42 million that's the maximum
supply that's the maximum number of high
coins that we can create but we also
have these six zeros after that and
that's because we've sat down here that
the number of decimals our coin can be
broken up into is sex
so our coin can have six digits after
the decimal point and in an aetherium
contract you are dealing in the smallest
denomination of your coin so I said at
the start of the video that we're not
gonna allow every coin we bought at the
beginning and the way we're gonna do
that is we're gonna gonna release a
certain amount of coins every certain
amount of time and the reward is gonna
be 50 high coins so it's 50 with six
zeros at the end of it because we're
dealing in the smallest denomination
again just like bitcoin and litecoin
we're gonna cut the reward in half every
so often just to make sure that our
coins don't go above the 42 million mark
then we have these events events or just
things in etherium that people can
listen to and then react to so if
somebody
first coins in your currency people can
listen to that so it's not that
important we could easily take these out
in our coin would still work but they're
just in just to give our coin a bit more
completeness so what we do is we have a
function called update supply so what it
basically says is if the time since the
reward last cut in two is greater than
equal to two million one hundred
thousand minutes and I just picked that
number because it's four years it's the
same as bitcoin and litecoin then we
just cut the reward in two and we update
the time of last having so we can start
tracking the next time that we're going
to cut it into the next we're going to
do when we update the supply is we're
gonna find out the last time that it
increased and initially I've said it to
increase every one second that's why I
have one second here it makes
development easier but if you want to
copy like coin you would do one hundred
and fifty seconds that's two and a half
minutes so every two and a half minutes
the total supply increases by 50 and the
circulating supply is the actual amount
of coins held in people's accounts so
down here is where we transfer our coins
so what this require function does is it
just checks if the person's balance is
greater than or equal to the amount they
want to sell as you can see here a
checks that they have enough then we
check if the receiver's balance is
greater than or equal to their current
balance because in solidity if I try to
send a lot of coins and it hit the mark
impossible number in an unsigned int it
will overflow it'll go back to the
beginning again so we have to prevent
again stop then finally if those two
checks work what we do is we subtract
the balance from the sender and we add
it to the receiver and then we update
our supply again we update the supply
because in aetherium our contract is
only executed when somebody either sends
coins by his coins something like that
so even though our supply increases
every 150 seconds it won't actually
increase until the contract is executed
and it'll only execute whenever somebody
for example transfers a coin so to
increase the supply we have to run it
every time somebody transfers the coin
so here we have a function called mint
and that function is what we use to buy
coins so what we do is we just check for
overflow again and what master star
value is is it's the amount of ether
someone sent to our contract so we take
the amount of ether and we divide it by
this number because one high coin is
gonna be worth a lot less than one ether
so to get the number of high coins from
the number of ether we just divide it by
this massive number here that's kind of
like our exchange rate and then we gave
the user the coins the Ender withdraw
money we check if the person trying to
withdraw money
actually has enough to withdraw and then
what we do is we subtract their coins
from their account we add it back into
the unspent supply because those coins
have already been created but they're no
longer in somebody's account so they're
not circulating so they're back into the
unspent pile of coins and then what we
do is we convert it back into ether so
we take the amount of coins we multiply
it by the same number that we divided it
by up here to convert it back into ether
and we use this function here to send
the ether back to the user and then
finally we update the supply again and
that's our entire contract so to create
our coin all we have to do is click
create and that will create it on the
task network we just click Submit and
what we can do we can copy this and if
we want to run it on our own computer we
can go into the etherium wallet and we
can go to network and we can click on
solo network and that will let us run
our own sort of private a theory of
network so we create our contract on our
solo network we just click on contracts
we just paste it in here we click on our
contract called high coin and we click
deploy
so we just put in our password for our
etherium account and to create an
account you just click on our to kind
and it'll ask you for a password and
then you can create it but you can see
we're on our private etherium network so
it's not actually mining anything so two
main things we have to mind them
ourselves we just click start mining you
can see now it's started to mine here's
how poin you can see the reward is
currently 50 coins the unspent supply is
zero the maximum supply is 42 million
and the symbol is there at the time of
last having everything is here and just
to make things a bit easier because
we're only developing a coin I'm going
to decrease the amount of time it takes
to increase the supply from 150 seconds
to one second and I'm gonna deploy it up
so our contracts been created here it is
here and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
mint some coins and I'm not gonna put on
any ether but because I just want to see
the supply increase so we're gonna see
the unspent supply increase there we go
and you can see there's two thousand
five hundred and fifty high coins
everything is displayed in the lowest
denomination that's why it looks so big
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna stand
not 0.1 ether and I'm gonna send that
and when I met these coins it's going to
let me buy them so you can see now the
contract has a balance of not point one
either and if I go to my wallets and I
go to my account you can see for high
coin I have one thousand high coins so
if I want to send some coins to somebody
I can go to transfer and say I want to
send it to this address here this is a
zero address this is sort of just a way
to burn coins and a lot of
cryptocurrencies so I send them there
and I'm gonna send say if my balance is
here I'm gonna copy that and I'm going
to paste it in here I'm going to send
half to this address
there we go so now you can see my
balance decreased by half the unspent
supply increased because it updated the
supply but the circulating supply didn't
increase finally if I want to withdraw
my coins I can go to withdraw and
because I sent half of them I can only
withdraw half so we're gonna copy that
and I'm gonna paste it in here
and if I click execute it's gonna let me
withdraw them but if I want to withdraw
even a single extra part of a coin and
click execute you can see it failed
because my balance wasn't big enough so
if I just execute this now I get my
ether back you might have ether in the
contract decreased by half and I got my
ether back so that's how to make a
really simple cryptocurrency
using etherium the source code for all
this is going to be on the haiku github
page and if you have any questions don't
