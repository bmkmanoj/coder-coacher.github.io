longer I think it's actually gonna tick
so I'm gonna try and be as quick as
possible going through as much stuff as
possible to make sure I don't have a
hundred videos about making a DNS server
so what we need to do is we need to look
at what a DNS request looks like this is
what a DNS query looks like but it
obviously doesn't mean anything like
this and it means even less because the
terminals tried to convert some of the
bytes into actual letters so what we
need to do is use Wireshark to actually
look at the DNS request so what we're
gonna do is we're just going to go to
Wireshark and we're gonna tell it to
start capturing packets again now what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up Digg
which is this one here and I'm just
gonna send another DNS request you can
see Digg is just for sent the request
I'll I'll just close this night because
it will just timeout and I'll keep
sending more requests as it has just
done so it just closed egg to stop it
sending more requests and we can just
filter these by DNS so we said DNS
server and you can see there's two DNS
requests so this is what a DNS request
actually looks like this is the raw
binary that the terminal has tried to
convert if I just show it in hexadecimal
format and go back to the server you can
see here there's backslash X 0 1
backslash X 0 0 0 0 0 1
these actually match up with Wireshark
so these first two this lowercase T and
the capital P are 2 bytes that the
terminal has incorrectly tried to
convert into letters
what you can see if I go to the DNS
request if I click this the DNS request
turns blue and these first two bytes are
the lowercase T and the capital P then
we have 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 which is 4 bytes
if we go back to the terminal you can
see the exact same 4 bytes so what a DNS
request looks like is this we have the
transaction ID then we have flags
we have Kawai of the number of questions
the number of rate of answers we get
back and we have authority resource
records on additional resource records
in this series to keep things simple
we're not going to be sending authority
resource records and we're not gonna be
sending additional resource records
because we're going to be creating an
authoritative DNS server it's not going
to serve requests that it doesn't have
the zone files for it's only going to
serve request from domains that it
actually controls to keep things more
simple here we have the actual
question and here we have haiku org and
then we have the type of the request and
the class the class is in which means
Internet there are other classes that
work with DNS but the only one that
99.9% of people ever use is in for
Internet which is encoded as a one ok so
here we have the header section as is
specified in the RFC you can see if we
go back to hike org there are headers
associated with HTTP requests and these
are the request headers and these are
the response headers DNS also has
headers and this is the format of a DNS
header if we go back to Wireshark we can
see these headers the header is the
transaction ID down to the additional
resource records the next part where it
says queries that's part of the body of
the request and but all these up here
are headers and if we open this up we
can see the flags in more detail and
these are part of the header section as
well
so you can see it says 0 and it goes 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then it goes 0 1 2 3
4 5 if you add that up it adds up to 16
and each one of these numbers represents
one bit
so essentially what that means is the
transaction ID takes up 2 bytes of
memory so the transaction ID is this
here and that is the very first part of
a DNS request and a DNS response the
reason you have a transaction ID is
because the DNS server sends you a
response to your request but you don't
know if that response is what you
actually asked for you don't know if
it's the correct response so in order to
ensure that the response came from the
right DNS server the DNS server has to
extract the transaction ID out of the
packet it receives from the request and
send it back in the response the
transaction ID just ensures that the
response that you receive came from the
server you requested it from the next
thing we have are flags and you can see
here this second line is the flags
the first one is QR that is if we scroll
down here it's a one bit field that
specifies whether the message is a query
or a response if it's a query it's a
zero if it's a response it's a 1 and if
we go to Wireshark that holds true you
can see that this is a 0 because it is a
query if it was a response it would be a
1 next is opcode and you can see opcode
is 2 is encoded using 4 bits and
essentially we can just send a 0 back in
this field
we're not going to be dealing with all
this other the other possibilities to
keep things simple we're just going to
stand back a zero the next is the AF
field which is the authoritative answer
and that will basically tell dig
whenever we send a request to it that
the response is authoritative which
means that the DNS server we got the
response from is the DNS server that
controls the domain name it's not coming
from a third-party DNS server and you
can see that takes up one bit then you
can see there's another one called TC
and that stands for truncation that
means if our request was bigger than 512
bytes and for example maybe it got
truncated because it was too long then
we would say that we truncated it but
since we're gonna assume all requests
are 512 bytes or less we're just gonna
say that as a 0 the Rd field is another
1 bit field that says recursion desired
and essentially that is just the client
asking the server for if it offers
recursion then we're gonna send no so
we're just gonna write a 0 for that for
recursion available is the next fail
that's also 1 bit we're gonna set that
to 0 this fails add the takes of 3 bits
is reserved it's just for future use so
we can ignore that we can just set these
all to 0 and response code is another 4
bit field that says whether or not the
DNS query was successful or not and for
simplicity we're also just gonna be
assuming all queries are successful
there are response codes if we scroll
down here for response code you can see
here are the codes that it accepts but
we're just gonna ignore all those the
next one is the question kind which is
always going to be one because one DNS
was first designed it was designed so
that you can have multiple questions per
query but in practice every single day
and ask query is one question so that's
always gonna be a 1 the answer section
can be actually a lot longer because
that's up to the DNS server if there's
more than one err record returned for
Haiku org then there's gonna be more
than one answer it's gonna return all of
those records and that will be answer
current which is actually a bit more
complicated than question kind because
it's not just a static number the NS
kind stands for the number of name
servers returned we're not gonna be
sanding any name servers so that's
always gonna be 0 and the AR kind
stands for additional records and we're
not going to be sending any of those
either for simplicity so that's gonna be
0 and that's gonna be 0 and you can see
that this is a two byte field this is
also a 2 byte field and these for these
for all 2 bytes
the ID is two bytes and the flags are
two bytes that adds up to twelve and
that means DNS headers are 12 bytes long
so the reason I mentioned DNS headers
are 12 bytes long so I just looked at
the video it's getting a bit long so I'm
going to come on to this message
compression in the next part so thanks
