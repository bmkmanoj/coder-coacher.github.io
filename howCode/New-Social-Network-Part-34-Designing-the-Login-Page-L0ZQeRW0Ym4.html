design for our social network series
we're gonna be learning how to design
the login page not just so we're gonna
be deciding what it looks like we're
gonna be implementing the functionality
behind the login page using JavaScript
so let's get started so to create the
design I'm gonna use some software
called bootstrap studio this is the
website for the software here and the
creators of the software have kindly
given me two licenses to give away what
this software does is it makes it so
much quicker to create websites using
the CSS bootstrap framework bootstrap on
its own makes it quicker to create
websites but using bootstrap studio just
speeds it up unbelievably so I'm gonna
be using that software you can use just
plain bootstrap on its own or you can
use CSS on its own and all of the design
source code will be hosted on the github
repository so you can download the
official source code and you can use my
design if you don't to create your own
so when we have this software what we
want to do is we want to create a new
design we're going to call it social
network and we're going to click create
so here's what our page looks like at
the minute it's blank so what I'm going
to do is going to click preview I'm
gonna turn that on and if I click on
open and browser you can see now we have
a preview of our website and we have
social network up at the top I said in
this video we're gonna be creating the
design for the login page I'm using
bootstrap studio we can do that
extremely quickly so what we're going to
do is we're going to go to bootstrap
studio we're going to click here we're
going to add a new page and we're going
to call this page login we're going to
go right here and rename it
a night we're gonna do is we go to
components we search for login and bitch
drops judo comes with all these
components built in here's a login form
that's already been created
and here's another login form and we're
gonna use this one here so we're gonna
drag it on and this one fills the entire
page now if I just go back to our
browser you can see it's automatically
refreshed and it shows our login form so
we're going to use this login form for
the social network series it wants an
email and a password and we no mean log
in with our username and our password so
what we'll do is we'll go back to
bootstrap studio and here we have email
we're gonna click that we're going to go
to the cog icon which is options I'm
going to change the name of that from
email to username we're going to give it
a place holder of username now what
we're gonna do is we're gonna click on
the button
we're gonna go to animation which is
this star icon we're gonna click trigger
and we're just gonna set the trigger to
however at the moment we're gonna change
that later but what we want to do is we
want to click on Schick so when we click
play you can see the login button shakes
and we're going to use that to tell the
user that their password or the username
was invalid so now that we have our
basic login page created what we're
gonna do is we're gonna click export and
we're going to export it to somewhere on
our computer so I'm going to store it in
the social network folder and what I'm
gonna do is just click export it says
it's been exported we can open it up in
the folder and you can see here here are
our two pages we have login an index and
I click on login
it's exactly what we created and when we
hover our mouse over here the login
button shakes so now we're gonna do is
we're gonna implement the login system
so to do that we're going to use the API
that we created in the simple restful
api series you can see over here i'm
gonna put a link to this video on the
screen and we're going to use this FBI
to log the user in so here is the source
code of the api series what i'm gonna do
is i'm going to just copy that and in
our social network series what i'm going
to do is i'm gonna create a new folder
called api i think gonna pierce those in
there i'm gonna open this api up and i
know the database class is duplicated
for the minute but we're gonna leave
that for now and we already have our
login and our log out system created so
to do the login all we need to do is
send a post request with the username
and the password to our api and because
we use bootstrap studio for the design
if i right-click here view page source
you can see we have jquery automatically
included for us so what i'm going to do
is i'm going to copy the assets on the
login dot HTML page I'm gonna piss them
in here so I'm going to open login
to mount up in our text editor and up
below the JavaScript that bootstrap
studio includes we're gonna include our
own so we're going to create our own
script tags when we copied the API we
left out a file we laughed at the
htaccess file so just make sure you
create the history access file and you
piss this in again this is just the same
HT access code from the other tutorial
series and once you've done that we go
back to login
HTML and we're ready to go and we're
ready to send our post request so before
we're ready to do that we need to change
the input type of the button from submit
to button because otherwise whenever we
click that the formal submit and the
page will refresh and we also want to be
able to grab the username of the
password using the righties so to do
that we'll just give username an ID of
username and password an ID of password
and we'll change the type from email to
text because otherwise we'd only be able
to type in emails and then what we'll do
is we'll just say login dot click so
that's our login button so we need to
give that an ID of login so here we're
saying when we click the login button
we're gonna run a function and this
function is going to be our Ajax request
so we're gonna say a dollar dot Ajax
which is the way you call jquery's Ajax
method and this method takes one
parameter which is just a load of JSON
so we just put in two cardi braces so
the first parameter and the JSON we put
in is type and it's gonna be post
because we're sending a post request the
URL is gonna be the URL of our API
suisse a URL colum API slash users
because we're calling the users end
point because that's the end point in
the API that allows us to log a user in
and logger user right there's another
parameter called processed data we're
gonna set that to false that's optional
but we're gonna put it in anyway the
content type of the request is just
content type and it's gonna be
application sauce JSON because we're
sending a chess on string the data is
next and that's gonna be the actual JSON
we want to send which is just going to
be a string and then finally we have
success which is a function it takes a
variable R with that as a response data
so now we're just going to put in our
JSON string so we're gonna actually
change these two single quotes because
in JSON to use a string you have to use
double quotes so the first thing we're
gonna do is are going to put into cardi
brackets and we're going to put in
double quotes and say username
equals the username is going to be equal
to the value of the username tax box so
to get that value we want to firstly say
it's a string by using two double quotes
then we want to use two single quotes to
split the string and here we want to use
jQuery to access the username text box
and then we want to use the Val method
to get its value so we're going to copy
and paste this but a comma here and then
we're gonna set password in double
quotes is equal to leave value from the
password text box and then on success
we're gonna say console dot log R which
is the response that we get back from
the API which in this case will be the
login token for the user and finally
before we run this we want to change the
API and point from users to off because
if we go to the API you can say that
auth is actually the endpoint when we
send a post request to log these R in
not users so if i refresh and I right
click and go to inspect element and I go
to the network tab the first thing I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna put in a correct
username and a random incorrect password
I'm gonna click login and you can see
now we got an error it says a 401
unauthorized it looks like we made a
mistake we didn't actually make a
mistake because if we go to the API you
can see that it's been told to send a
401 response whenever the username of
the password is incorrect
and we also want to stand back some JSON
so what we're gonna do is just copy this
echo and just paste it down here and say
error or just put in an hour or
something like
and we just copy this we can use the
fact that there's an error in our JSON
code to tell the user on the login page
that that something's gone wrong so we
just paste it down here again and we run
this one more time so what we want to do
is just click login one more time you
can see we got another off we scroll
down there's the username in the
password and then there is our response
so what we'll do is we'll put in the
correct password which in this case is
just test pass we'll click login you can
see this last auth isn't read we click
on that and then the response has our
token in it and if we go to console you
can see there is the token printed I
will also put in another one we have
success which we want to put in error
and run a function I will log the
response for that as well
so now if we refresh and we just click
login you can see we have an error so
now that we have access to our error
message we can tell our login button to
check whenever the username and the
password is incorrect so what we'll do
is we'll right click and here is where
automation code is we'll just drag that
into the address bar all it does is it
adds a special automatic class what
we'll do is we'll just say set timeout
we'll run a function
we'll say the function will run after
two seconds and this will be the
function that removes the animation done
here was where we will add the animation
so we'll just copy this
pissed it in here so what we're going to
do is just copy this and we'll just
delete this element variable
and we'll just paste in the actual
jQuery targeting the tax box like that
and then we'll just delete this my
sleeve for now and then finally what
we'll do is we'll just scroll up and
we'll delete the animation from here now
if we run this we type in anything or we
just leave a blank we'll get an invalid
response forum or a API so now if I
click on login you can see the login
button just shook now if I click it
again it won't shake so what we have to
do is use our timeout method and we'll
just paste in the code up here it's very
very similar we just delete my sleeve
the lay down
and replace with that so now if we just
run this one more time click it we got
an error we click it again we get the
error again and see if we could get too
quickly it won't check again but after
two seconds it's ready to start shaking
again and then finally if I put in a
valid username which is verified and a
valid password click login now we got
our token returned to us and the tax box
doesn't check click it again Wiki every
time I click it we'll get a new token
return so that's it for this video don't
