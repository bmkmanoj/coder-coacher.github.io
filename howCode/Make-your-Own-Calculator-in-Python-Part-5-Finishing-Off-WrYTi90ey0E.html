finishing off our calculator we're going
to be allowing you to assign variables
retrieve variables and use variables in
your expressions so the way we do that
is we scroll up we can see that
assigning a variable we give it the
equals operator so we need to be able to
work with that in our run functions we
say if p 0 is equal to equals which
means we're assigning a variable so the
way we'll implement variables is we'll
create a global variable called and it's
going to be equal to a dictionary in
Python which is an associative array in
any other language and we're going to
just make it a global variable that we
can use in this functions with say
global and then what we'll do is we will
say and and we will pass it the key
which in this case is gonna be the
variables name which is p1 and then the
value is going to be the expression or
should I say the evaluated expression so
we said p1 is the key which is the
variables name and the variables value
is going to be equal to run p2 and what
I'll do is I will just print the
environment variable oh when we are
saying a variable so let's just run this
let's just say 1 plus 2 whoops
1 plus 2 that works and we'll say a is
equal to 10 and what you can see we've
just done is printed out the environment
which means that a is not equal to 10 if
I said B is equal to 100 now we have two
variables and they're both stored in our
dictionary now what we need to do is
retrieve the variables so the way we do
that is we scroll up again you can see
that retrieving a variable is when we
have the word var so in our table we'll
say LF p 0 is equal to var then we want
to retrieve the variables will return
and we will check it is P 1 so we will
say return and P 1 I will just run that
and we'll say a is equal to 10 I'll say
1 plus air is equal to 11 so what we've
done is retrieved that variable and
added it to one and printed the result
out but if I say 1 plus B which is a
variable that hasn't been assigned yet
and run that it crashes up
because there's a key error which means
the key doesn't exist so the variable
hasn't been assigned so the way we fix
that as we say if p1 which is the
variable name is not in n which is our
dictionary we just want to return
undeclared variable phoned I will say
else returned the variable from the from
the dictionary so we'll just run this
we'll say they get undeclared variable
find okay on the collect variable a is
equal to 10 we have it stored in the
environment we say and I we get 10
printed out and we're just gonna just
delete that because we don't want the
environment to be printed all the time
that's just for debugging so there we
have it there is our calculator created
if I just run it one more time with a 10
plus 5 times 9 divided by 2 that gives
us 32 point 5 just copy that and you can
see Google gives us the exact same
answer so there we have it our series
and I finished what we just learned is
we've learned how to create a lecture
how to create a parser I to create an
abstract syntax tree and how to walk the
tree and execute the program which is
essentially what our calculator is it's
a mini interpreter that executes really
small programs that calculate numbers so
hopefully we'll be expanding on this in
the future will be creating hopefully
fully fledged programming language using
similar methods to this but that's it
for this series don't forget to Like
comment favorite and subscribe and I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
