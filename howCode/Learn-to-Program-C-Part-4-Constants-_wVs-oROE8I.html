learning about constant variables in C
so what constant means is the value
doesn't change so antsy a constant is
just a variable whose value is defined
at the beginning of the program and
doesn't change throughout the program so
C is a couple of ways to define a
constant slope here I can create a
constant using a preprocessor command I
can put a hash in here and then i use
the define keyword and then I give the
constant iniyum so i'm going to say my
constant and then i give it a value so i
can give it a value such as 10 or i can
give it a value like a test i am doing
here what i can do is i can say printf
you printed as a strainer print my
constant
a vice type GCC learned say oh learn and
I run this so you see we get tests
returned to us that's because we just
created a constant that is a string of
characters that we can use in our
program that will change another way to
define a constancy is just simply
defying as you would any other variable
let's just put a different variable in
here sleeve it for my and so another way
you can define a constant is seeing if
you type the Const keyword and then you
just occur like I you would any other
variables so say int test equals tan and
here i just type test and you will see
that whoops okay i'm trying to format as
a string sony me change this to a
decimal let's run this you see we got 10
a printed out to us standard convention
with Constance is to capitalize them so
that you can see straight away that it's
a constant so let's try and do that you
see we get the sim value returned to us
I know what I'm going to do is I'm going
to try and change the value of this
constant so i'm going to say test equals
20
and you can see now to read only
variable so it's not assignable so this
fails because I'm trying to assign a
value to a constant which is already
being assigned so that's it for this
