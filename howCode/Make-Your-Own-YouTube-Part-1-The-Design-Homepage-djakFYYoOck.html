you can see by the title of this video
what we're going to be doing is we're
going to starting off the new series I'm
making on YouTube style website from
scratch and as you can also see this
isn't an empty document and the reason
for that is because I went ahead and I
made the design ahead of time and this
PHP code is and just part of the design
so that certain elements change
depending on them the user's browser and
I'll explain more about that in a minute
so I go over to the website here you can
see I bought this menu and then I made
this myself ahead of time and tell me
about an hour to and I tested it in
Internet Explorer Firefox Google Chrome
Safari and opera and as you can see this
is just what it is now when you click on
the search box the whole menu highlights
and they change the color of the
underline changes and now we can type in
our search box so this is going to be
free download in the description so that
we don't have to waste time making it in
the tutorials but I made this 100%
myself so we don't need to worry about
any copyright or anything because I made
it so now I'm going to go into this
folder and the video box folder and as
you can see I have a folder called CSS
and this is where that PHP code comes
into play because as you can see there's
three folders one for WebKit one for
Internet Explorer and one for Firefox
and the reason for this is because
browsers all run on things called
engines and and that's how they display
pages on the Internet and that's why
Internet Explorer displays pages
definitely to Google Chrome and Firefox
and so as its own engine as well so as
Safari and opera on the Google Chrome
use WebKit Internet Explorer uses its
own and Firefox uses its own so that's
why I need to style sheets for every
single one and for each browser so that
everything display is the same because
there we need to change some of it and
each style sheet and that's one of the
reasons I did it
out of time because it would take a
while to make sure that it all worked
but as you can see we have a starship
command block and menu lighter and then
as we have the same input in all the
folders the only difference is the style
sheets are slightly different so it
still gives us the same end result in
every browser it looks like this but the
way we do it in certain browsers just
different ok so the next I'm going to
talk about before we get into the can
before we actually start writing some
code is how this search box actually
makes the whole thing light up and
that's one of that's why we have menu
black and menu lighter because when it's
just whenever we click on the search box
it just changes the stylesheet thought
the menu uses so I just changed the
style sheet to make the colors a bit
lighter and then make the underline
lighter instead of green so this is I'm
just going to start at the very top so
this is just a PHP function called cap
browser it's I didn't make it I just got
off the PHP web site and what it does is
it just like figures out which brought
you the user has and all I did was use
some simple if statements so if browser
equals Google Chrome or if browser it
goes Apple Safari then we give them the
style sheet with a that's in the WebKit
folder for the immanuel act because
that's the first thing that people and
see when they go on our web site there
the first time they load up this in
block menu and I did that for all of
them and if we go on down you can see
here it says um blur menu block and then
if we go over a bit I on focus menu or a
swap menu which is just a JavaScript
function it's really simple it's in this
file here so this is the JavaScript
function it just gets the menu element
and sets the href attribute to whatever
is put in whatever is given in the
function so whatever parameter we give
the function is set to the hitch ref
attribute which is way up here but
tomorrow for a minute so as you can see
it says on focus and then what that
means is on focus is just when the user
clicks on it so when the search box is
on focus we change the style sheet to
the lighter one and then on blur just
means it's just basically whatever the
focus goes away so whatever and they all
click away from the menu it goes back to
the black one and that's how it works so
that's it for the introduction and let's
get started with some real code so what
I'm going to do first is I'm just going
to copy this function to a separate file
so I'm just going to click ctrl X and
then you can actually just delete all
this to get all together so I'm going to
make a new file save it as functions.php
so I'll go back to video box go to R go
to includes well that's because I was
making this website are this Magne from
my actual creative code website and then
I decided I'm going to use it for this
series as well just get me making a
sapper one so that's flattest four so I
go to I just create oh sorry I'll just
create a file called functions dot PHP
create some PHP tags make a comment
maybe say the video box functions file
and then just paste the function in so
there it's out of the way then on the
index page we just have to include it so
include the dot forward slash just means
lock in the same folder I'm in so I'm
already in the video box folder so just
means stay in that folder yes if I then
we go to the includes folder and then we
go to functions PHP whoops okay so now
we've included the functions file we
shouldn't see any change so let's just
let that load
so as you can see that didn't change
that's it worked we've included it
separately on the reason for that is
because we're going to create a new
function in a minute so what I'm going
to do is say on both so a ballot point
basically and then we're going to set
PHP now we're going to echo the app page
title function which is a function we
haven't created yet but we're going to
do a value and I'm just going to give it
a title of I share your videos with the
to share your videos oops so share your
videos with the world is going to be the
title them of our page on the page title
function is a function that hasn't been
created yet so we're going to create
that now so let's so let's create that
function now so we're just going to set
function age underscore title we're
going to give it a variable of page
title and then we're just going to say
down here return page title so what this
does is inside the page title function
whatever parameter we gives it is stored
or whatever parameters would give it a
stored in the page title variable and
then underneath we're just returning the
page title variable returning is just
basically a bit like printing so what
this will do is well I'll show you so
now we've a code and the result of the
page title function this is what we
should see so it says video box another
ballot point and then share your videos
with the world which is what we give our
it's what we fed into our function here
so a that means it's working and now
that we've done that I'm going to show
you the logo I created for this
tutorials so I'm images then here's just
an icon of the logo I created and yes it
resembles the iOS YouTube app but I made
myself from scratch I didn't thought of
it anymore so
for tutorial purposes it should be fine
and it's for educational use as well I
mean and I made myself so there
shouldn't be any problems with it but
the only thing is if you were using this
as a serious video website you would
probably want to change that to your own
icon but we won't get in trouble for
using it and these videos are and for me
putting it in this source code because I
made myself so that means it's fine so
we're going to go down here on the index
page and here's all the manual things
and actually what we're going to do
first we're going to create a new file
save it in the includes file our folder
and call it header.php and I'm just
going to copy all of the header stuff
because it's getting a bit too
complicated the moment so we're just
going to copy down to there and click
control X and then we're going to save
it in the header file so all these
breaks are just so that we have a scroll
bar we can scroll to run they're not
actually required and they're not
actually important so I'm going to say
it just include it so includes slash pad
or dot PHP and so what we're going to do
at the same time we're just going to
copy all this and we're going to create
a new file I call it photo dot PHP now
we're just going to paste it in I'm
going to do the same thing as we did up
here you can actually get rid of all
these the moment so what we're going to
do is just paste that in there so we
should
see any change except that box just
disappear so now that bar is gone and we
should we shouldn't see any change in
the actual website so what I'm going to
do now is I'm just going to open the
site's our site style dot CSS file I'm
going to create a div called
welcome div background color it's going
to be yeah CCC CCC all right let's try
okay we'll do that
um the width is going to be any percent
margins are going to be zero from the
top on an auto from the right thumb mm
zero on the bottom an auto from the left
so I should Center it kind of a border
on the edge one pixel solid six six six
six six six and then we're just going to
create a welcome div so div class is
just going to be welcome Dave and then
in here we're just going to say welcome
to see what it looks like
so we're for some reason that didn't
show up whoops some reason I didn't show
up crack so we can have a look why so if
we go to site style dot CSS welcome you
do is there let me see what we did wrong
okay we spell welcome wrong so I'm just
going to paste in exactly and then go
back so here's our div it Sam may be a
bit too dark so we're just going to go
into the side style and then change it
to a lighter color so nine nine
nine nine nine and then let's just see
what that looks like it's darker okay
let's try it
f1f1f1 for the actual box so it's a
slightly lighter or a slightly dark
white so then we're just going to change
this to let's see cccccc let's try it
out so that looks better
we're also going to say we're actually
going to set the margin at the top to be
10 pixels and then just it shouldn't
whoops let's say a potting 10 pixels ah
- so let's just give us a potting on the
top of 10 pixels all right my zero so
then just see nine okay something's a
bit wrong so the simplest thing we can
do here is actually just put a paragraph
tag in there so what I'll do is I'll am
just put some red tags in here so three
break tags should do it
and there we have a slight gap now so I
actually don't like the border on it so
we'll just set border none' okay
and then I don't know adding five pixels
everywhere okay so that looks better so
I'm not what we're going to do is we are
going to again our icons so we'll just
say image source the da four slash just
means luck in the a directory in which
is
video box and then looking the images
folder and then look for venue box icon
dot PNG so there's our icon okay so I
know what we'll do but I got rid of
these break tags and then what we'll do
is we will give it a border on the
bottom one pixel solid and then cccccc
so okay okay that looks a bit better so
then we'll just get a hitch to down and
beside it
welcome to video box so we need to
change that in the CSS so in here we'll
just go down here and say h2
font-family:arial helvetica sans-serif
and then font weight is going to be
that's that 200 ok so that's refresh
this 9 yeah maybe a bit bigger so set
font size 16 pixels hmm okay let's try
20 pixels and then what we'll do is
we'll actually decrease the font with
count then do it again so let's just
leave that at 200 and then we'll say
display:inline
and then whoops and then we'll just say
padding top ten pixels so we'll say is
um float:right then what this will do is
just put it up here and then what we'll
say is will actually increase these
sides with the gray box to see if we go
up eight hundred and thirty which is the
size I give it for the wrapper so in 30
pixels so what you have to adjust the
buck fill the screen maybe actually bit
less okay so that looks about right and
then we're just going to go underneath
get a paragraph tag welcome to video box
the I don't know only choice or I don't
know the best way to share your views
online let's do something like that and
let's just create an inline CSS style um
let's just say float:right
text-align:left and now we just have to
put some space in
okay and then just to fill space I'm
just gonna just paste it in a few times
okay didn't work I think this just has
to be one big set all right one sentence
not ended okay let me see okay so I
thought of a better way to do this so
what we're going to do is just get the
image and paste it in here and that did
not work so we're just going to paste
the image on top of all that so as you
can see the image kind of overhangs a
bit and I think that looks a bit a bit
better than it did before so we're
actually going to get rid of this eh -
maybe I will just put a few breaks in so
what we can actually do is just putting
h2 in we can just put a space in it so
I'm them ESP gives us just an empty one
and then we can just put a break in here
so there we have it it looks a bit
better and I mean you can change the
look of that if you want so I'm afraid
that's it for this video because it's
just basically an introduction sort of
to the actual code of the website and in
the next video will probably be
registering users and things like that
so thanks for watching and don't forget
to comment like subscribe and I'll see
you next time oh and and the next video
will actually most likely be read
alright logging and things that got not
actually registering because I like to
do the logins first so I'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
