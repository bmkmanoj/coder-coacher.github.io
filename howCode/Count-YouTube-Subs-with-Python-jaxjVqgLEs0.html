how to create a really simple Python
script that when we enter in that
somebody's YouTube username will return
to us the number of subscribers of that
channel has so the script is called sub
stop hi and if I just run that now it
says add row' username if I enter the
username for hi code that's the username
that the hi code channel was created
under if I hit enter you can see it says
that that channel has 30 3036
subscribers and you can see that a
format of the number properly and all we
had to do was provide the username if I
was to run it again and I was a type in
PewDiePie and I hit enter you can see it
returns that he is 57 million
subscribers but it also formats the
number property so it's a lot easier to
read so this is really easy to set up so
for this to work we're going to use
YouTube's data API so together to work
we have to create an API key and to do
that what we're going to do is we're
going to go to consult at
developers.google.com/live and pas and
we're going to create a credential we're
gonna create an API key and you can see
that's just created a new key for me
because I already have one I'm just
gonna delete that one and for this API
key to work what we have to do is we
have to go to the library and we scroll
down and we go to YouTube data API and
we have to enable up so once we enable
that we generate our API key we should
be good to go so here's the Python
script it's really really simple so
we're not using an SDK or anything like
that we're just gonna use Python to send
an HTTP request to Google and they're
going to tell us the number of
subscribers so what we do is we import
URL live chat request and that's the
library that lets us send requests then
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
import JSON so the first thing we do is
we title user to enter a username and we
use pythons input function to tell the
user that to get input from the terminal
and store the value that we type in the
name variable then what we do is we
store the API key and a variable and
then all we have to do is we use URL Lib
request URL open and we pass the URL of
Google's YouTube API so what we do is we
pass in this URL and we pass it a
special parameter called part and we set
that equal to statistics that tells
Google to return this section in the
response and this tells us the view
current the subscriber current the video
current and stuff like that so you can
see we want the subscriber current so
after we've done that what we do is we
also said that we want to get the
subscriber current for a particular user
so you can see it says for username and
we pass in the username
we asked for at the beginning that what
we do is we specify our API key by
adding another parameter called key and
it's going to be equal to our API key
then what we do is we convert the
response to a string that's what the dot
read method does then what we do is we
say our number of subscribers is equal
to our data which is the string that we
downloaded from Google's so it's just
going to be this exact string here what
we do is we convert that JSON string to
a Python dictionary that's what JSON
that loads does and that allows us to
access it like we would a regular Python
dictionary so we can access the items
element in the JSON just by using
pythons array operator and accessing the
data using the items key so within items
you can see it's an array you can see
this square bracket here and within
items there's one item so we access that
item using the 0th index because it's
the first item and it's the fan it's the
only item in the response then you can
see within that item there's a
statistics element so we access that and
then within statistics there's a
subscriber count which we access just by
using the word subscriber count
so once we've done that the number of
subscribers will be stored as a string
in subs then what we do is we print it
out so we say whoever is high code has a
certain number of subscribers then we
say the word subscribers and we print
out this emoji just because we can
so all this section does is we convert
the subs
to an integer and then because it's an
integer we can format it using the dot
format method all this format method
does is it adds the commas into the
number so if it's a thousand it's gonna
have 1 comma 0 0 0 as opposed to if it
was just one big long number and that's
all we have to do so if I just run it
one more time you can see it says
creative code has 33,000 and 36
subscribers so that's it for this video
