what we're going to be learning about is
dictionaries in Python so what a
dictionary is is it's basically a
container that can a store any type of
Python object within it
so the best way to assure it is to
basically R me to explain it especially
he'll show it so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a variable called
hello it's just a random variable
doesn't matter what it's called and I'm
going to set that equal to our
dictionary so it's kind of similar to an
associative array in PHP so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna put two curly
brackets here and then insider is what
we put our information so let's say we
want to create an item in our dictionary
called test I gotta put two coats in I'm
gonna say test but it's not as simple as
it's not simple enough just to do that
we have to put in a colon and then we
have to specify the value of test which
in this case could be a string which is
hello world and I'm gonna hit enter so
now if I type in hello and just hit
enter it returns the whole dictionary
with all the values and the keys so this
word test is called the key and then the
value is hello world so I could do
something like Hello which means I'm
accessing the dictionary because I'm
using the Hello variable and I put two
square brackets in and then I put in the
word test so this means I'm using I'm
going to the hallo dictionary and I'm
going to use the Tecla test case you're
access to have a world value so I'm
basically just locking up the value in
the dictionary so I hit enter it says
hello world we can also add new items to
a dictionary so we could say hello and
then we've got a square bracket and we
put the name or the key of the new value
so this is just gonna say Frances is the
key and we're gonna set it equal to the
value so I'm just gonna set it equal to
99 just and I'm gonna hit enter so now
if we type in hello again it returns the
the new dictionary with well it's the
same dictionary but it returns the
dictionary with a value I just started
so now if I type in hello
in the word fascist because that's the
key it will return 99 if but it doesn't
work the other way around survives the
time in hello 99 it doesn't return
Francis that's because it would think 99
was a key and it would try to lock up
the dictionary finding are looking for
99 through its keys and I wouldn't find
it because the only keys are test and
Frances so what we can also do is we can
completely replace the dictionary so if
I said at hello and then I just
reassigned the variable the whole
dictionary will disappear so I could say
I don't know how cool is the key I must
set the value to high cool org so now if
I type in hello as you can see what we
did up here is completely disarmed and
completely gone and Python has got rid
of it and replaced it with this new
dictionary so what we can also do is we
can completely remove the dictionary
just empty a completely and what we do
there is we just say hello doc clear the
clear method will completely remove
everything within the curly brackets so
now if I type in hello again as you can
see it's empty because the dictionary
has been wiped
so I'm just gonna reassign or Ameen
recreate the dictionary ah now to add
some values to it so I can show you the
next time so I'm gonna say test I'm
gonna set that equal to ten ten I'm
gonna put a comma and then I'm gonna put
in another element which I'm gonna say
is high code and I'm gonna set that
equal to hyper org and I'm gonna put in
another key and I'm gonna say on YouTube
and I'll set that equal to a hundred or
something I don't know so that we have
three different sort of items at our
dictionary and I'm just gonna hit enter
and that will add them to our dictionary
so much I've been hello we've got the
three items in the dictionary now so
what I'm gonna show you is how to delete
an item so we can delete an item from a
Python dictionary by if I mean if we
know it's K so it's a deleted item we
use the D our key word and we just put
in the word hello which is the
dictionary you want to delete the key
from or we delete the item from then we
put in two square brackets so instead of
just accessing it like we did up here we
do the exact same thing we just put in
the key so I'm gonna put it in test and
this will remove the test item so if I
hit enter now and then I type in hello
again I shouldn't say no hello only has
two items in the dictionary
so another method we can use is we can
say hello dot
keys and the keys method will return a
list of all the keys and our dictionary
was you can see we have two keys if I
say hello the list that will give us a
list of all the whoops
oops it's not hello Darla says hello dot
items so if I use the items method I can
hit enter and it will return the key
followed by the item and then the key
followed by the item for the two items
in our dictionary if I type in hello dot
values it returns a list of the values
in our dictionary so that's it for this
