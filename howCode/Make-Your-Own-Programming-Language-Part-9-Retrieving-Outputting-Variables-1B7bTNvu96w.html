is we're going to be allowing variables
to be assigned as numbers expert and
expression and if we have time we'll be
printing out that variables will be
allowing you to it will do something
like print oops
very little name and then the variable
would print out to the screen also if
you're creating this yourself and you
want to use different sort of characters
to denote a variable name you can just
change it yourself in the lexer you can
just go up here and where we chose a
dollar sign all you have to do is change
that to you know if you wanted i'm % you
can use that or you wanted any other
side and you could use that to determine
a variable but yeah but i chose to
follow PHP and and use a dollar sign so
what I'm gonna do first is I'm going to
just say variable I'll set it equal to
the number 10 and now we're going to do
in the parse section is I'm going to
create an or so as you can see up here
we have 4 and then we have expression or
number or string I'm going to do the
same thing and say over and num
or expression so if it's a we're gonna
just copy all this action again not all
of it actually just this part of it and
cut this
and we'll store it in here and then put
this in here
the only difference with expressions is
we want to evaluate the expressions
first so what I want to do is you just
want to piece this in here but before
that what I want to say is eval let's
just look up here it says of all
expressions we'll do that to expression
this will evaluate it to a number and
then assign that number to the variable
name and let's go and run this first we
should get nothing or we should just get
this symbol table returned or printed to
us but we can get an error so that means
there's either something wrong in the
lecture or something wrong in the parser
so first thing we'll do is we just go up
here and return print tokens I will
actually return nothing and this way
returning an empty string will tell us
whether the program is freezing after
the tokens or before the tocar before
all tokens been parsed so you can see if
this shows we're parsing the tokens
correctly so it's something in the
parser that's failing
so I'll just return that I'll return
tokens again I don't know this comment
is out because we know it's not
something wrong with the lexer it's
something wrong with the posture and I
can already guess where it is the reason
is something wrong is because here what
we did was we said we use we got the
word string and we did that by going
here and getting the first six
characters but if we go over here we can
see num isn't six characters long what's
only three cards is long so we need to
get the first three characters and for
exp are we're gonna get the first four
characters so as you can see
an anti symbol table and the reason for
that is okay the reason for that is we
actually want to do num plus 2 and
numbers 2 or I plus 2 because the 1 this
is 0 this is 1 and this is 2 so it was
one is actually equals so we wanted to
be 2 and that's how we get the string
non-linear expr so we run that you can
see it stores the number 10 in a
variable what I'm going to do now is I'm
going to put in an expression
okay it says if I'll expression takes
one okay the reason that didn't work is
we're giving it two parameters and it
only takes one and that means we need to
take out this first parameter and we
want to put this first parameter here
and then comma and then this will be the
second parameter not only that we want
to get rid of the first five characters
because the first five characters of the
exp are of the ASPR token is the word is
the latter's expr : as you see here okay
you can't actually see it but the first
five characters are exp our token are
exp r : which is the identifier for the
tokens so we want to get rid of that and
just pass it the numbers itself which if
we get rid of the first five characters
then all we're left with is the actual
expression which in this case is 10 plus
4 and then we're passing not to eval
expression so if we run this you can see
it gives us 14 but we want to not just
say 14 we want to send num so I'm I'm
gonna pass it the string num and then
I'll say plus X or plus the expression
this way the whoops I wasn't dumb : this
way the token when assigned will have
the correct value okay oops that was my
god so what we want to do is we want to
say and num : and then just this string
so we want to pen this string to the
expression when it's evaluated and the
way we're going to do that we need the
STR function
and that's going to convert it to a
string force and this way we can append
this num : part of the token on and this
way our variable we are we can a keep
track of the variables type so I can see
knots as number 14 if I give it you know
another expression say this oops and run
that you can see it gives us the correct
number so not only do want to be able to
assign variables we want to be able to
you know retrieve the value of them we
want to be able to print them so I'm
going to be able to type of print and
say variable and get the variable value
back from the dictionary the way we do
that is we go up here and we just want
to copy the this section of the parser
again the next is fine because the lexer
doesn't take the order of the tokens
into account it just identifies them and
stores them in the tokens the tokens a
list so for example if I go up here and
just print up you'll see the lexer
doesn't care just ignore the error at
the end but just you can see here that
laxer doesn't care about anything other
than okay that actually does it seems to
after the print not be able to identify
the variable name which is the dollar
sign because we did a bit of debugging
and as you can see there's nothing wrong
the print statement this is the actual
token that we're trying to identify and
obviously we haven't this token doesn't
exist so what we actually want to do is
wanna come in here gonna say if 2 equals
less sound or 2 greater than greater
state suppose 0 bar started actually a
better way to do that we're just gonna
get rid of this and we can put it down
in this one here so we'll say if I'd
token equals last sound or
two evils greater than then we'll say
taupe equals not art Oh giggles nothing
is gonna race at it because that's the
end of the token we want to screw up
here and say just copy this copy that
actually just part two we want to go or
is it here and just paste it in and we
can get rid of that actually because we
have a time here so that should be it
let's just run this I mean when I
expected an indented block with 955 so
okay we need to push this in
so I
see now were able to get the variable
name after the print so what come down
here and we want to select this and just
paste it in I'm going to change that to
var and change that to three we want to
come in here and just say var so
basically we're just repeating ourselves
over and over just with changing this to
var and changing this from do print
instead of do print Tokai or whatever we
want to do is want to print we want to
get the variable first we'll actually
say I get a variable it doesn't
following them to do whatever they do si
not the do print we're just going to
call it cat because we're retrieving a
value so I'll say get variable and we're
going to do all right we're gonna look
up the variable name based on where is
it
var which is tokes I plus 1 so we're
gonna give this tokes I plus one to the
gap variable function which will create
an eye and it's just going to like
retrieve the variable from a symbol
table if it exists so we'll say I've
volume we have a variable name and we're
going to do is we're going to just do an
if statement say if and a var name in
symbols then we'll just set print that
true or else print on the defined
variable so let's run this so we're
getting this none type error because
basically we're not returning anything
from the function so we're trying to
print and the word none because in the
earlier videos I showed you if a
function doesn't return anything then it
just basically returns none on none and
isn't something we can if we go up to
the do print you can see that were you
know checking if it's
we can't you know minute we can't I get
the first certain number of characters
from the non object so where it's
feeling that's why it's messed up so we
can go up here and we can just return we
can actually say if the variables found
returned Varney and our site will
actually want us as symbols of our name
and then as we just want to return
undefined variable the reason we're
getting this is we just need to set this
to an Aleph because this way this little
only one of these are run at a time so
we run that you can see for some reason
it's giving us undefined variable so the
reason this is undefined is because as
you can see here the key is a dollar
sign variable but what we're actually
giving it is var : dollar sign variable
so we just need to save our name equals
var name equals Varney and and then we
just want to get the fur the we want to
ignore the first four characters
basically so we run this annoyed you can
see it prints true and then it prints 14
so we know that works we can get rid of
true so I'll say variable error
undefined variable and run this line and
we get rid of debugging stuff so get rid
of the print tokens and einie I get rid
of the print symbols um
printed this I'll run this now you can
see it gives us 14 and that's exactly
what we assign the result of this
calculation which is 14 to the variable
named variable and we print that done
here so say for example I resize the
variable so I said variable I is a
string that's what I call it as my my
name and then I'd print the variable
again
and as you can see variable up here is
now 14 and variable down here is Francis
and this is a number and this is a
string so we can change the type of our
variables so that's it for this video
