going to be doing is we're gonna be
uploading videos to our website because
that's sort of what the websites binary
I'm like siege on that yet so we're
gonna do that today
so the first thing we need to know
before we get started is the size of the
video is one upload on youtube the limit
is like two gigabytes in size on by
default PHP as a limit as well so we
need to change that limit if it's
alright if it already doesn't suit our
needs and squares if the PHP limit is
set I don't know for example say 10
megabytes and you try to upload 11
megabyte video it just won't work
whenever ik has uploaded 10 megabytes
the upload elem time right so there's
two ways to do it
there's by editing the PHP that ini file
and there's another way which is HT
access the first one is more recommended
and preferred apparently
but it involved it requires you have
access to the PHP dot ini file and if
you're on a virtual private server or a
dedicated server you should have this
but if you're on a shared hosting
alright if you're on shared hosting you
might not have it so that's why you
would need HT access so I'm going to
show you how to do both so the first
thing we need to do is we need to find
the php.ini file and i've already find
it but i'm gonna show you where it is so
ok so you can see here we go here whoops
it says local disk C ok I'll just go to
that actually um here is the axon folder
so this is my C Drive this is xampp and
if we go inside a comp there's a folder
in here called PHP so we click on that
on in here we just type in PHP on here
it says PHP and then it says
configuration settings so if we check
that's the right one we can check that
by going to properties and I'll open the
properties of the file and as you can
see it says configuration settings
and then the file extension is dot ini
so this is the PHP dot ini file and you
just open that up now you can see it's
about just over halfway or just under
halfway through the page we find max or
out upload max file size and the moment
this is the default I'm changed anything
so by default when you install xampp
it's a 128 megabytes but if you're
having trouble finding this it's really
simple all you have to do is if you have
a text editor like context you can press
ctrl F then you can just type in upload
oops
oh yeah we have to go up so if we go to
the top of the file and we just try
typing control I have only type in
uploaded click find it says file uploads
and here we can just scroll down a bit
oops it says file uploads and actually
here it is here so you can change this
to whatever you want you Neve it you can
leave it at the default which is 128
megabytes you could reduce it to 64
megabytes or whatever it doesn't matter
that's just this is the limit of the
size of the video you'll be able to
upload and if you don't have access to
your PHP dot ini file what you can do is
you can go to htaccess file and you can
go down you can just type in PHP
underscore volume' upload max file size
and then you can put them when you want
so you could say 5 and with me 5
megabytes which wouldn't be very good so
I'm gonna leave put that to 128 but
actually I can get rid of this because
I'm the PHP dot ini file already sat 128
megabytes so basically I can get rid of
this but if you don't have access to
your PHP dot ini file you'll have to use
this method so once you've done that
you've changed your locks upload size to
whatever you want for your videos we're
ready to get started so as you can see
here I have a file called upload dot PHP
and if we go to in the browser
we actually need to include the header
so let's do that
so it's include adds include and it's
includes forward slash header.php so now
if we just refresh we can see we've got
our title loaded so that means the
Hatters probably been included correctly
so here's our upload dot PHP page so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna steal
some code from some of the other pages
we've used so I'm gonna go to open and
we can go to the upload image file we
can just copy all this the whole thing
really I'll just paste it in here so
we're going to just say upload a video
and obvious when you change this to
upload dot PHP because it's a self
submitting form we can leave that as
multi-part form data because it's still
an it's not like text and stuff it's
submitting it's an image or it's a video
upload your image we just change this to
upload your video and change this to
just upload so we're to scroll to the
top and we have here it says if it's at
channel pick so okay what that is is
that's just this here so it says if
there's a file that's being submitted
now we're going to change this to just
maybe video and copy it and put it up
here and swap these around so we're
gonna change chat okay well here's
another thing we can do we can press
ctrl laughs - whoops new - or is it edit
replace we can replace every instance of
channel underscore fake with video you
can might not be able do the scenario
text editor but that's why it's good off
something like contacts so we're just
gonna click replace all not
saves us a lot of time I'm trying to
replace it so we're gonna do now is we
can remove some of these options because
the only sort of dummy video type we're
gonna be accepting is mp4 for maximum
compatibility so we'll get rid of that
so that's all we've got and that's all
we're accepting so we're going to type
in and video slash mp4 and we're going
to upload it to data users and then
videos and we'll get rid of this so it's
video slash random directory and then
video name okay that's good we can just
create that folder line so if we go to
the video box and directory we go to
data users we create a new folder so
we've got our videos folder we're just
gonna double click inside of it you can
see it's empty so what we're gonna do is
were actually that's where we're going
to be uploading it to so I'm just going
to change this to video exists so we're
going to change we're just really
changing things around to suit the video
we're going to change that all right
actually comment that out and we're just
gonna change image to video okay um so
we need to change this as well so videos
and I get rid of the icons folder on
below here okay this code looks
redundant so we cannot get rid of it
let's try it so let's just refresh the
page okay so we've got an error on line
5 so let's go up to 9 5 here it is if a
set files ok so ok so what we've done we
just left art apparatus a at the end
okay so now if we go and refresh so look
underneath everything yeah we can get
rid of that okay so what just refreshed
it together do that so here we have it
refreshed and we got rid of that so what
I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna upload a
video nah okay so if we go to choose
file and we click on the test video I
made it's only 105 kilobytes and it's
uploading to the same computer as it's
on so it should be very very fast to
upload so there it is it says the videos
uploaded successfully and if we come
down here we can see in our videos
folder we have a video file that has a
really weird name and that's what we
wanted so now we cannot copy that hmm
actually we don't need to we can just go
here to /data /nostart
that's actually then it's in users I'm
editing videos and here's our video and
we can prove that it's uploaded I worked
six works successfully we click on it
the video will start playing in our
browser so it's a really bad quality and
just a really simple video just to show
that we could get it uploaded so it just
says this is a test video and then Smyly
this that's only 12 or 11 seconds long
so but this proves that our a file
upload is working so what we can do now
is we're going to just very quickly okay
so what I was going to do is I was gonna
actually finish the video upload and
associated with the user who uploaded it
and store the video and a database and
things but I want to go with that I want
to go over that very in-depth so I will
actually be doing that in the next video
so in the next video what we'll be doing
is we'll be doing that stuff with the
database and we're also doing some
really cool stuff within the five
hashing to check if the video is I had a
check of the video has already been
uploaded before so if the video has
already been uploaded we can store the
md5 hash for it in database and we can
check it every time we upload a video
and if the video has been uploaded we'll
know that someone is trying to copy
someone else and they'll have to change
the video or get rid of it well that's
what we're doing next time so I hope you
enjoyed the video don't forget to Like
comment favorite unsubscribe and well

forget to Like comment favorite and

will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
