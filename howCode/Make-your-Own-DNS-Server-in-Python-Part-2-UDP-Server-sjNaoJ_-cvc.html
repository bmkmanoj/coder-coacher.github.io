start implementing our DNS server so
here I have what's called an RFC which
is called a request for comments this
was written in 1987 and this is the
actual document that describes the
implementation of the DNS protocol you
don't have to read it to follow this
series but there are a couple of things
I'm just gonna mention first so
specifically this is what I wanted to
mention if you want to send data over
the internet there's two ways you can do
it can use TCP connections to send data
over the Internet or you can use UDP UDP
is a connectionless protocol and TCP
uses connections TCP has more overhead
than UDP so it's useful when you're
sending a large amount of data because
TCP can ensure that every single bit
will get to the actual destination UDP
can't guarantee that every pocket will
get to its correct destination but for
things like DNS UDP is actually quite
useful
lots of DNS servers don't actually
implement UDP they just implement TCP
but what we're gonna be doing is using
UDP the actual DNS specification says if
your DNS response or request is less
than or equal to 512 octants which is
just a byte it's an octet is it bits so
512 bytes is really what this means so
essentially if your request is less than
512 bytes we're gonna use UDP because
it's quicker and it has less overhead
UDP just involves sending a packet to a
destination and you don't know if it got
there or not but if the destination is
listening for the packet it will receive
it and it can send something back to you
that's what we're gonna use to create
our DNS server the actual DNS
specification says if your DNS query or
response is 512 bytes or less to stand
it using UDP for this reason and if it's
more than that it wants you to send it
using TCP to keep things simple we're
not going to be checking the size of
messages and things like that we're just
gonna send them over UDP and we're just
going to assume they're 512 bytes or
less so without a mind what we need to
do is create a UDP server essentially so
we're gonna go to our text editor and in
Python the way you create a connection
using TCP or UDP is you use the socket
library so we're going to say import
socket and then we're going to define a
couple of variables the first one is
going to be port which is going to be
equal to 53
because DNS operates on port 53 by
default and that's what we want to
operate on because if we try to send our
request using Digg and to our server if
we're not on port 53 which is what Digg
is gonna think we're on it's not going
to know where to send the request to
because it's gonna be sanding a UDP
packet to port 53 on our server and if
our servers not listening on port 53
it's no it has no way of knowing whether
or not a packet was sent so it can't
respond and add to the DNS query next
really creative area called IP and it's
gonna be equal to one two seven zero dot
zero dot one and that's just the IP
address of the loopback which is
essentially my computer's IP address to
talk to itself the next thing we need to
do is create our socket object so we're
going to call it sock and we're gonna
say sock is equal to socket don't sock
it and right now if we try to run this
it's not gonna work we need to provide
the socket method with a couple of
variables
the first one is socket dot AF
underscore eye net so what that means is
it means we want to sand our data using
ipv4 we can use ipv6 as well but by
default we're gonna be using ipv4 to
keep things simple we've one more
parameter to give song which is socket
dot sock underscore D Gramm sock
underscore D Graham tells python we want
to use UDP instead of TCP next one
assess sock dot bind to use sock top
bind we say IP import to provide it with
the IP address and the port we want to
bind to but if I run this we're gonna
get an error because bind takes one
parameter not two so for some reason we
have to surround these in brackets to
create a topple which is essentially one
parameter with two parameters inside it
I've no idea why they make you do that
but that's what we have to do and don't
hear what we want to do is create an
infinite loop that will just keep the
program running listening for requests
so we say wild one which means the loop
will last forever and we're gonna say
data comma address which is EDD R is
equal to sock our ACV from and here we
want to say a 512 which means 512 bytes
and if we go back to the web page you
can see they want 512 octet or less so
the reason we have data comma address is
because this sock dot received from
method returns a tuple and the first
item
his data and the second is the address
that it got it from and here what we're
gonna do is just print data so let's
just run this let's just close out of
that so we're just going to run this put
in the password because we want to use
port 53 which means we have to have the
administrator permissions let's just hit
enter okay we have a syntax error whoops
so there should be a string let's run
this again so now our server is running
there's no I put yet because it hasn't
got any data so let's just run this
again and you can see the Digg command
has just frozen because we haven't
actually sent at any put which means de
gifts is still expecting to receive some
iPod and as you can see dag is just
repeatedly sanding the request that's
why there's three of these now and it's
just timed out because it hasn't got a
response yet but as you can see here's
the three requests let's just close that
and these are the raw bytes themselves
some of them have been converted by the
terminal into their ASCII characters
which for example is this word hi code
these are raw bytes bytes by Python are
represented by backslash X and then some
hexadecimal number but if the terminal
can it tries to convert them into ASCII
characters and that's what it's done
here with high code and org and that's
what it's also done up here with the
tape and then the capital P that's not
actually what was sent back that just
means the terminal was able to convert
the byte into a character - I put on the
screen but the underlying date is
exactly the same so that's it for this
