doing is we're going to be learning how
to create our own programming language
the programming language is going to
create is going to be based on the basic
programming language as you can see here
in the Wikipedia page the reason for
this is because it's an easy language to
write interpreters for because each
instruction gets newline and things like
that so it's an easy one to write an
interpreter for it's only a small
language too so that's why we're going
to be basically off basic we're going to
be writing it in Python so since Python
itself is an interpreted language we're
going to be limited by the speed of
Python itself and so if we really care
by performance we write in some emic c++
because that's a compiled language so if
you want maybe I'll write I'll do a
tutorial series in C++ as well but for
now we're going use Python because it's
an easy language to create stuff in
because what we could do is we can
create in Python the wicked just ported
to C but also easy because we're going
to copy our Python code and change it to
C++ so if you don't know what basic is
this is the that we Wikipedia page about
basic if you just scroll down you can
read this if you want and here we have
the syntax we're going to be using this
to make sure we make it properly we're
not going to make a proper version of
basic that people would actually want to
use it's just going to be to learn how
to create an interpreter for a language
one notable thing we're going to change
is here we have numbers along the side
on the left-hand side of an instruction
what we're going to do is we're going to
get rid of those and we're just going to
have the instruction itself because
we're going to use line numbers instead
because as you can see here there's a
go-to statement and it says go to five
which means go to up here which is the
number five we're going to use line
numbers for that so we were saying go to
a we would say go to some line number of
the program so I hope this series sounds
interesting and I look forward to seeing
you in the first part of the series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
