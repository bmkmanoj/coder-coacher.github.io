about what a binary actually looks like
so in the last video I said about when
your files when you create a see project
you can have loads of different files
and I'm going to compile they'll get
compiled together in just single binary
so today I thought we'd take a look or
what a binary lock she looks like so
what I'm going to do is going to create
a simple binary I'm just going to print
oops hello one that's all I'm going to
print because it will be an easy thing
to find in the binary then what we're
going to do is run obviously compilot so
GCC learned at sea I shall learn and
we'll run it and you'll see we got hello
world at printed out to us so we're just
drag this in we get the opportunity by
Nuri so this is what a binary actually
looks like this is the contents of the
binary all the ones and zeros printed
out in hex format so these are actually
all just ones and zeros that's exactly
what a binary is is that this is just
formatted differently to make it easier
to read because it's actually a massive
file so to see what a binary actually
looks like I'm in a format that's
actually usable we need to use something
called a hex editor so I've got one here
called I hacks there's just a hex editor
I got for free on the mac app store
there's loads of free ones you can get
free ones for windows as well so just on
a free hacks editor and then open your
binary in it so the way we do that is
just click file open race and I'm just
going to open learn and let's just close
this one okay so here we opened the
binary and you can see on the on the
right hand side here we actually have
some readable text so if we just scroll
through this you can see here's our
string that we're printing out here's
how the world so if I go back to the
terminal I run this again you'll see
just how to world but if I go into the
hex editor and I change this to say
let's say
a poco hi code and you can see as well
and real time on the other side so you
can see whenever I select stuff on this
side this is what I'm selecting on this
side so this is the code for hello say
hello it will hold sea of this and we
run this and we get a segmentation fault
so the reason we got the segmentation
fault is it's probably hard to see it
first but the reason is because before a
string is printed out the size of the
string is also is prepared before so
even though we can't see it internally
in the computer it sees the size of the
string and then it knows how much memory
to allocate for that string when it
tries to do anything with it so what
I've just done is I've replaced this
with a string that's longer than the
original string which is what caused our
segmentation fault we see this and run
it will get a hello world but if I go
back to the hex editor and I change this
to say hello so if I change this to say
a hello
well the spell was wrong so i'll change
the our journey and see if this we will
get hello world with an e instead of an
r you see if we go into the hex editor
change the stockton world let's go
actually just change this whole string
so this is a lab and character string so
i'll just change this to francis space
MC and that is 11 characters too if we
will miss you see we have fridays MCN if
i try to back to the hex head and i put
another letter in you'll see we'll get
segmentation fault that's because the
size of the string is obviously too big
for the size it specified before the
string so if we wanted to add this extra
data we don't have to find the beginning
of the string here which is here we'd
have to replace this number with another
number that would let us have a longer
string but what I'm going to do is we
leave it there put this back to knit or
MCM run this again you'll see we get a
semi pop and the program runs so let's
just be a quick look at binaries and
where you can actually look at if we
change any of the ones and zeros if we
actually what we were doing and we
change them properly we could make the
binary do whatever we wanted you can do
this with any program in the computer
because any program your computer is a
binary file so you can modify any binary
file and make it do whatever you want so
long as you know what you're doing
otherwise you break it obviously but
thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
