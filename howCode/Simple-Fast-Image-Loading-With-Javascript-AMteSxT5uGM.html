how to do something really simple and
really easy for loading images in
JavaScript you can see here I have a
really big image it's seven megabytes in
size it's a royalty-free image you can
see it's here I'll put a link to this in
the description and what we're going to
be doing is we're gonna be learning how
to load this image in the background so
that we don't actually see it and we're
going to let it fade in from sort of a
blurred image whenever it's loaded in
the user can actually view it because if
i refresh now you can see this slows
down my page little time massively it
makes the page tick almost two seconds
to load and what we're going to be doing
is learning how to run it in the
background so the page really quickly so
the way we do that is I have two images
I have a big image on a small image and
the first thing we're going to do is
we're load-in the small image so if i
load in the small image now you can see
it takes well last time to load but it's
gone all fuzzy in order to hook 72
milliseconds to load I have caching
disabled which means this is downloading
from the Internet every single time and
you can see it's coming from haiku dogs
at github that I oh and then we have
small pic so we're going to use some
JavaScript what we're going to do is
we're going to go down here and create
the JavaScript code
so what we're going to do is we're going
to save our image is equal to document
images 0 because talking about images
gives us an Iraq contending every image
on the page I mean only want the first
image which is this one and we're
getting that with these 0s and now next
we want to get the big image which is
var big image is going to be equal to
document dot create element and we're
going to create a new image element and
then what we're going to do is we're
going to say a big image dot onload is
equal to a function so whatever this
image loads we're going to run this
function essentially and this function
is going to say image dot source which
is this image here which is our small
image source which is the source
attribute it's going to be equal to this
top source which is our big image so the
source is going to be overwritten with
these source of this big image which is
this one here and then now if I say a
big image dot source I pissed in this
URL here and then I refresh you can see
if we go to our HTML the image changed
when it loaded if i refresh again
you can see its small notches change to
big but if I go to Network you can see
it talk 1.9 2 seconds to load on if i
refresh you can see that this spinner
stays up here for ages so what we want
to do is check the user into thinking
the page load is quicker than it did so
to do that what I'm going to do is I'm
going to set set timeout which is a
special function in JavaScript that runs
after the page is loaded what I'm going
to do is go run a function and I'm going
to run it after one second and in here
in this function I'm going to copy that
I'm just going to run this line here
which downloads the image if i refresh
now you can see that it pays it away
quicker and then after a second you can
see that it started downloading the
image so if I change it to something
like 50 milliseconds which is such a
small amount of time the user is now
we're going to notice but if i refresh
now you can see the spinard is a bit
quicker and then we start downloading
the image to the user it looks like the
image downloaded quicker and if we
refresh again you can see there is the
fuzzy image and now it's going to change
to the clearer image but what we want to
do is one out a special blur effect so
that the smaller image is blurred and
then the bigger image sort of on blurs
it whenever it's downloaded so to do
that what I'll do is I create a CSS
class what I'm going to do is I'm going
to set top blur and I will say a filter
blur I will put a blur of something like
50 pixels so what I'll do here is I'll
say class equals blur and that way the
image will be blurred when it's small
and then if I scroll down here and when
we load the image what I'll do is I will
say image class name equals nothing so
that way we're deleting blur class which
will implode the image so now if i
refresh you can see the images are
blurred there it's loaded in there the
blur is probably a bit too big so if I
just right click on that I'm putting the
filter myself I put in 10 pixels and
then we can see the blur it's on 43
that's probably too much to put on say
10 pixels of blur and then finally what
we want to do is we want to automate it
so to automate it what we want to do is
simply say transition or one second you
can see it takes one second to blur and
observe the photo so what I'll do is
just copy that and we'll paste our
transition there and I actually will do
is copy and paste this and from blur
I'll just change it to new blur because
if we just delete the class on its own
it will transition and then we will
the effect so we want to change those to
cross name nobler now if we refresh you
can see it's blurred
and there it just on blurred and if we
increase the duration to for example
five seconds you can see it's starting
to slowly on the other photo we'll leave
it to maybe if we refresh one more time
once the image is loaded you can see it
blurs into focus and now we have the
clear image so that's it for this video
