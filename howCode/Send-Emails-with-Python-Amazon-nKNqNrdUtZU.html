learning how easy it is to send emails
using Python we don't even need to
download any external libraries we're
going to be using pythons built-in
library called SMTP Lib and we're not
going to be using Gmail to send the
emails we're going to be using Amazon
simple email service and it's designed
for bulk email sending so if you want to
create something like a mailing list I
was on simple email service is the place
to do it so the first thing you have to
do is create an Amazon Web Services a
card you want to go to Amazon simple
email service you want to go to identity
management and you want to go to email
addresses so these are the email
addresses that I can send from so to
send from an email I click verify new
email I answer the email I want to
verify Amazon will send me an email to
that address I click on that link this
and me and the email is verified so to
send an email you have to have an SMTP
server so to set that up
we're gonna go to SMTP settings and
we're gonna click create my SMTP
credentials so we can type something
into this box it doesn't matter what we
type in and we can click create an
Amazon has given us an SMTP username and
an SMTP password so now we're ready to
start sending emails so in Python we
want to import SMTP Lib so the first
thing we want to do is create a new
instance of the SMTP Lib class so we've
created a special SMTP object next we
say a stock connect and we want to
connect to the Amazon server so this is
the server name here and the port we're
gonna use is 587 and we choose 587
because you can see it's one of the
three available ports next we want to
encrypt our connection so we say s dot
start TLS and finally we can login know
so we say s start login we pass in our
username first and then our password so
next we're ready to send an email so we
say s and mail we give it the from
address which is going to be no reply at
home code org the to address is just
gonna be Francis in our code org and
finally the third parameter is the
message so I'm just going to call it
message so up here what we're gonna do
is we're going to create our message so
if we were just put in text here the
email will be sent but gmail will block
it because it's missing the required
patters so when you're sending an email
you have to include Hatter's just like a
web request so
first Hatter is the from Hatter so it's
gonna be from don't we reply at high
code.org so then we put in a new line
with the special new line character and
we have our to address so it's going to
be Francis at haiku org we're gonna have
a subject so we'll give our email a
subject we'll set test email
and to separate these Hatter's from the
actual content of the message we put
into newline characters and now we type
in our message
so now if we try to sign this
you can see here is the email we just
sent and you can see this email was sent
using Python so that's it for this video
