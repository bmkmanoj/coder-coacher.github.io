so I'm today what we're going to be
doing is if we go to the website and the
my red mass is just action I'll add a
new button and then it's gonna say reply
and we're gonna make it more simple to
reply to a message that yeah you can
send so just start with we need to go to
the my messages page that I have opened
and your word says I've read this we can
copy it and change this the name of the
same input failed to reply the value of
this to plot to MSG just to keep it
shorter so if we have a fresh so that's
in the wrong place actually all right
let's copy it down here where it says
delete math you just copy and paste it
in there so now when we act click my
messages we have a thing that's it well
okay let's just change it to our Pillai
to keep it shorter so now we have reply
so what we want us to do is open a new
page um okay so what about what I'll do
now is I'll create a new page so off you
see it as a dot PHP file and what I'm
going to call it is msg reply dot PHP
save it and obviously the first thing we
want to do is include our header file
just check okay we didn't we don't have
a footer yet so I might actually make
home and I might make a footer in the
next few videos
so whatever okay so not further down
actually so here we are we have the
reply ID um input type and it's lower
part of the message so I all we do is
we're going to create an if statement
and this if statement is going to say if
I'm the call that reply and since we are
using the variable in single quotes we
have to hooked single quote space and
full stop space and then the name of the
viral which is Uyghur Matt Smith made
our post-op space single quote and then
that's how we use variables in single
quote so what we're gonna do is we're
just going to echo reply just to prove
that the form is submitting correctly so
we refresh we click reply let me get
reply that's what that means it's
working we all gonna do it what we
wanted to do whenever we click that is
to take us to MSG underscore reply so we
can do that using the header function HP
which is kind of just a redirect
functions all right
it goes like this header and then I'm
within the two parentheses two double
quotes and then we write location hold
on and then you said the page you want
to take you wanna MSG right HP oops
that's wrong msg reply so now you're
fresh let me click on reply
takes us to MSG underscore replied I'll
PHP which is good so what we want work
one that actually changes to its amis G
on this and we'll do that in so now
we've got the sad page created we're
going to open the c s-- and msg page i
can pretty much copy all of this because
it's just it's quite similar it's pretty
much the same thing so what we wanna do
is um let me just refresh so hmm okay so
let me see why it didn't work we should
be a form you're not okay so why the
reason there's nothing showing up it's
because we have this set if it's act at
you and then i'm so if it's the part of
someone username who exists in the
database so what we type in is year
equals and then this case cinema and
then you write something up okay so yeah
it's because i was not doing the center
so here it is it shows up and what we
going what we have to do is we're going
to chain we're going to actually keep
this the way it is so i'm what we're
gonna do in the my messages page and the
header location thing we're gonna just
put question mark you in close and user
so click back to my messages and we
click on reply it takes us to my msg
underscore replied uh PHP and then
they're usually more upset the message
and as you can see these are all sent by
francis which is why it's taking us too
okay so I'm let me refresh actually so
it works like this we click reply it
works but if we click reply on any of
the other ones now it doesn't work
doesn't let us and reply so the reason
that is is because the Hat it says
cannot modify header information headers
already sent that's because we already
sent use the we already use this header
location function so what I did was um
you know or what I'm going to do is I'm
going to open I've opened the indexed a
PHP page and I'm gonna copy the HTML
refresh so we're going to refresh using
HTML this time we're just gonna copy
this and this should work every time you
had location wise problem is them a bit
better because it's quicker book this
way I will work every time so we click
reply takes us to em the right page we
click reply again takes us to the right
page you see the fresh actually
so for some reason that just didn't work
but not actually is working see as we
 reply each time we don't get an
hour it takes us to the correct page so
that's the reply part finished so right
what were the next thing I'm going to do
is we might get so what we'll do is
we'll tidy up the M posts so we'll go
below paneer the profiles up PHP page
let's find yeah posts art okay so here
it is boosted by whatever whatever so
I'm just gonna add some line breaks and
you will not line breaks and I'm just
gonna sit out of it so it's easier to
read okay so in the diff posted by we
have a link that says I did buy and
that's it so it was added behind things
I got so what we're gonna do is we're
going to let me see we're gonna create
another we're going to create a new
MySQL query I'm gonna get all the users
and looking for education at M so
there's going to be a jet user query
select um sort of from users where
username equals added by that's it
which is this fire will hear someone to
do that geez all right we actually need
to a coffee cup this time move it done
so what we'll do is we'll put it whoops
I'll just move this over away and put it
on you so we can stack oh and get user
info and then see what gives us so we're
actually that won't work because the
reason it's got undefined variables
because we didn't actually declare the
variable until we were here so that's
just that first one so we'll just keep
all this in line so I will put whether I
paste it in here and I'll don't worry
about so if we refresh we'll see
resource ID 10 11 and 12 which is the
well it doesn't really matter so that
lose resource ID
this doesn't mine over then there is
well delete this and once I get info
close
maestro fat face off for associative get
user input so now we'll just say well
the reason he did this was to get on all
of the user information but the first
thing the main reason we did it was
actually to get a user profile picture
so would say is profile pic on more info
just mature Cheney it's going to baby
cat info
this time you go to the database and in
here it's profile pic with an underscore
and then just a quick to make sure it
shows up so we were freshly problem
so we refresh and now we get the
location of the profile picture which is
good because we're gonna put the profile
picture up here to make it more Facebook
ask or whatever so right now is the top
and we can delete this we don't need and
put it in an inside here we can add a KO
image source and close the source of the
image is can go up here and check user
Rassilon shall copy this like this today
and then we use our variable so we can
set the height equal to 45 just to make
sure it fits and we can always change it
so now we have the provoked microts in
the completely wrong place so the cop of
this
here we're just sitting here okay so
what I'm actually gonna do is take this
and copy the image meet that one
so up here will not create another day
and this is just gonna hide the image so
the image goes in there on the bonus if
you give a spot some style time these
dye is going to me um okay I got you
need to change that to single quotes um
let's just try it and probably one more
yeah okay it's still a bit messed up so
what we're going to do is know where is
it down here we're just going to add
three more break tag Z and there we go
it's sort of the right size you know we
both thought we can outtalk who decides
it's a 60 and I maybe one longer time
okay so another great tag so there we go
uh when we can which is added by here we
can definitely put the body on a
different line so not a break here
maybe just another one make sure we ever
yeah all fits cracking okay so the we
can always just outed by look at that
posted by and then hold on and then we
could say so there so I hope that's it
okay we need to up this outside of the
link up here so now we refresh that's
not a link that is a link that's not
like I know and then all the post data
goes in here like hey I post we make it
really long on add the post mmm okay
that's because it's all what it's not I
am one it's all one big word but we
actually need to prevent against that so
in the boosted by section you can just
add some style I'm saying
so all put in here's a Marx Marx wig
I'm down on 400 pixels so ever fresh I
almost put something very long hopefully
this should have sorted it okay nope so
yeah another one yes okay so I I rather
stupidly forgot this is in different did
they post it whoops
yeah posted by div is in a different
give to the actual tab so how we can
just give here
styling and we can that if I can walk
over look it set over hello
I don't want other pixels just to make
sure
shrinks and load okay so this isn't
really a big problem because I don't
think anyone's ever gonna put words in
like that but we can fix in the next
video cuz I don't want to waste loads of
time in this video fixing it but for all
the times of purpose we type in some
words with spaces that are actually
words like a post we would type we post
it it is shrunk it's just doesn't really
work too well when when I remember it's
one big long word but we can always fix
that some other time so what Jen's up to
600 okay so now I find a slight problem
yeah using Greek tags so instead of
doing all these we can I simply just put
our craft eigen closing one and then
just as I see him we don't have the big
gap but maybe we can so so a thanks for
watching and that's about it for this
video but in the next video what we're
probably be doing is I don't know making
comments or something on this or
creating a like button like on Facebook
Google+ things I got I don't know
well yeah thanks for watching don't
forget to comment rate and subscribe on
I'll see you next time or not read
there's no readings anymore it's like
don't forget to like the video if you
liked it and subscribe if you want to
see more so yeah thanks okay so where
before I go the reason has been um well
for a while there was a lack of videos
was because I was building this our
website and what it is is just a website
to sort of help you learn web design
development thing we got and as you can
see there's a lot of things here
languages and stuff that I haven't
covered in videos that actually we'll be
doing very soon and it's just a way to
get better because I've already written
a couple of things harder goes now for
code examples like this that use copy
and paste into your tax data and see how
they work and it explains each thing and
it uses a lot of advanced things that I
haven't shown in videos like how do make
a next in a previous button because this
is a whole dynamic and it's all loaded
from a database and I don't know what's
I don't know I think it's kind of
complicated so I wanna make a video
showing how I did it now one thing I'm
particularly proud of is the try it
yourself editor I mean tell me about 2
hours and what it does is you type in
some text you click ad at me and it
shows up in the window but that's very
similar to the w3 schools com1 okay and
i didn't want to just copy theirs so
what I did was I made an instant one so
you could turn on instant and it uses
the similar sort of a code to the Google
search style Jack wary and starts
tutorial on the ages ago
and what it does is it makes everything
real time so as you can see as a type
it's real time on it just makes it more
career I guess I don't know it makes it
more from our batter way too low you can
obviously turn it off at well there is a
few bug in any way but this website is
by no means anywhere near finished but
so far I've spent a good long time
making and designing it so I'll
definitely tell you as my subscribers
and viewers and things when it comes out
I will it is I'll tell you whatever I
finished it and I will be alone people
make allowing people to make a constant
there'll be a tire allows you can see
the reform with topics we can ask
questions to other people who subscribe
to me like we were interested in it or
you can ask me because I'll be active on
the forms and I don't know I just think
I'll be a better way for everyone to
learn than just watching the video every
few days so I liked it I loved it your
thoughts on this in the descriptions or
in the comments so I as I said thanks
for watching don't forget to like if you
liked it and subscribe not only to see
all my videos but also to find out when
this new website launches thanks teen
