so this video is and the first and
hopefully series of videos M on learning
PHP because when I browse whenever I'm
making the find friends series I was
thinking maybe I should have done it
learn PHP series first so that's what
I'm I'm just gonna be doing it alongside
it and hopefully this will go well so
first what I'm gonna go over is um what
PHP is and things but before you begin
this it's good to know HTML or XML or
JavaScript first because they're
supposed to be quite similar but it's
not a necessity and you can still learn
PHP without it because um that's why I
did it so um right what so basically
I'll say what is PHP PHP stands for PHP
hypertext preprocessor it's a
server-side scripting language which
means the scripts are executed on the
server on the user's browser um which is
why you don't need to worry about
browsers important things I got for like
HTML not every browser supports
everything in the HTML the moment it
supports a lot of databases it's open
source and basically that's all you need
to know for the introduction so PHP
files can contain text and he HTML tags
and scripts and PHP files are returned
to the browser as plain HTML PHP files
have a file extension of dot PHP dot B 3
3 or dot B HTML so let's get started so
when you see as I said a second ago when
you're saving a PHP file
let me just that's why I didn't see this
one first so when you're saving it as
you can see there's a well you can't
because of the video but there's a load
of different file types obviously you
can make this smaller so
and as you can see there's a lot of
different files here on G katana days I
should say if I wear this over of my
mouse over PHP files and says this file
extensions you can use but I'm just
gonna call this index.php and in case
you didn't already know index is the
default file that users automatically
directed to on a website which is why
the home page is usually called
index.html
so um or in not indexed on HTML it's
usually called index thought whatever so
now we have a PHP file created if i
refresh here no we just have a black PHP
file and um it's just like the source is
parking everything so our PHP files add
to begin what is to begin using PHP
first you need to install and you need
to install PHP basically so what I use
is a program called xampp which is here
and I'm just yeah X I'm someone I'm you
gonna see you can open the control pond
ok maybe not so uh to get ax um you go
to Google oh wait I can just type in X
um but I'm sure you'll find it so I just
acts on oops
and as you can see here's a page Pachi
friends dot org on here tax out so you
don't even need to go to go for it so
come on if this would load okay so
here's the Apache friends website so as
you can see there's a lot of different
and then our example running a lot of
different operating systems and what
xampp basically is it's just a bundle so
it has PHP MySQL Apache things got so
all you do is download it install the
xampp
I have a video on that was the first one
I ever made so you can watch that if you
get confused
so once you have a common stall door and
anything else like mom or mom or went up
I think it is No
so the basic here's the basic PHP syntax
so um pH as you see me in the finder if
you watch the fine friends series PHP
files start like this this is a PHP
block and then fine friends sometimes
well mostly to the time I just do that
um that is the short sort of the
shorthand so M version of PHP tags so
for creating a PHP block but it is
recommended to use that but it works for
me so I normally don't but I would
recommend to use this so when you're
using PHP you can't just see if PHP into
dot HTML file because it won't work
anytime you're using PHP you need to
save it or you need to use it you can
only use PHP in the dot PHP file or dot
PHP 3 or not pay HTML whatever so PHP
files can normally contain the contain
HTML files so are tags even so if I was
to create a HTML file just this is
completely beat this is like the most
wrong way to create an HTML file but
whatever so if I was to say this is HTML
I notice it's ended up HP file but if I
was to refresh the browser that says
this is HTML I know we have that code I
just typed and you'll also notice that
if I am if I
just write the PHP but create a PHP
block and you can't see it in the view
source that's because it's server-side
and it's not brought and it doesn't run
in like in the browser so but if I am to
echo this is PHP don't worry if you
don't know what all that echo and thing
means
Alex me not and eventually so if i
refresh this all we got is that this is
PHP we don't get any of the other PHP
code we only got they text in the echo
so it still brings me on to my next
point and so the first and most basic
thing in PHP when you're learning is
echo and echo is just a way I display
it's displaying and not just text but
anything it's like you can put hitched
email codes inside so you can create a
div and put it in a Knakal and statement
so one matter so if I was to write this
is me echo oh I could just write the
standard hello world and if I was to
refresh this hello world we can't see
any other code so um the echo statement
can also use the single quotes nothing
and explained are as I explained
sometimes in they find for a series if
it works fine and you can also use print
in PHP they both do pretty much the same
thing except just go here they both do
like almost identically and almost then
let's see him job except sometimes
people say echo is quicker you wouldn't
really notice it but if you were there
if you were concerned about speed you
should use echo so when you're using
Akal you can also append to a coastal
test humans together so if I was to
write
and this is a first student and as you
can see this part is the same as this
part except maybe I should match not so
in PHP this you and every time you do
something on the line so if I say oh
this as you notice I always put the
semicolon at the end just to create a
variable for the sound : at the end
that's just what you do in PHP you do
that a lot of programming language it
just means you and the line so you
coming if you were you could do a
multi-line echo statement then you could
just do that and you wouldn't need to
put like write some text but a comma
semicolon right some tags it's just if
you're using the echo statement on its
um on a single line or whatever and
basically you add a static :
it's kind of hard to explain but you
sort of pick it up you realize when
you're using functions and variables and
things you'll just know the parts and a
couple of so Japan two statements
together will a pen basically just means
add together so we stick on to each
other so basically in a browser this
would look like this and if I was to put
a space first and I could just just
stand up so then this is what it would
look like in the browser and it and the
Agra Steven knows to join these two
together because of this docked in the
middle so stop means to join it together
so if i refresh this we got exactly what
I said and that brings me on to another
thing in PHP you can also if you're
doing a very big script you know you can
use comments and - so it's just so if
it's complicated and it's playing along
means you know what it is and if
you were giving it to someone else to do
that what know what it is so we do this
by two forward slashes and then you just
pour whatever you want your comment to
say so you just IP just say this is echo
I don't know
and it's pretty self-explanatory because
we know this is macro statement so you
wouldn't really need a comment in this
scenario but say y'all a lot of code you
could use a code or no comments you can
also do multi-line comments so you could
say you could if you were doing a
multi-line comment all you do is put a
forward slash and uhm an asterisk and
then when you want to when you or you
wanted to start and then when you want
to end it you just put an asterisk and a
forward slash it's pretty simple so if I
said this is a comment
you'll notice that comments aren't
running on the pages are just sort of
ignored and see it's not even in the
source code either everything in between
this these two PHP block there tags are
in hidden sort of unless they're told
otherwise like echo tabs it not to hide
it so now you know what a comment is
when you and use them and you can also
use comments just to hide your code so
say you had some code and you didn't
want to delete it you just didn't want
to be wrong all you do is put two
forward slashes at the start and that's
what comments basically do the forward
slash is just it makes the PHP ignore
the whole line which is why and well
ignores that line from that point
onwards so if I put it at the start it
ignores the whole nine but you can put
it after the code and it will just
ignore and from the forward slashes
onwards so if I was to echo or comment
that out so you couldn't see it it's
ignored by PHP
and maybe source signal would so doesn't
get round
that's it for this first video in this
music
PHP basics M series or an arm HP or
whatever so if you liked it don't forget
