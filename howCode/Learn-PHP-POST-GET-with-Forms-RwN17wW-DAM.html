video it's been a while but we're
starting these videos up again so today
we're going to be talking about is the
post function well not really a function
but the post ability within PHP and what
I mean by this is the ability to
transfer data from a page to a website
or from a page to another page or
whatever or a page to a server or things
like that so the best way to show this
is by example so here I'm just gonna
create a simple HTML form and I'm just
gonna create an input type text give it
a name of my textbox and give it a value
I'll actually leave it blank but I was
still ass supply the value option so if
we go to our index page and we refresh
now we can say we have a textbox and we
can click it and it does nothing except
you'll notice it has a quota it does
this to the URL and displays it all
right it changed the URL and and now we
the URL is a bit longer and it's not got
a question mark and then the my text box
and then equals and I got the my text
box from the name I gave it so this new
attribute is work out my text box from
the question mark is just how PHP sort
of knows that it's like well it's
equivalent to a command line argument in
a computer so you could as just like an
arguments that you pass in the URL so
and the reason this might not make any
sense the forwards thought or the I
backslash and then the question mark is
because it's actually indexed up you
know what's actually slash index dot PHP
and then question mark which is that
what make might make more sense so the
next thing we need to do in our form is
we need to specify a method
in action the action is the page you
want the form to submit to so for
example if I had my all my PHP code on a
pH called search dot PHP for example
then I would set my action on my form to
search the PHP because I want it to
submit all the data it receives to the
opinion start/stop PHP but in this case
I'm submitting it to index to PHP
because my PHP code will be above it so
I'll just set the action to index dot
PHP the method is more you can have two
options you can either write post or you
can write get and you write post when
you want to submit data like send it
away to a web server for example if you
were creating a login and register
system when you're if you are
registering a user you want you want to
insert the information the user gives
you into the database so you would want
to post that information and if you were
for example using if you were making a
search engine or a login system as
opposed to a register system you would
use gat the get method because what this
does is it for pulling information from
a server sort of so the best way to
explain is just to show you so at the
moment the F form method is GATT so
that's just so you know a lot so now if
we type in something so let's say if
Frances into this text box and I click
enter to submit it as you can see it
says question mark my text box equals
Frances and there is this is because we
usually get a method so if I change this
to post and what will happen is we
actually won't see anything in the URL
so if I change this to Frances and I
click enter I didn't see nothing comes
up in the URL it's completely empty
that's because the GAT method is when
all the area all the information they
get submitted by by GATT gets pushed up
into the actual
URL as an argument which is how another
page can tick okay which is the way you
would get like another page to be able
to retrieve the information so you would
say let's just do it again so if we were
if we refresh and I'll actually change
this to search the PHP for an example so
why was the time in Francis I didn't see
it search that PHP doesn't exist but
that's not important it takes us to
search dot PHP and that uses a question
mark and then it uses the argument my
text box equals Francis so what you
would do on the circuit of PHP page is
you would retrieve the value of the my
text box argument in the URL and that's
how you would pass data from pages to
page which is why it's suitable for
things like a search engine because you
can pass information to other pages and
retrieve information pull information
from a database what you can do if you
use a post is let's say well okay this
is what the PHP comes in so with PHP
what we what we can do to retrieve the
information from that's from the GAT
method as we say a dollar underscore get
so this is like a root tight it's sort
of like a variable and it's sort of
slightly different
it's a reserved variable sort of so if
you couldn't you can't only start a
variable with an underscore but since
this is a special kind of variable yeah
that's how you get started with an
underscore and you don't just instead of
writing a dollar underscore get equals
and then whatever you say a dollar
underscore get and then use two square
brackets and then semicolon
and then between the three square
brackets you put in two single quotes or
double quotes doesn't matter and then
you give it the name of your tax box so
I just wrote my if I wrote my text box
then oh actually I forgot we actually
need to ask soar this in a variable
itself which is why this technically
isn't a variable
this is just to pull data from the gap
method we actually just started a
variable so I just call it store this in
a variable called my textbox and then
what we can do is we can accurate out to
allow us to echo my textbox we will get
the contents of whatever i en't okay
don't worry about this for an i this is
just because the undefined index means
we're trying to echo a variable that
hasn't been assigned yet because this
ver this value hasn't been created yet
so what we do is we'll just say hello
and if I hit enter we're actually still
submitting to it I searched up HP we
need to submit this to index type PHP so
that we can oh whoops
so we can actually use the we can access
this PHP code so let's go back and
refresh and type in hello again as you
can see the undefined error goes away
because we've done differently and
declared the variable and it's echoed us
hello as well as hello up in the end in
the URL if we were to change this to
post works exactly the same except the
information doesn't get stored in the in
the URL so let's go back unless type in
Francis this time as you can see the URL
stays exactly the same except now we
have it echo talk to us so that's best
that's the basics of post and gat in PHP
but that's also this isn't very secure
because people can put in things like
HTML tags survived right Francis
alright this text is bold and I could
surround it by bold tags hit enter and
as you can see it actors at exactly as
what was the contents of the text box
it also lets us a cool things like PHP
code so we can do if we were to type
this in we were to echo hello and hit
enter as you can see nothing went
nothing
iago but it did run the actual PHP code
so this can be used for things like my
SQL injection and this is potentially
really bad for your database because if
someone wanted they could just put in a
MySQL query to delete all rooms from
your database and and that would run
that would go through and you would lose
all your data in your database so what
you would want to do is you want to
surround this with functions such as a
stripped tags to prevent against that
there's loads of functions you would
want to surround it with but that's just
a basic insight and as we go through
more of these videos and we get more
advanced I'll show you more methods as
well and other different things you can
do so thanks for watching this video
