about web crawlers and robots.txt files
this video is created to coincide with
the article we put up on tips topics
based on Co it's a free resource for
anyone not just bestest customers but
it's primarily aimed for bestest
customers but anyone can access this
website and look at the content and what
it is is it teaches you about all sorts
of things to do with web hosting this
article is by robusta take state and it
shows you how to hide parts of your site
from search engines so what a robots.txt
file is is it's a text file as you can
see here here's Google's robusta txt
file
it's a text file that allows you to hide
specific content or pages from your
website of your website from search
engines and other web crawlers not just
search engines but it's not you know a
foolproof system because robots.txt is
there's no specific standard for it so
so if you create a robots.txt file a web
crawler can just ignore your text file
and just crawl whatever parts of your
site it wants to there's this will not
stop it from doing that
but it's useful for web crawlers like
Google and Bing because they follow the
instructions in a robots.txt file so if
you said a robots.txt file and you tell
them not to search a specific directory
and not to index a specific directory
then they'll leave that then they'll
leave that alone but if you're trying to
hide specific parts of your website then
there's no point because one web
crawlers can ignore it until robots.txt
file is always put in the root of your
directory root directory of your website
so here's google's it's in the root
directory and it's always publicly
accessible if it isn't publicly
accessible then a web crawler can't see
it and they're just gonna crawl your
site anyway so it has to be publicly
accessible so there's just two caveats
with robust rtst
it's not a you know a perfect solution
it's just useful for hiding parts of
your site from Google and things like
that but we're trying to hide them from
people then there's no point because
since it is publicly accessible anyone
just come on to the robust Pitesti file
look at the things you try to hide and
they can just access them anyway so so I
wouldn't use it for things like hiding
private information or things like that
there's a better ways to do that so what
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna show you
how to create a robots.txt file so if we
go back onto me what ad tips are bSpace
let's see oh here's an example of a
robots.txt file that will stop a robot
crawling the web site completely all
irobot the follows robots.txt so what
this first line says is doesn't matter
what the user agent is I want every
crawler anything that follow across my
website to listen to these instructions
and then we said DISA lie and then we
put a forward slash this forward slash
means wrote the root directory of your
website which in this case for tips the
base visted CEO is that is literally
this so this means if I had this as a
robots.txt file on tips that be spaced
at CEO this would stop all web crawlers
that listen to robots to take safe from
crawling my website so yeah Google
wouldn't crawl your site and they
wouldn't call your site and things like
that so basically you can do two things
you can say hello and you can say just
so long if you said disallow and then
you give it a folder name or a file name
then it will tell the web crawler to
leave it alone
if you sell oh then I'm tell about
crawler that it's allowed to access that
and crawl it so if I go down here you
can see here's one that blocks the
Google web crawler 3 4 so at Google's
user agent for that web crawler is
called Googlebot
so what I'm basically saying is user
agent if the user agent equals scuba bot
and disallow it to access the home
directory of some user and then I'm also
just allowing it access to the CGI bin
folder if I go down here you can see we
can also disallow Googlebot and any user
agents from specific files so if I had a
folder called slash Google slash hello 1
2 3 dot HTML this would tell Google that
I can't crawl this file and it would
leave it out if its index and similarly
down here we can have another user agent
so here's thing bar which is things
crawler and we're basically telling it
not to go to the thing /hello dot HTML
file
that's basically all there is to
robots.txt it's a really simple system
that allows you to hide and unlock parts
of a website for web crawlers it's not
compulsory you don't have to use one but
if you don't use one the web crawlers
will assume they can crawl every part of
your website so it might be useful to
you know use it to hide specific things
if you want specific files from Google
but it's not a good way to hide files
from users because anyone can just
access your robots.txt file if they want
so that's it for this video don't forget
