how to create our own simple application
that follows users back on our Twitter
account we can't follow users back in
real time because Twitter's disable that
functionality but what we can do instead
is we can run our bot every so often and
we can pick either a single user or a
selection of users at random to follow
back this might be something you want to
incorporate on your Twitter account
because it gives you an extra way to
show appreciation to the people that
actually follow your Twitter kind by
pegging so around them and following
them back it also gives you an extra
level of interaction with your followers
without having to do anything beyond
create the initial application so for
this video we're going to be using
Python to create our application we're
going to be running it on the internet
so we're gonna create a droplet on
digital ocean we're gonna create an
event a 16.04
droplet we're gonna use the cheapest one
which is just five dollars a month we'll
pick anywhere it doesn't really matter
for this video and what we'll do is
we'll also enable ipv6 just in case the
Twitter API ever changes to only allow
ipv6 obviously that'll be a good while
in the future but we want to be prepared
just in case and here we'll give our
server a name so let's click create on
that as you can see now our droplets
being created so we'll just wait for
that to be done so know that are
droplets been created let's log into it
so there we are we've logged into our
droplet for the first time so now that
we've logged into the droplet we need to
create an application on Twitter which
will allow us to access the Twitter API
to be able to follow people back we need
to use the Twitter API and to be able to
use the Twitter API we need to create an
application on Twitter which will allow
us to authenticate with the Twitter API
so to do that what we do is we go to App
Store Twitter comm and we click create a
new app so we need to give our
application a name we're going to call
it hi code follow back we'll give it a
description and we need to give it a
website so we'll just put in a follow
back on hi code org
and then we accept the agreement and we
click create your Twitter application
and if you get this error about the URL
format we just need to put in HTTP at
the start of that so our applications
just being created and this will allow
us to authenticate with the Twitter API
we need to go to keys and access tokens
and we have our consumer key and our
consumer secret we also need another key
or token as it's called called an access
token and we get that down here we click
create my access token
so we have our consumer key we have our
consumer secret we have our access token
and our token secret and that's all we
need to authenticate with the Twitter
API the next thing we need is a special
Python library which makes using the
Twitter API a lot easier and we're going
to use something called tweet pie so to
get this library tweet pie what we can
do is we can go to donor dynoed and we
can get the zip file location and
download it to our server or we can
install it using a special Python
program called pip and by using pep it
will also install three pies
dependencies
whereas downloading the zip file bumped
so we're gonna use pepper so we're going
to type in PAP and you can see it's not
currently installed if we use the
command pip that will install modules
for python too so we want to say a pip
three and that's also not installed but
that's what we're going to use to use
Python three so we're going to copy that
paste it down here
and install this and now we're going to
say pip 3 install tweet by so now if we
say a Python 3 and we set import Tweep a
you can see we get no errors which means
that it worked
so what we're gonna do is create a new
file call it follow back top pie the
first thing we're gonna do is import
tweet pay then we're going to go back to
Twitter we're gonna screw it up and
we're gonna get our API key we're gonna
copy that
we'll say consumer key is equal to that
copy the consumer secret
we're going to copy the access token
and finally copy the token secret so the
next thing we want to do is we want to
say it off is equal to tweet a dot o
earth handler which is a method we're
going to use to pass in the consumer key
and a consumer secret because that
authenticates us with our app and we
authenticate with our app using OAuth
the next thing we have to do is
authenticate our specific Twitter
account which in this case is the Haiku
Twitter account with our app and that's
what we use the access key for so we
want to say it off dot set access token
and we want to pass in our access token
and our access token secret and then
we're going to do is create a variable
called the API and set it equal to 3 PI
dot API and then we want to pass in our
authentication so now in the API
variable we have an instance of the
Twitter API and we can use that to
actually query anything we want so let's
just run this for an hour and see do we
get any errors what's a Python 3 follow
back pay so the reason for that error
was just because the API method is
actually in capitals so now we're ready
to grab the list of followers so to get
the list of followers what we're gonna
do is we'll say if followers is equal to
tweet a dog cursor this cursor method is
a handy method that means we don't have
to worry about Twitter's pagination
because if you have a lot of followers
they're gonna be shown on multiple pages
on the normal Twitter website and the
API is actually the same it's gonna show
you only a snippet of the number of
users and then you have to deliberately
tell at which page you want to see so
using tweet ID our cursor allows the API
to take all that away from us and it
means we don't have to worry about any
of that so we can say a tweet by cursor
I can pass it API it up followers and I
can set items to get all of the items I
can set our items 100 for example and
that will limit the number of items
returned so in this case the number of
followers will be limited to 100 or I
can put in any number I want there I can
also use dot pages and things like that
instead of that items and what we'll do
is we will print
followers I will run up and you can see
we get this special object so if we
enter it through that object using a for
loop
like this and then we save it and run it
you can see we get information returned
about every single Twitter follower
which doesn't appear to be very useful
at the minute so instead of printing the
entire follower object we and say a
follower dot screen name to get that
property from it run that and you see we
got us we got the screen names of all of
the followers of the haiku Twitter
account so now instead of just printing
out their names we want to follow them
back so I don't want to follow all of
them every time we have a new follower
because if you had a lot of followers
Twitter could ban your account from
following too many people to fix that
what we'll do is we will scroll up to
the top and we will import the random
library on Python and then what we'll do
is we'll say num is equal to random dot
R and int to get a random number between
the range of 0 and 9 and then below that
what we'll do is we'll say if if num is
equal to 1 for example so using this
method we'll follow it about 1 and 10
users so what we'll do is we'll say if
num equals 1 follower dot follow and
then underneath here what we can do is
we can just say
so what we're doing is we're following
one
users and then we're just printing out
the name of the user that we followed so
let's run this again but before we run
it will go to the Haiku Twitter account
will refresh and as you can see the
Twitter account isn't actually following
anyone at the minute what I'm going to
do is just run our follow back script
and as you can see in this instance it
followed two people if i refresh the
Twitter account
you can see a nice says hi code is
following two people if I run it again
we're gonna follow another certain
number of people we could potentially
follow every single how to code follower
but because we're generating a random
number between 0 &amp;amp; 9 there's a 1 in 10
chance that we follow someone so we
should end up following about 10% of the
users
so now to get this to run automatically
what we can do is we can set crontab - e
to create a cron job and since this is
the first time we've run it I'm gonna
choose natto as the adder and what we
want to do is pierced our cron job in
here and what this says is once per day
at the time of 9 o'clock at night
we're gonna run this command which is
Python 3 / root / follow back type a see
that and that's pretty much it
we could even cheat decrease that
increase that whatever we wanted to do
by increasing the range of the random
numbers that are generated we could
decrease the amount of people we follow
and by shortening the range we could
increase the amount of people we follow
by increasing the possible range of
random numbers that are generated we
could follow last people and by
decreasing the range we could follow
more people so hopefully this is useful
