what we're going to be doing in this
part of the series is we're going to be
finishing off the my videos page that we
started in the last video so as you can
see this is how far we got in the last
video with the my videos page and we're
going to just be finishing that off
today making it look better and then
making it better way to organize the
videos so let's get started so now that
we've got our m ra ra date a bit where
another words selecting like the videos
from the database more displaying them
on the page as you can see here we've
won video and we're swinging on the page
now what we want to do is we want to
have a better way to form a top so what
we're going to do is we're going to
create actually a couple of divs to
surround each video on then we're going
to use the chrome developer tools to
style it and make it look nice so what
we're going to do is we're going to
delete this and then in here what we're
going to do is we're just going to end
the PHP block down on creating you in
here and then what we want to do is want
to create another adivinar going to do
is we're going to use PHP at we're an
open EP feed lock and we're going to
activate the video title so this is the
title here which we got the title from
the database and we store it in the
title variable and that's the variable
rekelen right here so now if i refresh
the page all the only thing you're going
to notice different is this description
is going to disappear so if I click
refresh you're going to see that the
test video is the title Swit state and
in the description disappeared the only
reason the description disappeared is
because we're not a queen or not i
pointed out anymore so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to add some style to the
div I'm going to leave a blank for an
eye and then I'm going to refresh
another the page is refreshed as you can
see since we didn't actually apply any
styles we're not going to see anything
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
right-click and I'm going to go to
inspect element all this will do is it
will bring up the a chrome
developer tools and what we can do is
ink on ID wrapper and then we can go
down here and this is where our div was
so this is the dev we created it's
displayed a little bit differently in
this but it's the same div we created
dynamically in the PHP script so the
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to settle width of 900 pixels and
a height of just the 200 pixels for nice
it's nice and big then we're also going
to do is we're going to set a background
color we're going to set up the block
just to make it easy to see and as you
can see no it's it's friendly from
developers as we can see this all easier
and our David showed up art has shown up
so I'll actually make it gray because
then it's easier to tell the difference
between where the div starts and where
the man you ends because the manage box
and it has to be different color so a
lot of gel not what I'm going to do is
I'm also going to send margin-top i'm
going to set that 240 pixels okay and as
you can see not for some reason that the
magazine push time so I'm just going to
get rid of that I'm going to say a
potting Arnold instead okay so we'll the
problem with if we SAT they at the air
potting for example to number potting
top two I don't know 40 pixels as you
can see the dead just gets bigger on the
actual a bit the actual video does show
up now but that's not what we want
because this means that every every
single Dave for the videos is going to
be one beggar or image 40 pixels bigger
that we wanted to be so we're just going
to actually get rid of this so and then
we're going to come into here and we're
just going to put in a couple of brief
tags actually end up with these break
tags in above hmm when you put these
break tags in up here so we're just
going to end the PHP tags there and then
open them again and then we're just
going to add a great tags up here
because if we add them down here that
means it's going to add this whatever
code we add in here is going to be
rendered however many times we have a
video so for example if we had 10 videos
in the mud if we ate uploaded 10 they
use this we get up or a code 10 times
and we don't want to break tags between
every single video we just want it from
the very first one so we go outside of
this while loop when we add them up here
so now if I copy this just so we don't
lose it and i piss it on in our refresh
what you're going to see is the mall
yorkshire notice any change because the
value of the test video only disappeared
whenever we added the style to the m.div
so if i come down here and i go to
operate me and then I go into test video
again I just install that in ok to isn't
enough but I can see it did get pushed
on a little bit more so what we're going
to do is we're now maybe add two more
break ties soon now we've got to mow
break times and we're going to refresh
and as you can see now the videos been
pushed I know that the more but we won't
actually notice we want to see what it
looks like property until we had this
styling in so here's our div and I'm
just going to paste this in here and I
didn't see now we have account from the
top but I we don't actually want to get
that big so maybe we'll just add 3 4 90
to try this again so let's go to click
on doctype click on rapper and then put
under diff again we're just going to
paste this in so as you can see that's a
bit little bit more of what we wanted
and it's not perfect but it was
different I so now that we've done that
what we're going to do is instead of
making the background where we're going
to fit the background light we're going
to add a porter at the bottom I'm going
to say it's in one pixel solid and we're
going to make that paper a grey
okay and then what we're going to do is
well actually we don't need to hide to
be 200 pixels that was just for us to be
able to see it better so we're going to
make it 100 pixels um we're going to say
well that actually looks okay for an eye
so what we're going to do is want to
take this code and just written down
we're just going to copy it and we're
going to come in here again we're just
going to paste it in the style and we're
just going to tidy it up a bit and fresh
and as you've seen our style has stayed
what we can also do is we can okay i
will leave until i leave it for now
actually and welcome back to the theater
so now we want to do is we want to dial
the title so what we're going to do is
we're going to we could go okay what
what moves we're going to go into our
CSS files which it's not me worried
where is it probably include we're going
to go to include actually just open the
hydrophone we're going to see where we
get our CSS from so it's star she
thought CSS is that where we appear to
be getting or staff them so that's ok
let's go into CSS and then start you
tell CSS now what we're going to do is
want to create a class for our Dave so
we're going to call it my video is div
and we're just going to copy this code
here and change and put it we're gonna
put in here at my videos div and also
that one work so we need to just change
this to class then come up here and just
paste it in here
so that's right now let's refresh it
should be no difference okay the reason
the the styling disappeared is because
for some reason sometimes you have to do
this I'm just going to run a new tab and
then come here and open a new page again
and then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to say I'm going to go to the
directory / CSS now i'm going to click
on style of statutes on CSS scroll down
and as you can see my videos they've
actually appeared night so now what will
happen probably is the stache should
show up and it didn't look I called it
my video give the reason why I went to
the style sheet and loaded it is because
sometimes you have to load the style
sheet after you've made a change to it
before the bride's will actually update
it so now if you're not here we go our
stars back and the reason I included it
in a gated on class as because now we
can do this adopt my video is div and
then we can do is we can apply the
harbor attribute to it and then we can
say is a background color nothing sadder
too i don't know i like grass or have to
have to f2 and then what we'll do when
we refresh now is if we might over it
now we might actually have to refresh
this okay i called the mag- again so
let's try a nine so now when I mouse
over as you can see it highlights what
sort of changes color so now what we're
going to do is we're all so we draw
another reason for creating classes we
can also get specific elements from the
class so i could say my videos give h2
and then i could apply some specific
styles to it and then because the water
can do now is I can now run this and
it's to tag and I can apply specifics
too so those are h2 obviously that looks
weird because it doesn't it just looks
weird so what we're going to do is we're
going to say a border a bottom none and
what this should do is you should i
remove the green border at the bottom
and then what we wanted to do is that
actually looks okay for now then what
we'll do is we'll create the description
so we'll create a new day of underneath
here oops now we'll call it will give it
a class of its own child sorry i cannot
regular this keyboard again now we're
going to call it my videos div
underscore dese we're just going to copy
that we're going to go in our strategy
to get it yes it in so we're going to
set the width of this to let's say fifty
percent okay and we actually need to
won't actually see anything until we
have put some content in our Dave so
we're just going to copy this we're
going to paste it in now we're going to
say dese
and there is our description then what
we're also going to do is we're going to
let's go into our database so localhost
and then we're going to go to smash PHP
my admin and then now we're in our
database we're going to click on video
box and we can go to our videos table
and get specific parts all right
specific pieces of information from the
table so we can get the video keywords
the upload by and we get anything we
want from here the reason I did this is
because then we can see well what path
field we can actually get and here's a
list of all these things we can say how
about the video so we can also write
keywords so let's say let's just go down
here and then change it to well actually
we don't need to do for this one maybe
we'll just keep the dev around that but
we won't give it a class I will just say
keywords now what we could say is tags
and then just sorry lot i would give
this strong and then the strong tag here
this will just said tags and then both
make the tags boat I mean the word tags
food so there it is there and what we
might want to do is put out a line on
the bottom so at what we'll do that is
well just we might actually have to give
it its own at class so just say my
videos underscore tags are okay we'll
keep everything the scenes will say my
videos give underscore tags and then
we'll and I whoops videos wrong that
will just come in here back to our style
sheet and we will say my videos div tags
and then we'll say and position absolute
a bottom pixels but this might actually
just do is put along the bottom of the
page but we'll see how it goes yeah put
it on
page so at what we can do there is that
we can actually just instead of position
absolute bottom we could say a margin
margin bottom 0 pixels let's see what
happens ok let's try listen minus 10x
closer than that should move it ok some
reason this is working ads have a look
let's try margin-top let's check your
style sheet
you
yeah okay i did move it done okay that's
what we'll do we'll send margin-top say
i don't know maybe 30 pixels what i
should do is it yeah puts it on the
bottom so now what we'll do now we've
got our own dip for it with I just said
border on that background color and I
will set it to f4 f4 f4 which is sort of
like bragging i will say i would at one
hundred percent and then what we'll do
is we'll say f potting three pixels so
let's try it now let's refresh and see
what it looks like it's a little bit
weird maybe we'll pick maybe half one
you
this is check the fish' is up to
properly
ok
you just leave it as well okay instead
of change the background color will make
a border so step order top one pixel
solid gonna get gray
and will um let's see
let's get rid of the pot immunity let's
see what this looks like
okay that looks better so that's the my
videos page we are obviously this
doesn't do anything yet but that's all
times what we have in this video so also
we just did styling in this video so I
apologize for that but we did need to do
it or we needed to do it eventually so
what we'll do is we end this video here
and then in the next video what were we
doing is actually creating things like
links to edit the videos and things I
got in the my videos page so thanks for
