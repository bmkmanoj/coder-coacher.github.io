how to set up geo DNS so that probably
makes no sense to most people and
essentially what geo DNS is where you
can change your DNS queries depending on
where bytes in the world your users are
coming from and the reason I made this
video is because of the manner I'm
working on the new version of haiku org
and one of the things I want is I want
high co.org to be fast for everybody no
matter where bytes in the world they are
so to do that you have to have servers
that are located as close as possible to
everyone in the world using this special
trick with your DNS you can write people
to specific servers depending on where
bytes they live because they're closer
to the server their experience and your
website will be much faster the reason
I'm making the video is because haiku
uses CloudFlare for security and
whenever website sits behind cloud for I
didn't actually know it was possible to
oddly sort of features with those cloud
for our doesn't natively support them so
I find a workaround and I'm gonna show
you how to do it in this video so you
need to domain names I have Francis
McNamee comm here and then I'm gonna use
the backspace code domain name as well
and what we're gonna do is we're gonna
create a cname record so with Krita seen
IAM and it's gonna be called just the
out sign which means it's the root of
the domain name so it's the cname record
for Francis McNamee com
you can't normally do this in DNS
provide for has a workaround so it
actually does work when you do it with
card fare and the domain name is gonna
point to is just gonna be geo vespi SEO
so we're gonna click add record and we
want the record to be behind the orange
cloud because that hides the IP address
of the origin server which protects you
from things like DDoS attacks next we
want to go to the best space zone which
is the zone of the other domain name and
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create
a subdomain I'm gonna create a subdomain
called geo best pistachio and I'm gonna
delegate it to Amazon route 53 which is
Amazon's DNS service that will provide
this extra functionality so this is
powered by Amazon Web Services so what
we're gonna do is put in our domain name
which is GFS pissed at CEO it cost 50
cents per month plus whatever number of
queries you do so it's not that
expensive at all so we're going to click
create to create that zone and now we
have our zone created and we can create
records but what we want to do is click
on this first one and we want to copy
these name servers to Clyde flower so
this is like whenever you buy a domain
name you have to point your name service
to Clive flower what we're doing it by
creating an ass records as we're
pointing the name servers of our
subdomain to Amazon from Clara this will
allow us to host our zone on Amazon so
we put in jail again and we paste in the
sack
nameserver we only actually need one but
we're gonna put in four for redundancy
we're gonna put NGO again we're gonna
piss the not name server and finally
we're going to pissed in our last steam
server we pissed that in click odd
record and there are four records have
just been added can I reverse DNS
refresh is extremely quickly so if I was
to go to terminal
and I was to type in dig which is a
command that lets you run a DNS query
and I was just sent geode mass space CO
and I was to type in an S because I want
to look at the an ass records if I click
enter you can see our domain already
points to Amazon there is our records
there so because I know a points to
Amazon I can go to route 53 which is
Amazon's DNS hosting and I can create
some records and I can make these
records change depending on where in the
world I am so if I click create record
set I'm just gonna leave that blank
which means it will apply to GOI
pacifist at CEO and I'm gonna put in an
heir record that says 1010 1010 and if
the writing policy is simple
that just means no matter where you are
in the world this query will return this
IP address but what I'm gonna do is I'm
going to click on geolocation and I can
click on any country I want or any
continent I want so I can say if you're
from Europe you're gonna get tan tan tan
tan I'm going to type in Europe just for
the name
and there we have our first record so if
you're from Europe you're gonna see tan
tan tan tan I'm gonna create another
record it's going to go to Giotto best
Vista CEO and I'm gonna put in 2020 2020
and I'm gonna go to writing policy I'm
in fact geolocation I'm going to scroll
down and I'm gonna choose North America
and if you're from just a click create
we're gonna see 2019 or 2020 I'm gonna
do one more now say 32 32 32 30 days are
obviously just random IP addresses I'm
gonna click geolocation one more time
I'm gonna put in South America so there
we have our three record sets so if
you're from Europe you'll see 10 10 10
10 if you're from North America you'll
see 22 22 22 29 different from South
America you'll see 30 30 30 30 at the
minute if you're from anywhere else
you're actually just not going to get
any record returned so we'll do is we'll
click create record set will create one
more which is going to point to 0.0.0.0
we're gonna click geolocation again and
the location is just gonna be default so
this is the default one we're gonna
click create so now we have four record
sets depending on where you are in the
world you'll see a different record so
if I go to this website it's called
watts my DNS net and I put in gos space
don't CO and I click a search what
you're gonna say is different IP
addresses appearing depending on wara
bytes in the world these servers are
located so you can see in Los Angeles
Accor 22 22 22 20 in Brazil they got 32
32 32 30 and if we go back to rate 53
you can see for South America which was
Brazil we got 34 North America we got 29
for Europe we got 10 and for everywhere
else we could zero so you can see in
Europe we got tens and in Australia we
got zero two zero zero two zero what
we're not done yet we wanted this to
apply to our domain Frances McNamee calm
so whenever we go to Frances McNamee
calm it goes to Jo de Paz mr. CEO so
nobody should actually know about your
bastard CEO because that will give away
the IP addresses of our servers which
could make us vulnerable to a DDoS
attack but if I was to turn off the
cloud for Clara and I was to run a query
said dig Frances McNamee calm and I hit
enter you can see we get tan tan tan tan
print tonight so if I run this on
Frances McNamee comm
you see we get the exact same result so
I've just clear
my DNS cache and if I go back to Clyde
for her and I turned the orange Clyde
back on our wives that would be hidden
behind Clyde Fleur and now if I run it
again after I've cleared my DNS cache
you can see we got the Clyde 4 IP
addresses but if I was to go to my
website the actual server I would hit
would be tan tan tan tan so hopefully
that was useful that shows you how you
can use geo DNS on Clyde flower to
distribute your visitors across all your
servers depending on where they're
coming from so that's it for this video

email me at Francis at haiku org but
that's it for this video and I'll see
you next time
