what we'll be doing is we're going to be
learning about CGI programming in Python
so what CGI is is it's basically sort of
a really old version of its kind of what
was around before PHP so before with
before PHP I you couldn't just put sort
of scratch code in a file for example a
big good examples to let me show you so
as you can see here is hi gorg and this
is a PHP file and I include all of the
PHP code in this exact file along with
all the HTML but you didn't used to be
able to do that and so what people use
with something called CGI
and this is the CGI folder on um not
everywhere post provides us but a lot of
them do on a toy called
add does I have it so what I'm going to
do is I'm going to create a Python file
and I'm going to show you how to execute
it on your server using CGI so if we go
to FileZilla over here
ignore the htaccess file that's just
because without it the way I can figure
my other you see access it didn't work
so we're just ignoring you see access
file that's not actually not necessary
so what we're going to do is we're going
to create a new file and we're going to
call it Python pi so then we're going to
do is that we actually have to give it
the correct permissions first so we're
going to go down to file permissions and
we're going to set the permissions to
seven five five and then we're going to
click ok so now we're going to do is
we're going to right-click again we're
going to click view slash add it and
this is going to download the file and
let us edit it so the first thing we
need to do add to make a work is to
include a header at the top of the file
because as you can see if we go to a
Python PI we get an error and actually
before the header we need to include the
location of the Python interpreter
so what we're going to type is a hashtag
exclamation mark slash USR slash bin so
slash user slash bin slash Python and
the Python has no extension at the end
of it then what we're going to do is
we're going to set print and we need to
print the header and I'll notice I'm not
using Python 3 that just proposed this
override it doesn't support Python 3 so
yours might if it does just you know use
the Python 3 syntax but if it doesn't
like mine just use the Python 2 syntax
so what we're going to type is a content
type : space
I will actually go over to the space
text slash HTML then what you want to do
is you want to put a new line in the new
lines important because without thing
you line it will actually work it'll
just give us this internal server error
again
website any put the oh no I took it I
thought I put the slash no place so now
we've done that we can go to FileZilla I
mean click yes and this will upload our
file so now if we go back to the browser
and we click refresh as you can see we
got a blank page but that's only because
we haven't total path on script to do
anything so to do something we're just
going to say print hello world one head
yes to upload that and we'll click
refresh and I can see notice how to
world on the page
so we can do this too I put any time in
HTML that we want so let's say we could
even do server-side things as well but
for simplicity I'm just going to put
some HTML so I'm going to say title
hi code Python script or something I
don't know and then underneath here
we're going to put in this is a Python
script and then we're just going to do
something simple like while one equals
one let's say a while
I is less than 10 then we're going to
set print that's say I don't know
something and we'll go up here we'll
just say I equals zero website that is
just a simple that loop that we're doing
is to show you how it works then we're
going to say is a I equals I plus 1 so
this will just this is a simple script
we can run on our web server now so
let's just refresh the page and as you
can see it says this is a Python script
something something's not something
whatever and there we have a haiku
Python script up here so let's just put
in a new line to make that easier to see
and we'll also I put I decided so we'll
say I'll get rid of that we'll say plus
I to append it and then we'll appending
you line on the end of it
so that's refresh whoops
okay so let's just go back on say
to make xmls a print I put a space there
and I will set print new line
so okay oh okay the reason the new line
isn't working is because we're we have
to using HTML new line so let's just put
in a break tag
and as you can see in our script is
executed and we can do dynamic things
with Python on a webpage that we
couldn't do before but if we were to put
Python Pi in the main haiku or cooler
I'll actually do that just as a
demonstration
so if we were to just go back to here
and refresh the page I can see edit room
returns our actual file because the file
doesn't get run unless it's in the CGI
bin so we just make sure that you put it
in the CGI folder or your file won't run
so that's it for this video don't forget
