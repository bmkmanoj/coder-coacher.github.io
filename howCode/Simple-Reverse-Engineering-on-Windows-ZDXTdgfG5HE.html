how to do some simple reverse
engineering on windows we're going to
decompile an executable and see how it
works and then what we're going to do is
we're going to modify one of the
instructions in the executable to change
the behavior of the app so of course
we're not going to do this on any
commercial software but I've made a
simple app for this series that we can
modify and add decompile
so the app I've made looks like this
it says my app and it says locked if we
click unlock it says invalid code the
unlock code you supplied is not followed
that's a way didn't type anything in if
I type anything in that's invalid like
that and then I click unlock it's going
to say that the code was invalid so what
I'm going to do now is put in a valid
code so you can see what it looks like
whenever the code is valid so this is
the valid code and this is the one that
the program has been programmed to
accept and what we're going to do is
click unlock you can see that the tax
box in the button automatically
disappear and then the label changes to
unlocked so what we're going to do is
reverse engineer this simple app so that
it accepts anything we type into this
text box so before we do that I'm going
to show you the source code of that app
so here's the app here if I go to form
one dot CS that's the form that I used
to create the app as you can see all it
is is we declare an array of strings
called unlock codes we have a list of
available unlock codes these are the
only codes that are acceptable
we scroll down to the unlock button
underscore click which is this event
here when we double click on that button
we run a method called unlock app and
the unlock app method loops through all
of the unlock codes and the checks if
each unlock code is equal to the value
in the text box if it is we say it's
unlocked we exit the function and we
turn off the textbox and the button
otherwise we display this message to the
user saying that their code was invalid
so that's all it is it's a very simple
program it's pretty much identical to
the Mac version in the other video only
we're using c-sharp instead of swift so
now what we need to do is we need to
download the software we're going to use
to look inside the app so the first
piece of software that might be useful
for reverse engineering is called
strings if you've ever used that on a
Mac on a Mac there's a command called
strings and when we run that it will
show us all of these strings in the
program so if we download strings
and we'll just extract it
so we'll copy that to our desktop we
only want string
don't want string 64 but because the app
we're gonna be messing about with has a
32-bit binary not a 64-bit one as for
the assembly code will be a lot
different in the 64-bit binary so what
I'm going to do is open the command line
I'm going to search for it hit enter and
there we go
now I'm going to see D to the desktop so
we can access the strengths program and
now we're going to do is we're going to
go to my app you can see there's the
visual studio solution we're going to go
into the folder my app we're going to go
into the bin folder which shows our
binaries and we're going to go to the
release folder and then we can see our
executable
now we're going to do is we're type in
strings space and then we're going to
drag in the executable
and then we're going hit enter
so what we just saw is ever
in the app printed out so what we're
going to do is just scroll up and what
we're going to do is we're just going to
have a quick look through the strings to
see anything we recognize so you can see
straight away there is the string the
test unlock button we can see unlock app
we can see my app we can see some stuff
we actually recognize if we keep
scrolling we can see more stuff we
recognize we can see invalid code the
unlock code you supplied is not valid we
can see the word unlocked and we can
actually see the three strings that we
have that are valid to our program so
automatically we wouldn't even need the
reverse engineer we could just try these
three strings to see if they worked and
sure enough they would all work but
real-world programs aren't gonna be that
obvious but looking at the strings is
still useful because what it does is it
shows us some of the methods we want to
use you can see there's the word unlock
codes and we scroll up again we can see
unlock button click which is a method
that we used we can see unlock app which
is another method so we can see methods
that are used in our program but we
can't actually do anything with this so
now that we've seen a couple of methods
what we can do is we can use another
program called il spy
it's a dotnet decompiler dotnet is used
by the majority of Windows programs at
any program written in dart net can be
disassembled and decompile using il spy
so what we want to do is download it we
want to download the binaries and you
can see there's the binary downloading
now and we also want to download
something called reflexive what it is is
it's a dotnet assembly editor il spy
will let us look at the functions but
reflex will let us modify them so we can
click download there takes us to github
and we can dilute reflux will fry us by
2.1 depends if and then we have the two
files downloaded I've already died
ordered them earlier and I have them
here in the il spy folder so what you
want to do is you want to extract iOS by
you to a folder and then you want to
extract reflexil to a folder and you
want to drag the contents of the
reflexive folder into the il spy folder
that's why this is here you can see we
have loads of axial files in the same
folder as il spy and then what you want
to do is open il spy you want to go to
the one that says application not the
one that has XML configuration even
though it says il spider DXE you want to
open up il spy and you'd see here it is
here now what I want to do is open up my
app so I want to go to open I want to go
to my app I want to open this folder
open the bin folder open the release
folder and I want to click on my app
which is our Exe I want to click open
and then we can see my app since it was
written in C sharp and it was written
using dart nap we can open up an eye out
by and I can D compile all the functions
so if I go to my app and then I go to
form 1 which is what we created in
Visual Studio you can see it looks
extremely similar to the Visual Studio
code it's virtually identical
and you can see this is where we're
comparing the value in the textbox to
one of the values in the array so
essentially what this if statement is
saying is if the value in the textbox is
equal to any value in the array then
we're going to say unlocked and we're
going to let the user in so essentially
what we want to do is just flip this F
statement to make it a not equals
instead of an equals and by doing that
what we'll do is allow anything to be
typed into the textbox I whenever the
user clicks unlock it will accept that
as a valid code so to do that what we
want to do is click on this plus beside
form 1 we want to scroll down and we
want to look for our unlock app method
that's this method here and we can see
it here so to modify this method what we
want to do is click on it here and we
want to click on this COG icon and we'll
scroll down a wee bit and here is the
line we want to change it's this equals
so we want to look through the
instructions and we keep scrolling we
keep scrolling you can see here we're
getting the GATT text which is this one
here we're getting the text out of the
textbox and then you can see here we
have this up equality this is actually
the operation that's doing the
comparison so what we want to do is we
want to add a dot so we want to right
click on it and we want to click Edit
and you can see the operand is the OP
equality we want to change that to in
equality because you want to invert it
so we want to scroll through this list
of methods but as you can see it's
directly below equality as you would
probably expect and we want to click on
up in equality and click OK click update
and you can see here what we've just
done is updated that method now what we
want to do is right click and say update
il object model we want to scroll down
here and as you can see what we've just
done is converted to this equals equals
into a not equals and that's exactly
what we want I know what we want to do
is just close that and we want to export
our binary so what we want to do is we
want to go to the my app aisle right
here at the top this thing with the blue
icon beside it we want to right-click on
it and you can see here are all the
reflux or methods that were added in and
what we want to do is want to click see
of ours this allows us to save it as a
dot exe and we're going to save it as my
app patched
and there we have it our app was just
saved and now it'll accept anything we
give it as a valid code so we want to do
is go back to our folder so you can see
here's my app and here's my app dot past
so the first thing we'll do is we'll
open up my app dot patched and what
we'll do is we'll just type in nothing
and we'll click unlock as you can see
the program has just unlocked that's
when we run my apt are patched when we
run my app which is the original
unpatched version it says invalid code
because essentially what we did was
convert this double equals into a not
equals and it in validated everything so
our validation is completely gone and
now if I type in that same code the
valid code it also works in the patched
version of the program and once again
I'll type it one more time and I'll try
to type anything I want click unlock and
you can see the program has been
unlocked so that's a quick overview of
how to really easily modify and
reverse-engineer a tiny program on
Windows for this method to work your app
has to have been written using dotnet
otherwise we won't actually be able to
decompile it with this program hopefully
find that interesting and you learn
something and that's it for this video
if you haven't seen the Marc version you
can go over and look at that now we use
a virtually identical program but we use
slightly different techniques to patch
it because we're using a Mac as opposed
to a PC so you can go and watch that if
you're interested there's links in the
description to all of the programs that
we used to actually patch this program
and to view source code and D compiler
and things like that in the description
don't forget to like our page on
Facebook that's also in the description
and we're also on Twitter now as well
and that's in the description too so
