learning how to create the users
profiles so to do that we need to create
a new page and that page is going to be
called profiles up PHP so now that we've
created profiles our PHP we want to go
to index.php and copy and paste stop and
that's going to be our template so we
just want to create a header first and
we're just going to set profiles then we
want to do up here and if we want to
check if the username parameter has been
passed to the profile
and we do that by checking Ghat username
so we want to check that against a value
in the database so we're going to do a
query
so we've done a query that selects the
username from the table of users and if
that query returns true we find the a
user and if it returns false we haven't
find them so what we want to do is if
it's true we have finally values or
otherwise die
we want to set user not find and if the
user is find we want to set a variable
called username equal to and then we're
just going to go to this query once more
and we're going to extract the username
go to the zero
item of your air that's returned and
then go to the username field on that up
here we want to just declare username as
an empty string to begin with and we're
going to actually just get rid of this
log in check so now that we know the
value of username what we want to do is
use PHP tags to acolyte username then
we're going to say usernames profile and
before this will work what we need to do
is change this from username to get
username
and then that way we're getting using
them out of the gap variable I know
we're going to try this and see does it
work so you can see no we're on the
profile we haven't provided it with a
parameter so we just get told this is
someone's profile but it's obviously not
so here we are on the profile page and
what we're going to do is put in
username equals Frances and you can see
it as Francis's profile if I put in a
username that is invalid it says users
are not fine so we're going to display a
list of the users followers on their
profile just like on Twitter so we need
to create a new database table to handle
app it's going to be called followers
and we want to create a row called user
underscore ID it's going to be an int
and then we want to also create one
calls follower ID and that's also going
to be an int and it was going to be
unsigned we don't want either them to be
no so now we want to go back to our
profile page and we want to create a
follow button so down here what we'll do
is we'll create a form
so here's our form and if we refresh you
can see now there's a follow button this
will make a click follow we want to
insert a row into the database
so down here below username what I want
to do is check if the form has been
submitted
and if the form has been submitted what
I want to do is first to check if the
user is already following that user so
we're going to run another query
so if the users already following that
user we don't want it up and follow them
again and then if we negate this we can
do it so that if they are not following
that user then we want to follow them so
then one another query
so here we're going to create the actual
follow in the database and we need to
get the user ID on the follower ID and
we also need to add on our parameters to
this query so here we want to get the
user ID first and then the follower ID
so our user ID is going to be equal to
and then as usual since we want to
of a value we want to get 0th index and
then we want to get the ID field so that
we have our user ID and then our
follower ID is actually easier to get I
want to do is a follower ID equals like
that so here what we're doing is
reflecting the user ID from users
depending on the username that's
provided to the profile page so in this
case it'll be Francis and that's going
to be our user ID and our follower ID is
the ID of the user that's logged in else
we can say echo already following so
let's see does this work
so I logged in as a different user if I
go to users you can see I created
another kind called hi code and I'm
logged in as hi code so what I'm going
to do is I'm going to click follow
we didn't get any output but if I go to
followers we have two rows we have the
user ID which is the user whose profile
is is which is Francis and then with the
follower ID which is Ho called so know
what I'm going to do is I'm going to try
and click follow again and now you can
see it is already following so there's a
couple of things we need to do to tell
you this up so to tell you this up we
need to create an unfold but n' and we
need to create a where to stop users
following themselves so it's a minute i
can go to the haiku profile page and I
can click follow and if i refresh you
can see now we have someone who's
following themselves and obviously we
don't want that to happen so in the next
part we'll be covering that I will be
covering the unfollow button but that's
it for this video don't forget to Like
comment favorite and subscribe don't
forget to follow us on Facebook and
Twitter we also have a subreddit night
it's slash are slash hi code but that's
it for this video don't forget to Like
comment favorite and subscribe and I'll
see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
