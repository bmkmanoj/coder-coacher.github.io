learning about a programming language
called C C is a programming language
that is one of the most popular still in
use today even though it was invented
way back in nineteen seventy-two the
reason for C being so popular is because
it's a small language it's easy to learn
and it's really really fast the reason c
is so fast is because any code you write
and c is compiled directly into machine
code machine code is the binary code
that your processor directly execute so
for example with the language like
Python it's sometimes criticized for
being slow because it's interpreted
python is a lot slower than C because
there's an extra layer of abstraction
between the actual processor and the
Python code itself Python code is
compiled into Python bike code and the
bike code is executed within the Python
virtual machine which is another program
that runs on your computer c is
different because it doesn't have a
virtual machine any code you write and
say is compiled Arachne into the machine
code that runs on your processor itself
so you don't have that layer of
abstraction in between the processor on
the actual code this is one of the ways
that c is a really fast language another
reason for seeing really fast is because
you have to declare the type of every
variable before you use it you don't
have to do that in Python because Python
and worksite the type of the variable
itself at runtime but see does all this
in advance when you can pilot so it
doesn't have to do any of that when it's
running which is one of the reasons it's
really fast so I've told you some self
by saying let's actually start learning
it so here I have a blank file called
learn C and this is where we're going to
put our C code so if I go to this folder
here you can see here's the file here
learn C and the first thing I'm going to
do is just going to make a basic hello
world program don't worry if you don't
understand what any of this does the
moment i'll explain it after i finished
so
sort of the basic C program and now i'm
going to do is I'm going to tailor to
iPod hello world to the screen so now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to run
this and then i'll explain it as line by
line afterwards so here i am the
terminal the way you run a sea program
is you compile it what i'm going to be
using as a compiler called GCC but if
you're on Mac the way you install the c
compiler is you download xcode and then
from xcode you download the apple
developer tools and then within that you
will have your c compiler on Windows you
can download visual studio or you can
die know the c compiler called min GW
I'll have links to all these in the
description so you can download them a
get set up really quickly so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to compile it
now so the way i compile it is i say GCC
because i'm using the GCC compiler then
i give it the filing of side called mine
learn c then what i can do is in hit
enter or i can give it an IAM for the
binary but for now I'll just sit down so
you can see that compiled the file so if
i click if i type in LS this will list
all the files in the directory so you
can see we got one called a doubt and we
got loaned see so learned out see was
the file that was originally there but i
wasn't originally there so if i go find
her again you'll see now we have an
executable called aired out out so if i
run this i run this by putting a dark
the backslash and then i type a dot out
and i hit enter you can see it says
hello world here there's no new line
because i didn't put a new line
character in on windows you'll get ed XE
so way you're running on windows as you
just put in a dot exe you don't have the
box the adult backslash on windows so
there we have it the program just run so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
back into the text editor I'm going to
put a new line so the way I put a new
line is I put a backslash and then an N
a backslash is an escape character so
that tells say that the next character
after the backslash is a special
character that it doesn't actually want
to output so this tells see not i put
the end but instead to treat this as a
new line so i compile this again i just
type GCC learn let's say run it that
compiles it
I type arrow again you can see now I get
hello world and as a new line between
halo worlds and the next part of the
command prompt so the first line of this
file says include stdio.h what that is
is it's a file that has loaded functions
in it related to input output stdio
stands for standard input/output then
what I do is I created a function called
min a mean is the function the c
compiler locks for that's the first
function that it executes whatever runs
your program so you have to have a min
function but don't worry about too much
for now the next line is print F this
stands for print formatted which means
just print out text to the screen print
F is stored within the stdio.h file and
that's why we can use it if I don't
include stdio.h I can't use printf
printf is just sort of the equivalent of
for example Python as a print function
PHP as an echo or a print keyword so say
just as printf then we return 0 I don't
worry about that for now but notice how
I statements in C also end with a
semicolon in Python you could type say
print you can just say hello world and
just leave it at that and it would work
but in seeing you have to have a
semicolon at the end of each state so
that's it for this video don't forget to

see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
