of the how to make your own social
network video series so what we're going
to be doing now is we're going to be
fixing the bug with the header with the
in a catalog in I mean the header
function here that sends us to the home
page for being logged in because it
keeps a again it keeps guys signing it
to it setting us to that page regardless
of whether we're there or not so it
never actually load and just get stuck
on a continuous loop so the first thing
I'm going to do is going to create a
variable called user name and I'm going
to set it equal to sashen the user
underscore login this allows us to use
the to use the username variable when
accessing the data from the session user
login and what I'm going to do here is
I'm just going to say a header location
equals home dot PHP and that should be
it so let's refresh the page now that's
in Frances password hit enter on the to
take is to hunt up PHP and it does and
it shows our username we go to home dot
PHP we change this to a CO username it
should give the exact same result and it
does and then what we're going to say is
hello username Lexie hello com username
and then what we're going to say is just
down here echo something else that's
just gonna break tagging actually I will
say would you like to logout I will just
say logout dot PHP
whoops live at HP and log out so let's
try that again
since hello Frances would you like to
log on I collect log art takes me back
to the next page and I'm logged out so
that's it for this video don't forget to
