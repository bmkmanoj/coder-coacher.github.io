video in the Python 101 video series and
today what we're gonna be doing is we're
gonna be going over mods operators
numbers on how to save a Python program
so let's get started so obviously this
isn't a Python program because I can
only do one line at a time
and I can't run multiple come on because
as you can see if I go up and I try to
type things it won't let me
so obviously this isn't how we create
proper Python programs so I'm gonna show
you how you do that now so obviously we
go to file and we go to new and new and
what this does is it creates and you
Python window except this window is
different from the original Python shell
because this window allows us to do
multiple lines like any other tax data
so I'm just gonna resize it okay so
obviously we can do multiple lines and
create proper scripts in this window but
you have to save your programs but you
don't and the other one so to save our
program we go to file we go to sea of Oz
and as you can see by default it says
localhost say and then python 27 so i'll
go to desktop and then as you can see it
says Python files and just up high and
up pyw
so I'm gonna save it as test 1 2 3 dot
pi and obviously you have to use the top
pi extension or you can use it up by w
extension so I'm gonna say what is test
1 2 3 up high and here it is here so
what I'm gonna do is I'll type in print
whoops
print and I'll just write hello world
and then ask me to mark so here's our
python script it's amazing obviously
we're just gonna click run module or ass
5 so what this does is it takes us back
into the original Python shell when it
runs our script which is exactly the
same as if we had to just typed it in
here
so agency it's identical the advantage
with this is you can create proper
Python scripts you can run them through
the Python shell look so none of them
that I'm going to go over with the main
point of this tutorial was mods and
numbers so obviously in Python you can
do mods so you can do one plus one and
gives you two you can do imp minus 7 it
gives you one you can do it - 9 it gives
you minus 1 obviously you can also do 3
times 7 which gives you 21 you can do 3
divided by 2 and you get 1 and obviously
on here we run into a problem obviously
3 divided by 2 is in 1 3 divided by 2 is
1 and a half the reason this is giving
us 1 is because in Python if you these
numbers of traitors integers because
that's what they are so in Python if you
give it if you divide an integer by an
integer
pythons going to give you an integer so
what you have to do is you have to
create a float because the flow can
handle decimal points which is why it's
called a floating point number so I flew
house you have to make these 3 numbers
into a float and we do that by just
typing 3.0 divided by 2.0 because the
3.01 3 are identical they're exactly the
same number except Python treats this
original one as a float I was an integer
divided by an integer and it treats this
as float / float because it has a
decimal point in it now you can also
just need about the 0 it doesn't matter
so what we're gonna do is we'll just hit
enter and obviously I was right in and
we get 1.5 but what if we wanted to find
the remainder so if we did three point
three point divided by two point it
works obviously but what if we want the
remainder so if we did three point /
if we did three point two divided by one
point six obviously we get when we get
to point let's no remainder so do three
point two divided by not poignant okay I
forgot I'm so about it this today all
right so two point one by by three and
here we go we get a long number so to
find the remainder we just could do two
point one and then instead of the devote
that slash for the divide we could just
do your percentage and then three and
this will give us the remainder and
watches add two point one so let's try
to get in with another number three
divided by two point five it's going to
give some one point two so there's our
answer and then let's see we have a
remainder so three divided by two point
five or not divided 3 and then
percentage sign two point five gives us
not point blacks while remainder is not
point five and that's basically it for
this tutorial that's and mods covered
and how does he have a Python script and
run it through the Python shell so if

going over variables modules things like
that so once again don't forget to
