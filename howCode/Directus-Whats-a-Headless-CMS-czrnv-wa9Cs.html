learning about some software called
directive directives is a headless
content management system so what that
means is unlike something like WordPress
which is a content management system
designed for a blog and it only works if
you're creating a blog directives is a
content management system that you can
use with all different kinds of projects
so directress makes it really easy to
manage your database because it provides
a customer admin area for your app or
your website which allows you to manage
your database without having to use SQL
commands or use an SQL client and what
it also does is it provides an API so
you can communicate with your database
much more simply you don't need to worry
about connecting to your database all of
that taken care of by directives so if
we don't want to manage our database
ourselves we can get directors to do it
for us but what we're going to do is
we're going to install their open source
software on our own server so I have a
digital ocean cloud server here and I'm
using Ubuntu 17 point o4
and I'm using Ubuntu 17 0.04 for this
video but you could also use one of
digital oceans one-click app templates
you can install directives on digital
ins lamp 16 point oh four and that would
save you have any setup page pay Apache
and MySQL yourself so before we can
install your access we have to install a
couple of things first we're going to
make sure all of our packages are
up-to-date
we're going to upgrade them
so we have to install Apache so we're
going to install Apache using apt
install apache2
and now you can see we have our
webserver installed so now we have to
install PHP and we have to install a
couple of PHP packages so just copy this
command
and those instructions say we just want
to run these two commands to enable PHP
to run on Apache
let me just say service Apache restart
next we want to install composer which
is just a PHP package manager and then
we want to install MySQL
so we have to give our RIT user a
password
and I we want to login to MySQL and
create a user that we can use with
directors so we do that by saying MySQL
- you root minus P and we provide our
password and what we want to do is
create a user so create user a collector
active at local hosts identified by and
here we just put in our password my
passwords just going to be password and
now we want to give this user the
required privileges we're just going to
grant all privileges star dot star to
and we're just going to provide our to
access user
so we run that and we flush the
privileges and before we go we have to
disable strict mode in MySQL because
drag just needs us to do that so to do
that we just set set global SQL
underscore mode equal to an empty string
that just resets the SQL mode I'm gonna
connected out of that so now we want to
do is Dino direct us so I'm going to go
into the directory where our webserver
is serving files from and I'm going to
remove the index file and now I'm going
to download directives from github so
direct this is an open source project on
github and this is the link to it here
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
download the source code so to download
reactors we just say get clone and we
just pass in the URL and we run that
so now you can see we've a directors
folder if I go into that folder we can
see all the files that director size so
now we're pretty much ready to install
directors so there are two different
ways to install it we can install your
actors by the command line or we could
follow the instructions in the Installer
so we're going to learn how to do both
but first we have to use composer to
install your actors dependencies before
we can do that we're going to install
unzip
because it makes composure much much
quicker if we have unzip installed so
now we're just going to set composer
install
so now we have all the dependencies
we're ready to act instead
Directive so if i refresh this page you
can see we have this folder if I click
on that it will open the directress
installer we don't want to have to go to
slash directives so I'm going to add at
my Apache configuration so if you just
go to this file and we're going to put
the document root to HTML forward slash
directives and while we're here we're
going to enable HT access files because
direct just uses lots of rewrite rules
so we're going to go down here we're
going to set directory
and all we have to do is set a low over
aid I'll save that and now we want to
enable mod rewrite which is the Apache
module that lets us use HT access so we
set a to n mo D which is short for
Apache to enable module and we're just
going to enable the rewrite module I
know we should be good to go so now
we're ready to install directives so
we're going to click Next we're going to
give our project the name the admin
password is just whatever I want my
admin password to be click Next and for
us we're going to say localhost and for
user it's going to be directives the
user we created earlier and the password
is going to be password so we have to
give a database name and we didn't
create one earlier so if I log back into
MySQL and I just say create database
directors exit out of that click Next
and we're almost good to go you can see
we have a couple of errors so to fix
these bottom three it's really simple we
just have to go into a terminal and
paste this in we have to change the
owner of the directors folder to wlwt's
the user that Apache runs under so if we
just run that and refresh you can see
those bottom three errors went away
so if I click install now now we're
brought to the directs login page and if
I try to log in using my admin login
details click login
and you can see now I'm logged in to
directors so now I'm going to show you
how to install it using the command line
because some people might want to learn
how to do that so in the directors
folder there's a folder called bin and
if I just run bin slash directors you
can see this is the directors
command-line interface so installing
directors using the command line is
really easy it actually tells us how to
do it so you can see no directors is
telling us how to install it so if I
first say install and I pass the
configuration details I need which are
config which is the DB host which is
localhost the database name which is
directors the user which is directors
and the users password which is password
so they hit enter and I want to set up
direct to this database so I just hit
enter now and now I want to install
directives and I want to create my admin
user which is going to be Frances at her
code org my password is going to be
password and for my site name I'll just
call it local so we hit enter that
should be everything installed can login
with my username and password once again
directors I'm not dating directors is
ready simple all I have to do is follow
these very simple instructions here so
