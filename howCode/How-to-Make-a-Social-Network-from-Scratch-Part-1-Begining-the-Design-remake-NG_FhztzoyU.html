is the first video in of the 14 remix
I'm going to be doing of the how to make
your own social network series because
in the first fourteen videos there was
actually this background music that
turned out to be copyrighted and I got a
copyright notification on my channel
it's not a copyright strike so it's not
the same thing it just means that
YouTube knows that they like they've
worked out the music was copyrighted I
didn't know what was at the time but it
obviously is so and also the first
fourteen video so this I didn't record
my own voice I use this really weird
computer software to do it so I'm going
to be remaking the videos and then
removing those old ones and hopefully
these ones will be higher quality as
well so I'm going to be remaking them
exactly as they were so they'll be
exactly the same just will be hopefully
higher quality because hopefully the
recording will be clearer and it's my
voice instead of a computer and there's
an annoying background music so let's
get started so at first thing I did in
the last videos was I created a pH
called index to HTML and this is it here
and obviously this is it here as well
and what I did next was I created three
folders so the first one was image now
it doesn't matter what order so image
CSS and then J asks for JavaScript and
then what I did was I pasted in the logo
and this is the fine friends logo here
load you can't see it because it's on a
white background but trust me that's
correct so the next thing I did was I
came in here and I started the actual
HTML document so let's start a nice
let's do a doctype and set it equal to
HTML and then we will create whoops
he had pigs and we'll create the body
tags next and the title was a fine
I believe so doesn't remodel let's just
do find friends so the next thing I did
was I created a new file I saved it as
let's doing here CSS and I saved it as
style dot CSS I believe it as matter
just SEO just say a CSS file then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to include
it so let's do link rel equals
stylesheet type equals text slash CSS
and then hit draft whoops we're going to
set this equal to CSS / style dot CSS
and then we can check that it worked by
just creating a style for it all or to a
start this means disaster between
Asterix means that anything within the
brackets applies to every element on the
page so I'm just going to set it equal
to Arial and I'm going to just put some
text on the rip way we'll know what's
working is because the default font in
the browser is Times New Roman so I'll
actually get rid of this begin with with
no over to our browser will refresh and
as you can see the font is in Times New
Roman we come over here we paste this in
and it should change to area which is
correct just means our style sheet is
being loaded correctly okay so then what
as I said margin and I set it equal to
zero pixels and I set the padding also
equal to zero pixels then I set the font
family to Arial and in the video I
actually just laughed it as Arial but
I'm going to set this to Helvetica and
then it sounds Sarah the son's son Sarah
isn't actually a fun it's actually just
a font family because you're supposed to
when you add at the end of every
whatever specify font you should look to
specify the font you want and then a
fallback and then well you can put as
many file blocks as you want but usually
people use to file box and then the
final one is any font within the
sans-serif family so ad that's just so
where you know that sounds hair isn't
the farm and then the final one we want
to do is want to say font size equal to
1200 I did 12 pixels so I'll just do
that again let's refresh and all we
should see as the tax got smaller and
there's no padding or margins around the
edge anymore
so the next thing I'm going to do next
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a class called header menu so I'm
going to say do whoops and if you're
using sublime text a quick thing you can
do is instead of typing in a last time
greater than David and in between it are
putting div in between it you put the
word Dave you press table and it fills
it in for you then I say class equals
adder menu then I want to come into the
stylesheet again and I want to set the
class header man I want to set some
style out to reach for that I add our
menu class the first thing I did was I
set the background color equal to okay
equal to 0 0 p9 and de that's the font
color I'm in the background color and I
set the height to 38 pixels it's at the
border bottom to none so 0 pixels are
not the same thing I set the padding
left to auto and the padding right
to auto and I also set the width to 100%
okay so then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to refresh and as you can see we
have the blue bar across the top now up
we did in the first video then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to inside here
create whoops the wrapper so I'm going
to create a div and give it an ID of a
wrapper and then within that I'm going
to create another Dave and it's going to
have the class of whoops let's set the
class equal to logo
then what I did is I went back into
satisfy and I said whoops hashtag rapper
for the ID so I got the ID app element
with yo sorry to get the element the
idea of robber so what I did now is I
set the margin left to auto and the
margin right to auto as well let's head
the woods to 100 pixels whoops not 100
1000 pixels measure the padding top to
zero pixels
on the padding-bottom - also zero pixels
now we're going to go onto the dot logo
class so what I did was I also set the
width of this to 125 pixels
and then I
I went into the dot I went into the
local class again and then went into the
image element inside our class and I set
that word to equal to 150 pixels and ice
at the height equal to 38 pixels so
let's go over here and let's put our
imaging so image source equals image
slash whoops just get name of it
in file type for the PNG so find
underscore friends underscore logo dot
PNG and let's refresh and as you can see
our logo appeared as it did last time so
that's it for this video don't forget to
