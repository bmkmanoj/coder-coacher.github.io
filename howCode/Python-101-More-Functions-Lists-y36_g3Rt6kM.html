going to be doing is we're going to be
going over functions on lists in Python
so as you can see in the last tutorial
we left off we had our basic function
called my function that when it's
returned hello space and then whatever
the parameter that was fed into it and
you can see now if we hit our 5 it runs
in the Python shell and it prints
whatever and our returns whatever
variable we give it so to get started in
this video what I'm gonna be doing is
we're gonna be creating our new function
and what it's going to be called is
maths so we can actually just get rid of
this function and in the last video I
said today to define a function or
create a function which is the same
thing basically all you do is type in d
EF and then the function name and I said
this one was gonna be called maths and
then obviously we give it the two
parentheses and then the code on like in
the last video so the minute what we're
gonna do is we're just going to tell our
function to return we could just say
this is maths function so if we save
that and we hit f5
we forgot to run our function why was it
so slow I don't really know so what
we're gonna do is we're down here in
print moths
save it again and we're just gonna hit
our five and as you can see it says this
is the moths function which is exactly
what we are told it to do so we can
leave this here print maths
down here and what we can what we will
do is we can say we can give it some
variables so the first one we'll give it
is num1 num2 and then we could just call
this one to underscore do it's known as
three variables so i love three
parameters and what we're going to say
is if if to underscore du equals M or no
way a let's say that then which is that
we just go down and we threw something
in our F statement and I'll go over if
statements more in the next video but
just copy as I do in this one so we're
just going to say print it and then in
here what we're going to do is we're
just going to say one two then a so a is
a a string so it has to be surrounded in
quote either double or single quotes so
now if we hit f5 so as you can see it
printed a I'm gonna give us none so
let's have a look so it says the printed
a but obviously my this is cause because
we didn't talent and else so we'll just
say L F which is like the same as saying
save Aleph and print hello so let's save
that a minute i-5 might not have been
the problem but okay invalid syntax so I
forgot so we just saw Aleph and then
that print hello now we got f5
okay so I obviously every all you have
to say I left to do F to do doesn't
equal a then we just print hello so if
we have five this probably wasn't the
problem so okay that wasn't the problem
but it doesn't matter so we're gonna say
here is a leaf doesn't equal a we can
change that to Aleph equals s then we
can just copy this and then paste it in
Aleph equals D I don't know where we
could do /no I'll just do day to keep it
simple and I'll explain this in a minute
and then um and then pow so I what this
is this is obviously a maths function so
Anna stands for odd a stands for
subtract Daisy stands for divide M
stands for multiply and POW stands for
power sort of like times by itself a
certain number of times so what we're
gonna do is we're just gonna say ass and
we should get hello and says hello
so what we're going to do is we're going
to say if to do equals a then we're just
going to say return num
plus num2 so now if we change this to an
R we should get 3 so if we had a 5 it
gives us 3 and the reason we got none is
actually because I told it to print and
we were already using print so we just
have to say return in the function so as
you can see it gave us 3 because it
added the two numbers in the function so
if we change this to a 7 it should give
us it so if we had a 5 gives us it so
now we know our function is working for
ad we're going to do subtract so we can
copy this change the return to - all
right change it so - is the numbers then
change it so it divides the numbers and
honestly now multiplies them and then
you add does them ^ them set of a yeah
well this means is it multiplies num1 to
the power R by itself a certain number
of times which is specified by num2 so
I'm gonna show you that so let's do 2
times R 2 to the power of 6 which is the
same as writing yeah yeah which is the
same as writing if you're writing math
you would just do 2 times 2 times 2
times 2
yeah that's it
so that's basically what it means so
let's delete that so we're going to
change this to POW and then we're gonna
hit f5 to add once it saves so if we had
a 5
as you can see it says 64 because 2 to
the power of 6 is 64 and now if we
change this to add a 4 divided 2 divided
by 6 is gonna give us a negative number
are not negative number you know see it
probably won't work
yeah it'll give us zero because what we
gave it was two integers and integers
obviously you have to be they can't have
decimals in them but this isn't our
functions fault the person doing it just
has to change one of these to a point
zero either this or this and then hit at
five and it gives us the answer so
obviously I don't need to change all of
these but I'll just do multiply so this
she gave us 12 and gives us 12 twelve
point zero because we converted the
first one into a float which converts
our answer and a float so there's our
first function well Sakon really but
it's sort of useful but there is
problems I mean obviously you can only
do two numbers and I would probably be
easier just to do
I don't know 3/2 if you wanted and then
you can do x u2 or whatever I mean it's
not a very useful function but it's a
function on the less so the next thing
we're going to be doing is we're gonna
be going over lists and well to avoid
confusion I'm just going to start our
delete all this okay so we're just
delete it all this and we're starting
with a clean document nothing in it and
I'm gonna tell you what a list is and if
anyone's familiar with another
programming language you'll work it out
pretty quickly so let's create a list
and call it let me say languages let's
just say that languages equals and then
when you're creating a list you have to
put it inside two square brackets and
then each item in your list is in is
added like this in between two single
quotes and then a comma to separate the
items and then two single quotes again
so that's their languages and I'm
talking about computer languages so we
could set PHP
see obviously Python JavaScript what
else is there
I don't know he's already language but
we'll just include it in this anyway and
then I don't know CSS so there's our
list of items it's if you're if you've
ever done any programming you'll know
that this is basically just an array
except you can tell us on the red
because if it was an array I need to
import the array module and there's a
few slight differences with the array
but lists are pretty much they're pretty
similar so here's our list and we can
print specific parts of our list so say
I wanted to print a part of our list
since light one just since we said
languages equals and then when you said
it equals a list then this is obviously
a variables so we print it like any
other variable so if we printed it in
here and then we in between a two single
quotes and then we hit f5 it prints us a
light or a prints out languages but
that's not one we wanted to print an
item of our list and then since it's a
variable we do it like any other so
since it's a list we have to put two
square brackets around what we want to
print and we have the talent which item
to print so you'll see if I hit 0 or
type in 0 now you'll think well there's
no 0 item because one two three four
five six there's six items so that's one
that's two that's three etc well in
computers since it's computers you know
everything works in ones and zeros and a
list for computers those LM think that
number zero is actually this which is
number one to us so they start at zero
so they go 0 1 2 3 4 5 so the thing
there's paint whenever I tell it to I
put that it like pop PHP so mean f5
it gives us a PHP and if I was to I put
even though there's six items in the
list since it starts at zero this is
number five so if I I put this and see
it first it gives a CSS and that's
basically how nests work so so what we
can also do is we can get rid of this
and we can say print Frances whoops
that's not a variable so print frauds it
no whoops we can create a variable
called Frances equals Frances then we
can say I print
Frances and then we can print specific
characters out of it so as he said this
will be 0 this will be warm this will be
two so if I said I wanted to print into
character one it should print are so
right at five it gives me heart so
that's basically an introduction well
sort of that's all you need to learn
about lists that's what they're used for
well it's not actually all they're used
for mean there can be used for other
things but that's just some examples and
that's some examples of functions so I
