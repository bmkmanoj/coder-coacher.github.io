remix of the art make your own social
network series and today we're going to
be doing is we're going to be editing
the profile page and hopefully finishing
it off so let's get started so the first
thing I'm going to do is we're just
going to change this instead of saying
user does not exist we're going to echo
out Oregon Tech marks and take them back
to the index page so if I go to a user
that doesn't exist let's go to Google
that doesn't exist so it should redirect
us to the index page and it does then
I'm going to go back to
let's go back to Francis so profile of
HP usually nipa status and what I'm
going to do isn't gonna I'm gonna paste
in this what to just go from the last
videos so as you can see it's not really
looking like good so lats
well sweetie I use the proper PHP quotes
are mean tags instead of the short ones
so as you can see it's as fast as his
profile but it's not the way we want it
at the moment but we'll fix that later
on I'm going to paste this down here
and I should say that it's not really
lovely not great at the moment 20 lose
I'm just going to paste this CSS code in
here I'm going to repress
not quite right so so just piss it
whoops more CSS coding to make our
profiles and look way better so that's
this refresh
I'm instead of the same problem okay so
I just went in I'm just going to go into
our header file and I'm just going to
paste in this divide equals wrapper so
this should just make everything fit in
better not quite but let's just go back
here
ah
let's set the width of this to 560 movie
and the width of this to 560
and as you can see now everything fits
in properly
and what we're also going to do is we're
going to say
Oh
we're going to say height:auto on the
operand we're going to get a video velu
so there are not everything F it's in
the way it should
on our profile pages so then the next
immunity days when they go back to the
profile pages
and we need to actually just nip the egg
PHP tags that should be almost it
okay so that's it for the basic design
of the profile page it looks like and
the next thing we need to do is we need
to use hitch T access to make our URLs
look better so let's create a new file
again now we're going to call it off HT
access we're going to paste in this code
so what this should do is it should
allow us to type in let's just go to the
the next page again
and if you just added the unit page
first so it's the next up HP and
we'll get rid of this do
there are no everything's like lined up
with the wrapper so what I'm going to do
is using the typing slash Francis
instead of slash profile of PHP and I
can see it brings up my profile the wait
did that is it used da HT rxf ad to rear
up to create a rewrite real I would
rewrite the first argument from the
profile of PHP your approval the PHP
page which in my case was a username and
it would allow us to use that in the URL
instead of the timing in profile dot PHP
question mark equals and then the art
first argument which in my case was the
username so just allowed us to get rid
of all out and use scientist swing just
hiding such classes do a slash Google it
should redirect us to them engage so
there it is that's it everything works
as expected so that's it for this video
