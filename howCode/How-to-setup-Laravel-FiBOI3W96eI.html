how to install laravel and how to set up
a really simple project because what I
noticed is there can be a few things to
get in the way the first time you set up
your larval project so we're to learn
how to install laravel and we're gonna
learn how to set up a project in this
video so the first thing you have to do
is install composer and the reason we
need this is because laravel has lots of
PHP libraries that it depends on and we
need to include those with our project
to be able to use laravel and what
composer does is it makes it really easy
for us just to dine at all them
automatically whenever we set up a
project so you want to go to the
installation section and for Windows all
you have to do is download the composer
setup.exe file for mac and linux you
want to download this installer it's
just a PHP file and then what you want
to do is just run PHP installer so if
the installer isn't a file called
installer you just want to say a PHP
installer so what you want to do is
download this file you can see the file
is called installer and once you
download that and you run that installer
file it's just a PHP script but once you
install that you'll have a file called
composer PHA are and what you want to do
is just run this command to install it
globally on your computer so if I was to
type in the word composer you can see
now I have composer installed in my
computer so what I want to do once we've
installed composer is we want to install
our eval so to install our eval it's
really simple all we have to do is run
composer global require we say laravel
installer and that will install laravel
for us and then we just have to update
our path variable so that we can use the
laravel keyword so after we've updated
our path variable we'll be able to use
the keyword laravel and this allows us
to create a new project so I'm going to
create a new project
so I'm just gonna call it hallo world
and we're gonna hit enter so that's
created our project you can see here in
my tutorials folder we have a folder
called hello world and here is all of
our laravel files so here's all of our
files that laravel needs and the file
that we upload to our public directory
on our web server would be this public
folder everything else isn't publicly
accessible so you can see here I went to
tutorial local that's the page that
serves our public folders so that's the
page we should be able to access our
project from but you can see I got a
HTTP 500 error and the reason we got
that is because we need to install some
dependencies for laravel so we want to
go inside of our project folder and we
want to run this command composer update
no scripts if we run that it's going to
download all of the dependencies that
laravel needs so now if i refresh you
can see we can actually have a web page
now but it says something looks like it
went wrong so the reason for that error
is because laravel has a special key in
its configuration and that key is used
for security of sessions and things like
that
and by default the key doesn't exist
because we have to create it so because
we haven't created at larvas giving us
this error if we go into our project we
go to the storage folder and we go to
the logs folder you can see we have a
file called laravel dot log and this
tells us everything we need to know
about the error so you can see it says
no encryption key has been specified so
your laravel project comes with a file
called artisan and it makes life really
easy for doing all sorts of things like
creating controllers and models but what
it also does is it lets us generate this
encryption key for us so if I type in
PHP artisan you can see all of the
things that lets us do but what we want
to do is generate a new encryption key
so you can see here under this keyword
you can see we have key generate so what
we have to do is type in PHP artisan key
generator and the first time we do this
we're going to get an error because we
have no tnv file because the file
doesn't exist but if I was to say cat
dot e NV dot example you can see here is
our laravel configuration file and up
here up underscore key is blank that's
what we want to set so what we want to
do is just say move dot e and V dot
example 2 dot env that will rename the
file from Ian V dot example to env I
know if we run our generate command
again you can see laravel generated
okay so here's what a project looks like
here's our env file and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to update the
database credentials so that we can
actually log into our database so the
host for me is gonna be localhost on the
database it's gonna be laravel the
usernames root and the password is root
so now if I go back to our project and i
refresh now you can see we get the
default Laval page because everything's
been installed and set up correctly so
hopefully this shows you how to set up
Laval and the next videos we're going to
be learning how to create some really
simple laravel projects but that's it
for this video we don't forget to like

see you next time
