learning how to do is we're going to be
learning how to create a URL shortener
so this is going to be a pretty short
series because we're not going to be
trying to create a room bitly we're
instead going to be learning the core
concepts behind a URL shortener so that
we can apply those standing other type
of project we have in the future so
three technologies we're going to be
learning about in this series are MySQL
I MySQL prepared statements and htaccess
those three technologies combined with
PHP is what we're going to be using to
create our actual URL shortener so
you're probably wondering why I'm on the
best faced website the reason for that
is because if I go to ordering.you
services and I go down to es da vici
domains you can see here on best face
now we're letting you buy one letter
ESWC domain Ian's the reason for that is
because if you're creating a URL
shortener you want a really short domain
name and unfortunately and basically
every single domain extension all the
short names are not taken except for
ESWC because if we go to the ESWC
website we try to register say just any
web any to that or domain name or even
less
it says domains has to be three
characters in length that means nobody
has registered and two letter domains or
one letter domains or anything because
you have to be three letters or longer
so what we're doing is we're giving
everyone the opportunity to buy one
letter ESWC domain Ian so it's a
one-time purchase there's no renewal
fees no expiry dates it's just a
one-time fee and I'm not domain is yours
for life so you can see here it's for
pardons 99p that is five dollars or four
euros and forty-nine cents thought is
the price of a one letter domain name
for life
if you click order now all you have to
do is choose the domain name you want so
here is just all of the one letter
domain names you just pick whatever one
you want and then you click on do carton
you can get it and then that becomes
your domain name for life you can do
whatever you want with it I just thought
I was as good a time as any to allow
people to register one night of domain
names because well the year
shortener obviously you want a short to
main you so that's how you can gather
one letter domain name from ESL VC and
if you don't want to get a one letter
domain name you can just go to yes the
VC and register and any other domain
name you want all of the domain names
are phrase so the only ones that cost
money are the one letter domain names if
you want to register to me and that's
three or four or five or whatever number
characters in length then it's all free
so here's my domain it's MnDOT ESL VC
and it's hosted on bass space as you can
see here this is the best space control
panel so what I did was I just
registered my instantly see domain name
and I went out on domains and decided to
do me and then that's how it works so
what we're gonna do is when we use best
bass to host our URL shortener that's
because it has everything we need to get
set up and running and actually hosts
our project on the internet so that's it
for this sort of introductory video if
you need any help at all just let me
know and I'll be more than happy to help
if you have any problems registering one
of the one letter domains just that our
best Vista 14 know and then they'll get
you sorted right and if you have any
trouble adding it as a domain name to
your current also just let our support
team know and they'll sort you out so
thanks for watching and I'll see you in
the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
