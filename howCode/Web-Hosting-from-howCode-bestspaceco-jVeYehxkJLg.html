something that I and a few people have
been working on for the past few months
so what it is is it's I'm sure you can
see it's a web hosting company so what I
find whenever I was looking for web
hosting was that and web postings
expansive and average company seems to
just offer the exact same thing as every
other company they have the same set of
features they use the same software and
everything is the same kind of supports
always terrible so when you have a
problem you basically on your own so
what I wanted to do was I wanted to
create my own hosting company and what's
different about it is that all the
hosting is really cheap compared to the
compact compared to any competitor you'd
be able to seeing you get so much more
value for money and the best space
that's why I specifically decided to do
it I wanted to make sure I provided the
most value possible and at the best
price
also there's a couple million a couple
of other people it will be some sort of
stand by 24 hours a day to answer any
questions that you have and finally not
only is the paid hosting there is a free
plan as well so what I'm gonna do is in
this video I'm just going to show you
the website and show you how to set up
your own hosting account with best space
also one more thing you can see it also
uses HTTPS to make sure everything's
secure and to protect our information so
if I scroll down you can see here
someone here's the hosting plans so the
free plan is 50 megabytes of disk space
500 megabytes of bandwidth one database
one email account and one subdomain the
micro plan is a plan that comes free
with every single domain name and it's
free for life so if you buy a domain or
transfer to me into bath space then you
get the micro plan for free forever from
it's not a monthly thing and just you
keep it forever so what it has is 100
megabytes of disk space 2 gigabytes of
bandwidth per month 1 minus QL database
one email account unlimited subdomains
and a dedicated ipv6 address and one an
ipv6 addresses is it some address sort
of like an ipv4 address but whenever the
world changes to ipv6 and you'll need an
ipv6 address to stay online so all the
a micro plan and above all have a
dedicated ipv6 address the tiny blonde
has 5 gigabytes of space and it's only
99 cents a month it is 20 gigabytes of
bandwidth unlimited subdomains 50
masculine databases and 50 email
accounts and I've done a lot of research
and that's better than anything I can
find anywhere else especially from the
big hosting companies then we have the
big plan which is only 249 a month and
it has 20 gigabytes of disk space 100
gigabytes of bandwidth per month 150
masculine databases 150 email accounts
unlimited subdomains an ipv6 address and
optional extras as well and the huge
plan has 50 gigabytes of disk space 250
gigabytes of bandwidth unlimited
databases unlimited email accounts
unlimited subdomains dedicated ipv6
address and optional extras and then
story $3.99 a month and the unlimited
plan has unlimited everything and it's
only $5.99 a month and this is a
fraction of the cost you'll find on
competitors websites so you can see if
we look at a competitor their starting
price is $4.99 a month and this might
look comparable the best base then
whenever you look at it it says
promotional price only and you have to
sign up for 36 months and then after the
first month the renewal rate is $5.99
but with best base the most expensive
plan with best pace is $5.99 and you got
unlimited everything and not only that
but you're not tied in to a contract you
can leave whatever you want you just
paid for monthly you just pay a monthly
also if you're not hon with your hosting
plan from best base you can leave way
time get a full refund if you leave it
on the first 14 days of your plan so if
I look at Hostgator we can see the
package type is Bailey which is the
smallest high plan they offer and when
you sign up for 36 months it's 30 it's
six dollars and 36 cents per month and
if you pay if you want to pay a monthly
like you did best space you get 796 and
that's for their smallest plant for us
for our biggest plan which is unlimited
everything it's only $5.99 a month and
you're not
tied into a contract so as you can see
we compete every competitor based on
price so here's a comparison table with
all the plans you can see every plan
except the free plan comes with 24/7
support which means you can send us a
message anytime the day and will reply
to you as soon as we can I will sort out
any problems you are having you can see
this is a full set of features for each
plan so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go back to the home page so you
can see here we also have security so if
I click here it tells you some stuff
about SSL Certificates if I click here
you can see we also sell SSL
certificates and these are just $9.99
and $14.99 a year which is much cheaper
than the competition offers for these
exact SSL certificates and also if you
want you can have a dedicated ipv4
address for just $2.99 a month
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to buy
a Dominion and I'm gonna buy some
hosting from best base so what I'm going
to do is I'm gonna buy Francis McNamee
comm so as you can see that's just that
only costs $9.99 per year and I can
register for up to three years so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hook or deny
and you can see here the default name
servers are these these are the two name
servers that best base uses so I'm just
going to keep them as the defaults for
now I want to gonna do some click order
hosting so here you can see our micro
hosting which is free with every domains
if I click this it's a free add-on I can
get it with every domain you can see
here it's free
every one tiny hosting as well that's an
extra $9.99 a month and you can see
here's all the different plans so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna buy a huge
hosting which is 399 a month which is
far far far cheaper than the competitors
hosting so what I'm going to do is click
order and what I'm gonna flick is a user
domain already in my shopping cart which
is this domain here France is McNamee
comm and I'm gonna click continue so it
says here it just shows me the billing
cycle which is $3.99 monthly and it
shows me as some stuff about the plan
what I can do if I want is I can click
this and it will give me a dedicated
ipv4 address but for now I'm just going
to leave that unchecked I'm gonna click
Add to Cart
so as you can see here I'm ordering huge
hosting with or for my France McNamee
com2 Mian and I'm registering Frances
McNamee comm for one year what I'm gonna
do now is I'm just gonna click checkout
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
look at the payment method which in this
case is PayPal and I'm gonna click
complete order
so it says please wait while you
redirect please wait while you're
redirected to PayPal so just give it a
second until it redirects so obviously
I've thought about this email address
and I'm gonna just put in the password
and i'm gonna click login
so then what I'm gonna do is I'm just
gonna click pay now what this will do is
this will pay for my domain name and my
hosting and this should set up my
account so like like return to pit to
best base and I click click here just to
speed it up cause it normally does that
and it says thank you your payment was
successful so whenever you create your
account you get an email so this is the
first email you get this is before
you've paid for it this is just when you
make the order it tells you that it's
unpaid Dan you got an order confirmation
email telling you your orders been
received and it would processed shortly
and then you'll get another one whenever
it's been set up so here it says I've
just got an email from PayPal and it
says I've received 1398
which was the price which was the price
of the hosting and the domain so PayPal
has just sent out two bath space and
what I'm gonna do now is I'm just gonna
wait for the next email to arrive so you
can see here it says it takes a few
moments for the transaction to appear in
your car
and you can see here if I go to my
account it says pending it's pending
because the best base software is
waiting for the transaction to arrive
and to PayPal and then as soon as the
transaction arrives in purple as soon as
the payment arrives in pepper after a
few minutes as PayPal says then the
domain will be registered and the
hosting will be create the hosting
account will be created so as you can
see it says pending searches just take a
couple of minutes and then eventually it
will say active so as you can see I just
got the invoice from bass face telling
me that the payment was successful and I
can see here it says my new account has
been created
so if I click view here so if I click
view here it takes me to my products and
services so you can see here it says why
posting it's huge hosting and it's
Francis McNamee com so what I can do is
and click view details and I can do a
few things here I can change the
password of the account I can buy
add-ons for the Econoline click few
available add-ons and you can see I can
buy a dedicated ipv4 address for the ax
card and I can click here and I can
upgrade so I can upgrade to unlimited
hosting if I want or I can cancel my
hosting account so if I could login to
cPanel it'll take me to cPanel and
cpanel is a standard admin area that Y
posts all over the place use and it's
the best admin area around that's why we
use it a pass space so as you can see
this is my admin area and this is what
happened this is what you get when you
register the huge hosting package so
here's all of the features I can use so
what I'm gonna do first is I'm just
going to go to Frances McNamee com
so I'll just go back here and click on
this and you can see it takes me to this
page here this is the default page for a
new Dominion and a new hosting account
so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna
click
whoops I'm gonna go back to cPanel and
I'm gonna click on I'm gonna click on
file manager what I'm gonna do is one
click show hidden files and I'm gonna
click go and here we are in the file
manager so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
create a new file us call it index.html
I can click HTML editor I'm just gonna
make a simple page so I'll say I'm just
going to write a hello world so I'm
going to write how I just wrote how to
world I'm fixed
you'll see down here it says
successfully save the file and if I go
back to index or I go back to Frances
McNamee comm you click refresh you can
see it says hello world so let's say you
set up your own posting a cotton domain
with bass bass you can also buy your own
SSL certificate so if I go back to bass
face you can see it uses HTTPS
one thing to remember is when you
register domain that you have to have a
complete set of contact information and
so for example you have to have your
first name your last name your address
your full address and a phone number if
you don't have a phone number then the
domain registration will happen so what
will happen is if you don't have a
complete contact information what Labin
is the best base software will take your
payment and everything and you will get
your hosting account all will be set up
but the domain won't actually registered
because it can't register it without a
valid a full set of valid contact
information but if you add that happens
just don't worry about it we checked the
orders multiple times a day and if we
say that a domain has been ordered but
hasn't been registered because of
incorrect contact information we'll just
send you an email and ask you for the
correct contact information and then
when you send that to us when put that
into the duel me and I will just click
register for you and we'll get it all
set up for you for no extra cost so
don't worry about it if it happens just
make sure you have a full set of contact
information if you're registering a
domain and if you have any questions
just go to the best space support area
you can go to tickets says I have no
tickets the minute
but if I open a ticket here's the
categories I can use and if I want to
can just email us here it says hello at
best mr. CEO if I click that they'll
open up in my email account and I can
send an email to best space so if you
have any questions at all about anything
just let us know we'll get it all sorted
right for you so that's it for this
video and actually before I forget
there's a special promo code called hi
code and if you use that you'll get 10%
off the huge hosting package for the
first month so thanks for watching and
I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
