what we're going to be learning how to
do is we're going to be learning how to
create our own hashtag system similar to
that of Twitter using PHP and for our
websites so this tutorial was requested
by this user on the hi code QA and he
asked if you can if I can show how to
make a hashtag system and I replied and
this is what I'm going to be showing you
how to do today so let's get started so
because I never get a hashtag system
before I just went over it for about 10
minutes or whatever to add just to see
the best way to do it and it's actually
really easy and simple it only took me
17 lines of code including the opening
and closing PHP tags so let's get
started so what we want to do for us is
obviously open up the PHP tags then what
we're going to do is want to create a
variable called string and this is the
string that we want to contain our hash
tag in so I'll just say this is a test
and we'll put the hash tag before the
test so this is a hashtag test then I'm
going to create a variable called hitch
tag and I'm just going to set it equal
to the hashtag symbol so these are both
strings and the rate we don't actually
need the second variable I mean we could
use we could do it same easily enough
without it but it makes things a bit
easier if we are into this variable
so we need to create a variable called
array I mean we need to create an array
and assign it into the array variable
here I'm going to use the explode
function in PHP to explode this string
and convert it to an array
so what we're going to do is we're going
to put a space here and what this does
is it says explode the array and so
using the space as a delimiter
in the string variable so this basically
means it'll make an array and then it'll
every time it sees a space it will know
that's the end of the array and so for
example in the array the first item will
be test
the second item will be is oops the
third item will be ah well ah I mean
obviously you got the rest of it so
that's the way this is going to work so
if we set print underscore R let's say
okay whoops that's a string we need to
use the array variable
then if we refresh the page now we'll
see that we've split up the string into
an array and these are all different
elements within that array what we want
to do is that we want to count the
elements in the rest will set a RRC
which is the array kind which is what
the C means it means cut is going to be
equal to the current function and then
we're going to give it the parameter of
the first array so it'll kind all the
elements in the array so we should get
four if we say echo ARR C and then
refresh the page we should get four so
we get four ecwid artists on the page
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create a generic variable just called I
and this is just a variable going to use
in our while loop here so I'll just go
down a bit more so this while loop what
it's going to do is it's going to
iterate through the array and it's going
to check if any of the items in the
array and have a hashtag at the
beginning of them so it's a really
simple idea basically we're just getting
the string splitting it into an array so
we can search through the array or mean
iterate through the array with the while
loop and then every time we find an item
in the array whose first character is a
hash tag then we're going to convert
that into a link so you can click on the
hashtag so now we create our I variable
we're just going to say while I is less
lips.i is less than ARR C which is the
kind so this basically says is y 0 is
less than 4 the first thing we obviously
want to do is we want to increase the
variable by 1 so that this where the
loop doesn't last forever the loop only
loops through each of the items in the
array so now we're iterating through our
read with the while loop we need to use
the sub STR function within PHP to check
the first character of each item in the
array so we're going to the F stem and
obviously to check if something is true
and we're going to say I web sectional I
where it says sub STR arr
and then we're going to access the index
of the eye very well so basically each
time the array lives through the first
time it loops through this is going to
be 0 the next time it'll be 1 then 2
then 3 so we're going to check each item
in the array and this is how we access
an item in your
right we put the Iranian two square
brackets and in between them we put the
index of the item in the array that we
want to check I mean we want to retrieve
so we've retrieved that now and then
we're going to put the flips we're going
to say comma zero comma one and then
just get rid of so this will start at
the beginning of the item which is in
this case if for the first time we run
through this this will be the word this
so basically saying if sub STR this and
then this means the first character
which means teh and then this means most
we start at the first character or and
then end after the first character so
this will just get the T from the first
item in this case which is this and
it'll check if that begins with hashtag
so then what we're going to say is
equals equals equals whoops edge tag so
this means if the first character is a
hashtag then what we're going to do is
echo and arr
Arri which means we'll get a co the item
in the array whose first character is a
hashtag so let's refresh and we see it
it says hashtag test but none of the
other items in the array are accurate so
are we going to all we have to do now is
we need to say reassign the the arrest
we're going to say ARR and then the
square brackets in the I which basically
means the array item we're going to set
that equal to the same thing again so
we're overriding it but we're keeping
the same information we're just adding u
data onto it so we're just going to
append a link
whoops a link on to the beginning of it
and so it's going to link to nowhere at
the moment and then we're going to end
the link so now that we've actually
finished messing about with our our
string we're going to convert it back
into a string because up here we started
with string we converted it to an array
and I we did and we did whatever we
wanted to do to it in this case we
converted or we converted the hash tags
into links then we're down here what we
want to do is we convert it back into a
string so we're going to set the string
variable again equals arr
our website actually implode this
basically sticks the Irate r6e array
back into a string so what we're
basically converting from a string to an
array and here we're converting the CM
array back into a string then we're just
going to echo string so let's refresh
and as you can see it says this is a
hash tag test and the hash tag test is a
converted to a link and this works for
anything in our string so we could say
our code is great and this won't be
converted to a string we could say and
then we could actually end it as well
with hash tag code code or is the best
or whatever so we're just putting in
whatever we want in our string it'll
work with everything we just refresh the
page and as you can see everything's
fine except the two words that start
with a hash tag I'll convert it into
links just like on a website like
Twitter or whatever for example so we
can do one more thing we can make this
into a function so what I'm going to do
is I'm just going to delete this string
variable I'm gonna say a function hash
tag
oops I'm just going to end it down here
and we're going to give it the vibe or
we're going to give it the parameter of
string so this means we can use this
anywhere on our website and it should
work fine we're just going to go down
here and we're going to say hashtag
string and this will or whoops we don't
to use the string we want to provide it
a string so I'm going to say my code is
thrift I go to web section and you spell
it wrong go to a high code.org it's the
past I know so we're just gonna say
something like that and we're going to
refresh but as you can see no it's blank
that's because we didn't tell it to a
quite the final sort of product in our
string I mean on our function so we just
want to go down here and say echo
hashtag so we'll AK with a hashtag
function and whoops
okay I simplify things we're just going
to say echo okay the reason that didn't
work will just go back is because we
didn't return the string so I'm going to
say return string and then now we can
echo it out so it says how good is great
go to hike or gets the hashtag best so
that's it for this video don't forget to

I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
