we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be
going over creating the channel settings
page and as you can see obviously I've
change the color scheme again because I
think I might have actually been a bad
idea to change it to the gray I think
this just makes the colors and all just
fit in a bit better I don't know if you
prefer the other way just let me know in
the comments below and I'll fix it and
change it back but um I think this
probably is better so that's it for the
intro to the video and let's get started
so as you can see here I'm on the
members page and I've got one channel
and I can click on it and it will then
load and let me view it and I can just
scroll this around and I can subscribe
on subscribing things and but we can't
actually change the channel like upload
images and change the color of it or
anything so we're gonna do that now so
we're going to go back to actually the
members page and I'm going to add a new
link left we'll go to channel settings
dot PHP which is that the file we
created in the last video okay so I'm
here on members dot PHP and here's the
first link so I'm just going to put a
space and then or is it where I'm gonna
put in the straight line and then I'm
just gonna put another link in and this
links just gonna go to channel settings
dot PHP we're going to end that link and
in here we're just gonna say channel
settings and then we're just going to go
back to the web page and refresh you can
see we have a new link that says channel
settings and it takes us okay so the
channel settings page let me have a look
okay so we didn't give it an argument so
it redirected us to the index page
because here we can see we are taking an
argument in the URL so if I was to go to
index dot PHP our main channel settings
dot PHP and give it an argument it lets
me see it so and if I was to yeah I take
this away yeah you can see it redirects
us to the index page so what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to go to the
members page I'm going to give it an
argument which is equal to the channel
name so channel underscore nyan so now
if we go to the members page we have the
mouse over here down in the bottom left
you can see the URL on it links to
creative code if I click on it it takes
us to channel settings page and we can
see that it's correct because it gets a
quote up there so that's it now for the
mammaries page we can go to the channel
settings page nine and i'm just going to
delete this aqua channel mmm and what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a form so the form is going to be
it's gonna have an action of channel
settings type PHP c equals channel we
actually need to surround this in PHP
for a PHP block and then echo the
variable then we're gonna set the method
equal to when we can actually copy this
from the image upload page because this
is gonna be the image upload form for
the channel so if we were to go down to
the bottom I think here we have here we
can just copy this from here on and go
to channel settings and just oops yes
sit in there
just like that so this name is gonna be
channel BEC yeah it's fine
so we'll just change this to upload your
channel image and upload channel image
will actually say channel icon because
I'm gonna have banners and things as
well so if we refresh now we have a form
and to the upload channel icon and then
we can go to the upload image page we
can copy all this so if we were to just
copy everything and go to the channel
settings page and just put a comment
here so the channel icon image load
script you could even put this on a
sapper file if you wanted then use
object-oriented PHP to use it as a class
I'm you know bring it in without having
to redo it but I'm not going to bother
so I think this should actually work all
except for we don't want to update users
we want to look update channels so I
will just comment that out and here we
want to just change move uploaded file
to channels / images / icons okay so
what we need to actually change
something here because that's a good
folder to put the a child icons in but
not the profile image icons so we're
going to leave this the way it is and
the image upload script we're going to
change this the directory it checks and
moves to two users / images / icons and
the users / images / icons and we need
to go to the members page now and just
to change that I think scroll up and
change this to users and users
and aki-nee to go back out of the
channels folder and create a new one
called images to hold all of our I
called users to hold all the users
profile images and really other damages
so it's users and then in its inside
users it's images then I think it's
icons let's have a look
yep it's icons so now we're just going
to go to members dot PHP and obviously
our image won't exist because we changed
it so I'm gonna go upload em in stop
page opinion I'm gonna upload one it
doesn't really matter which I upload so
I'll list upload defaults
image is uploaded successfully go to
members and there it is and the reason
it didn't show me default image is
because the default image isn't in that
folder so I'm just gonna copy default
out of this and paste it back in here so
now if I was to delete my profile image
I would still I would just be shown the
default one which is this yeah sorry
about that okay so now what we're gonna
do is we're gonna go to add a channel
settings and we have an hour so line 44
channel settings you go down to 44 so
okay it says unexpected and so that
means we left out one of these probably
so something's not quite right okay what
we'll do is we'll just put another one
in just to see what that if that
actually f don't you delete one let's
refresh
so I still got unexpected end so we'll
put the back in and another one and here
it is yeah we were just missing one so
I'm gonna go to choose file and I'm
going to upload the search icon and
click upload channel icon the image is
uploaded successfully if I go back to
data and I go to channels on images and
icons I actually okay I'll empty this
folder and we'll do it again because
it's hard to tell if that actually
worked so we'll just do it again upload
the image choose search icon and click
upload channeling or icon so go to icons
we can see here we have the image we
just uploaded and that's good not means
we can use it so if we were to go into
phpMyAdmin 9 okay so here you can see
we're inside of phpMyAdmin and i Sneed
out and you call them to the table at
the end of it to store the channel image
so channel icon and you can't remember
the length of it so I decided to 255
which is the maximum length for a bar
chart and our tables been altered
successfully but I won't be able to
create channels because well I'll show
you so we will create channel dot php' I
try to create one so I okay let me check
Y dot okay yeah it didn't actually
create now you can see we
one channel and the reason for that is
because when we are the new road to the
table the column count another column
current for the child and actually March
the query we did when we create the
Charles so we go to the create channel
page and always to do is add an empty
column here and that should be it that
should be a most illogical great
channels again so if we go here and we
go towards let's create channel dot PHP
and we type in a channel nyan now if I
click create channel let me go to
members you can see we have our new
channel and if I click view shows up so
that's it all fixed an eye on the
channel page we actually want to display
the image we uploaded so we're going to
go to channel up HP and here it's really
easy I what to do is add another row in
our while loop so add channel icon and
channel icon and then since it's on a
wild lip now we can actually refer to
this variable and it will take the image
out of the database and we actually can
check did it go in
so now if I movie haven't actually
uploaded one so that's all denied or
codec oops almost upload an image so
search like ok and just thought we
haven't actually done that yet so if I
go to channel settings we need to
actually run come with this on opt yet
I ran usually query to update the
channels table to associate the uploaded
image with the channel that's being
uploaded for so we go to channels are we
up to the channels table we set channel
icon equal to profile
we didn't actually change any variables
so it doesn't make sense here but it did
in the image upload script and it's just
easier than changing it
oops and we're being so look we're a
channel me and let's do that so Y
channel name equals channel and that
should be it
so now if we go here and we were fresh
and we pick another image to upload so
search icon when we hit upload to upload
channel image if we refresh the table we
can see we have two results but and not
just shows we are and we have our second
channel there but now you can see if I
scroll across we have our second image
uploaded on its associated with this
channel so what we need to know is
actually just display it on the channel
so now we can refer to this so we can
just copy the variable name and choose
the image source to data for ya data
forward slash let's have a look okay so
that's data four slash channels for
slice images forward slash icons forward
slash and just echo it right you sit
there and dollar sign and there we go so
now if we go to members on me click on
view channel here's our image let me go
back to members and me channel settings
I'm come up with another one so default
pic we upload it it gets uploaded
successfully you can go back and here it
is here so that's it for this video
