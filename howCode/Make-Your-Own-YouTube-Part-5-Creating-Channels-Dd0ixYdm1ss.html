we're going to be doing is even when we
finish the registration pages what we're
going to be doing is we'll be leaving
the profiles for the moment because I
want to actually that people create
their own channels so as you can see we
have the Mavericks page here and then we
just have a blank page called create
channel dot PHP here and if we go to the
members page it's blank
um database has one table so I haven't
done anything so what we're going to do
is we're just going to come on to the
members page and we're going to say good
paragraph actually we're just gonna say
I know where welcome to video box it
looks like you haven't made a channel
yet and then we could just say you just
create a submit button so I what type
equals input type equals submit the neom
it's gonna be create channel and then
the value is going to be click here to
create your and we just say click here
to create one so now if we refresh the
page I didn't say it's quite clean but
we're gonna fix the style mm-hmm after
we get the general coat on we're gonna
go back and fix up this part of this
that or these parts of the pages because
I think the menu is practically don't I
mean there's nothing more we can really
add to it but these pages need a bit of
work so as you can see it says click
here to create one on the clock here
we're going to be our going to take the
user to the create
channel page PHP so here I'm just gonna
create a form so we'll have form so the
form action is going to be create
channel dot PHP and then the method is
going to be post and then that's all we
need to do there so then in the what was
it in the PHP code always the type is if
is set
if a sex host or a post green channel
then we're just going to say a header
how to remove kitchen and then create
channel top PHP so what this says is if
the create channel button is pressed so
if someone clicks that button then we're
going to use the header function in PHP
to redirect the person to create
channels on PHP which is this channel or
this page here so I'm just going to
write here this is create channel page
then we're going to refresh so now if we
click click here to create one it takes
us to create channel dot PHP and we see
the content of the pH here so we're
pretty much done the manage page for the
moment we'll come back to it later for
the chance and only create channel page
I'm just gonna include the adder so I
can see here now with the header and
obviously we're going to create a hitch
to tag that says
create your channel and we're gonna let
people create more than one channel
we're gonna let them create probably
like a max move five or something
so they can have more than one channel
associated with our current so we're
going to say form action equals create
channel dot php' method equals post
input what type equals text my name
equals channel name and then value
equals the value is going to be equal to
give your channel a name and then on
click is gonna say value dot
alright value equals and nothing so when
they click on the box the value gets
reset so as you can see it's we have a
text box here that says give your
channel lynnium when we click on it it
empties a text box
I'm actually going to increase the size
to I don't know 40 the marks like it's
gonna be I don't know 32 characters so
now if we refresh or just hit this again
we have our box we're gonna have a
submit button underneath or at the side
it doesn't matter so we can actually
copy that from this page and paste it in
okay so what we're gonna say is just
create channel no
we have our create channel button beside
it so what we're gonna do here is we're
just gonna check if it's being submitted
correctly so once a if obviously if is
sat post create channel then we're going
to print on up and echo echo and printer
for the same thing basically so it
doesn't matter which one we use but I'm
just going to say you know our channel
is being created and we're just gonna
refresh so now if we click create
channel size your channel has been
created but obviously it hasn't because
we haven't given created a database yet
so we're gonna do that now
I just zoomed out so you'd be able to
see better so we type in create a table
actually called channels now we can
planet the fades so obviously we need an
ID to uniquely identify every channel
you need a channel name and then I
create created by and dant created so I
there's four fails we need when this
loads the first fail I said was ID
second channel name third I created I
and then the final one was the date that
the user created the channel so it
created channel names of arch are
created by a bar chart and then date can
just be dead to keep things simple large
our length of both of these is only 32
characters
and we're going to autoincrement the ID
and set it to primary and we're just
gonna click Save
so now the channels table has been
created we're going to go back to work
on our form so what we're going to do is
we're just going to create a MySQL query
called current channel equals my
scallops
nice job query insert into channels
we're okay inserting two channels values
so we're gonna say insert into channels
values so I do you can leave empty
because it's Auto increment channel name
is gonna be equal to okay we actually
need to create a thought so if we say
channel name equals post shaumyan
so that just means whatever the value of
the channel name textbox is will be
assigned to the channel in the in
variable and that's it really so we just
need to put in here channel name i
what's next i created by so create it we
can leave that on i for the loop and
then the other one was just did so do
you think was did we use the date
function and then we use we tell it how
to form updates so we your mom
and here I created by is the user
variable I think and then dated all this
going to be the t8 variable so then once
that's created we're just gonna echo
your channel was created successfully so
now if we come back to this page and we
refresh it I'm gonna create a channel
called range of code that if I click
create channel your child was created
successfully but we mistyped channel
name but it should still have gone into
the database so as you can see that went
blue and it wasn't blue already so that
shows that I our row must have been
added
it says approximately 1 total so that
means our road was definitely out it but
the only problem was the child me and
variable so we just need to spell out
correct let's spell this correctly and
we'll do the checks in a moment so what
I'm going to do is when we come back out
and we are going to drop not drop empty
yeah this table so what that will do is
just gets rid of everything and now we
create our channel we don't get any
hours and we going to the channels table
you can see here we have a channel
called creative code created by Francis
and then today's date so that means it's
creating the channel successfully what
we need to do some checks to make sure
that the same channel doesn't get
entered more than once
so let's actually do that now so what
we're going to say is if channel name
equals
channel name TV then back ooh that
channel already exists and then or else
that's the only check we really need to
do is to make sure that the cha wasn't
created already now we need to do so no
need to make the channel me embark on
the MTB variables so we're going to
create that long so channel name debate
equals mysql query and we're just going
to say it select channel name from
channels wire channel name equals whoops
where's it here our telling me me closed
channel name and then we just need to
say 'numrows equals mysql num rows
channel name baby and then we just have
to say if num rows equals one and echo
that channel already exists or so that
actually that's all we need to do but we
could also say okay no that should work
anyway so I'm just gonna explain what
this does so at this query
just says select the channel name row
alright select this column actually from
the channels table which were in here
where the channel name is equal to the
variable channel name so it will select
the column channel name from the
channels table where the row in
underneath the column our channel name
equals the same as a channel iam
variable which is whatever is typed into
this box
so we can try that like 9 so if we
refresh the page and now if we were to
say um me because we just yeah okay
actually it should work if we were to
type in creative code again and click
create channel says that channel means
okay we've got a problem
okay so we're creating the channel but
we're at we are realizing that it's it
already exists so that's good that shows
that it's working so here we're just
going to check that by echoing channel
name TV so we're gonna try to get in so
okay we have a problem
but um do that accidently go back to the
way I was but the reason that was still
going anyway is because you can actually
rid of this because we need a mouse
so by deleting this if statement because
it's redundant basically because we
don't need it because we have this mom
Rose check because what this does is it
checks the number of rows returned
that's the number of rows returned
equals 1 then we echo that channel
already exists and what we need to do is
we just can delete this if statement
isn't needed and then what this does is
it makes a complete if statement so now
we have F from rows equals 1 that child
already exists or else create the child
so that book should be gone so what were
to do is we're going to actually change
this from equals 1 to doesn't equal 0 so
that way if I have any errors when we're
inserting or creating child's this code
still run but if we ever had a problem
and channel going to insert it twice
then this code wouldn't run so then no
matter how many times the channel
existed it would be created over and
over and that would just be a hassle
though we don't need so to save time in
the future in case we ever run into
problems we're just going to change that
so now I'm going to go back here
I'm just empty the channels table again
and now we're going to actually try and
insert a channel again so I create a
channel I make create channel your
channel was created successfully if I
try to create it again not channel
already exists and then now if I try to
create one that doesn't exist so what
Francis and it says your channel is
created successfully so if all this code
worked we should have two rows in our
table mine and there which says
approximately two and here they are so
that's it for the
video don't forget to comment like sorry
don't forget to comment like favorite
and subscribe
well that's barely basically it and in
the next video we'll be finishing this
off and on the members page we will be
displaying people's channels I'm going
to be removing this message if someone
has a child and I will probably be
imposing a limit on the amount of
channels you can create so that someone
can't have a million channels so that's
it now see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
