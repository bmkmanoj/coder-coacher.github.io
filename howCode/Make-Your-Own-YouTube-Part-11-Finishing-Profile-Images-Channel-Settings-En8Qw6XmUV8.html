gonna be doing is we're gonna be
finishing off the profile image upload
script by associating the image that was
uploaded to the account of the user that
uploaded it so that's all gonna be doing
today
let's get started so as you can see here
I'm on the page and if we go to the
folder you can see it's empty so what we
need oh and I actually forgot to say as
you can see my cursor has this yeah like
a yellow circle around it I think it
might improve the quality of the videos
a bit but if anyone doesn't like it just
leave a comment let me know and I'll get
rid of it but uh let's get started with
the video so since I have no images in
the folder I'm gonna upload one so he's
gonna upload this search icon and click
upload image as you can see that script
run perfectly and here's our image so
what we want to do is we want that to be
associated with the logged in user that
uploaded it so that's not too hard to do
so the first thing we need to do is we
need to create add table inside of our
database and this tables going to be
called oh no we don't even need to
create a table actually we can just go
to the users table go to the structure
and if we scroll down and we add a new
field on the bottom of it alright okay
I'm more in here we create the column
and we're gonna call it profile pic it's
gonna be a bar chart of length okay it
doesn't matter we're just said 255 and
that's it I'm we just need to scroll
down and click Save so that's it's saved
and if we go to the Browse tab now and
we scroll down we can see here we have
three users and none of them none of
them have a profile picture so what
would you do now is
when we move the uploaded file to the
folder once we've moved though we need
to associate that with the user so
that's easy all we need to do is create
a mask I'll query so we can set query
equals or we gets an associate yeah I
probably spelled wrong so I just say
just a a sock like the shortened version
profile neck equals mysql query now what
we're gonna do is we're just going to
say update the name of the field was
profile pic so say profile underscore
pic oh no it's
whoops it's update that users set
profile pic equal to and we give the
profile pic the name of the name of the
image so in our case we should create a
variable for that so we go up here and
we just a create a variable called
profile picture equals random directory
I thought we just append this onto the
end of it so just say that in a pendant
okay what might not actually work I'll
just get rid of that and the easiest
thing to do is say a profile picture
equals random directory
no okay I just over come here to this so
you could say image name equals dot and
then you could say profile pic equals
random directory docked so add the dot
just means append and we just appended
image me and variable and then in here
we just say profile pic and then we
could I just echo alright actually died
success we're good to say image how the
image was uploaded successfully okay so
now if we try it again and we upload
default pic and we had output image the
image was uploaded successfully which
means all our queries are M all our code
is run which means this query run so now
if we scroll down across the user
Francis okay so yeah we've got a bro
problem we just need to change this
query a wee bit so the moment we told it
to update every single user with the
weather every single user and set the
profile peg equal to this and that's not
what we want so what we're gonna do is
we're just gonna say where username
equals user so what this will do is that
she just update it for that one person
so if we put in line at it one these to
delete that comes a big top and it's Eve
and
Cu and up and then save again and
actually look we can't just delete this
sum as well okay so we've done that and
what we're gonna do is run to upload the
image again so we're like choose file
and we're gonna upload the fine friends
logo we're gonna click upload image and
it says the image was uploaded
successfully so now if we go to the
icons folder we can see our new image
and
if we go to our users table and we
scroll down we should say whoops not
only the user that was logged in as that
profile image so here it is here's the
image and that's it really uploaded on
its associated with the users account so
if we go to members we can actually
display this here so we will go to the
members page and we will just create a
query so we will send members page and
actually up here we'll create the query
so we'll just say get profile pic equals
mysql underscore query select profile
pic from users groups where username
equals user so that just gets their
profile pic and we're just gonna say if
whoops num rows whoops
profile underscore pic equals mysql num
rows cat profile pic so we're gonna say
is we're just gonna well actually
there's no point having the num rows
because numbers is obviously always
going to equal one but for the moment
I'll just leave it in so we'll say if
num rows profile pic equals one which it
should then can we do something and I'll
then we're just gonna echo unknown error
so echo or instead of AK we'll just to
die on
ah so a dot should never actually happen
but if for some reason it was to happen
then then we can act with that so what
we're gonna do is we're just going to
say and while while row equals maestro
fetch associative and what we do here is
we just put cat profile kick then we
just say profile pic equals row profile
okay so let's try this nice so if we
just echo profile pic you can see here
that that worked and we get our code the
contents of this field but we don't want
the contents of it we want to just be
displayed as an image so that's easy all
we have to do is just say it's just test
to run this in double quotes so that's
easy now we've surround it in double
quotes we just say image source equals
profile pic which is I actually not
quite right but it's only doing so add
the image source does not equal profile
pic it equals I think it's Donna /wel
since we're in okay no we don't need to
do that
never mind so it's just data forward
slash images or a channels images and
then icons so data for such channels
slash images slash icons and this should
be all we need
so now if we just refer
we got our image jacket but since our
image is it's actually just white so we
won't say it so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to upload another one so just
go to upload whoops so we were to upload
em is a PHP and we uploaded a file so
that's default pic now we click upload
image the image is uploaded successfully
we go to the members and here it is so
we're going to do is we're just going to
set a default height so we can set
height equals 120 pixels and if we
refresh now it's a lot smaller and we
want to do is want to have it a default
image so if you don't have an image
uploaded we give them a default one so
so that's actually pretty easy all we
have to do we just need to run this
within within an if statement and we
need to say if profile pic equals
nothing so if the VI column is empty
oops then we don't want to swim in that
it's so empty we we despair the default
one or else we give them their actual
profile pic so there we have it and for
the their own crew topic all we need to
create one for their profile pic if they
don't have one so I'm just gonna copy
this and I'm just gonna change this to
default dot PHP and that's it that's all
we need to do but in here obviously we
need to create that so I'll just copy
and paste this image one of these on
this will be our default one so I'll
just change this to default PNG
oh wait it's a JPEG so we need to change
that actually default type jpg and here
jpg
so now we shouldn't actually see any
change because it's the same but if we
were to go to the users table just
refresh it to make sure that it chooses
the most recent version and we go to in
line at it and we scroll across only
delete this scroll back and see if it we
should again see no change
so we out where our script isn't working
so if we just like to click this copy
image URL and paste it up here now we
hit go to the gloated object not fine so
we need to see why it's not being formed
okay so where's the actual image it's
deep it's actually called default jpg
update yeah dot jpg we don't want that
so we can just rename it just didn't
fall because it's already a jpg so now
as you can see it's been fixed if we go
back here and refresh our image gets
displayed to us and once again if I go
to upload image dot PHP and I click file
or choose file and I upload image oops
there and then that becomes my profile
image well not profiling
well yes but we haven't actually
associated it because that's only for
the profile as I'm actually associated
with any channel so we still need the
channel and image upload so what we're
gonna do now is we're gonna create an
added channel page so new what it's
gonna be called is added alright set
channel settings top PHP and obviously
it's a PHP file so we need PHP block
like the members page we scroll up
and like every page really we just
included the Hatter to give it style and
down here we're just gonna create a
header to tag that's just gonna be
called channel settings okay
and in here what we're gonna do is we're
gonna say add channel channel equals get
oops
get oh it's alright I'll type today I
get just SC and then we could say echo
channel so now if we go to channel
underscore settings.php we get a I'm
gonna find it next because we haven't
that variable isn't actually being used
because what this does is it extracts
they say in the URL there is them
because well it extracts the C after the
question mark so it will extract
anything after this so if I was to say C
equals test it will extract the word
test after the display but what we want
to do is we want to check that that's
actually a real channel to that we're
just gonna go down a bit and we're gonna
say a channel check equals my query I'm
just gonna say I select all from
channels where channel me and equals
channel here we and then here we said
num rows equals MySQL num rows channel
check
and then here we just say if no whoops
equals zero then we're just gonna
actually redirect the user so we use the
header function on redirect them to the
index page else we actually want to just
say echo channel so now if i refresh we
get redirected to the index page but if
I go back to channel settings I change
it to creative code we get I display a
creative code so that's it for this
video don't forget to Like comment
favorite unsubscribe
in the next video we'll either be
finishing the channel settings so we can
display the profile images works or or
the channel images even when we upload
them because that'll be easy all we have
to do is just copy the code we used for
the profile images and just change it a
wee bit just to ass upload it and store
it in a different folder and things but
it's really pretty much the same and
will either be doing the channel
settings or uploading videos next so
that's it for this video don't forget to

I will see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
