story's and I made this using our UI so
I could have used a JSON dear cell but I
actually use the UI and I'll just flick
to the UI to show you that name okay so
here you can see all the left hand side
this is this is the website and on the
right hand side it's like a wizard paint
and it just guides you through it so I'm
going to go into review the recording
that I've already made you can see that
I've recorded something already record
it again so I just clear that it record
and so what we're doing in the app is
we're tracking what's happening so we
can analyze that and then work out how
to do the extraction later and how to do
the playback so I can enter an English
postcode in here do a search and you can
see that it's tracking the actions that
you make on the page so I can stop that
quite happy with that I can play it back
I see ya that's exactly that's how I get
to the data and then I can move on one
of the things that we're doing in our
next release is we're very tightly
coupled at the moment to the freebase
schema some of you might know freebase
google acquired them oh well quite metal
web and we use that schema as its
creative commons is the basis for our
schema but we allowing people to extend
that but in this instance here i'm just
going to map this input to something
that's within something's within the
schema existing okay and so that's my
input so my input is mapped to name and
my outputs I've got a couple that I've
added in postal code and name and now
what I have to do is all I do is add in
test cases so much like if you were
programming and you were writing unit
tests you define test cases and these
test cases then help us do things like
also heal the connectors
so if the website changes we can then
look at that website and look at your
tests and work out how to change the
extraction without you actually having
to do anything about it and that's
something that we're actively developing
at the moment we've got the first
released video now and I think that's
going to be something really powerful
because the ones constantly changing but
if by looking at examples we can see how
to get the dates back and how to change
that for you automatically it's going to
be real simple Plus these examples then
we monitor them and we do run them every
day and you can sync you can be notified
as if they start to fail so I'm just
going to add an example so I've put in
an English base coat to a query it plays
it back so yeah I've got I've got some
results okay scroll down page so here my
results so I've already met these but
i'll show you how you do it really
quickly it's a learning algorithm so you
give it examples and you can give it
can't resell enforcement putting that in
the UIC and it learns and extrapolates
based upon what you give it where it
thinks resolve bangers are so you can
say and this looks a bit like firebug
you can see that so so right so that's
that's one result and that's another
result if you see that it's got all of
the different results and it can
extrapolate that and you can work in
fairly simple examples or it can work
and much more complicated samples wait
we're looking at quite complicated
patterns in the HTML and and then I can
start mapping my actual fields they want
to pull a so the thing that I've mapped
here already is postcode and you can see
that that's highlighted on the left I'm
going to map a ball so map name I'm
going to map something else so i can
just demonstrate this to you so i just
clear those examples
I going to map the opening hours by so
the opening hours on a monday so I want
just the opening at there you go so I
give it another example and it's going
to start to external into a give it one
more
yeah and what is doing in the background
effectively is taking a set of examples
and counter-examples generating rate
expressions next parts and you can
effectively do that in the DSO yourself
or you can let the you I do for you so
this is very powerful for business
people people who you don't have the
ability to actually do that for
themselves but it's also more powerful
because we can look at these examples
and then do the auto hearing was talking
about before so once you set up enough
test cases you can publish it to our
service and you can access it using the
api's so for example this this box here
this runs off the rest api so you can
see that you know these these are the
examples that I've taken eight and this
is the Jason's come back there are
cookies that come back from when we are
navigating through the site to get to it
the URL of the page and then each of the
results that come back but then you can
also mix that say with other store
locators so let's say I just search for
the cater here okay so these are lots of
different shop locators that we've kind
of Matt and built so and connectors for
so I just stand in a few more there go
down it's actually two different
postcode types that's been mapped to so
I just tried that one as well worried
that I just just depends it normally so
I just sorted by number so you can see
the ones coming back
I'm just
some of them have no results but they
know you can see that snack returning
results over the messaging API and the
message log here shows you all of the
comic messages they're coming backs and
forwards and we have client libraries
that help you integrate that into your
indoor applications so I'm just going to
switch back quickly to my slides and
finish okay so things that we have
coming and even better auto healing I
talked about that a bit we we put a lot
of feedback about the client libraries
that we've done and we're continuing to
improve them the tool that you saw we're
iterating on that a lot there will be a
new version 8 soon and that's going to
have a table view your el patents more
advanced editing if you a power user
within it we also are constantly working
for get more examples and documentation
blog posts so at the moment we're in
close Developer Preview we we need
developments to help us and so um we
need feedback including bugs including
you know what's good about the api's
what's bad about the AP ice and you know
all feedback as good as far as we're
concerned and and also other things like
dsl's the way we're using to to do this
we want this to be a platform that
developers love and really want to
integrate with you know I'm a dead
myself and I hate writing lots of
integrations I've had to rip you know
I've had to write thousands to different
types of data source and and I really
wish that it was simpler and so that's
what this is about it's about trying to
make it simple for people to integrate
with lots of different types of data to
give you a consistent interface to query
against and so that's why develop a
feedback so important so if you go to
our website at import I oh and you sign
up while you request to be signed up
into it can you put the hash tag up and
we'll try to get you in as quickly as
possible you can also drop us an email
hello it imports iron ore on twitter or
i'm on twitter as well and if you have
any feedback you know that would be
great so unless you and thank very much
Seleucus you're still enough say don't
force it on dell patmos it means that
you can squeeze the advertisement on the
website i don't i don't quite understand
again you went to predators our website
to be the same information which was
updated without the adventures okay so I
so you can yeah you can expect age from
a website we do have the ability for
people who own the website to a two of
you own the website to say no and to
block however you know we have a longer
vision for this about people being able
to monetize data like if you've got data
that people want to use you should be
able to monetize it like you can for ads
today and hopefully we will get there
but this is the first step at the moment
you know we're just really focused on
trying to make it simple form for app
developers and for business people to
access lots of data and Andy's my
personal goal would be for the people
you know don't have to write so many
integrations to configuration over
recoding and when it comes to getting
data what I will talk Matthew and used
to export that
so the format that comes back is in
Jason don't know what you mean what you
can access you you can get the data from
us in Jason and then you can do whatever
you like with it so I mean we have we
have people who we have for example an
XL connector so you know if you want to
put it into Excel directly you could and
we have dotnet libraries that we're
going to release for that and admit you
know or you can put it in HTML or you
know we have functionality that allows
you to copy it to the clipboard so you
can paste it I mean three depends um
it's meant to be really flexible really
where a platform we're about providing
an API to people what people want to do
with the data you know hopefully people
could make cool things and you know
we've seen a number of people do apps
and that have kind of one you know
competitions using kind of data from our
site and that's exciting because that
data it wasn't easily accessible before
and and it would have taken them too
long to get to it so it's saving time
and made it easy yeah I mean it's it's
elastically scales this patent pending
technology that means that you know the
same technology is used by people
service and millions of requests and a
day on quality hardware and so you know
we are constantly trying to push you
know our load testing on on ec2 to see
dijo el scale often and we can scale
better than people who provide data so
it's not problem for us so much yeah so
the comet API is lock polling and people
sometimes ask why not web sockets
because it's buggy and at the moment and
also the support for proxies is bad but
yeah I'm you know that's the kind of we
have a vision of of using messaging
api's the architecture that we have
isn't tied to comment and one polling
but that's what works best today so
that's what we use today we will
probably have other implementations I've
been playing around with the stomp
implementations like in my spare time
and will you know if things become
popular will release you and guys like
you very much oh so there's no more give
us location it's a very question so the
is a premium model so if you are using
up to a certain quota like most things
it's free so the idea would be to let
developers and startups use it for free
and then when couples get bigger they
have to start paying for it and pricing
models you know I think I don't think
where is starter pass out we've been
going like for about a hundred year and
I and we're trying to work that and work
that I'm that will be something that
comes out the next is you oh no I think
you'll probably be I think I'll probably
transaction no I think we will be
transactional as in we will probably
look at the throughput that your
question for our service and that's I
mean that's how it logically would make
sense because you know our costs are
relative to the load that you putting on
the load that you're putting on is
relative to the number of queries that
you're doing or the number of kind of
amount of processing power and that's
normally about you know related to the
number of pages with processing so I
don't know but as an engineer and that
would see much at the moment we don't
wear wear like a pass-through we don't
provide caching ourselves however and
this is a question I get asked a lot and
I'm really keen to get feedback because
one of the things that we could do is
look at how we in men some kind of
client-side caching of results within
our libraries and being able to use
things like vocal storage and but you
know if you've got feedback on that
please tweet me and I don't area okay
guys okay thank you if you who want to
talk with Matt on the soul okay you can
just reach reach ah not so menu for what
I guess what Khan says they step up on a
purely speech I'll it up a little down
there except an application to be honest
part of the products a visual designer
sample to put a uniaxial you can do one
opposite actions about estimating makes
you believe yourself happy no you see a
lovely like them we do not take on the
new participate movie book came standard
with 34 can see you okay this one more
thing uh says lesson free t-shirts they
kind of like first compressor but we
soaked so everyone yeah I'm get okay
okay thank you very much let's see
