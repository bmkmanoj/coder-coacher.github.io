name is cookie we are from team flying
go our appt ensures that passenger never
flies alone a passenger journey doesn't
start and only with passenger but it
starts with defense and family who pick
up or drop of the customer same time
it's also about the airport and airline
who is going to service the customer so
we see the problems and then we go to
the solution yeah and I would like to
say okay this is all about the passenger
problem i am busy with my work i don't
know at what time should I start what
should I take why a train car taxi which
parking to choose this all is my problem
and now we'll show okay what is the
solution for all this problem yeah so we
start basically our applications could
not do it based on the geolocation so
he's going to track you real time so
basically you add your flight and we
tell the context based offer so we can
find out where you at that position and
we tell to cust you that your flight is
in another one hour so you have to go to
the boarding so various offers based on
personalized will be shown there yeah
that's the short trailer the movie is
about to come thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
