the starbucks load to car for every kind
of small business so they can have us a
loyalty card on the phone and consumers
can use that to pay in the score
dusek to the two so ladies first hey I'm
pipe see
ok
Jeff
so we spent last night and little bit of
this morning working through some wire
frames if you like take a look at them
we can show you what we've got to so
these are all in the planning order good
night this is not the front page and
this is this is the front page of the
merchant so you can see the merchant can
create a new card and you can see cards
that the merchants created the cards
have the name of the business type of
the business and matching can upload an
image which you can see they're great
we are planning to build a single
prototype app so this app actually
communicates between a client a customer
hand and retailer but we're going to
build that all into one place because
we've only got one phone two demo one in
front of the judges we're going to run
up on the screen so we're going to wrap
everything up into a single app but
we're going to have an app that allows a
matching to create a card that allows
much and to send a pledge to reply to a
customer and then allows the customer to
pay with that card and imagine to
confirm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
