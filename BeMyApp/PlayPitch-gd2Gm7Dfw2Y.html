currently play pitch and the idea is
that you can use your iPad to play an
instrument and have direct instant
feedback on whether you're playing a
song correctly or not okay it'll play a
real sheet music so you can learn how to
read real sheet music while you're
learning here in stone
hello Pearson right now I'm working on
some to iOS code to to record in some
day I'm trying to work a little better
on the device right now we've got code
that works in a simulator
the device and over Travis Bosco he's
currently working on our pitch
recognition algorithm he's got quite a
task yeah and uh making progress on that
hill is currently working on marketing
for high making this out of a monetary
reality Ivan in the white is a currently
working on logos and some other art
along with the more monetization
strategies open and huge high elven hi
these guys are working on the UI to turn
our pitch recognition into software okay
they're making very rapid progress so
how's it going let's check your
whiteboard
yes oh wow once this is going to be our
avatar he's a lion with a curled main we
haven't come up with a name for him yet
he's going to be probably named after a
classical composer he's going to start
out very happy while you play and kind
of get a little upset and you don't play
the right note to get some some real
abstract feedback on how you're doing in
the program
alright so by tomorrow I'm hoping that
we can demonstrate a real song vo play
is owned by possibly multiple
instruments which will ends demonstrate
real-time feedback on whether you're
playing this on correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
