the smartassness team basically we are
developing an app which is going to
provide maximum convenient to the
passenger who is entering the airport we
are considering the passengers who are
on transit was going to depart who is
honorable so we are going to provide
recommendations to the passenger based
on context for example if the passenger
has only a less minutes to go then we
are going to guide him right to the gate
or if he has little more time we are
going to guiding few shops and offers
going on in the shop and if he has
little more time we are going to guide
him to broil in more events so that he
can go go out of out of the airport and
he can enjoy his journey it is not only
going to benefit the passenger but also
going to avoid the queue so that he is
not going to wait in the queue for a
long time near the gate or the chicken
