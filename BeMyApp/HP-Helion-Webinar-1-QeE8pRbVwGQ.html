some tradition to kick the ball of wax
which is again Rico hello can you hear
me thank you so much and thank you for
Nando for your introduction my name is
Erica gate Ani
I would for HP and it's a big pleasure
for me to kick off this afternoon Jesus
of webinars organized by my lap and my
welcome is of course on the Alpha of
Intel and HP you know that we
collaborated to the production of these
webinar series and in particularly we're
pleased here to kick off the first one
that is all about OpenStack you know
that Intel and HP are strong partners
and we are collaborating in in a number
of different activities in the IT
industry and we jointly to organize this
a series of webinar to share with you
our commitment in the open source and in
particularly on OpenStack and this is
because both Intel and HP are Platinum
members of the foundation we hold the
seats on the board of director but this
role I think that most importantly we
really represent the commitment of Intel
and HP organization on these platform
Intel developers er work with the
community to expose Intel hardware
technology to OpenStack software module
and to extend the new prosthetic
technology to
with security compliance I have ability
manageability performance and of course
the end user experience overall with
fear working with the OpenStack
foundation to develop the HP Helion
OpenStack distribution with the intent
of really accelerate and facilitate our
customer experience that are using or
going to use the OpenStack platform for
their workloads so let's say that thanks
again for your participation on behalf
of Intel and HP and I hand over now to
my estimate called like Christian Frank
for the technical representation hello
things and we go thanks for the kind
introduction
Chris Frank I work for you the fuck out
him in the cloud pre-sales team and
that's been with OpenStack pretty much
for the last three years so I main role
is within HP to build and design how
it's based on OpenStack and also bring
OpenStack into what we created in MIT so
having said it I think we need to start
with a water key statement if you for
she could advanced aside please
thank you wonders of modern technology
we haven't sir oh one less exactly thank
you
the cloud and at the board's bedstead
2hv is making here we say is like the
cloud of the future will be based on
open-source what does that mean at one
point we stopped developing our own
cloud software we stopped developing
things that were run only on HP hardware
we stopped developing things that only
work with HP software we decided the
future of the cloud is open-source and
waiting open-source the biggest cloud
project is OpenStack by no means it's
not the only one but that's the one
where we took the big math and science
like everything's Howard's going forward
will be based on open Jack next if we go
if a company like HP goes open-source
what does it basically mean we said we
have to set up some some core principles
I don't want to bore you with all the
details but that he is wherever we do we
commit back to trunk and the second
thing is we do not forc
so we have no intention of creating the
separate HP branch of OpenStack and as
we go on through the presentation we
also have no intention to do that for
boundary also the goal is for us and
it's a clear commitment to open-source
and the goal is to be to stay true to
trunk and rate as much back as we can
next so the first question usually
arises is what is OpenStack I'm a help
of things a lot of things there's as
many front pictures out there showing
then it's a myriad of projects it's now
part of what's called a big tent
projects in but in as its
or what OpenStack does it takes the free
core resources that you have in a data
center which is computing networking
storage and manages that and I've
managed it through software meaning that
if you need a new computer and need a
new network segment or need a new volume
of disk it's OpenStack who goes out and
provided for you either separate or
together and that's what open state does
it runs again set of services and then
runs on top of standard hardware and
standard however means in our case of
course the HP proliant serious when you
move one actually on whatever you want
to and that is true for all the
distributions of OpenStack it brings a
dashboard where you can look into the
consumption of your originals is where
it can initiate Weezer's requests such
as deploying a deploying sequential
machine or deploy network but there's
something that it does not bring which
is pretty important and that's mentioned
there is under your applications next so
and it makes it very clear
OpenStack is not open take a second
operating system can run up the cloud
for you but it does not provide services
they that you normally associate with a
cloud from an end user perspective so
this no file-sharing there's no calendar
synchronization so OpenStack is not on
cloud you can run on cloud on top of
OpenStack as one of the applications
which is actually a nice fit - you get a
together working cloud on a working
environment for for your employees
co-workers co-students
partners and then the local socket up -
to share information with great
OpenStack is just taking care of the
infrastructure anything that has to do
with applications comes later so what's
the end of today we'll start looking
into into applications because
infrastructure is becoming more and more
kind of commodity but as far as
OpenStack is concerned and for the next
couple slides please keep in mind all we
do with OpenStack and we take care of
infrastructure next why open-source it's
agile it's the biggest project
open-source project in the world right
now
it has a governance body that's truly
multinational month multi-core per wheel
so to speak so it has influences from
all over the world from all major
companies from smaller companies and
with having the biggest set or area of
developers available it is really fast
and really quick it has
and that is not short truthful for all
of the open-source projects can have
long-term vision
it's very strongly focusing on API so
making sure that everything the platform
does can be done from api's constantly
at the eyes with long-term support and
there's a strong focus on in know
probability so within this open source
community we at HP we do have a place
next next
yes and which is basically saying are we
aware one of the or one of the leading
contributors I'm not going to bore you
with with the details I just want to go
on to my favorite slide of cloud just
briefly sorghum's next yes pencil
capital if you haven't heard about it
then they could for two years if you
have heard about it and think you know
back to sleep for about a couple minutes
is that the key of understanding cloud
is to understand the service model
behind cloud and the idea of services
behind OpenStack and also it's very
important to understand the service
model once we go into application space
we look at traditional systems in ite
and I think this is happening for a long
period in my life
your machines you tend to lovingly named
them give them like or echo cluster zero
one on Oracle whatever and si P so and
so you have individual machines with
individual tasks individual operating
systems individual uptime needs in
individual schedules
and if one of them fails the main focus
is to get them back to health North a
but exactly that machine when we go into
the cloud space things change so the
machines that actually the worker that
deliver that deliver the results to the
end customers they are not individual
anymore there's a lot of machines that
do exactly the same tasks that
communicate using message buses that
have no state information whatsoever
inside except for things like databases
or message queues which allows us to
basically how to kill or lose these
worker VMs if something happens it gives
us the ability to to scale as we need to
if you are a simple the example they're
usually called as Netflix although there
are no on OpenStack we're just imagine
there's a Netflix Super Bowl halftime
advertising probably all available
machines me to stream that mine goes
back down afterwards
so what we are talking here is about
scale outs the ability to rapidly scale
to rapidly provision new machines to
pick up a certain tag if the need is and
drop it if the need goes away so as we
go forward to try to keep that in mind
from where OpenStack comes from and
that's the area of of capital meaning we
are very good at deploying a lot of
machines in a very short time we are
very good at deploying loader loads of
machines talking about hundreds and
thousands of numbers
opens tanks 42 look after single hi
available machines that's not a judgment
saying though everything has to have to
be Barry capitalist the only way to go
and legs are bad no no it's just if we
talk about clouds if we really want to
consume cloud resources or you need to
understand that the applications behind
can actually provide whatever you need
whether it's data streaming file sharing
web your eyes they need to follow
certain principles that turn them into
cattle and one of it is statelessness so
that you actually can lose a process and
nothing happens coming back to Netflix
and I know affiliates working with
Netflix they have groove bad and that's
called the simian army the simian army
is a set of tools that includes the
chaos monkey and the chaos monkey is
basically a software toured that runs
through the entire infrastructure and
cures processes and services and if the
chaos monkey runs and the end users have
no interruptions then the platform is
okay right so it is that's the idea of
the catalog of a security and high
availability numbers and then
statelessness that's the key thing that
we need to keep in mind when we talk
about cloud so let's have a brief
at traditional applications next so look
at traditional apps think how how do you
actually get an get an app out there
many Lea's have a template your
provision your services you configure
your infrastructure install all the
runtimes and the more complex the
application gets the more want and she
will need you to get your services to
define monitoring you define a Jenny for
that particular application and then
once you're finally done you're happy
with testing you push butts and and run
pretty cumbersome and it's still I mean
that's where we decide between
traditional and cloud native apps it's
still at a point where we're looking at
a law or individual steps next cloud
native apps whether you run them on a
pass or not how create in the way that
they are that they no longer meet
dependencies so if we look at a path
like foundry or row base or even
traditional Java applications or Ruby or
Python a cloud native application is
self-contained and as the word contain
which in probably and a few slides will
lead me to the world of containers and
then to doctors but it's self-contained
and that's where the key starts it gives
the developer the ability to
stood out who is there normally no
dependencies to resolve one some is of
course testing to be done that's a
matter of process no but we think the
technology allows you to develop guilty
application you push the code out and
then the services on the cards then the
platform that runs it takes care about
scaling provides the redundancy informed
of runtime environments and he'll
whatever whatever fate night before the
node and let it be just the chaos monkey
switching it off to be able to do this
again we need to be stateless and we
need to have a system in place that
manages the dependencies next so if we
what does it do for us there's a big
transformation
we go with the cloud if we go cloud
native there is a bonus scale out so the
ability that OpenStack and an account
software gives us Steve is the ability
to to scale scale in numbers to go from
a hundred web front-ends to a thousand
web front-ends in no time because there
is a new TV series out there's a new ad
running so you need to get get your
front and supported eats get tenfold
increase of service so we're no longer
talking about an up or flex up that we
had in the virtualization world where we
says like ok we add a new virtual CPU
and to be good by a virtual Ram that's
not it's not all we're to talk in our IT
area with an open stack we want to do is
talk about scale
open-source yes
we've covered ads if you have a lot of
machines that you know of simple
services it becomes actually simple and
distributed there is a those people
using the word micro services at this
point we had generate to avoid a lot of
the development on cloud native apps is
driven from the grassroots meaning that
feeds it's not decided by like a
steering committee of an IT world but
finally decided by nine of the owners or
group of students says like oh look this
is a cool app when i'm i don't i
organize a something like sharing
sharing bam breakfast rooms and you can
happen to get an Airbnb platform out of
it
what's our last key is api's all of this
only works together if you have
documented and stable NPI's if you have
them you don't need to spend a lot of
coding hours into integration the team
out of this mess a key change when you
go clouds that affects you the
application you know scaling simple to
route and micro services and everything
is run around PP is next next just skip
that one
good what's our vision and which is
think I need to speed up a little bit I
like to talk what's our vision we we
envision that ite and the world
Ruby led by developers we believe there
will be open source based
and be all about data so the key things
that we want to look at going forward is
developers open source and data data is
the one part that we all have see what
won't be covering today but probably on
the later stages of the webinar next and
as I said open source developer net open
source based if we look at all the key
things operating systems the server-side
desktop site server side is Linux based
now by great margin web service almost
almost more than half more than for bio
based on open source projects either
patio engines the world biggest content
management system is WordPress so
there's millions of really reliable
really good open source software out
there and that is that is key that will
drive the world we believe next and we
have very famous supported believing
this even the President of the United
States agrees that if you want to leave
a footprint you need to be able to code
so that's coming back to where say
whether we believe in developers and
development and also in an open source
that is actually not a photo
LinkedIn video which we are not going to
play but I'll just fall for copyright
reasons that's a YouTube video next it
let's go a little bit deeper free things
that we that we need to fall kind of
free words or terms that we need to talk
about at the bottom of the cloud if we
build out from infrastructure if you
want that you run something and make
money out of it
the core is a infrastructure well we
kind of believe that this is something
that we've covered we've done it many
times you know I want to do it the
operating system for the infrastructure
of choice first its OpenStack next once
we go up in the chain that's where the
development comes in that's where the
platform as-a-service now that we
decided to go with proudly resides where
you have an environment that supports
the languages of our time PHP Ruby Java
nodejs whatever whatever you want
the foundry works very nicely together
with docker and there we are back making
back to what ten minutes ago I was
talking but the containers and more than
containing nerves and risky things with
a package that contains the dependencies
the whole idea behind going over to the
platform as a Services is that every
time you push out an application every
time you deploy an application you've
automatically resolved all the
dependencies that frees you from any
breeze
any patching needs that freeze-freeze
you from an e-version control
we just know at the point in time
because it's self contained in a
container pardon the pun
it's it will work so that takes a lot of
worries about it
away from from application developers
and then on top of that next we see a
service catalog meaning some kind of
catalog services where we can give your
users the ability to pick and choose
work what they need to be instant' what
they need to install on their machines
that's not so much important you run
your own clouds for your own business
and you're probably okay with the two
lower layers but if you run a kind of a
service provider cloud for other
people's business that's me kind of
deviating three points the Service
Catalog where you provide the
application services provide
applications maybe even development
services to to the customers and how
them choose service catalogs there are
many we have one which is called cloud
service automation there are many others
there is a part of there is an openstack
catalog that's being worked on we'll see
and in Tokyo of our father-god
and liberty so yeah that's kind of see
the top layer the icing of the cake on
the whole application chain
so now that I've set the groundwork I
need to introduce the you know how shall
I say that the foundation that we have
which is the Helion OpenStack
so let me starts on the let me start on
the right
what is helium helium is our plant for
everything cloud whatever interpretation
you come up with it's probably correct
whether it's the as a gas code in your
minutes there is also word for Sun so
whatever your interpretation you have
it's correct
helium is our brand for code so a
product it's a brand within that round
or product family it's probably better
sorry so Brown so in within that product
family the infrastructure-as-a-service
part is OpenStack which is a
distribution of OpenStack provided by HP
no more and also no less it provides a
standard OpenStack environment with
certain add-ons from HP but it's the
call it is OpenStack from trunk like the
OpenStack you would confirm redhead
morant is today and Rackspace or whatnot
the packaging is is different we package
different networking drivers will
package difference know each drivers but
in the end it's OpenStack so if if you
want to add things that you know from
other distributions the entirely a must
do so we might not have tested it and
I'm not saying that we might not have
inadvertently broken things
even OpenStack is a distribution of
OpenStack it works
any type of harbor so it's not
explicitly tied to HP hardware obviously
we like in it of course we do like it to
be rather late to be our where but it's
not tie to it last but not least if
you're familiar with OpenStack you meet
you know that there needs to be an
underlying Linux an open sack and that's
serve so we that we bring together with
the Yulin OpenStack open state
distribution will bring a purpose-built
Linux distribution just for that case
which is called H Linux so the whole
package you can actually download from
our pages is it's completed feature
complete so we're going on Linux and
we're bringing up here an open stack and
it runs it comes in two editions the
free community edition that you can
download and then we have one edition
that comes with support and patching
next what do we do with it
basically and it's infrastructure on the
service you can run test beds on it you
can provide infrastructure to customers
you can provide the infrastructure
in-house anything that you want to do
with infrastructure you can do with a
theory on OpenStack next on top of field
on OpenStack we put in your development
platform
human development platform is again a
distribution of an HP distribution off
cloud foundry which is an open source
platform as a service
and again the same principles apply we
are true to drunk so it's Cloud Foundry
has an API stuff that you develop on the
helium development platform to the Cloud
Foundry API will run on any other Cloud
Foundry platform from with the same
version like OpenStack firmly does
evolve so also api's evolve and and so
yes there is need to be within kind of
the same name with eight range but it is
a true two trunk distribution of hungry
next so what is foundry interestingly
enough it was developed originally by
our colleagues from VMware spin-out two
pivotal and eleven and at one point
became open sourced so and it's now
driven by a cloud foundry foundation
pretty much using the same principles as
the foundation behind OpenStack it
provides two things that provides a
development environment or development
plugins that support your developers in
why should the color packaging in the
code and deploying it and then on the
other side on top of OpenStack it
provides a runtime environment where all
the all the dependencies are being
resolved where the high availability is
concerned this is taken care of and upon
me and well you all the stuff that
normally for vacation a system and will
do are being done by the platform
so two things to past read the the IDs
and developer experience
now the the right-clicking Jenkins push
to push to whatever environment you have
and I'm on the other side the you see it
on the screen and says GA there the dock
a pool of the systems they take the
applications and actually run them next
again briefly we're one of the
contributors for our family has been has
been found Cloud Foundry foundation has
formed there is a hungry summit not away
and we are we are part of the foundry
unlike with the OpenStack foundation for
the Cloud Foundry foundation we're
actually a funding of founding member
next so what do we do on top of cloud
foundry which is more and above the
trunkload foundry here we have an admin
user interface we have put in docker
containers an application California and
added a couple of your pecks
topics in how we speak are basically the
paths of foundry they resolve the
dependencies so if you write it if you
for a symptom simplistic view if you
write a you write an application in
Python you publish it
in your manifest it says okay it's
Python and yours I need access to ms SQL
or MySQL then the appropriate build
packs we grabbed and combined with your
application to the container that then
minion runs the application so there's
nothing there's no database out and to
do there's no like to have the right
Python on my on the executing execution
note and happens at Bill's time and it
is staying with Python if as Python the
versions roll new versions of your big
patients will have you be new versions
of Python in their bill packs so again
there's no need for patching and the
containers do not interfere with each
other next copy are boundary is
integrated in in OpenStack we leave the
middle screen show you see at the bottom
let's take your horizon so basically
we've integrated or obviously it's not
just a super that it's integrated in
normal protect management so it's
absolutely seamless for the OpenStack
admins to a minion administer also the
foundry one time I mentioned earlier the
integration with with drove or ms SQL
foundry actually need the database and
actually uses the OpenStack services
such as strove for databases and there's
many more to come so it's a very
exciting integration taking place
between the infrastructure services
as OpenStack grows and provide more and
more OpenStack like more and more
infrastructure services we you can see
that at the same time there's more and
more consumption of these services from
the past base from Cal foundry next so
if we look at all of this together then
we have reached the point would just be
kind of fee what we wanted to pay the
hotel platform at the bottom the bottom
layers in OpenStack taking care of all
the infrastructure the upper layer the
beginning their platform family which
gives us the crown foundry lifecycle
services the tight integration into
OpenStack by actually using OpenStack
services for Cloud Foundry functions
such as trove for databases and then we
can going back into the bigger HP world
we can expire in two particular or I'd
all all this or the other by things and
now we have to offer
I usually think to say that HP is an
nigel company so if there is an external
process we have at least two tools for
it so yeah the entire world kind of of
HP software becomes accessible next if
you would
tartlets it's fairly easy for
prototyping for light-duty production
and get yourself the development
platform a Community Edition being an
open second unit musician that free be
downloadable there is a short link at
the bottom of your screen where you can
start and I can start today for
production we have to do the science
yeah well we struggled it weather how
hours you'd call them so we decided not
to call them at all we have the the even
OpenStack and the giving on that flat in
the editions that where we that are
supported where we offer support for and
the the message that we well we are
offering these is based on a
subscription on a yearly subscription
next so here the like I said earlier
getting close to closing out said
earlier the whole helium platform is a
it's just a family of products or
products hungry the many other things I
mentioned our service automation but
there is a integrated solutions like the
helium rack or the helium and content
Depot which is basically swept in the
box so to speak their senior collectors
which is talking to you if your Amazon
web server this compatible private cloud
we do actually run managed cloud
services where we take clouds in the
house and run them so the whole the
whole helium portfolio is all about
taking clouds taking infrastructure or
paying it up and moving into what we
call a hybrid world between private and
public services next
so big thing coming up really soon
that's the OpenStack summit October 27
to 30 and in Tokyo this time the kind of
unfortunate the early bird registration
ended yesterday but it's still not the
full price so if you have any doubts any
possibilities to go go
these summits if you are in in any way
interest in an opus AK the key source of
information that's where the developers
and then the users meet and decide on
the fate of off the platform at the
product so it's not hvu decides what
happens in OpenStack it's not a VM
Rackspace runjesus so they were here the
you know I mean it is the users the
community mr. beauty of OpenStack so if
you have any chance go there and I can
only say as like people kind of go
fighting say it's like oh man
Tokyo is so far away and so expensive no
it's not I actually living in Europe in
the middle of Europe it's much cheaper
to go to Tokyo than it was to go to
Vancouver last year next in addition to
the
open SEC summit we also have to tell
foundry summit and it's much closer
that's in Berlin actually November 2nd
and 3rd Monday Tuesday after the All
Hallows weekend it's in the middle of
Berlin the Cloud Foundry is much smaller
as OpenStack so they don't expect be the
fall we meet we meet a conference center
completely attitude it's not small it's
much nicer it's in Berlin and again
that's where the future of the platform
will be decided that's where the users
meet the developers were the directions
for the next features are being being
kind of agreed on so if you're
considering this for your company I can
highly recommend there you go next and
that kind of brings me to my last night
thank you very much for attending for
sitting through me talking almost for an
hour now and I for the last five minutes
I give the mic back to I sing organize
unmuted
thank you very much Christian I
appreciate all that okay all right guys
I really want to see a big tank of the
Christian where is a very thorough
presentation reminder reminder I'm gonna
send you guys an email tomorrow it's
gonna be thanking me more as well as a
links for the video that were in a post
up so be on the lookout for that
also try to work on missing that survey
that's going to be included it's gonna
be sharing some cool stuff and just a
friendly reminder we do have the second
webinar it is going to be next
but sorry on to Tuesdays from now
September 15th we're gonna be with its
young
1:10 he's gonna be our second speaker
you never playing and pushing a web app
with cell phone G what's that guy's is
once you have a big thank you to
everyone the showed up so Christian and
then regal for helping us host all this
and have a great night guys
if anyone here has any other questions
Frank they probably asked it down in the
little shack if anybody has any
