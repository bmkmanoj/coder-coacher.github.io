some technician um to kick the ball off
flowing I want like two or Richard easy
guide to n Rico if you actually
wonderful organizing so I'm going to let
me say a few words well I need to skip
them we will and we can you start hello
can you hear me yes working okay
wonderful thank you so much and thank
you for Nando for your introduction my
name is Erica gaetani I would for HP and
is a big pleasure for me to kick off
this afternoon Jesus of webinars
organized by my app and my welcome is of
course on the Alpha of Intel and HP you
know that we collaborated to the
production of these webinar series and
in particularly we're pleased here to
kick off the first one that is all about
OpenStack you know that Intel and HP are
stronger partners and we are
collaborating in in a number of
different activities in the IT industry
and with lists I'd jointly to organize
this series of webinar to share with you
our commitment in the open source and in
particularly on OpenStack and this is
because both Intel and HP are platinum
members of the foundation we hold the
seats on the board of director but this
role I think that most importantly if
you really represent the commitment of
Intel and HP organization on these
platform intel developers ur work with
the community to expose in order
technology to OpenStack software module
and to extend the US tech technology to
security compliance I have ability
manageability performance and of course
the end user experience overall we rich
fear working with the OpenStack from
dedication to develop the HP Ely on
OpenStack distribution with intent of
really accelerate and facilitate our
customer experience that are using or
are going to use the OpenStack platform
for their workloads so let's say that
thanks again for your participation on
the Alpha of Intel and HP and I end over
now to my estimate called like Christian
franca for the technical representation
hello then things and we go um thanks
for the kind introduction and it was
Chris Frank I wat phu the out him
in the cloud presale team and that's
been with OpenStack pretty much for the
last three years so I'm enrollees with
an HP to build and design touts based on
OpenStack and also bring OpenStack into
what we created hig so having said is I
think we need to start with a water key
statement if you for if you could
advance the side piece thank you wonders
of modern technology we haven't sir oh
one less exactly thank you the cloud and
a
aboard bedstead HP is making year we say
is like the clothes future will be based
on open source what does that mean I was
at one point we stopped developing our
own cloud software we stopped developing
things that will run only RHP hardware
we stopped developing things that only
work with HP software we decided the
future of the code is open source and
waiting open source the biggest cloud
project is OpenStack by no means it's
not the only one but that's the one
where we took the big map and says like
everything's howard's going forward will
be based on OpenStack next if we go if a
company like HP goes open source what
does it basically mean we said we have
to set up some some core principles and
I want to bore you with all the details
but the key is wherever we do we commit
back to trunk and the second thing is we
do not for so with no intention of
creating a separate HP branch of
OpenStack and as we go through the
presentation we also have no intention
to do that for cloud foundry also the
goal is for us and it's a clear
commitment to open source and the goal
is to be to stay true to trunk and
weight as much back as we can next so
the first question you usually arises is
what is OpenStack I'm out of things a
lot of things there's as many fun
pictures out there showing that it's a
myriad of project it's now part of
what's called a big tent projects are in
but in as its core
what open steak does it takes the free
coal resources that you have it in a
data center which is computed networking
storage and manages that and it managed
to get through software meaning that if
you need a new computer and need a new
network segment or need a new volume of
disk it's OpenStack who goes out and
provide it for you either separate or
together and that's what opens take does
it once again set of services and then I
runs on top of standard hardware and
standard however means in our case of
course the HP proliant serious when you
move one actually on whatever you want
to and that is true for all the
distributions of OpenStack it brings a
dashboard where you can look into the
consumption of your resources where it
can initiate weezer's request such as
deploy a employing the question machine
or deploy a network but there's
something that it is not playing which
is pretty important and thats mentioned
there is under your applications next so
and I makes it very clear
openstack is not open take a cell
operating system can run up the cloud
for you but it does not provide services
they that you normally associate with a
cloud from an end-user perspective so
this no file sharing there's no calendar
synchronization so OpenStack is not own
cloud you can run along crowd clapping
for vocals like as one of the
applications which is actually a nice
fit to you get a together working cloud
on a working environment for for your
employees co-workers Co students
partners in then the local socket up to
to share information with but OpenStack
is just taking care of the
infrastructure anything that has to do
with applications comes later so what's
the end of today we'll start looking
into into applications because
infrastructure is becoming more and more
kind of commodity but as far as
OpenStack is concerned for the next
couple of slides please keep in mind all
we do with OpenStack if we take care of
infrastructure next why open source it's
agile it's the biggest project open
source project in the world right now it
has a governance body that's truly
multinational month multi-core per wheel
so to speak so it has influences from
all over the world from all major
companies from smaller companies and
with having the biggest set or area of
developers available it is really fast
and really quick it has
and that is not short truthful for all
of the open source projects can have a
long-term vision it's very strong
focusing on AP is making sure that
everything the platform does can be done
from AP is constant api's with long-term
support and there's a strong focus on no
probability so within this is open
source community we at HP we do have a
place next next yes and which is
basically saying oh we wear one of these
or one of the leading country which is
I'm not going to bore you with with the
details I just want to go on to my
favorite slide of cloud it just briefly
saw Adams next yes pathol cattle if you
haven't heard about it then they could
for two years if you have heard about it
then they can go back to sleep for a
couple minutes is that the key of
understanding cloud is to understand the
service model behind cloud and the idea
of services behind OpenStack and also
it's very important to understand the
service model once we go into
application space we look at traditional
systems in ite and I've been mr.
something for a long period in my life I
your machines you tend to lovingly named
them give them like Oracle cluster 01 on
oracle whatever and SI p so and so you
have individual machines with individual
tasks individual operating systems
individual uptime needs in individual
page schedules
and if one of them fails the main focus
is to get them back to health nord a but
exactly that machine when we go into the
cloud space things change so the
machines that actually the worker that
deliver that deliver the results to the
end customers they are not individual
anymore there's a lot of machines that
do exactly the same tasks that
communicate using message buses that
have no state information whatsoever
inside except for things like databases
or message queues which allows us to
basically how to cure or lose these
workout VMS if something happens it
gives us the ability to to scale as we
need to if you are a simple the example
they're usually quotas Netflix although
they are no on OpenStack we're just in a
gym is a netflix super bowl halftime
advertising probably all available
machines me to stream that mine goes
back down afterwards so what we are
talking here is about scale outs the
ability to rapidly scale to rapidly
provision new machines to pick up a
certain time if the need is and drop it
if the knee goes away so as we go
forward to try to keep that in mind web
OpenStack comes from and that's the area
of of capital meaning we are very good
ads deploying a lot of machines in a
very short time we are very good at
deploying loader loads of machines are
talking about hundreds and thousands of
numbers
there's no problem thanks 40 to look
after single hi available machines
that's not a judgment saying though
everything has to have to be Barry
capitalist the only way to go and make
beds are bad no no it's just if we talk
about cloud if we really want to consume
cloud resources or you need to
understand that the applications behind
and actually provide wherever you need
whether it's data streaming file sharing
web your eyes they need to follow
certain principles that turn them into
cattle and one of it is a status pneus
so that you actually can lose a process
and nothing happens coming back to
netflix and going off the edge with
netflix they have you groove bad that's
called the simian army the simian army
is a set of tools that includes the
chaos monkey and the chaos monkey is
basically a software toward that runs
through the entire infrastructure and
kills processes and services and if the
chaos monkey runs and the end users have
no interruptions then the platform is
okay right so it is that's the idea of
the catalogue of a security and high
availability numbers and then
statelessness that's the key thing that
we need to keep in mind when we talk
about cloud um so let's have a brief
at traditional applications next so look
at traditional apps with how how do you
actually get them getting up out there
made tedious you have here template your
provision your services you configure
your infrastructure install all the
runtimes and the more complex the
application gets the movement and you
will need you to get your services you
define monitoring you define a Jenny for
that particular application and then
once you finally done you're happy with
testing you push and run pretty
cumbersome and it's still I mean
absolute that's well we decide between
traditional and cloud native apps it's
still at a point where we're looking at
the law of individual steps next cloud
native apps whether you run them on a
pass or not how create is in the way
that they are that they no longer need
dependencies so if we look at a path
like a foundry or ro base or even
traditional java applications or Ruby or
Python a cloud native application is
self-contained and as the word contain
which in probing and a few slides will
lead me to the world of containers and
then to doctors when it's self-contained
and that's where the key starts it you
give the developer the ability
pushed it out with their normal with no
dependencies to resolve on some is of
course testing to be done that's a
matter of process and not but we think
the technology allows you developed
built the application you push the code
out and then the service is on the cards
then the platform that runs it takes
care about scaling provides the
redundancy informed of runtime
environments and he'll serve whatever
whatever fate night before the node and
let it be just the chaos monkey
switching it off to be able to do this
again we need to be stateless and we
need to have a system in place that
manages the dependencies next so if we
wanted to do for us there's a big
transformation in it we go with the
cloud if we go cloud native there is a
bonus scale out so the ability that
OpenStack and then an account software
gives us steve is the ability to to
scale scale in numbers to go from a
hundred web front-ends to a thousand web
front-ends in no time because there is a
new TV series out there's a new ad
running so you need to get get your font
and supported eats get tenfold increase
of service so we're no longer talking
about it up or flex up that we had in
the virtualization world where we says
like okay we add a new virtual CPU and
to be good by a virtual ram that's all
it's not all weird to talk inline
skating with an OpenStack we want to do
is talk about scale
open source yes we've covered that if
you have a lot of machines if you love
simple services it becomes actually
simple and distributors there is a those
people using the word microservices at
this point we that generate to avoid a
lot of the development on cloud native
apps is driven from the grassroots
meaning that feeds it's not decided by
like a steering committee of an IT world
but violent decided by nine of illness
or group of students says like oh look
this is a cool app when I'm i don't i
organized a something like sharing
sharing BAM breakfast rooms and you can
happen to get an Airbnb platform out of
it also last key is AP ice all of this
only works together if you have
documented and stable NPI's if you have
them you don't need to spend a lot of
coding hours into integration how the
team out of this message key change when
you go clouds that affects you the
application you know scaling simple
distributed microservices and everything
is run around PP ice next next just skip
go on it what's our vision and which
thing I need to speed up a little bit
I'd like to talk what's our vision we we
envision that IT and the world will be
led by developers we believe there will
be open source-based
I am be all about data so the key things
that we want to look at going forward is
developers open source and data data is
the one part that we are actually won't
be covering today but probably on the
later stages of the webinar xed out and
as I said open source developer let open
source-based if we look at all the key
things operating systems the server side
not desktop site services is linux-based
now by great margin web service almost
almost more than half more than half a
bio based on open source projects user
patio endings the world biggest content
management system is WordPress so
there's millions of really reliable
really good open source software out
there and that is that is key that will
drive the world we believe next and we
have very famous supported believing
this even the President of the United
States agrees that if you want to leave
a footprint you need to be able to code
so that's going back to various a word
we believe in developers and development
and also in an open source that is
actually not a photo
the link in video which you are not
going to play but just for for copyright
reasons that's a YouTube video x it
let's go a little bit deeper free things
that we that we need to fall kind of
free words or terms that we need to talk
about at the bottom of the cloud if we
build out cloud infrastructure if you
want to actually run something and make
money out of it the call is a
infrastructure well we kind of believe
that this is something that we have
covered with done in many times you know
I want to do it the operating system for
the infrastructure of choice first is
soap and stack next once we go up in the
chain that's where the development comes
in that's where the platform as a
service now that we decided to go with
currently resides where you have an
environment that supports the languages
of our time PHP Ruby Java know Jas
whatever whatever you want the foundry
works very nicely together with soccer
and then we are back making back to like
10 minutes ago I was talking for the
containers and more than containing
nerves and as a noun risky things with a
package that contains the dependencies
the whole idea behind going up to the
platform as a services is that every
time you push out an application every
time you deploy an application you
automatically resolved all dependencies
that frees you from memory
any patching needs that freeze freeze
you from any version control you just
know at the point in time because it's
self contained in a container pardon the
pun if it will work so that takes a lot
of worries about away from from
application developers and then on top
of that next we see a Service Catalog
meaning some kind of catalog services
where you can give your users the
ability to pick and choose what they
need to be instant what they need to
install on their machines that's not so
much important if you run your own
clouds for your own business and you're
probably okay with the two lower layers
but if you run a kind of a service
provider cloud for other people's
business let's be kind of the VN three
points the Service Catalog where you
provide the application services provide
applications maybe your development
services to to the customers and how
them choose a Service Catalog there are
many we have one which is called cloud
service automation there are many others
there is a part of there is an OpenStack
catalog that's being worked on what
we'll see in Tokyo off hardev Scott and
liberty so yeah that's kind of see the
top layer the icing of the cake on the
whole application chain x
so now that I've set the groundwork I
need to introduce the you know how shall
I say that the foundation that we have
which is the Helion OpenStack so let me
start on the let me start on the right
what is helium helium is our plant for
everything cloud whatever interpret
rotation you come up with it's probably
correct whether it's the gas continue
minutes there is also a word for some so
whatever interpretation you have it's
correct helium is our brand for crowd so
a product to brand within that round or
product like family it's probably better
off sorry so brown so in within that
product family the infrastructure as a
service part is open stack which is a
distribution of OpenStack provided by HP
no more and also no less it provides a
sin that OpenStack environment with
certain atoms from HP but it's the call
it is OpenStack from trunk like the
OpenStack you would confirm redhead
mirantis suzay and Rackspace and whatnot
the packaging is is different we package
different networking drivers will
package different so it's drivers but in
the end it's OpenStack so if if you want
to add things that you know from other
distributions the entire da much do so
we might not have tested its and I'm not
saying that we might not have
inadvertently broken things but even
OpenStack is a distribution of OpenStack
it works
on any type of harbor so it's not
explicitly tied to HP hardware obviously
we like it of course we do like it to be
runnin hv however it's not tied to it
last but not least if you're familiar
with OpenStack you meet you know that
there needs to be an underlying linux an
OpenStack and that's serve some that we
that we bring together with the field
and OpenStack OpenStack distribution
will bring a purpose-built linux
distribution just for that case which is
called H Linux so the whole package they
can actually download for our pages is
it's completed feature complete so we'll
bring our Linux and will bring up here
an OpenStack any runs it comes in two
editions the free Community Edition that
you can download and then we have one
edition that comes with support and
patching next what do we do with it
basically edit infrastructure and the
service you can run get spit on it you
can provide the infrastructure to
customers you can provide the
infrastructure in ours anything that you
want to do with infrastructure you can
do with a theory on OpenStack next on
top of children OpenStack we puts the in
your development platform human
development platform is again a
distribution of an HP distribution of
cloud foundry which is an open-source
platform as a service
and again the same principles apply we
are true to drunk so it's cloud foundry
has an API stuff that you develop on the
helium development platform to the cloud
foundry API will run on any other cloud
foundry platform from with the same
version like OpenStack currently does
evolve so also api's evolve and so yes
there is it to be within kind of the
same age range bit it is a true to trunk
distribution of Cloud Foundry next so
what is Cal foundry interestingly enough
it was developed originally by our
colleagues from VMware spin out to
pivotal in 1511 and their one point
became open sourced so and it's now
driven by a cloud foundry foundation
pretty much using the same principles as
the foundation behind OpenStack it
provides two things it provides a
development environment or development
plugins that support your developers in
why she took our packaging in the code
and deploying it and then on either side
on top of OpenStack it provides a
runtime environment where all the all
the dependencies are being resolved
where the high availability is concerned
this is taken care of and upon me and
where you're the stuff that normally for
vacation a system and will do are being
done by the platform
so two things to past read the the ids
and developer experience gather the
right click in jenkins push to push to
whatever environment you have and then
on the other side the you see it on the
screen as says gee hey there doc a pool
of executing the systems they take the
applications and actually run them next
again briefly where one of the
contributors telephony has been has been
found cloud foundry foundation has
formed there is a boundary some it's not
far away and we are we are part of the
foundry unlike a with the OpenStack
foundation for the cloud foundry
foundation we're actually a funding of
founding member next so what do we do on
top of cloud foundry which is more and
above the trunk loud foundry here we
have an admin user interface we have put
in docker containers an application
gallery and added a couple of your pecs
dope bags in how we speak are basically
the paths of cloud foundry they resolve
the dependencies so if you write it if
you for a simple simplistic view if you
write a you write an application in
Python you publish it
in your manifest it says okay it python
and yours are need access to ms SQL or
mysql then the appropriate build packs
we grabbed and combined with your
application to the container that then
we me and run the application so there's
nothing there's no database out and to
do there's no I do have the right Python
on my on the executing execution node
and happens at bills time and it is
staying with fightin if as Python the
versions role new versions of your
applications will have you do you
versions of Python in their bill packs
so all again there's no need for
patching and the containers do not
interfere with each other next how we
are confound REE is integrated in in
OpenStack we leave the middle screen
show you see at the bottom let's take
your horizon so basically we've
integrated or sorry so it's not just a
suit to that it's integrated in normal
protect management so it's absolutely
seamless for the OpenStack admins to a
minute administer also the power fallswi
one time I've mentioned earlier the
integration with with trove of ms SQL
Cloud Foundry actually need the database
and actually uses the OpenStack services
such as strove for databases and there's
many more to come so it's very exciting
integration taking place between the
infrastructure services
as open stack grows and provide more and
more OpenStack like more and more
infrastructure services we can see that
at the same time there's more and more
consumption of these services from the
past base from Cloud Foundry next so if
we look at all of this together that we
have reached the point which is the kind
of fee what we wanted to pay the heal
yourself platform at the bottom the
bottom layers using OpenStack taking
care of all the infrastructure the upper
layer the beginning their platform cloud
foundry which gives us Cloud Foundry
lifecycle services the tight integration
into OpenStack by actually using
OpenStack services for cloud foundry
functions such as trove for databases
and then we can going back into the
bigger HP world we can expire in two
vertical or idle or this audio dice
things then we have to offer I usually
tend to say that HP is an nigel company
so if there is an external process we
have at least two tools for it so yeah
the entire world kind of HP software
becomes accessible next if you want to
started it's fairly easy for prototyping
for light-duty production get yourself
the development platform a community
edition begin an open second unit
musician that free be downloadable there
is a short link at the bottom of your
screen where you can start and I can
start today for production we have to do
the solids yeah we struggled it whether
how I wish you'd call them so we decided
not to call them at all we have the
email open standing on that flat in the
additions that where we that are
supported where we offer support for and
the the method that we well we are
offering these is based on a
subscription on a yearly subscription
next so here like i said earlier are
getting close to closing out said
earlier the whole helium platform is a
it's just a family of products or
product hanley the many other things i
mentioned our service automation but
there is a integrated solutions like the
helium rack or the helium and content
depot which is basically swept in a box
so to speak nessie know your collector's
which is talking to you it's your amazon
web server this compatible car private
cloud we do actually run managed cloud
services will we pay clouds in the house
and run them so the whole the whole
helium portfolio is all about taking
clouds taking infrastructure or pick it
up and moving into what we call a hybrid
world between private and public
services neck
so big thing coming up really soon
that's the OpenStack summit accept / 27
to 30 and in Tokyo this time the kind of
unfortunate the early bird registration
ended yesterday but it's still not the
full price so if you have any doubts any
possibilities to go go these summits if
you are in in any way interest in an
open sac the key source of information
that's where the developers then the
users meet and decide on the fate of off
the platform at the product so it's not
hbu decides what happens in open
staircase I am rackspace grungees su
they were here you know i mean it is the
users the community that's the beauty of
OpenStack so if you have any chance go
there and I can only say as like people
kind of get why I can say is like oh man
Tokyo is so far away and so expensive no
it's not I actually living in Europe in
the middle of Europe it's much cheaper
to go to Tokyo than it was to go to
Vancouver last year next in addition to
the open tech summit we also have to
tell foundry summit that's much closer
that's in Berlin actually November
second and third monday tuesday after
the All Hallows weekend it's in the
middle of the lane the Cloud Foundry is
much smaller OpenStack so they don't
expect be before we meet we meet a
conference center completely attitude so
I small as much lifer it's in Berlin and
again that's where the future of the
platform will be decided that's where
the users made the developers were the
directions for the next features are
being being kind of agreed on so if
you're considering this for your company
I can highly recommend there you go next
and that kind of brings me to my last
night thank you very much for attending
for sitting through me talking almost
for an hour now and I for those five
minutes I give back back to icing
organized I'm muted thank you very much
Christian I appreciate all that ok all
right guys I really want to say a big
tank at a Christian we're here is a very
thorough presentation a reminder
reminder i'm going to send you guys an
email tomorrow it's going to be a thank
you email as well as a link for the
video that were in a post off so be on
the lookout for that also try to work on
me setting up survey that's going to be
included it's going to be sharing some
cool stuff and just a friendly reminder
we do have the second webinar it is
going to be next let's go beyond to
tuesdays from now September 15 with
gonna be with its young content
you're going to be a second speaker you
going to be deploying and pushing a web
app with south boundary what's that
guy's is once you have a big thank you
to everyone to shut up so Christian and
then Rico for helping us host all this
and have a great night guys
if anyone here has any other questions
Frank they probably ask you sound in the
little chats as if anybody has any
questions
