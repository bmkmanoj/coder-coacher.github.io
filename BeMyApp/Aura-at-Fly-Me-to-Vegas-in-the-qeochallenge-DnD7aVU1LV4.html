everyone so we r T sea bass sea bass is
a hacker club in Berlin and three of the
five members of our product we got a
presented you to today's ola is your
music companions very similar to
original presentation too much
better it's our team for this applies
members unser who still at work
right now who was right here you wanted
as me Calvin bruise in Munich for now
music student and so meet help us along
with design and so what are we going to
present to you today I want to talk
about hola and alpha is a system which
is supposed to give you your personal
realm within your home so often we come
home and we read it by like not much
maybe even have some automation like you
sit for like the light turns on but
still it feels very cold our vision is
to make to make a home really something
which knows your mood like you come home
to your mom and she looks like oh we
wanted to the same
just use it because that's a medium that
a lot of people like used to like
express the feeling and that is not so
like black and white like automation
like coming on the heat or something
like that so we use different inputs or
we use the calendar like what where you
come from right now but was on your
agenda you dizzy we use the current
weather in Germany that well everyone
suppressed in winter we use the current
time of the day of
and we our vision is also to follow your
music habit I've just learned from what
you do this before and putting all these
things together we will want to present
you the right music at the right moment
when ever you come home or where are the
divorces these hour this is our vision
and to make the presentation of course
we couldn't take all this and it's also
really hard to present today so we have
an application here and basically that
shows you it shows your color circle any
issues you can say like a few yellow for
example and then you say okay and then
yellow is the color my happy and we
should hear something plain that's not
the next
our application of it I see the light
jean sifrin of like now I've got Sam so
lets you set and the like shoulda just
maybe not sad anymore maybe energy and
we have life so this is our application
we talked to the far
like I showed you where options cleaning
right here on the bright side but also
just the color yeah should we skip to
the technology yeah
yeah so this is how it works view so we
have all these components we have
developed a rich components that are run
on the same Raspberry Pi right now that
they could be distributed home we build
a bridge to the device we developed a
fridge for the phone that is just this
thing the bonus codes which is switched
and we've also developed like the key
part is the bridge between our system
and the music player demon which is a
open source application that we use a
lot to play music at all right so ties
into our
yeah and then we also have the app that
can receive so this was what we could
show just one month but we kind of have
a perspective beyond that so and the
ideas of course on the one side we are
very like into videos those days walking
wrong with our own music and I don't
know when you think back to like 90 80 s
you would walk into a restaurant and
chocolate point into music box and like
everyone would tell like think about the
music and
social experience we want to bring that
back to the faculty chair like oh plate
that song and then God I was like hey
mama the song you liked it and maybe
come up with something like a volt
another voting system let go a play cube
was going to play next or something like
that so moved on the one side but like
connecting people also what happens like
that is coming home is depressed and I
know mom's coming out with super happy
and be like you played yeah not only to
music maybe this isn't that the noi by
what parents play at home which resort
aware to do some problem blah blah blah
so children can dance in like their
pockets or their global what every cell
is not only music but it's very like
writing to listen at home together we
want to like connect the family together
not only like automatic on the robot so
I like this before so good question oh
so like I said you always have like a
backup right and they're growing growing
again and the idea is to kind of have
half this backlog come with you and
whenever we see that there's the right
situation you can turn on the shower yes
that's very good of course like having a
application like that it's very easy to
present her but it actually doesn't
represent a difficulty of the algorithms
that you need it its young what we
basically need us like my
classifications of a lot of data and
learning so it's hard to present here so
we chose the easiest
but our vision
our business visit to China this happen
in the end goal away yeah so you don't
have to get a say today say physically
what mood you're in that for the phone
actually detects when you're in
like
just a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
