that but it's always better to insist on
this it's we don't win fragmentation and
their work when first interim green
devices came on the market in 2012 we
know there was something original of
Android on arm I think every device is
everyone droid devices were working on
arm every application for an ipod arm so
what we did is for all the android
tablet applications who all these have
status on each other to use debit
virtual machine on android it just works
so what music will be determining its
with gentle too much will be at your
machine and at first a platform and
probably over a mutation that choose
shell libraries magic library is
designed for this week's EP you met
something called NDK as bridging
technology but i was or x86 telephone
parody we were taking the compliation so
when I separated still with some some
binary translation during runtime cut
it's working very well and talking so
ever can say all devices are compensable
the arm application most of the time it
just bought and otherwise you can
generate android x86 libraries using the
NDK that you
use it for any memories since put a
timer you can use the Android in any
case produce x86 library since already
2011 it even before we are in platform
on dramatic so we are working with
Google for this ready to make it easy
for developers and also professional so
first hotels have any chaos or maybe not
all of you right now Watson nek up and
maybe we have from definition politician
is any care in an application that
contains and uses a doublet likewise so
that s to libraries which can usually
buying in leaves and named Jeff Derek 29
authorities p idea so let's not be sorry
because you're white and C C++ in
compiling everything yourself that you
are than any cap if you're using some
game giants like unity or enemies in the
end you're at the NDK up and most pajama
gangs are using a generic down
so what if you're already have
navigation and only shadow tech lab
right inside cross itself yes solutions
so everything stopped there when you use
your indicate to chain so you have some
meth ice what you need to do is to
inside chennai education the tank day
the application make fire you need to
set up a bi 20 you can also set up avi
to x86 or avi or anything but oh I think
that's most useful 8 so if you put this
are able to go and run again in cables
can be any cable chain with the fuchsia
object libraries of all the available
platforms from you indicates direction
so right now it could combine from mb 7
md5 mix and it tasted so everything
starts from here but so what once you're
through shelter check the roids all
these are generated inside lips folder
and folder names against you again so I
said seize on its own so it's all there
in your memory package and graduate
application folder so when you package
it you have two solutions by default if
you do let it this way between just
package all three libraries home the
rest of the application inside to a big
ATK not necessary that the depends on
the size of your library if you have one
more level platform meters and rush to
our patient dies by the side of
procurement
it's not always badly usually you're
going 0 application but it's not what
takes the most days that's assets and
some of our things so that's why is
ready to prefer dreadful and if your
edge case does ready to dig you are the
solution we can build one APK by
architecture and when i say 18 k bar
architecture it's not 11 applications
for architecture that means that you're
going to storm this chip one application
is level programs from user to only one
application they can run on x86 or am
Russian on PA PK it's you wanna so for
we stand out where that diner is wet and
we they put by when where you package
all your lives inside your 8k your
authority came the storm I call Wes and
when user on browse the store and
download your application it on loads
out of it so it on loads also with
libraries that are not useful for the
user taurine but it's only at
installation step pads on the uses
libraries are straight up and since the
HKS engine preaching and so on there is
no direct in solution to just avoid this
road I pedazos writer right away so for
remove title fk1 it's it's both simple
and complicated and this storm will
think in a very simple way you will not
be in fact and it's a beaut
smart choice just tuning your version
codes number in central manifest and
when you upload multiple apk for one
application on the store that means you
relapse about a key for the same up and
we lose her when we go on the store you
just see one application and when you
click download we download only one APK
to learn to himself and so the so we
deliver only one HD and you will deliver
this educate them on the list of
compatible 8 case based on the Iron
person got number let's say you're
promising based or with 14 exit exit
devices please devices with terms were
strong I accept x86 8 k's as an army 7
HKS I've said only five decades because
I'm compatible so the stories will fit
on the list of compatible educate but
you will just have nothing to fit on
since everything is compatible so to
choose the only single egg deliver the
store will deliver one will be I already
know that means x86 one after HK need to
a higher version code otherwise in the
exit the x86 devices will get the option
that would be very gentle if you have a
x86 version you're right son so here's a
convention you can use to rewrite
innovation good because brushing code
usually the sake of application Russian
freedom time as human readable version
in this casual version put number with
the usually
310 so within my energy is equal just
one HK back for architecture you can
just protects your own version of a
rhyme you'll see with an application
with the 10 best British equal to 500
550 r7 anything lower than the one you
will choose for x86 so we are Cameron
Miami to 6 and 10 as partial number
Russian good and I'm talking we go yes
is this also a Tribble you know which
other the other store said I wasn't so
someone I have no I think if you look at
the device itself and you run get from
on it we see if you picked out CQ parts
we will see it first one since about x86
boat and RV back put so I think if
there's a saying especially because if
you just forget the store and install
the APK when you run an TV install it
will install on your name came with a ir
Russian hood so it doesn't accept on
right at work so it should be exactly
the same creator but I don't know if you
can help
my beverage game yeah yeah so when
you're on your typical console if you
want to avoid an integra educate or you
sign up it's not very clear out to do
bands and but today what is the way you
need to switch from simple mode to
advanced mode and then to just put your
new age a rickety from a pic to support
and different very good and you may have
the first time you do this you may
unfeeling your over right into from an
APK along your big old possible but you
will have some screen slightly stained
or just striking arm from your app and
circuit I got in Back know if you just
put it along yoga one and you end up on
this kind of console where you are 180k
balancing support and the Russian hood
so you can change by the way if x86 one
is and then you can switch through
simple modes in one if you try to you
just will have an error message so
that's safe
we're putting up ABI Alton sell your
application of your as if bones and
written by needs us very simple if your
whole source code and all your neighbor
is belong to you and you know that but
sometimes most of the time you're also
using for party libraries again James
you don't promote yourself I received
support from a virus libraries and garen
Giants garden accessories these are
armed I think most used by and retail
workers and so if you most of these just
have x86 spots already there some of
these tons damage providing sex x86
libraries for x86 compatibility for
example in j GX and to get on Jan
reviews from gelato such a massive
library with the m50x a6 are very only
to get a 90 but if you get these dice
table release you omnia your ver esos
for yoga API but then to make props just
a matter of going to be nine threes
getting mjd X of S or x86 and 30 mins
inside yo D and the f-86 further use so
that's not ready for empirical
for Oberyn Giants usually a PDA with
Vienna and but some of some override
dad's steve downes about x86 this case
varies not mentioning you can do
yourself about asking them begging them
to x86 reports saying your device is not
but Sir there is nothing you can write
you so tall and don'ts for necessities
way yes but the armor shunting rocking
quite well on our devices and if you
were in a neat that device you can still
play on the run convoy it's a very still
apartments it because of the arm
emulation but that's not that big so
even if you look at a 900 in Asia it's
in comes pre-loaded with an application
for speed and its application bus only
an arm application rise no excessive
fire inside a very very little on the
device and think it's evaluated for
consumer and as consumer you consider
know it is running put some
compatibility layer so yes I did the GTX
just listen nope
nine point nine money that it has
stables it has xf6 in the same all right
but you still have the added money you
still have to add a cell phone yeah if
you argue but you can bet it's already
in there so and if your income I'm on
top is the only library in the world not
possible but he's going to angles are at
the library that's not very well now and
that doesn't say it's basically supports
x86 the java source code is so cool
usually it's not a people to make it
work for a sec because if you look as
open source libraries on Android nainsi
bad boys most of the time visitor Royce
Aventine crazy for android basis before
and different words and responsibilities
but before anger if it was mostly for
linux and I leaves on what platform
ex-ac so most of the time if you look at
an Android library and with massive
every all the code is burn for it to
work well on x86 and if it doesn't work
straight that's because someone when in
Portuguese to Andrew it just messed up
the compilation strain of codes may harm
Michaels and Kings I
just a matter of taking the makefile so
there is no assembly to provide things
like us but would take more time or
knowledge and every 10 10 minutes one
hour you can just fix the part of the
Android cyborg and make it come by for
all three for all the ideas in beginning
set six and most of the time to fix the
main file you can rely on target area
but my process I the NDK to check and
when it's combined for x86 target our ad
i reconnected so detectors it's five
different five ingredients or includes
cease all stories inside of our musamba
source code does not comply price 86
here and this other hypotheses
p minus 1 has in it floristry something
useful that's an actuary mirin rice so
your animation
purchase- Otis information on this view
NCAA di 1 x86 again mr. operation of
device on da just a celebrity bomb so
let me every asshole
oh yeah where is always some cases where
it cry yeah after the time for okay this
supposed us
comparables and their comparators
compile type GCC and that some already
has mrsa division tips just condemn this
show we have it yo you talking about
communicate every inside the nba's on
if you go inside the sample types of
applications ok
we're inside and you're right and tables
we just ate all the candy it's it's
compelling for army idea and
generalizing ESO insights on the area
and the side because I mean spy that's
by default and EK food chain me goodbye
on you are
so I'm just be too
and I di oh we're missing cable and get
you now it's been 27 mins and x86 as
well so just to summarize particles
already said of TP any question
let's go back
and what did you go cool but welcomes
combined or assesses this is rated for
two cases and these cases are not very
welcome sometimes vs if you have written
some songs businesses for example or now
you can use Indian instruction set and
building down the inferences so when you
use this to writing on specific code
that will not compile processes so you
need to a different book back for
excessive wear an equivalent to nail
instructions 886 and I've asked all the
SSG so on this professional devices
that's triple sec free that is available
and all all android x86 devices you are
at least triple sec free available with
the comparable our demonstrations are
unavailable on arm I'm not not available
on all harvested on devices and not
available at all on rd by death and if
you are with our disney on instructions
in your coat we are providing the head
of the Sierra but is working both minion
forensics in Gary's like pause and 700
is rocking all of these two egg balance
sse code so just doing simple macros
like this one so in ninety percent of
vacation 1 190 so you just use with the
other and as much as performance as your
you are well written SSE free codes in
the first place escribe and in five or
ten percent of the over cases where it's
not 11 nothing is still working but you
can just have some performance it's
because it's not strict matic so there
is some software emulation several
infancy shoes instead of just one
a number of case can cause troubles run
run time it's about memory alignment
advances so on that form our double
engine and on Android by liquids bitter
end jan 9 x86 so you're basically in
januar no problem with this but you're
certain differences on memory alignments
very itself when it's packing or not
backing structure so if you can this
example see structure with when instrum
long in the needs on a long long we want
to be a line on a spike that mean ism if
we produce this pattern and so with for
bias for nothing provides of nothing
advice from your own money and provides
again and provides again for nothing and
on x86 phenomenon we just want to be
aligned on four fights that means memory
structure will be back we will not sell
these white spaces yeah so this is this
structure is just used inside your
clothes and if I've everything processes
just cause no program it could be
programmed if you are communicating the
server that will then your Delta
actually miss pattern of instead of this
one or if you are loading binary files
when I'm going to stop all the assets
information Metro game and you're in
close and used to send by for both
platforms and a long time your clothing
this pattern automata
we love in trouble so there is a simple
fix for this case and that's a bit of
common case because usually looks
exactly the same later so as easy peasy
you is to false be long long attribute
here to be a line on a bite and then you
get a true to the same memory pattern
between exit season the soup tastes way
to do it if you want to a quick fix you
can also program be set don't even touch
your code but as we can align interval
as like we compile so you will align the
disarmament a bite but which are they
may drop over issues when using over 430
libraries or even pissed about c library
depends where you based safeway is very
specific sex is and these are great to
kind of issues from the term memory I
New Jersey not that common when that was
you will be happy to assist I people
making this kind of stuff is very
painful so your code is running wire at
this companion process 6a morning you
can go program optimized little bit so
as we said before about nail
instructions you can directly use as
headphones so you're on the front foot
is you free next platform is SS property
so you can make yourself SS key codes
using an SS in Princes but unusual ones
because most of the time you can rely on
I love the victoria station either way
vectorization but instructions but make
sure capable of executing the same
operation on several pounds of data sets
in a restricted set of CPU cycles so it
just gives you more performance because
we can process more design sense inside
so three so compiler can maintain
vectorization so if you have a follow
that process data and compiler can see
where is nowhere as the potential
between this data loop the loop he can
go and hopefully garage so enable all
this stuff you can add supplies to
compile tcq so once again you use target
acadia and you change x86 or voice
because you don't want to pass x86
pacific seatbacks dropped from PI Roman
occupation Obama so you must pray and
fast math is
gross profit addressed rings both
platform so hope we just expect all in
fur from enhance ocean of you compiler
that's not say you can add I sense a bit
less exactitude in that most of the time
surveys were tragic and that makes a
specific party that terms of am tunable
able to specify your complaining from 80
math teacher on these devices so there
are some specifics about this
architecture it's in order and you
compare on you don't want to care about
it and actually it's sse3 and also
specify the vampire vampire can rely on
SS because x equals not quickly done
using X a X 87 instruction sets
a subset of x86 indicated map but SSC so
done faster but very quality it's x87
because SS is not available on all
platforms but Kieran and ruin all
entered by Franz RSS wish we were said
to use it and last time I used it to an
application because some sort of creator
I get the thread for some point or
performance that's not suitable if you
want to look nice on next architecture
you can already use engine SLX oh I said
I need savant the name of your next type
architecture as we be inside tablets and
phones until next year you can use it's
available with razor blades for use on
any k r m9 and using GCC Pro project you
just need to also specify going to use
this is open hate the indicator chamber
but by default right now it's four point
six entrance am and SEC 4.23 time if
you're using mhm it will generate cool
that we've also on all the platforms
very wats evening
cnx for me but not for the next 30 okay
can we use our chassis so if you still
have some bugs running ios6 good there
are some techniques for 17 and be
careful so you may already know this but
style if your prior to talk to grow and
develop yourself that's an insertion
vmdk many deals with you so most of time
second occasion ma supervenience course
of output stuff on there are tests you
have an idea for this and we got prints
a and Luke is your way to use it despite
defines this kind of rifles and then in
your clothes Cody's that you would call
printer and then inside Google cash you
can see much work watch one together
your buds yeah text a working if you
want to prefer with chili and all this
is also possible but you can also get
more information about the load of your
shadow tech library so you just pull set
property value check tonight one and if
we generate more information when load
of shadow database it's already enabled
by later and you can
also it's also on your device's about me
more information you want stay back nice
and memory overruns so but we absolutely
dead zone memory structure issue issues
like so before you can use this eve of
battle and set it to one of 10 like an
expert on you can call this only if you
are good I'm going to activate this you
need to reach the then we be all android
on background using a adb shell stop and
start and approximately an eclipse so
eclipse is already able to GTV with
android applications over a TD some
things to know is so each one real
application has been debate about flying
set to true inside is manifest any
cables will be called me an EKG book
different one which we generate for KGB
files and your level in the development
but most of the time right now inside no
manifest you don't set yourself be de-
back through of course is the igu senses
himself intuitive elbows or obvious
books but in these cases
never close control ivy and you don't so
we learned that the true sadly they will
give us like a true in your manifest it
will now send this it's about an answer
send an EKG verses 1 and to be sure it's
working out now we will send from
voltage for anything
so it's it's cool with any k d % 1
equals the melody today we have a
definite looks like i said to swing the
magnets so you can see some types of
generated GG december and genial seven
so you're struggling
and when you're be severable generative
together and written up by night you can
go through your eyes and setting the
locals and Android hands replication and
if we don't easily curing exes and we be
able to delegate as in the application
link among your own diamond desktop you
are the backbones you have all these
problems but the verification will run
before the demagogue is attached below
to deform the demo car is attached then
it means that if you set a break point
during the loads of the library it will
never be real resolution with not just
will not stop it because their petitions
on know yet there is a great balance
despite so you can put some timers
cheetah
but the way that is pretty good HTC
romantic so if its gdp and all this is
not enough for you and you like get a
Weber's is by right so go ahead Rick by
14 already know it give if you know my
grind so let's choose to that does many
checks on memory so able to be a few
detector memory leads memory overruns
and and many more ammonia oceans it's
working on liners as it's also working
on android so conduct stuff on the back
line so we get to the error when
fighting workers shouldn't and we're
going on androids is working as well so
when you get by one you don't have very
soft wing stall so i made the package i
respected myself we can get it using it
to just push others in the package on
you prefer brilliant with emulators
fortune but can win x86 innovator you
are just permission menziesii
Oh Buddha we did and then you set that
background to be pulled curriculum of
this application inside product what
does package name of giraffe and then
next time table for us you will able to
see all a backline output inside vodka
so I'm in the binaries for the 4.13 for
bearing of Android in later yes 86 match
for my power perfect we thought was
broken you can also use it on real
devices in the decade I listened on the
especially recompile buy from and wait
for a later generation x over x minus
one it's a little touchy
integration
immigration very fun ride
so we have some tools 21 total abs so
first the annual agencies image from the
emulator what's the most importantly who
is using the Android or Delta five so
you're using the x-axis one is just
painful the robot I know ask visually
android emulator opposite going so slow
that's true because x equal to choosing
the Iron Age and emulate the old a
platform stream and that's right pane
you're right way to use that William you
later right you is to get a six image or
whatever that's what we want and also
install internal hardware acceleration
equation manager ok axle so much time is
at the bottom of the list in Android SDK
manager that's one country is IDK
manager we just totally package and we
have stored it excuse me yes when is
there going to be Linux support you
don't need linux suppose you have a
Kenyan camera module inside Lennox so
you don't need hexham at all okay so so
you should be at it should it should
work with the exit
yeah if it still slow you make it work
language KDM ocean to the current life
can find the one citation sitting
through installer package for I think we
only have to be mi you have to say no h8
forgotten and yeah so the time on so if
you're each one just if your windows are
not this one otherwise you got me and if
you are windows are not the same if you
download the package inside your SDK
installation directory unlocking
surprise inter package in this each one
min story that's a big them rather to
this because you maintain yeah I'm Tony
friday from a scale under which we work
and then performance is even more than
they r 1a 1a you reachable so to use
intellection you need of an Intel
processor and process vgx forget
realization
yes thank you can refrigeration
extensions and usually if you're on a
computer is 550 4 years old it should
have it in store or savory son there
it's because in and disables in your
base sometimes that test your bios and
discouragement what's the time very much
like the news for work for I mean at six
it's going just yeah we got resources
and so little yeah he proposed my degree
it quite pretty fast quite well to me so
they'll cover that IDK yes
so we have no benchmark bearing arms in
danger and yes 8610 essence fruit and i
wish you run egx difference if you know
matrix a benchmark regularize device
could get like 20 power line or maybe
40,000 probably i must perform talent so
you're getting ambushed me to save our
parents and our panel we have devised
and on armies just use your illusion of
original so every story is ready for
onion with a broken into in detail go
through but interesting and I'd really
relate robots working well if you are
doing in a ship the reference not
necessarily only on a census because
unbilled a disease you have some
libraries I back in 10 so in here is
interfering but in bars TVD so that's a
library from father program PG but the
supercilious library so right now if you
look at androids and all these nations
that comes with focus some anchors
present like many ways our programming
on Android you are the key phrase yeah
so one slice I guess one wants to do
spreads and it was when you need to when
you start get waste time and gets power
performance and more going to the center
this is quite complicated so it's best
to use for either libraries and Timmy
least my performing and over PI
libraries that exist are poison but
apparently but apparently is not
available at all for any by dog thank
you so in the end may
so when she doesn't want to she proceeds
and platforms and where is run the
streets who is pushing that from the
screen right now it's on Yun Android and
it's working well but for very specific
cases a given image many creations
exactly TV's made from many more uses so
first it's open source EG tele2 with
runtime exception and insulate about
names windows mac a memory and it's also
available on arm and x86 platform we can
recuperate from arm is rocking well open
sea for example is using it by evil put
its work if one to pay a simplification
reviews and source code and you will i'm
different licensing we go to statically
indeed like that and also gets a bigger
shoe box the also very resentful school
absolutely so here is an example of how
to integrate pipe to get by and it's
super specific numbers using GV metal
sign here is using power we use soap our
languages will get us in
reign of operation the function you want
to be initiatives on each part of which
is wedge of operation and also a mentor
that will add Wizards from the different
loops together let me start at the
defense wish you would want that hearing
impaired reduce you set the registers
your opinion here you start with a0 a
third stop of your vision and you give
this method to be initiated on each part
of the right it's when your ranch and
you're just adding are we are just get
by and it's only when you look at
something really will be to cut together
all of these look at something to get me
go back so it will get this reversal
using this reduction function so it's
just like an addition to be able to any
dependent what I do it for one so if
you're not going to super specify
programming amazing isn't it if you
think about it if I brushing just no way
yes then if you just think at the
different area because if you want wish
the second error performance will be
price I think to me that is one mom and
a lot of good and you will see that
works
yeah my experiment from the device yes
but I'm sure your center of expert right

have ended itt for you but I CT is
sucking at all
desktop something on internet that's a
set of libraries that are very a vigil
tonight for specific study videos
including encryption this kind of usages
here we can provide specific functions
without very exciting twist what's
available hunt because I extensively
because it's funny voices always find
our pants we have any type of pyro is on
this video decoding software on 900 or
special awkward shop for regarded it
depends on products for easy but most of
the time he may have taken I don't know
this mine is it on chip
Oh
so in terms of fire is something that
not your Android NDK and use instead of
GCC I usually means you can have pretty
good persons name is Pat from from den
first person sometimes go game as is
between ten first versus performance
improvement and present it agrees only
Fox 8 6 but today or tomorrow co2
measurements in the problem we can fight
but right now it's free for the new and
expensive one another and HD Kenya
susceptibility project anarchy and I
need to say something about typical of
it it's a game engine so who knows
company we require one on to your
scrubber and working here and one of
things that came out from under me bro
president all-new ever give up certain
justice said towards about
the French commander excellency so yeah
Albert it's not something writing you
it's from 1999 this time it was easy as
a bigger three essays and then there is
some stuff for games animation in
Chinese studio approximation restriction
deviation efficient engines as screech
engine based and give vision with you
well
if you ever so subtly know you people so
bo go and because of that gang so if you
don't know I work maybe you know these
games this is great im just freestylin
out so all these games are using the
disease and ipod and / games of bingo
console or AI idiots and we were scary
is also using any means you think you
get it it's addictive as is working but
the good news is if you don't supernova
game on android iOS of data we give on
this offering and if it's not enough to
get lonely story various contests you
can mean one hundred thousand dollars so
just no
to get on g
and if you use our keep our game we must
not ask for any money even if one minute
though we did not as friendly money just
use get / room e 30 that's not indeed
but let me show you some strength of
just show you one of these samples is
game time
nashik RPG so RPGs resemble he cannot
run for the source code to take a load
and all the SS you can't reuse
everything out on the character yes and
resourceful itself i will show you one
of the tsunami project and
again see its persistence
anyway you have only source available
that's pretty simple for irregardless /
TV and look into your samples you have
some more casual games all the time and
into the next modern combat or 11 but
every game is possible to go to jail so
against you seen the BAE you can't be
all windows food chain so you can run
your game in 10 products this is the
keys so but you don't have to write the
dipper and windows unless you want to
pay just for me that for being a
christ-centered enemy that's bad
and when some really good Fisher is
that's definitely so I can prepare meet
you guys so providing the u.s. you just
write my IP address somebody device of
the year but what follows is coming one
is this specific educate for this in
your

Pistorius a
front of the world
timmo diamonds are kind of attention

pi server but will synchronize all your
assets all the time we go to bed so you
can try okay on the tablets and to some
changes on the computer just wing it by
the assets and it with me since our
Wi-Fi look at it and we just pick we
don't and again will be instituted we
don't need to the Clarion ohk of your
right something wrong so it's just very
fast education and I probably can't even
use your talents as input control of
your game working on who can use the
excavator from device just pay your game
is a TIG ol here all alone even if you
touch my baby inside
thanks
what
and your internet that's why
we've already dated internet goes faster
under system or wave data so right now
we can so see me to the contest with
bottom corners we think though we can
fish second part of the day where you
can try to get x axis for tomorrow if
you have any focus I'm wiser and wait
