about libgdx which is an open-source
yellow base a cross platform game
development framework and yeah so first
I'll talk about my a bit about myself
and my involvement with the project so I
started working in the games industry
Critic as an AI games programmer and we
were working on home from the revolution
and I was doing like an open world MPC
behaviors and I was whole c++ and stuff
like that and spend about two years over
there then I moved on to Sony and was
working on a multimedia application for
playstation 4 as well and yeah that was
also siblings plus and after that I was
like six months over there and after
after that i left the games industry as
a day job and went to Bloomberg so we
make like well Bloomberg for those who
don't know it's like a finance finance
news company and yeah I work on a market
monitoring tool in real time but yeah
and on the side I've always been making
yet small games and stuff and that's how
i came across libgdx to start making
this a small mass game it's like a
puzzle game for kids it took me over
five months after after my full-time job
and try to do the whole thing like art
in all the Holy cold and a bit of
marketing and stuff it's israel for free
there's no ads and stuff so you would
use a bit of an experiment may be using
libgdx as well for m4 game games so i
don't know if you know loon there but
it's like a 48-hour in a game Connie
competition and you have to do
everything from scratch on your own so i
made like i think i joined three times
so yeah very small games right to the
stuff I used Liberty explore for all of
them m and yeah and then I think in 2013
i joined the libgdx Cordwell the
development team and we're about about
20 developers I think in less time
and I've been mostly involved with the
api's for level loading like you can
create maps on some external tool and
then we have a Maps API that parses that
and thus all the rendering and you know
you can query objects on the map and
things of that and I'm because I don't
have a lot of time and I mostly do code
reviews now like all the pull requests
that come in so I mean both do that and
yeah it was it's it's been a great
experience so far and as well I'm the
decor maintainer for the main maintainer
for Ashley which is a component-based
entity system and it's part of the DB
GDX family so I don't know if you know
about into the systems but basically
rather than having your game objects and
you know like your game objects design
in a inheritance based model where you
know you have a game object and you have
the player and then you end up with a
massive inheritance hierarchy you could
just have an entity which is an IV and a
bag of components and the components are
used data so it's like velocity position
mass things of that and then you have
systems that process entities that have
a certain form in this component so your
movement system would process entities
that have a position and a velocity and
it makes from very clean and cold and
very to your split of logic and data and
it's quite nice and well yeah and also i
wrote a libya textbook and it's like a
collection of articles on on how to use
libgdx with examples and stuff though
all the code is and available in github
and we we updated with every libgdx
release and so yeah now on to leave to
the x and here's the part where i try to
sell you the framework so yeah like I
said leave GX is called cross-platform
and it's yellow based but you know like
it's it's very very fast because
actually if you look at on github paying
fifty percent of the code is C and C++
so it's mostly a native code for the
most performance critical stuff and the
cool thing is that it's also compatible
with
with all the jvm based languages or Java
Scala and all the other ones and then it
has like nightly releases so if you want
to be like on the bleeding edge and then
there's like monthly stable releases we
have it and I Jenkins well Sarah Jenkins
jobs running tests and things that so
it's it's nicely maintained and nicely
kept and yeah it's not a game engine so
it's not like unity or unreal and it's
it's a game framework so it's basically
you can cherry-pick the components that
you want to use so if you don't want
collisions you don't need to run any of
that codes you basically you want the
low level stuff you only use a low level
stuff you it doesn't impose I
Princeton's unity has this object model
that you need to use its forced onto you
so here you can use actually or you can
use an inheritance base model it as NASA
and yeah and you can write your code
once in Java and it deploys pretty much
everywhere so yeah like Java so windows
linux and mac and then it's it deploys
to android deploy straightway to iOS
through rhodium and and also through a
GWT em exports to javascript like very
optimized javascript and you can run on
any web GL enabled browser so so that's
very nice m and then it doesn't impose
any editor or tools so it uses cradle
for the for the build and then you have
your Gradle scripts and you can import
it on on any any ID you can use eclipse
you can use IntelliJ whatever NetBeans
or you can get segments line or whatever
it is very fancy so so that's quite nice
as well and and the question is like oh
with all this open-source technologies
do people actually use it and like
professionally out for commercial
projects so here's a few examples so
this game is halfway it's like a kind of
a 2d version of ex-con and I think it
really is like last year or something
and it's two programmers one artist and
it's all leave GDX and it has like it's
very very good and it's on Steam and
it's a commercial project
and as far as I know it's been fairly
successful there's also that were for
instance which has some 3d features as
well and so that's also on sin and a
particular one I think it's it's pretty
impressive is spine it was Agee style
project and it's by the guy who wrote
the 2d like the UI toolkit for libgdx
and its animation tool so it's a 2d
animation tool so rather than having
sprites you have like a not last with
like the pieces of your character and
then you have a nice skeleton like in 3d
animation and you you have keyframes so
you interpolate between the keyframes
and the the textures followed the bones
and it's quite to kind of design
animations very quickly and it's an
incredibly complex piece of software and
it's all written in in BG days all the
UI obviously the graphics everything and
that's I think on Kickstarter it was
like fifty fifty dollars to support it
and now it sells forth with 300 so so
it's a pretty big piece of commercial
software and in terms of statistics of
how many people you see this is from
appbrain so i don't know if it's very
you know reliable but one point five six
percent of all the apps in Google Play
and are made with libgdx which is quite
high I think the game the only games
engine or framework that has a higher
share is unity I think it's four percent
but yeah that libgdx is the second one
so it's it's well definitely wet views
and the good thing is that open source
and it's free so all the X developer's
do all the work and you get all the
money make all the profits and get rich
on us so it's very nice and also
advantages of being open source like if
there's a bag I'm sorry I'm picking on
unity but it's a speck on unity like
you're on your own and you have to wait
for someone to to swap for the unity
developers to fix it with you leave
detects you can just look at the calls
on the Apple request a lot of people do
that and think libgdx is
at some point it was the most forked
java project on github it's like 3,000
forks and there's um it was started like
seven thousand times crazy and and other
people contributes and yeah a nice a lot
of bugs get picked up very quickly and
if someone finds the bag they can just
send a pull request and get it gets
accepted so yeah um to create a project
is very easy there's like this small UI
and you say oh this is the name of my
main class this is the name of my game
and I want to deploy to these platforms
I want to use these third-party
libraries and you click a button and it
generates all the Gradle scripts for you
and then you can import that into your
your ID so so that's quite nice that's
very easy to use and in terms of the
architecture and so their sleep du DX
and it has a core set of what is a core
set of interfaces and then each back end
each platform implement implements their
own back-end so for for the desktop we
use the lightweight java library and
framework and that's just based on
OpenGL and I'm that that's all the
desktop platforms and then for Android
it uses a OpenGL ES and all the Android
while the Android SDK basically and for
the iOS version and it uses rhodium
which is another open source project
that takes your Java code and make what
transpires it into an objective-c and
then you can run it like binary code in
on iOS and then the html5 back end and
it's yours GWT we will web toolkit it's
an open source library by Google and you
can you can just a yeah like I said you
can just take java code and compile it
while compile it translate it into
javascript and then you can run that on
any web GL browser it doesn't support
the whole
all of Java so I think reflection is
limited but libgdx SI reflection and api
so you can use lines that there are some
other some other API is some of some
some parts the of the Java stand a
library that are now available but
mostly it's it's it's reported and in
terms of the feature ah yeah in terms of
the features so like I said before it's
you can cherry pick whatever you want
and it's kind of broken down into low
level mid level and high level ap is so
if we go through the low level stuff
there's application management so like
bringing up a window and handling all
the events like you know the game is
initialized the game is paused the game
is going to update its going to render
and the whole render render loop there's
a it has an API for file input and
outputs you can write to file street
from files and grit from you know like
local storage external storage SD cards
whatever you want and that might be
limited on WebGL for instance on
browsers but yeah in other platforms is
available as a networking API you can
just work with sockets and yeah it's
very very very easy to use and it's an
all the API you can play like a crow
music or you can play small and all the
effects and eSports like most most
formats so that's not a problem either
and for graphics it has uses yeah opengl
the opengl api i think it supports up to
it was three awesome i checked and and
yeah i mean you can you can use the
higher level abstractions but you can
use access the whole open opengl api and
you can just play around with opengl
yourself and which is quite useful if
you want to do like shaders and you know
more low level stuff and then it has an
input api so it supports like touch
screens game pads and keyboard mouse
everything you might
needs a mid-level for for the pack the
3d part and it supports meshes and like
I said shaders before textures
textures I'll atlases sprites and
supports polygons batching so so you
basically can say you have a texture
atlas with all the sprites all the
characters that you have and then you
can say draw this one here draw this one
over there and it doesn't talk to the
graphics card in the meantime so so it's
very fast basically you send all the
drug holes and once and then at the end
it pushes everything to the graphics
card that makes it faster that a lot of
the c++ and game frameworks the out
there and just because it does patching
so that's quite nice and yeah it expects
your addresses like I said bitmap fonts
so font rendering and it comes with like
bitmap fonts generation tools so it's
very easy to use and there's an asset
manager so it does all the reference
counting for you it does like a
synchronous I said loading you can have
your nice loading bar stuff like that
math library for collisions like shape
intersections think so that it has a
custom collections library so you don't
have to use the Java standard ones that
do a lot of new locations and libgdx
tries to do no memory allocations while
the game is running so it doesn't array
in a garbage and so these custom
collections like array maps thinks that
and are specifically designed for game
so it doesn't it doesn't spin the
garbage collector has ligation XML
civilization civilization functionality
as well I'm in the high level stuff so
it comes with box to thee for physics or
bullet for 3d and has the map load
loading API that I worked on and there's
a to the same graph for managing your
game scenes and it has an e UI toolkit
so like buttons
thinks that it has all the components
and then he has a high level three the
API which is not as mature as the thule
stuff because it came at a later stage
but it's ready to use as well libgdx
supports a bunch of extensions people
contribute like their own libraries
maybe they don't make it into the core
but they become as part of like
third-party libraries and some of them
are you can select them from the from
the set up tool so Boxley is a
third-party library books to the lights
for EM for dynamic to the line in which
is quite cool there's an an AI and
third-party library as well for game
controllers for 43 tech phones things
like that and you can write your own
this one for in-app purchases so that
could be quite useful and and yeah and
one of the problems with and developing
in Java is that all you have like your
jar package at the end and you know you
need to rely on someone having the right
version of the JVM installed and then
that doesn't always work so there's
Packard which is a tool that also lives
within the lib GX environment and it's
just a command-line tool that you can
you can run and you pack runtime
environments there around ten
environments the one that you know your
game works with and with your jar and
then it creates like an XE file or
binary file that's ready to run so
that's what you could distribute on the
sub platforms and people say oh yeah
it's an open source framework survival
is not documented but the wiki at song
github has like 80 articles has
dialogues for all of the API is there's
a bunch of online stores obviously the
book that I wrote but this like forum
something so that so people who have
problems with it can just ask and you
know everyone everyone helps so it's
it's so easy to get help on only to the
X and and it's also it's also got a
really good community and sometimes with
open source projects I'm sure you've
seen like posts from the Linux kernel
and mailing list with linux or balls
being very upset and assaulting people I
think so that so that I happening in
liberty x like people send small pull
request may be there
not great because they they're new to
the project so people say oh maybe
should change these but Allah people who
come asking for help are very welcome
there's a IRC chat there's the forums
yeah people just open an issue and
Singapore requests so that that's quite
good think in the last month there were
20 marriage pull requests and 60 I think
over 60 issues active so it's a very
active project and you can see that the
github where you get like you know I 510
comments today sometimes so it's a very
active project and yeah I was going to
do a small demo and I have if it works
so I have Eclipse a project here and
it's like a like the flappy birds can
along with a plane so you can see you
have like the under project the core
project where all the logic lives and
you have your desktop project HTML and
iOS so all they called up for the game
is sexually here you don't need to touch
anything on the other projects but then
you can i see you can run it from you if
you run the Vista project it's running
into the application launcher let's hear
so it's like very simple game so it
comes with a bunch of examples and read
about this so I'll close it now but
there's a bunch of finished small games
that you can use clone from github and
they're like full examples of how to how
to use libgdx so it adds to the
documentation and you can see the code
is its I thing like three hundred lines
slice more or less so it's it's pretty
good and yeah I think that's all I had
so contributors I think they'll send
them around or something and yeah so
thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
