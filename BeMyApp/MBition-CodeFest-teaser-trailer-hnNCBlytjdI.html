developers with an urge for continuous
improvement the greatest challenge for
our developers is to provide code which
meets very complex requirements but is
still lean and elegant
a mission and particular in the UI and
user experience
department we focus mainly on the
realization for connected services
location-based services speech
personalization and instrument cluster
me the biggest challenge
he had ambition at the moment is to
bring in the best people on board
because we have obviously very exciting
products and projects that we would like
to work on the next years and for that
we obviously need the best people
today there is still quite a gap between
software development established
processes and the automotive industry
and what we aim here at ambition is to
fill these gaps the moment the people
come into our office they feel the
difference they feel that it's not just
about saying that we're agile and modern
it's yeah it's a state of mind to feel
how passionate the people are about
developing products thing and that's
something that we try every day to reach
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
