cleaning tickets and I'm tired of you
know of those tickets so I want a nap
that's going to rescue my car from
getting tickets so that's basic idea I
want as a park I want another Street
Street rules modification so I know
whether the rules of the street whether
it's a street cleaning day or whether
it's a rush hour day on a business
district or if it's on a saturday meters
are working on on so that you know I
come on Sundays and thinking about
weekend but turns out the meters are
still valid they're working on on the
sauna day and gets till I get it so I
want notification by the same time I
want somebody else to think my license
plate in case I forget so so let you
know I can thank them and my car because
I'm fair forgetful I dollar to new
information is going on in my life we're
getting a lot of stuff so somebody ping
me so that's
yeah but I'm not a techy guy so but I
have braids great minds over here so
who's gonna is gonna make it happen yang
go ahead and introduce yourself hi I'm
Ron of an oven i'm actually a resident
of san jose i have a major problem of
coming to city and getting a parking
space that i know i won't have to get a
ticket for so i'm looking forward to
trying to solve this problem i have a
previous background in crm consulting
and I've done work with startup
companies and participated with founder
institute as well and I'm hoping to
support this effort on business
development potential partners API
partners and help out help this bright
team out Dean I joined this team because
I think there's a mass appeal it's a
mass appeal I'm application and so this
main main reason but other than that you
know my pelipper I live beauteous you
know I've worked on many other startups
before answer cool way to meet other
people do any developing similar apps or
ideas my name is lovin I was something
we just gues with the back end I'm going
to live mortgages and mongodb and then
integrating the content so I just jumped
admitted people hi I'm mark oh I like at
Sunnyvale I come into sub Cisco with my
car I also had the problem so I
like the app I do iphone development in
my free time I have several apps in the
App Store so I'd like to contribute to
this app and also I'd like to meet the
new people hi my name is Allison
and I guess I'm here because those TV
seat a week before and this is you know
sort of a way to pull down from
craziness my first time I thought
actually but um I usually think I have
the phones are kind of you know a waste
of time you know but I didn't wait very
presented it like you know I have a
thumb with spirit kind of curious what
it's about and I think I said I like in
general and so on the team I am I mean
potential like also be developer but I
am officially a designer's so i will be
designing the UI in the logo and
everything the look of it and more lies
that's it
so again this screen you know this is
your iphone camera and you take a
license plate picture and you can you
know kind of crop it down so you don't
waste your bandwidth and but in case you
don't want to do that you know bad
lighting some decals to do manual entry
keyboard pops up and I'm voice entry and
I just going to say it out so the idea
is that you we don't have a logo yet so
our logo looks pretty awesome right here
um we don't even know where our name is
yet currently so this is again just kind
of like a blank concept here but it is a
very basic register interface where I'm
going to in your license info contact
and you have a list of the cars at your
own work cards that you registered so
I'd in my case I have your car Nielsen
