tracks selected mobile users by location
and we bought the amount of time to use
a stand on each designated location and
we are able to visualize that data in a
meaningful manner in the weather and
this is super easy to set up so like the
like I said the one of the use cases can
be automating logging hours for
workplace for payroll especially in
factories where the amount of time that
person works is pretty crucial to their
entire process of the company it can
also be used to track participants in a
research study and also monitoring in
Texas for schools and colleges if that
actually becomes a becomes a platform so
yeah basically once you again you get a
chance to see the vote for today or for
the previous days so for this app use
the three of us as well as some googling
please which is every ok my page so you
can see a friend in between which hours
so you can see what they come to work
and they go launched by simply placing
beacons around the office so there's
actually our logs for today and we put
in to which actually kind of talk two
hours and you as you can see we were I
to them guess around 11 and I'm in the
presentation room you can also check
each location and see the persons which
are in the room at the moment you can
also get the personalized views and see
when people come leave work at each
state so all right so we have our logger
log in page right here and I'm just
going to pretend i'm learning page for
today today's my lucky day lucky day
well here so all right so we will now
plug in 0 plate over that droid we've
had a couple issues with debugging I had
to say that iOS three now is a much
better law firm to develop ibeacon
technology on here we have his current
location he's at geekdom SF and his
history ok and his history which will
load in a little bit a tells him his
last couple locations throughout this
time of Google</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
