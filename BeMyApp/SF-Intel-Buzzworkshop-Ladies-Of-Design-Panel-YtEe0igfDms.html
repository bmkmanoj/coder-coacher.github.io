esteemed panel of ladies in game design
i actually need notes because literally
these people have done so much stuff
that i don't feel like i can play proper
homage without having some little cheat
sheet so i'm going to introduce danielle
Swank first just wave when i say your
name because unfortunately they're not
in the order that i had them on my sheet
mostly because her name is the same as
mine and it's very rare that i'm
actually on a panel with someone that
has the name danielle we're like or meet
someone who has that name so she is a
game designer and engineer she runs a
studio in San Francisco called barking
Mouse studios she has kind of lived I
think the indie dream a little bit which
is her first game lost toys sold 60,000
copies it was featured by Apple which I
think if you're an indie developer is
kind of like the very first thing where
you're like wow my game got featured and
she's wanted to own the game won a ton
of awards as well the company's a couple
years old and in addition to running the
company she does a bunch for the indie
community itself she runs a game to have
a study group that has about 600 members
that's focused on kind of fostering
community around independent game
development and a co-working space the
kind of has the same mission called game
nest and she's also doing a project
right now called make games box it's a
subscription type of service that gives
you design tools essentially on a
monthly basis wait so our next panelist
is Anna Kipnis she is a senior gameplay
programmer at Double Fine she's been
there for 13 years which i think is
amazing and an amazing testament to a
great studio she's worked on for me a
bunch of games that i actually have
played and really liked so psycho nods
brutal legend costume quest once upon a
monster the cave broken age and then she
actually in 2014 did a game where she
designed it and led the prototype it's
called dear leader it's got a great
documentary series that Double Fine
produced as part of their their
prototyping process which really awesome
it's a online really really easy to find
with Google she's also kind of got that
same theme which is she's done a lot in
terms of the
immunity as well as her job so she
founded a game jam called mullage am I
guess everybody probably knows that's
inspired by Peter mullennix she also
serves on the IGF and is a UCSC for
their masters in games and playable
media she's an advisor to that program
so Jane inge who is right next to me
she's a lead artist at campo santo
they're doing a game called fire watch
right now and she's doing all of their
environmental art and all of their
lighting so she worked at EA she worked
actually on spore and the creature
creator the godfather some pretty big
titles for them and her role as
essentially a environmental artist has
led into a lot of other areas like level
design so it's it'll be interesting to
talk to this panel about how while your
everyday job might not be game design
how many things actually wind up
intersecting or overlapping with design
or how many different types of designers
there are she's done projects really
that are kind of amazing in terms of
kind of the swing its iOS porting big
huge open world productions and you know
smaller studios bigger studios so a lot
of experience there might ran as our
panelist on the end she works at storm8
right now they are a mobile game studio
she has the distinction of having
released three games in her career that
have all been in iOS and Android
top-grossing so I think we can all
aspire to actually be able to say
something like that about ourselves in a
couple of years she's been called the
monetization maestro by game sauce and
she has won the evil game design
challenge which is a casual connect
session that essentially has you design
a game but you're kind of a black hat
monetization person while you're doing
it so it's a little bit of a parody very
fun she also has launched a site that
kind of celebrates the game developer
and game development lifestyle called
the 24-bit I definitely advise you guys
check it out some really good profiles
on there and then our last panelist is
Lauren cason she is a 3d concept artist
and a 3d artist she works at phenomena
she has really got some serious variance
in her career from what I've seen MIT
Media Lab so
kind of far-reaching interesting you
know game stuff that maybe isn't going
to be out there but it's still really
cool and fun to work on she worked at
Zynga and then she worked at Harmonix or
harmonics sorry so MMOs mobile games
lots and lots of you know music and
dance type games it really I think of
very interesting background and again
that same I did something I do games for
my living and then I also kind of give
something back to the community type of
a vibe so she works with as a mentor and
a teacher for arts and technology in
juvenile detention centers charter
schools she does the Intel computer club
house and she works with girls make
games so please welcome our panel and we
will we're going to have each of the
panelists describe what they do in a
typical day and what you do in a not so
typical day so we're going to start off
with you hi everyone so I'm an
environment artist so some people will
be surprised that I'm on a design panel
so I'll talk a little bit about that um
so my company dime working for right now
it's called Campo Santo and it's a
company of ten people so we don't really
have titles but we just have spheres of
sort of responsibility and since we're
making a story-driven exploration first
person title a lot of the design is
either sort of narrative design AK like
story writing character building that
kind of stuff or level design in the
exploration sense can you guys hear me I
should probably took it um so since I'm
doing a lot of the 3d environment art my
art making is very intimately tied to
level design so I'll describe a little
bit of how that works so there is the
like you don't about half the studio
sort of talks about how the story goes
and the exploration is still sort of in
the surface of that since we're trying
to tell a story um I'm not personally
involved as because you know I already
have enough to do but you know I'm free
I'm for you to participate if I want but
I usually choose not to so let's say the
story requires the player to go from
point A to point B and
and someone else after the story
meetings will usually be like well we
kind of think we want to go from point A
to point B and we wanna about like 15
minutes and it should feel like you
hiked a mile so that's kind of the
design constraints and then I have to
make that all they usually sort of
market out with gray boxes really sort
of minimal and then I get to turn it
into Disneyland so I will basically have
to take that kind of information and
make it an interesting 15 minute walk
and and I get all the free range like
designing how the space actually needs
to feel like National Forest in Wyoming
or just like well how exactly do you go
from I'm just using a random Disneyland
example how do you make interesting to
walk from the Haunted Mansion to space
mountain you know there's a lot of
actual level design even if you know
exactly what you want to play to do so I
do a lot of sort of sight line you know
control sight lines because you want
people to have a sense of discovery as
they are walking along a 15 minute thing
and the more you can sort of add that to
just a simple path like instead of a
straight hallway actually doing an
s-curve we're like having some sort of
like you know discovery along the way
really adds to the experience and that's
mostly the kind of design I do don't do
that basically every day I think that
hey guys so I am a gameplay programmer
and I well in general gameplay
programmer in design have a great deal
of overlap in fact when we interview our
game play programmers we do specific
questions targeted at the applicants
design sense a double fun traditionally
we have had very few designers so
gameplay programmers and world builders
actually worked with Jane for quite some
time took over different like they kind
of took over different aspects of design
like for instance Jane would be
designing the liquid which you kind of
described which would be the actual you
know the physical space design of the
plate you know making it interesting to
walk around and getting the scale
correct for the character and like all
these really important questions
where you can even design puzzles really
for anything that you're working on and
then for we would get usually so our
games at Double Fine tend to be very
narrative driven and so we would get
kind of a more like a script for what it
is that is supposed to happen in this
place and very kind of loose ideas for
puzzles and it would be kind of part of
my responsibility to iterate you know
create design little puzzles and fill in
the gaps of the design some sometimes
the design is very specific and that's
especially if you're working with a
designer we have had like under a legend
when we work together we did have some
designers specifically you know working
on puzzles and mechanics and things like
that so we would work closer with that
but even there you there's just so many
things that once you take design and try
to implement it there's still a lot of
little design gaps that you have to fill
the other experience i had that was more
i guess traditional designers i got to
lead the dear leader prototype for
amnesia fortnight which you guys if you
want to see it's on youtube which is we
had to pitch this idea then we had to do
like a 30 second pitch and then the
internet got to vote on which of the
games they wanted to see made during
Milliyet the two-week game jam and my
game got picked and so I got to lead a
whole team and one of the really
interesting things I guess like what I
think we'll talk about it later too but
one of the interesting things I learned
is just like how much you have to be
able to communicate with other
disciplines when you're a designer about
what it is you know like you have to be
able to really clearly describe what it
is you're after and what you're looking
for and so a lot of my work I thought I
would get to program a whole bunch but
in fact I ended up spending a lot of
time just making sure that my team
actually knew exactly you know that they
had all their questions answered and
there were parts of the you know parts
of the design that I hadn't really
thought through until someone actually
came over and asked me Lily how is this
actually supposed to work you know
so yeah that's pretty much that's been
my experience oh it is on um so I am a
3d and concept artist and that can mean
a lot of different things especially
depending on where you are i worked in
mobile and mmos and 3d or concept artist
means totally different things in those
spaces um the studio that about right
now phenomena we're doing sort of
experimental games and what my job looks
like on a day-to-day basis usually is we
have an art director who he's more of an
abstract artist he came from a fine art
background and so my role tends to be an
in-between with him and our engineer
taking work in saying where's the game
um yeah okay all right hi I'm Danielle
Swank um for me I run an indie game
studio and it's a tiny studio I think a
lot of like larger studios they tend to
separate different disciplines and
different designs but at barking Mouse
we have a holistic process in that
everybody is responsible for everything
and and so there's not really a way for
us we don't separate engineering from
design are both of the founders in our
company come from a UX background which
means that what we focus on is the
players experience and so for me that's
what design actually is and what I do on
a day-to-day basis so we do an enormous
amount of play testing play testing is
how for me games evolved with my last
game when we're in active development
for it like if I was talking to you at
the at the grocery store you'd have your
game in my hand and I'd be like looking
and seeing Oh what do you do you know um
because that for me is how people
interact with the worlds that I create
is my design process you know how are
they frustrated at a certain point are
they not understanding the next steps
you know that for me is where
we're games shine like where if I can
get somebody just in the middle of their
busy busy day to day of life to spend
five minutes with my creation and I feel
like I've done my job and on a day to
day basis what that is is that it's
engineering then that so that's taking
you know the stuff that I saw in my play
testing and saying okay well I have to
adjust this code and make the game play
a little bit better oh wait there people
are having trouble hitting their their
their touch targets so I have to make
sure that that sampling area is bigger
you know a game I don't ya I'm not
actually sure how to how I would
separate out there's those different
disciplines it's a really holistic
process at our studio cool so am i and
I'm a game designer so I don't draw and
I don't code anything but my job is like
Danielle said I care about the player
experience and what that means is in
mobile you want the player to come back
every single day but also you want to
motivate them to send and purchase
things in your game so for me my
day-to-day would look something like I
would check in with my team there's a
lot of communication I would find out
what our assets i would need to create
the content and from there i figure out
well how does this work in the game
world what's the story here because we
can't just put things in the game
because they wouldn't make any sense and
then from there we look at well if I put
this item in how does it work with the
game economy because it's a live ongoing
game and it's a service as well and yeah
after that um since it's it's in mobile
we get to check out the data and from
there I can see ok where our players
stuck in the quests where where is it
too easy where is it too hard and then
for the next week's content we would
adjust it so we don't make the same
mistakes so yeah I would say a game
designer at store may is someone that is
in constant communication with their
teammates and again always thinking
about the players experience so for
those of you that have worked in
multiple environments
I think the the next thing we talked
about talking about was how is it
different from one environment to
another and i think more specifically
how is your role different in a triple-a
versus kind of a smaller studio for
those of you that have kind of both
sides of that experience I spent about
four years of my early career at EA so
which is a very triple-a experience and
then i worked at Double Fine which is
about a 60-person studio when I was
there's a lot that's mid-sized and now
i'm at ten percent so i've sort of seen
my role through all these different
scales i would say in triple a's
definitely a lot more sort of if you're
an artist then you're not it's like even
more fine-grained than what you even
think like if your environment modeler
you probably wouldn't even get to make
the textures but you're just modeling
and a lot of times your art making is
actually very separated from the design
process so which is why I prefer smaller
studios because you just have to do more
and um I feel like once it gets out to
sort of maybe like a 20 person team then
just everyone has to do everything and
um yeah I guess that's sort of my view
on how yeah I I think sort of say
something similar I think when I was
working in MMOs and it was sort of one
of my first jobs we're finding out that
there was a girl in the Environment
Department who like the only thing she
did was paint rock textures and like she
was so good at it she made amazing rocks
but but that was like her whole job she
did it for like two years um and like
how specialized you could get in triple
I'm um and at smaller studios it was you
you get to have more hats um the other
thing that was a very different for me
is how quickly your work ends up getting
out there um so if you're at a triple a
studio you might draw a concept and it
doesn't get modeled for two months it
doesn't you know get implemented you
don't see that in a game for like maybe
years um but in mobile if you're working
on a live game then you get that concept
that morning it's modeled and it's in
the game tonight which is you know it
can be good or bad depending but it's
it's much quicker I had a very similar
so actually I I when I started double
fine I didn't think of it as like a
smaller studio well I mean yeah that's
true is missing well so because we were
we were competing at the beginning we
were competing with triple-a games so
that was kind of crazy I mean we had
like Jane was saying we had about 60
people when we were doing this huge open
world game but yeah the difference is
like you got to work you got to oversee
a lot more of the design or like a lot a
lot more of like every every step of the
way actually when we had our amisha
fortnight the very first game jam at the
studio we divided into very small teams
kind of it was kind of like my first
taste of what an indie studio would have
been like I think our team was about
seven people we didn't get an audio
person and so I actually ended up doing
a lot of the audio like just you know
picking out songs and whatever just
forgetting them in the game and this is
this is it kind of speaking to what you
know the other panelists are saying that
essentially you get to do a lot more
you're a lot more in touch with why
things are where they are and you know
what the I guess the design motivation
for those things being in there and
that's that's i would say personally
that's more gratifying so we've kind of
sit with or had a common theme here
which is you know what is it what's
different between kind of indie
development versus kind of more than
triple a type of development what I
would be interested in its kind of to
wrap up this topic is games as a service
everybody's kind of talked about it a
little bit especially around like mobile
if you're building web games if you've
done open-world MMOs there's a big
difference between a game that you ship
on console that even if it has DLC and a
game that you ship and then people play
it every month and there's an
expectation of content whether that's on
mobile or pc and so we have we do have
some varied experience on that people
have worked on MMOs people have worked
on you know iOS titles and Android
or even smaller games that ship in a box
which you know is not as popular these
days they still make a reasonable amount
money so it'd be interested in kind of
getting your perspective what really not
just in the design but what really
changes fundamentally about the process
in the game I don't have any triple
experience just mobile but as a game
designer I think it's still the same
like we still we want to make fun games
right at the end of day we want to make
something fun something enjoyable and
things that our players will love ya so
for me I only have an indie background
and we shipped a game like it was over
it was done with there was no extra
content I though come from a web
background where that's so different
where web web sites are updated every
day twice a day five times a day you
know get crazy with it um and so it was
so nerve-racking to me um I know
everybody says Mobile's really fast but
like for me that like day or two of like
waiting for App Store approval was like
wait if there's a bug I can't fix it
like been um so that's actually kept me
up at night right before we ship like I
major I qaid everything and then I q8
some more uh I mean it paid off and
because we had zero crash reports which
is huge but it was it was a very even
mobile with a very very different
experience for me um I've only worked on
like non surface like games I guess the
flip side of that is that if you're
especially the more sort of triple-a you
go and people get really secretive about
the development and sometimes that
really actually isn't good so it is very
important to strike a balance of you
wanting to do like your perfect creation
and then oh like this is the perfect
thing and then you show everybody but
like the thing is like what you think is
good and what you used to doing is not
what new players would see and I kind of
sometimes wish oh I wish that our game
is kind of more like a surface because
then once we know Oh a hundred people
played it
they none of them got what we were
trying to do then you can maybe try to
address it but so for people who are
doing non-service light games without a
lot of updates then you have to really
play test your game and make sure what
you're trying to communicate is indeed
communicate it before you let the baby
go and then you can't touch it anymore I
have just one quick thing to add like
the idea of work like when I think when
I was coming up in school and I I think
I had a an idea of what game development
was going to be like and it wasn't going
to be like a game takes longer to
develop and it takes to go to high
school or something like I mean it's
just I I thought you know what I
remember when we had our first likes to
do game jam I was like this is what I
thought in school like two weeks you're
done you know right and it's like I
remember like there's a the cross heroes
guys gave this talk at GDC and they were
like yeah this game like took like six
weeks or something it was so long we
were like yeah I i think my shortest
daves dev cycle of the game I ever
worked on with yeah I was it was a very
long time so that i think is another
huge difference just when you're if
you're going to be working on a
non-service game it's possible that
you're going to be on it you can't even
talk about it and no one's gonna see it
for a very long time yeah um so the last
mobile studio that I worked at was
completely open development we streamed
our scrums like yeah it was it was
insane but it went over really really
well like we had a following before our
game without um and we were getting
feedback constantly from players which
you know like some people are down for
them some people aren't um but I think
open development is an interesting space
that people are getting into uh also
something that was very strange as an
artist when I was 14 games as a service
is you're getting immediate data
feedback on your art you can say like
the blue armor did way better than the
red armor and you have numbers so that
that was very strange strange in like a
way that was good worse day
yeah i think it was good um I think it's
just like as an artist I think you're
usually sort of like working in a bubble
and hoping that people like your work
and and having literal numbers like a
sheet of data about what did well and
what did not was interesting so I think
the the next thing that we had we were
talking about was do you kind of you get
a pass as an indie dev right because
you're a five-person studio you know
it's your quality bar lower can you
actually put something out there that's
better or sorry that's not as good as a
triple a studio would yeah I think I I'd
like to take this one first um you don't
like hey this is sad truth about indie
development you were your games are
judged in the same scale as everybody
else's games so they have to like no
matter what you know my games are judged
at a triple-a level which you know is
it's fine actually because I feel like
as a single person I should be able to
do triple a quality what I can't do
because I don't have another hundred
people working with me is I can't do
triple a scope but what I but I can take
my little tiny game and I can polish it
up and make it this little jewel box of
the game actually the first game that we
made the idea from it came from Skyrim
we I love Skyrim but what and my one of
my favorite parts is there's a
lock-picking minigame in inside of it
and it's just it's amazing how much
tension how much emotion that these
people were able to put in just as
little simple rotational mechanic and
I'm like wow that's amazing I can't do
Skyrim that I can do the lock-picking
game do we get a pass i would say i
would say i want there to be any of us i
guess the only sort of pass you get
isn't that as a small indie you are free
to do the more open development and you
are free to engage with your community
and like possible fans more so you do
get to sort of tell them how you came up
with your ideas this is how we've been
doing it
look at how hard has been and people i
think do sort of resonate with the story
of you developing something more so than
if you're a triple a so like that would
be the only pass i think you would get
because otherwise if your game doesn't
work it doesn't work it doesn't matter
people paid sixty dollars for it or
twenty dollars for it they will still
you know hate you and yell at you on
twitter and all those things um but um
the only yeah the only thing he says
that you do get to have more of a
personal connection with your fans and
your community and it can be very
rewarding and I and if anyone here is
doing indie stuff I strongly strongly
encourage you do more open development
because it actually you get a lot out of
it I think this is I just well um we
were discussing this I just had like a
bit of a devil's advocate idea about
this so you don't get a pass if you're
trying to be in a commercial space if
you're trying if you're really if you're
in it if you really want to make a great
game and be able to sell it do you don't
get a pass because you're going to be
competing against much bigger budget you
know let's be realistic here however if
your if your focus is to do something
experimental and crazy and you know
really put all of like you know maybe
may even make a statement like you know
this isn't about visual appeal I mean
you can still do polish in ways that are
different from you know the traditional
ideas of polish right so you can still
and i think that's totally acceptable
and like I think that there's you can do
a lot of really innovative and weird
things like they're you know tale of
tales recently announced unfortunately
that they're not going to make games but
all of their games while they you know
they were somewhat polished experiences
all did something interesting and there
is real value in that all right we have
any questions in the audience okay Oh
excellent I'm so glad that there are
some artists on the panel for this
particular question so back in the day
when arcade games were very popular
there wasn't a lot of graphic fidelity
that was available and a lot of the game
mechanics released it on their own in
this day and age we have so much more
opportunity in that sense
do you think that from a design
perspective that visuals get in the way
sometimes of great mechanics um I don't
think they should I think it's easier to
wow people there no um but I don't think
that great games are doing that or well
I don't think they're not wowing people
but I don't think that the great games
that you see aren't still solid in their
mechanics do you wanna do you want to go
I cuz i um i guess like for me I'm kind
of a picky player like if a game isn't
beautiful in some way I actually really
it's very hard for me to pursue it I um
but I think the difference is that now
there are a lot of ways to make
beautiful games it's not just that well
I have you know just many normal maps or
whatever like that is not what makes a
beautiful game what you can have very
stylized and whatnot and like all that
can as long as all that kind of art but
not all the graphics you know all the
actual attention to beautiful art is in
surface of what you're trying to do with
your game like if it's like a say like
we're doing a narrative game so a lot of
times to tell myself is like well I
really want to make some more rocks
because I love it and as beautiful is
like well does the fourth rock make your
story better then if not then stop
making more rocks like make something
that nexim going to actually serve us
your story so I think as long as the art
is there to not just be sparkly then I
think it could make your experience a
lot better just because you know it mean
games are like a visual audio all that
kind of stuff right it could add a lot
and it could make it just very
distracting to so so for me personally
working with artists fidelity is the
thing that is that makes makes it
different like the higher fidelity your
game is the more difficult it is if you
decide to you know do something you
completely like change mechanics or
aspects i do you if you for instance
adding a character is a huge cost
for your animators for your modelers
things like that so if your character if
your game is beautiful but lower
fidelity you might be able to do that at
a much cheaper cost and without you know
agonizing over as much so I think it
really depends I think on for talking
like a realistic game that it's going to
be really difficult to do I you know I
guess the art may get in the way of
doing some crazy stuff because you know
real with realism you have constraints
that you wouldn't if you if you had a
more stylized look or something like
that also I think fidelity like high
fidelity stuff is not necessarily where
a lot of interesting things are
happening right now if you look at
mobile like Monument Valley princess Ida
maybe had 50 polygons um two colors and
I still think that was one of the best
game character designs that I've seen in
a while so in a lot of mobile games you
looking at like ps1 mobile graphics
8-bit graphics are coming back there's
still cool stuff happening with very
little resources I just want to give you
a word of encouragement about indie
getting a pass and that is that you must
be aware and if you're not you will be
in a second that the steam machine is
going to largely be the platform for
indie and that's because it's a unique
OS and to open OS and so they're not
going to spend a lot of time on money
porting over old console and PC games
they're going to start new with with
Indies so you have a platform all to
yourself what I heard through the talk
that really resonated with me I've been
a designer since like 95 and worked on
Triple A from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater i'm
now creative director at a indie studio
in emeryville and the thing that's
correlated the most to the quality of
the game is what you're talking about in
terms of getting everyone on the team to
understand that they too are designers
when a gameplay programmer decides that
we're going to use a radius based system
for detection that carries so much
weight with it so I would love to hear
if any of you have had either one very
successful or very unsuccessful thing
that you tried to convey that message of
ownership of the design to your teams so
ownership for us is built into our DNA
we we all since we all do everything um
but it's really interesting um like my
partner also does play testing as well
and when he noticed that people were
missing hit targets on on smaller
screens he introduced to tap stochastic
touch sampling so yeah we did have been
a bigger radius and of and then improved
our mobile experience enormously but but
it's stuff like that I work also with
contractors and we try to while we
control the creative direction we also
try to empower them to do their jobs to
the fullest abilities so like if I'm
using a contractor that I work with you
know before and on a regular basis that
we've developed a bunch of trust with
you know I'm like oh okay here these are
the textures that we're going to put on
the models these are some big ideas I
have about this what do you think and
you know go run with it because I do
think it is important that everybody
should have ownership and understand
kind of the principles behind the game
that you're trying to make otherwise you
know you get you get a less cohesive
theme you know because people will still
go and do their do their work to the
best of their abilities but they don't
understand kind of the reason and the
ownership behind what they're doing then
you get a bunch of different
perspectives instead of a cohesive
perspective
um this may be a controversial thing to
say but I also feel like you've your
small a team and you get a group you
together with a very specific knowledge
that if you guys don't make it together
there's no second game that really
really pushes the whole ownership thing
like you wouldn't believe like I feel
like I'm pretty close to a lot of sort
of tech world people and I've seen like
I always I used to think that oh if you
just have a small a team then everyone
buys in and below below but actually I
just stopped thinking that like I feel
like a lot of it is just like if you
have like if somehow you have a small
team but there's so much money or
resource that somehow like you know that
fire under your butt is just not the
same as if you're like hey like this is
our baby and you know if we when I try
to you know make a second game or
whatever like this is your one chance
and you know that's all really you know
and and that understanding has to be
from day one and I feel like that really
like I feel like that's the only sure
way that I personally know of that
really ensures ownership so for my game
it's a live game and our team is very
small zactly one of our producers went
up to me and was like we should what do
you think of like a monster raid in your
game and I was like a monster raid what
do you mean like you know like go beat
up monsters and stuff I was like yeah
okay like I took his idea and I you know
we would work it around to make it fit
in with the game world but it wasn't
like no you're not designing my game I
would listen to like other people's idea
than like yeah I think this could work
so I my experience is actually primarily
in web and then the studio I'm doing
right now is mobile and I came from a
traditional at background but something
that I took from kind of app development
even enterprise development that has
worked really well with my teams is
everything we talk about is in terms of
the player experience so my background
is a very heavy and like network
programming so when i get a network
person and the person is like oh it
doesn't really matter what i do how does
that impact the player experience it's
like duh it impacts every time it talks
to the server you know everything about
the game if you're building kind of a
sore
service or a client server based game
can be impacted or made better if it's
faster if you're geographically
distributed so the the it really what
has worked well for me with my teams in
the past has been take the thing they're
working on and tie it to something that
is visual in the game even if it's
something that you would normally only
see on the command line or if you
rendered it in Maya like talk to them
walking through the process and what
that really equates to when you're
running the studio and I think or when
you're a designer is you need to know
enough about every discipline to
understand how they really do impact the
game right how it builds cohesion and
how you know having a you know putting
your finger on the screen and having
this sheep explode as an actual you know
kind of like little thing that somebody
ads into the game that fits but it might
not have fit if they had done it a
different way so I think that's really
what it comes down to or that's what
I've had the most success with Brian
Davis very very small studio here me and
my son Josiah Davis Lee we built a game
called Paper Chase and we were surprised
to get about two million downloads and
in this short relations okay um and then
we got some investor money and so I'm
gonna ask you a hypothetical if you had
that kind of success and we went at one
level of our game but people really love
that obviously would you take the
investor money would say that you know
it's around like half a million dollars
would you take that invest your money
and build more content and focus it on
building a bigger game or would you
focus it on building game economy or
would you split it like 5050 or would
you split it twenty eighty or that kind
of thing I know if I kind of really
vague hypothetical but just in the
interest of time so for me it would
really you're very small it would really
depend on kind of what my goal was right
is it a goal of a lifestyle business
that supports you and kind of keeps you
running month to month and maybe gives
you a little bit of disposable income
and a small amount of growth or do you
want to build you know the next
100 million dollar title I mean I think
everybody wants to build an X
hundred-million-dollar title like that
if you don't and you're a little bit
different than other people but you
really have to think about what are you
trying to get from that and it would
there be a lot of factors I think that
would go into how i would spend that
money or what I would do Who am I
getting the money from what can they buy
me is it strategic money can they help
me publish can they help me market my
game as well and then things like you
have something that people love i would
say i'm partial to build more of the
thing that people that the things that
people love but if you feel like at the
core you can't actually make money from
the game there isn't a good monetization
loop or a mechanic or you feel like it's
too bolted on that might force me to
kind of look at doing something
differently so it really is dependent on
the situation but i'd first start with
what's your goal right in terms of what
do you feel like you can get from this
and then what does it by you cover my
future perspective and that would be
whether or not i was i was going to be
willing to take the cash or not and move
forward with it I was like do you also
the thing is like if you really want to
make more content for it because you
enjoy it that's one thing or like our
people asking for more content are they
paying willing to pay money for it I
don't think all those things you need to
consider but it's also fine to just have
a short and sweet thing and then have
another idea you know if that's what you
want to do I feel like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
