here and most of you must already have
received an email from me from Michelle
or from Sandra and so we just want to
say thank you for being here and I would
like to introduce you to a pitted Enki
who will be speaking and introducing you
to this webinar so um tita you can split
up hello my name is Peter done clean i'm
here with andrew golf blue we're from a
session and we're here to talk about
decision forks go on today so as I'm
sure you all know because you've come to
this webinar the fortune phone app
challenge is life today as part of this
we want to help you take it out global
so what we're inviting you all to do is
to create a project based on our 4G SDK
and you could be in the running to to
win a stage at this year's global tech
events Mobile World Congress and soaked
by Southwest and so you know please
submit your app so as as I mentioned my
name's Peter don't clear I'm a technical
director here at decision I'm
responsible for the overall architecture
of be 40 x EK and this is under the Gulf
who's a senior architect and the team
working on forge SDK so for those of you
don't know i'm just going to spend two
minutes giving a bit back a bit of a
background on a surgeon so a sittin at a
glance we're the number one next-gen
provider in the world today we've got a
20 year plus history and we don't want
two trillion messages a year and what a
global company with 35 offices across
six countries 650 plus employees and a
large support team we were the first
company to launch an SMS see that's the
piece of infrastructure that was into
mobile networks to enable the routing of
text messages and today
all who all for clover provide services
as well as a trans messaging
capabilities web RTC so um i'm going to
start just by giving a little bit of
history about web RTC I both the chef
that's currently going through
communications today so a lot of people
ask whether web RTC and the developments
that are happening today our evolution
or revolution and I always I contend
that they're both because if you look at
the history of the World Wide Web we
started with the static pages in the
early 90s through two dynamic pages
through two applications that actually
run in the growth in vizar web apps and
through two applications today using
technologies like web RTC that enable
real-time communication between users
and this has been a very map of
evolution is hard to imagine today but
but only quarter of a century ago the
internet as we know it it really exists
the World Wide Web didn't come into
existence until linking lately but if
you look at telecommunications this is a
real revolution telecommunications has
taken 250 years to do what the world
wide web and the Internet has done
quarter of a century and and the big
difference between telecom started where
we are today is that if you look at
things like the optical Telegraph which
was used by Napoleon to direct his
armies across France or if you look at
electrical Telegraph's which required
Putin wires across a continent or
telephone systems these cost billions
and billions and billions of pounds to
belen instead of all it's something you
can really only do
as part of a massive organization as or
as part of the government and prove we
are to do things like web RTC and the
revolution that's occurring
Communications is that you don't need
that kind of infrastructure you don't
need that kind of backing to build
something now there's been a room
democratization or of this industry and
for me a decision we're trying to do is
help developers get in there and and
take advantage of all these advances and
basically what we're talking about is
RTC way and web RTC and a lot of people
get confused so RT C Webb is simply the
stack MTC web is being defined by the
IETF and it defines what was over the
wire what the bits are all the way
through to what kind of encryption to
use what could X do you use and the idea
is by providing this single definition
that is secure that is peer-reviewed
that is well put together it makes it
very easy for very different people to
write applications that can interoperate
like browsers and with web RTC d well
this is what the w3c are doing and
that's about providing an epi the
JavaScript API that goes into the web
browsers to enable people to use the UK
capabilities so what is forged by a
surgeon well with forged by a surgeon we
have taken web RTC on a variety of
related technologies and pull them
together into a single SDK which means
that you have a single SDK with an epi
that will run in your browser that we're
running through and Firefox and that
will allow you to do rich communications
video audio video messaging presence in
a browser but also in a mobile app you
can build native applications as well
and what that means is that with forged
by a seizure you can write a native
application on iOS and a native
application on Android and
about and we can all communicate with
each other you can make calls between
them you can send messages between them
you can transfer files and why would you
do this will it allows you to
revolutionize whole range of sectors
healthcare their banking all of these
call center paper things can can be
enhanced or what about online dating you
know you can have a not easily build an
online speed dating service or you know
you could use this as part of a
realistic application to shore house
you're wanting to view a property and
you can get that they're so the estate
agent insured or amanda was involved in
a recent date who's also on the call but
quietly no at a recent conference you
could do a an application where you get
dietary advice where you can have a
personal shopper going on the
supermarket selecting your good faith
there's a wide range of opportunities
that this technology opens up and so
basically for my decision is a smart
communications framework so as I've said
click to call video chat from a website
whether it's call centers health care
advice anything contextual information
this is really really important if I'm
logged into my bank and I want to create
a transaction isn't it great and I can
just click a button go straight through
to an off later who already knows what I
am because I've logged in to the back
who already knows what I need help with
because I clicked on a bottom next to
the transaction and create kweon you can
massively improve the user experience of
these mundane services and even better
for the company is delivering it you can
save money because by doing this you can
shave minutes of each phone call into
your call center and that means you can
do more with less people so that's my
quick introduction to portforward by
incision is and now i'm going to hand
you over to Andrew McGough who's going
to actually fall in this webinar go
through building some apps right now
just to show you how easy it is to do
this quickly ok hello
so the main thing I'd like to try and
get across in this webinar it's just how
easy and how easy the forge SDK makes it
to create messaging presents video and
voice applications at a completely
cross-platform they cover android/ios
and the web so in this webinar i'm going
to try and create a simple android chat
application and connected to a
compatible iOS chat application and i'm
going to show you how to create a HTML
web RTC application which does audio and
video and then i'm going to modify the
original android application to connect
the video to the video that's output
from the web application that have just
developed so that's quite ambitious the
bill that you might think but we'll do
it right so the first thing you need to
get started is to get a forge SDK
account know if you do that you'll get
through to the porridge website and this
is what it looks like now you can see
where I'm pointing and that is one of
the key pieces of information you need
there that's the API key which you which
is unique to you and you used to but
connecting to the porch at work and if
you click on the view user accounts
button you'll get a list of 10 user
accounts that have been assigned to the
development is it just for develop the
users so you'll get 10 accounts and 10
passwords I've obviously and blocked out
the passwords for this presentation okay
this is a flowchart of the internals we
won't concentrate on that too much and
and if you click on the download button
on that webpage you'll get to this page
which is where you actually download the
SDK so as you can see you can download
the SDK for Android iOS and for
JavaScript which is obviously the web
and as a whole bunch of demo
applications and you can also get to the
documentation through this page okay so
I'm going to start with Android as I
said an Android chat application and so
this basically the first thing you need
to do with the accession SDK is connect
to the orange network and this is this
simple piece of code is what you need to
connect 4g network on
so if you look at the top line that's
where you put in the API key username
and password which like I showed you on
the web page there's a little bit of
configuration just to say that we want
persistent connections and then you
basically then you basically set up a
new a season SDK you set up some
callbacks so that when you see an SDK
connects and we display that it's
connected on on our android application
page and then start messaging so that's
all you need to do to connect the forge
SDK a network of an Android and then the
rest of our app to do this chap we just
need two more functions one is to set
one is to set up the callbacks for
testing messaging which effectively
receives a message and displays it on a
view on the on the Android application
and the other is do send function which
is linked to a button on the application
and actually sends a message and so as
you can see is very little code there
and most of the code is there is
actually updating the actual controls on
the actual Android app and these are the
steps you need to go through to create
the app which I'm going to actually do
now why okay so I'm gonna skate from
that open android studio which is the
latest way of developing android apps
and mechanic creating you create a new
android studio project call its them
test shutter for instance chap chap test
Edmund accept the default version of the
API and we'll just do a blank activity
and we'll just accept the defaults for
that and hopefully should create an
application
so it takes a few seconds that I'm from
studio to create the basic application
having good so okay close that so it's
creates a basic hello world application
for you and the first thing we need to
do is actually get the forge an SDK
libraries int into the into the actual
application framework so these are what
you get from the downloads web page that
I've already shown you so basically if I
open you get an SDK zip file so I'm
going to copy the jar files out of them
give you the two jar files go back to
none oh it's you again and there you go
into it's best to go to the project view
so it can get a clear review of the
application from there now you're going
to fold a call of lips so i'll paste
those in there okay then you need to
right click on those and say that you're
going to add as a library to the
application I think you only actually
need to do that in one of them and then
I need to copy that the native libraries
which are the kind of underlying web RTC
libraries that the application uses so
to do that you create a folder under
main okay and I lips you correctly lips
okay and we're going to copy copy the
these to do falls into their
okay let's now got the library's added
to the Android application so another
thing that we need to do is need to
update the unemployed manifest file
because as this is obviously doing
network communications and also
accessing web cams we need to give the
application permission to that to access
other things to standard Android thing
you're going to do so I got some code
and paste into there so it's just poor
line is to say give this application
permission to access the internet camera
network status and to record all of you
someplace that internet under a Monday
spoil them ok now let's have a look at
the layout of the application that we've
got by default so the default layout for
an Android application is a hello world
is what you get by default obviously
that's not what we want for our chat
application so I've got some and to save
time I'm not going to draw this manually
I'm going to actually just import from a
file i have already created and I'll
talk you through what it actually does
replace the hello world one so basically
basically what it was that's what it's
gone the controls look like so it's
basically text view which tells you the
status of the application which kind of
stuff is connecting and text box where
you type in the destination you want to
send to and a text box where you type in
the message you want to send a button
which is kind of actually setting a
message and then scrolling a scrollview
with a textview in it which is going to
show you a list of the messages you've
actually received and so if you look at
that that's what it's going to look like
fish up so just with that small amount
of XML to finds that you do let yourself
by actually dragging the controls into
that
they're into the actual window here
probably just imported the xml file to
make it a bit quicker okay now the next
part is to actually get the code in
there so we look at the job of file
that's been created I basically just
opens the basic Android activity I need
to put in there to cope with it just
shown you a minute ago on the slides so
that it got stored in another text file
yeah ok so its base to this piece of
code here cut and paste that into the
top of him so that's the bit that
connects to the accession network as I
said that's and that's a bit as the
standard text messaging as I showed you
on the slides and I'm going to call the
start method when the ugly when the
activity opens up spoke on a cole slaw
ok as you can see there's a whole bunch
of non important methods there got so to
save time I cop import lines that make
their you can actually get them mind
anybody's doing all tentative oh so it's
a good time to just paste again ok so
most of those should disappear the
couple still left that I've obviously
forgotten so I'm gonna quickly add
closed using alternate there that should
be it so things are looking green since
looking pretty good so as you can see
however I've actually the API key I've
used is the one that was originally on
my webpage i'm logging in as the user
called Andy forge and we were both calm
0 so now i'm going to try and run this
application in the simulator
I'll play think I've got the simulator
open in advance because it takes a
little while to open my open its going
to compile and I can run it ok so its
farming simulator making move in there
here we go tighten up okay sleep because
you can taste connecting to the network
now it's connected so that means it's
successfully connected to the vorange
network so I'm going to try and send a
message to itself that's the only thing
I'm created so far this was the username
from the earlier that was on the web
page I send it a hello message as you
can see instead it's been a message
received from unbored champion will go
from zero and the messages hello so
that's worked basically and okay so go
back to the slides quickly okay okay
okay right ok so that's face of the app
that I've just created okay so it's the
next step does anyone have any questions
at this point I'm happy to take
questions on the Android if anyone has
me about to move on to the iOS version
the same act okay well carry on ok so
now I'm going to do the equivalent in
iOS so this is pretty much identical
code to what we did in in our
android/ios so it opens the SDK you pass
it the API key the username the password
and and then we wait for an unconnected
event which comes back through an
objective-c delegate you display that
you've connected on the actual
application screen screen screen theme
you get access the messaging part of the
porridge SDK and set a delegate so that
you will like to receive messaging
messages
and then there's equivalent of bits to
what I used earlier in the android sdk
so there's a non message received
callback which gets called when the
message gets received and it puts it
into the into the control for showing
receiving messages and there's a sale
impressed which is linked to the actual
button on the on the actual application
that will send a message when you click
it and these are the steps you've got to
go through to to create an application
and get it running into Xcode throw
quite small steps then how actually do
it now open the banks code and create a
new Xcode project I'm going to do a
single View application because just to
keep things simple and it's worth saying
that normally when you do an application
like this you'd probably put a login and
a password box to start with but I'm
just I'd covina decide to keep things
simple and to actually be able to do it
within the time but as we probably
normally do and i'm going to type in it
in a name for the application i'm going
to call it iOS comes up next save it i
repurposed in the default basically
suggests right so i also has created me
a default project called iOS chat app
now similar to the android thing the
first thing I've got to do is actually
get the libraries into the project so
and best place to go on there is to
click the iOS chat at the top there
click the project there go to build
settings and type a header
hello Oh had a quick with additional
matter director isn't and like I
understand I had a search paths along ok
I need to add to that and I'm just find
the folder that I need to add to it so I
know copying the head is from it there's
zip file you get from that the website
to a folder in my documents folder so I
just pick one of the headers to get info
on it and I'll give me the directory
name there but I need to payson so i'll
paste that into their site internet and
then I've also got added a lot library
search path to pick up the library's
path so after then let's face the same
but with libraries instead of haters
it's all pretty straightforward so I get
into there and then I've got to actually
all right now I'm going to add the other
libraries themselves to the target
project so
libraries if i open the libraries folder
and that's all the libraries i need to
add from the forge sdk case those
internet and there's a couple of extra
light as you need because the web RTC
libraries depend on it something i had
30 access GL kit which is for the opengl
spite of things and there's that i see
you pop off which is placed an opening
yes lip c++ because it uses c++ behind
the scenes to web RTC web RTC library
and final one is less equal light up
need all of those and then there's also
one final thing I've got to do to
configure it which is to add a linking
flag and this is so can get access to
all them everything Mike's additional
link i think it's called conditional
Englishman Flags Over think of like that
so cut it out to their job see so that's
they can get hold of all the symbols it
means to be able to compile the
application okay I think that that's the
main steps I need to do before I can
actually start great in the app now and
so the main things i need to update the
view controller which well obviously
when you create a single view up
everything is driven from one view which
is kind of the code for that interview
controller da page of you control the
docket and so i'm going to add some code
to that
okay I'm just going to find one all
right so this is the view controller to
page you want to open it so this is
basically they're exactly the same as
the original one that's already they
accept it adds a few delegate classes to
it so that we actually receive the
colfax than various SD King SDK methods
they get call back and confirm later you
need to do control it up and I've got it
pasting that as well so this is this is
basically same code as I showed you on
the slide so there's a loading function
which sets of the SDK with the username
password and the connected callback
which sets of messaging and there's at
send pressed handler so that basically
is the code behind it but we haven't got
a layout for the actual app page so I'm
gonna create that now now I'm going to
just quickly do that manually this time
so I label at the top which is where I'm
gonna just play the state this appears
on 1 we're going to put a text box if
you where I'm going to type in there i'm
going to type in the actual destination
for the message but in another text
field you should be where i'm going to
put in the message that i'm going to
send and i'll put it in a button which
will get the same glutton for the
application put that in there and then
i'll put in a text view which would be
where i actually display the text itself
the case we see
okay no if I get too wide right so so
the label I'm just going to put instead
I'm just going to put connecting in
there which is going to be the initial
status that we get going to put a bit
wider place all that i'll put
destination so you know when you can
type in message is the place over there
send is the textbook 1 i'm going to
clear out that you can't see ok ok ok
then so turn on the assistant view which
means i can see the code and the actual
controls next to each of them and and i
can have a quick preview what that's
going to look like when it runs on a
real device from there so make these
little bit wider yeah okay
you so I've got that and now I've got
connect these controls to the actual
code itself so I be able to view
controller em and I just have to all i
do is i right click from there to the
actual correct control so that one I
want to be an estate asst I want to want
to be my destination I want I want to be
my message that box that I want to be my
chat list the send button I want to link
that to the same press event come here
so hopefully I look at those chat list
same pressed Estridge destination and
that should be it that should be in an
iOS application which is the same thing
as the android application created
earlier so I'm going to try and run that
now in the iOS emulator just taking a
little while to load up okay here we go
I'm thing at the Android one alongside
it okay i'm going to start so it's
connected to the sdk network or jess UK
and now i'm going to try sending a
message to itself this is common warlin
can upset this one of us can also try to
send a message to it and as you can see
it's actually received the message now
i'm going to try sending a message to
the android version of the application
which I can do pay just change that to a
zero now hopefully it should appear in
this android window as soon as i do this
there it is so the ios app sends a
message straight to the android app
looks so back to the presentation so
that's pretty much it for creating a
nice and an android
okay we've just had a few questions come
in so I'm just going to go through the
questions we have so far and then and it
will continue with the presentation so
the first question from a green Palin is
the hands-on tutorial it provided with
the SDK is quite basic didn't finish
tools of the web is that burning
especially for iOS can we get as
presentations like these presentation
slides so these slides will will be
available and we'll be providing them to
mod at the end of this presentation
there are also some tutorial videos
available on YouTube with more going up
all of the time and we'll make sure that
you get a link to those and there is a
question from each other from Romero
Garcia would it be possible to use
JavaScript SDK and tackle with prova
instead of those android/ios etc and the
answer to that is not at this time
there's no card or support at this time
I said anyway securely store the off
details role in config well yes as Andy
mentioned that he's pretend he was name
and password hard-coded into the
application for speed there really
wouldn't already do that you wouldn't
normally do that you would normally have
a user intro their own username and
password to use the app somebody's
asking weird to get covered for
messaging well the again this
presentation will be will be shared
afterwards that was from Alice we
searched another one from remain Palin
is push kept quiet which scio saved only
push kit is not required you can write
web RTC applications to receive calls
with a push hit then that will work on
both iOS 7 on iOS 8 but we also do
support the use of push get on IRC so
you can break your application in a more
efficient way ok and there's been a
couple of other questions about
presentation yes there will be
a piece of a presentation made available
so I'll and the carrion know with the
next part of his demonstration okay so
that basically shows you how to set up a
simple chat messaging app op that covers
both Android and idols and so I'm now
going to move on to showing you how it
on a web page you can do exactly the
same thing connect to them or just UK
and this time we're going to try and do
web RTC video rather than messaging and
so I'm sure you slides for that okay so
this is the basic HTML for the
application so these three lines
basically just import the libraries that
I'm using the application so i'm using
jquery to make it easier to manipulate
the kind of underlying dom of the HTML
page and that's the sdk and I'm
JavaScript library then amusing
underscore to make a few operations
simplicity this is the body and then the
body of the HTML page and it looks a lot
more complicated is it's just a simple
top level did inside it there's an audio
tag which is what actually plays the
audio for the web page and then then
within that desert span which is what
i'm using for displaying status and
updating updating this to show the
status as the calls going on and there's
two buttons now this up made it so that
you can actually connect us to different
users the idea behind that is you can
you can open the page twice on the same
computer as a different user and then
you can make a call from one to the
other just for testing purposes so
that's kind of why I'm done them so
there are two buttons one two connectors
use 112 connects you to two there's two
video tags and this is where the remote
video is going to be displayed and when
the local videos can be explained
there's a simple text box which is what
i'm going to use to type in the
destination when you want to make a call
as important to actually do the call and
that's important to disconnect call so
as you can see it's just a fairly simple
user interface to find in HTML right so
this is the equivalent of what we've
already done
in android and iOS so it just connects
to the forge network so it's kind of
equivalent api's but in HTML sorry in
javascript as opposed to objective c or
java so you basically set your username
and password again I've hard-coded
there's two in this app because you can
connect this to different users then you
call is to create the SDK connection
this is the callback you get when you
connect and inside this callback I've
actually this time around I'm actually
setting up the web RTC call back now
what that's actually doing is let's send
up a call back when you actually receive
an incoming call that's pretty video or
audio alright so this is this is the
only bit of extra JavaScript you need to
be able to handle an incoming call so
this is the callback from the previous
slide so as you can see I set up a call
back on increment session when you
receive call now this is the own income
accession function so it basically
receives the session complicates the
status to say there's an increment
course that's just that they actually do
that was on to put the span actually
that was on the web page then it feeds
in the incoming call into the video and
audio tags that we set up on the page so
it finds those here and then updates
that updates the object that gets
returned and then it sets for nother
call back when the call gets
disconnected now this is interest in
this light accepts the call normally in
most applications you wouldn't accept
the call at this point you'd actually
make a ringing noise and then use do
take an action to say except the call
but to keep things simple I'm accepting
to call at this point so it essentially
answers straight away that kind of
reading period but yeah that's just to
keep this demo simple and this is to
handle outgoing couples so this function
is linked to the button to send a call
so it basically reads the destination
from the from the destination text box
it doesn't outgoing Weber I just need
connect and this sets up a few callbacks
when it connects and then it
says that I want to do audio and video
in the core and it connects the audio
and video from the call to the tags in
the web page similar to what we did when
you receive a call okay this is what it
looks like so I'm going to go to that
now okay Krum actually I can show you in
the show you in the IDE first so do i do
that so I'm using the just standard
eclipse with a couple of web plugins to
actually edit the web page and I'm using
pipe length as a serve as a web server
just to serve the pages just opening
clipped I'll open the webpage at the
same time Mr P things going that's one
copy of the webpage shrink that down so
they can put two alongside each other
dude with Kate then that's 22 web pages
with these are the tags that you saw in
the HTML is two buttons to connect to
two different users there's two video
tags for showing ones local and ones
remote video there's a text box and
tightening who you want to call a call
button for making the call and a
disconnect Bob the disconnecting the
core and this is just the code that's
pretty much exactly what I showed you
with them a little bit of setting up the
controls on the web page when you start
other than that it's pretty much
identical to our shiny and the ants nest
body okay so I'm gonna try it out so
connect this user one connectors user
one so it's connected to the SDKs use
one when you connect this one is used to
so it's connected to the SDK
I'm going now these two is that this
one's set up as user to and this one
sorry this one set up as user to this
one set up as user three so I'm actually
going to do a call from user to to user
three these are my user names from the
original fourche SD kk g to come Three
so hit the copper button now the web
page is telling me that it wants to use
access to the camera this is something
that's built into Chrome for WebRTC it
doesn't let you use you the webcam
without asking if a positive
confirmation first until now not if I
rent is saying it wants to use the
camera to because it's receiving a call
so I'm going to allow them as you can
see record I'm not using the same webcam
because they're on the same PC but you
can now see and the audio want one to
the other I can obviously disconnect the
call button okay so that's basically how
to set a simple video call just using em
javascript and HTML and I can take some
questions now before I move on to
actually adding that to them android
version of the application what sadly
username and password so when you add
log or when you clean yourself forge yet
this question is what are the username
password from remain pelin when you
create an EP up when you sign up to the
fort portal and technically I key you
get some development usernames and
passwords that you can use is their
support for developing the Android
version in the clip so the answer is yes
you know as we saw there and the Andy
just created a brand new Android studio
project and copy the libraries that you
can do the you can do the same thing and
clips if you want to it said the another
one here seeing from see chain the glade
football
wall of china still work the answer is i
honestly don't know all the signaling
and media sort of the signaling
connections and things that go over here
and are over HTTPS and and web sockets a
secure web socket so it's all encrypted
north over the normal course you would
go over for for web traffic media for
WebRTC it encrypted over UDP whether
that works through the gate for Wall of
China I don't actually know how to set
about with requirements for web RTC yet
there are some there are some
constraints you can assign when you set
up the session which would control kind
of the maximum video resolution minimum
physically do resolution and things like
that which you can use to respond with
requirements and also negotiates down if
basically all the web RTC it's stuck
itself monitors the bandwidth between
endpoints and negotiates the quality of
the video down automatically to
compensate for that so it's kind of been
built into web RTC and you'll find
information on how to actually said it
was constrained specifically in the API
documentation for Android I awesome and
for job steps or depending on is
slightly different depending on which
platform you're developing for but it is
in the API documentation which you can
download from the forest developers
portal again somebody they're asking
anyway to adjust the quality of the
streaming dynamically based on bandwidth
and the answer is that actually yes and
that hat does happen automatically
that's just built into the SDK so
someone here saying you've noticed video
jitters on Wi-Fi with web RTC it really
depends on the quality of your Wi-Fi
signal how much bandwidth you have and
also how much latency you have what kind
of network you're on so for example if
you've got two people on the same same
physical network and that physical
network allows peer-to-peer connections
you will have far better quality than
you will if you've got two people on the
same network
vp isolation on the Wi-Fi because that
will require here pinning things across
the internet and you then in that
subject whatever the latency and
bandwidth of your internet connection is
but that's just a standard VoIP and
firewall ap isolation configuration on
route or issue so how'd you find the
code for Jess and try to stop this is
from San relief we will be sharing this
presentation so that'll be i'll be there
i sees your own device can you make a
web RTC call over the air that's from a
bare tool tour toledo sons so I can't
see a full name on this set on the skin
yes you can do this over 3G or 4G
connection as long as you've got the
bandwidth its config you can turn that
off as well if you don't want your act
to be able to do that because obviously
you can use your monthly from of the
money from of the account we need if you
do that so we can configure it in the
configuration whether to allow that or
not yes that's a good point so actually
you can meet calls over 3g or 4g you can
make calls over Wi-Fi on you can also
restrict that with a question about from
euro mutt school I repeat Scalia can
claims the name there do you have an epi
for windows for and fortunately not at
this time and yep and another one asking
for this flight and material these will
be distributed after the webinar and so
I'm not going to let Andy quickly go on
and add video to the Android app again
ok that's the presentation okay
okay so the next thing we're going to do
is take the original android application
add a video to it now this is incredibly
easy because we're already connected to
the forage network and I'm only going to
add receiving video and at the moment
just to keep it simple this is pretty
much the only piece of code I need which
is kind of you're going to call it when
you connect to the SDK it's going to set
up a call back but when you and receive
a video call which is going to be an
awning current session and its connect
connect back to a web RTC video of you
which I'm gonna actually put on the an
application screen and again it's kind
of accept the call it straight away so
it's not going to go through any main
period which you would probably do in a
proper production up okay so I'm gonna
actually compare the up now okay going
back to the original android app okay so
the first thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to go back to the page layout i'm
going to add to the bottom of that i'm
going to add the video of control on
tibetan just video drop txt i'm actually
just a little bit of xml post paste into
the bottom of that page and something
comes in just there okay so let's one
view which is going to be the remote
video which is popping which got an idea
video view another view which is the
local video I'm just going to have an
idea of local you these are these are
views these are custom views that were
created by us that you can they actually
appear appear in if you want to drag and
drop them on the page than they appear
in somewhere in this list there is a way
of searching up it's in there I can
assure you sir okay right so the tube
video views are now I do to that page so
now I'm going to add that piece of code
that i showed you into into here to do
to accept a video call so this is the
piece of code I show you in the slide so
just test web RTC put paste on him
then it's got a few or no commander
system and add those with just the odd
enter key what class ok mr. knows I need
to call this function when lip when the
connection happens taking this just
calls the test web RTC so that it sets
up a call back as soon as you connect to
the decision network come up they have
some leave in the messaging part in our
case expecting a variable to store man
in psychotherapy it's not an ounce it's
not think there's one of the not change
that i recommend taking which is if you
this to the manifest file in it it means
that that that the activity itself
handles that the actual phone rotation
so that if you rotate the phone you can
keep the video going rather than it
restarting the activity at which point
you have to renegotiate the video
because the orientations changed i'm
going to add that to the hundred
manifest and it goes in there i believe
so that means that the activity itself
handles screen rotation ok I think
that's pretty much it so this time I'm
going to actually run it on a crop
rather on the emulator up and run it on
a proper android phone ok ok so let me
just get going this so I'm going to try
and start it ok ok isn't as a fam still
probably is asking for permission to
connect doing that it's found it so
so application started up I don't know
whether you can see that in the webcam I
hope you can i'm going to go back to the
web page and try and call that from the
web page to that android phone
disconnects rd there and the phone is on
user 0 because that's the original user
that i connected us so they call that
except that it wants to use video
hopefully then you look there you go so
that is web page i hope you can see that
webpage call in an android phone so
simple video there's audio as well from
a web page to an android phone ok so so
that is basically all I'm going to
demonstrate today so that's a picture of
the page are there any more questions so
hopefully you can see from that just how
easy it is to create cross-platform
messaging video apps using the SDK with
a minimum amount of code really easy
connecting to the forge network ok and
some more questions is it possible track
that the data usage on web RTC or we
don't have to be done separately I
believe the web page is it going to show
you that usage then and we currently
integrate some loving to do that I'm not
one hundred percent sure it's there at
the moment you can actually there are
android and iOS methods you can call to
monitor the web RTC of the device so you
could do it on a client side and
transmit it to a central server there's
various options we are looking to do
that in remediation
okay yeah so yeah so the questions come
back again about JavaScript SDK and
package all with with Cordova um I'm not
sure we haven't really looked into that
a great deal it's something that we
would like to explore but I don't know
the top of my head where we are with
Khudobin something we can you can get
back to you about in the future I don't
really know the current position
regarding them yes so since the purpose
of testing my people shall I count on
your system so the way that the acidity
key works is that we allow excision SDK
can actually authenticate of many system
that you have using either a mechanism
that we call a simple offer or two and
there are video tutorials online on
YouTube to explain that which links can
be provided to you when you use that and
you can have users on any de mean that
we don't even really know about because
we refer to to this external system to
to deciding whether users authorized or
not just as an example you can log on
with Facebook or LinkedIn or off to and
we use that for some of our devils but
for the text users which they get
created for your developer account we
just have that list of pain and they're
all the season domaine so
question that I'm the best best answer
how do you enable or disable order your
video when you've got a web RTC fold
right okay that's various API calls you
can call and when you've created a call
when you've got a call a program you get
session object returned to it's an
equivalent in all three of the SDKs and
there are various methods you can call
that so you can kind of renegotiate the
audio and video you can take all of you
out the colleague put video into the
call seeking you can yeah there's a
whole bunch of things you can negotiate
about what's going on in the call yeah
that's what you use to disconnect the
call for instance that session object so
so in the blue engine you can change get
another question from remain palin is it
possible to get more than two years
which in the same video call and is it
okay to have multiple video calls
separator not at the same time so for
the first one I'll answer which is that
we are in the next major release of the
oestrogen SDK network we will have
support for multi-core 44 n particles
where we name is Gator them too but
that's not in the curve that's available
today but you can have multiple course
simultaneously so you could have
multiple separate video streams and be
display them or webpage simultaneously
so I could call five people from show
five video tags showing all five people
on the same page now so basically you
can do and you can do is sort of a mesh
column where everybody calls everybody
else if you manage that logic in your
application for in the in the next
version of the SDK we will actually have
a selective forward a select select
forwarding unit within the network that
will enable you to make basically one
call that the SDK completely manages
multiple streams question again asking
do we use turn service now serious ever
is we have a would turn servers and we
of course prefer a peer-to-peer direct
connections and we'll use them where
possible where that doesn't work these
stun and
doesn't work we have we do have turned
servers an eight next question is is it
a p2p connection the answer is yes is
WebRTC pure computers the default
followed by stun followed by turn so the
video call doesn't unless it's turn it
doesn't actually go through out any of
our services yeah yeah and even when it
does it encrypted using dtls srt PS we
can't actually decoded comment on
scaling can can we comment on scaling
with WebRTC and this like video
resolution scaling or scaling not quite
sure what scale and that's referring to
this scaling with multiple channels
simultaneously if your meaning yeah i
mean i'll assume that you're meaning a
large scale service and the answer is
where RTC skills very well because by
default things will be peer-to-peer when
or not peer-to-peer they'll be a using
stun where possible which is pretty much
peer-to-peer and we only fall back to
use in a really a term server when we
have to so it does scale very well we
can we run out its own servers in the
cloud environment so that so they can
actually we can actually scale a number
of turn servers we have potentially so
actually compensate for higher loads
okay so scaling into confidence calls
with multiple parties I've seen that but
that makes quite a couple of questions
though so yeah so that you know when
they select a forwarding unit technology
we are looking at can scale to very
large assist very large numbers of
participants but right now and basically
a you scale your conference or you have
multiple parties by creating multiple
video sessions on each one which means
that if you have five people in a
conference call each of those five
people has to have four calls up so
you're scaling it from our software
point of view isn't hard but it will
have an impact on bandwidth and
processor usage of your system
sometimes I how can we integrate their
supplication and Toyland project will if
Andy yeah i mean that's exactly the kind
of thing that we're aiming for with this
sdk it should just be a much for
dropping in the libraries and using them
where appropriate in the activities you
want to use them for I mean that's kind
of we have looked already had an exhibit
existing projects yeah should be
possible okay a little problem in town
and we can bewitch camera front / back
on icon is used for the people yeah as a
API call to say which camry you want
clearly get listed I think it's a
printer bug there's basically a method
he called to say which can be so
somebody getting something like Google
hi know so people high notes basically
works using a select forwarding model
that's what we will we will support in
the next version of the SDK before right
note today when you wanting to do
something like that you have to create
multiple sessions from each each each
device yeah so some ask so another
question you know about tech controlling
the media your can you disable or enable
your local audio source your video
source yeah you can turn it on and off
as you go through coinky green gushing
cool ok another one from Java it's a
possible to receive in feedback revolts
from different users that you're
broadcasting to them yes because I'm the
messaging that you see can be used which
is being displayed on screen you can
actually send anything you want using
that messaging between yourselves or or
or two other between you between
yourselves if you want to send a JSON
object someone you just set the content
type to application Jason and you say
content-disposition something that
informs your receiving application that
this is to be used for feedback
calculations and then you don't have to
use the instant message and just send
messages to people
do we use a socket i/o we don't play
brief note okay so it says can you
modify the SDP you like on the Google
hangout made by video I know developers
using the SDK cannot modify the SDP been
easily that's deliberately cat yeah they
model they can modify fields that are in
the stp by setting up constraints and
things like that's the inadvertently
modify it but stp is quite complicated
and what if I still try to simplify if I
added on top okay so question about
stealing a video from remain pen again
will remain our display be more network
hungry and the answer is that basically
the Webber seal I pretty quiet football
will tend to use up as much bandwidth as
is available to provide the best quality
a picture and will don't need and as
required to meet Eenie as good a quality
picture as possible but by using the
constraints that have been mentioned a
few times you can limit yet what the
application will do so what library do
we do we use for signaling we use a
variety of different signaling life
release we basically use sit for
signaling and but we use a number of
different libraries force if across
different platforms and in a number of
cases we made some modifications
ourselves our background is actually a
signaling engineers here can you record
the video chat so you could do it
locally on your device voice recording
the streams recording on the network is
again its feature that's do for the next
major release of the SDK and we'll come
along so I think the conference in
support so both of the next few months
with it yes it in the next two to three
months that will be available perhaps
sooner and for for some nita customers
and but
then you could do local recording right
now so do we have a tutorial for me too
many video calling on the platform no
not as a woman but that's a good idea
i'll add that to the list and hopefully
have one soon and that's all the
questions so far it's ok so just finish
off there will be another webinar on the
twin killings of january and what we're
going to try in folks or in that webinar
is answering any common or interesting
questions that people come up with
between though men and the submission
date for the hackathon is etm gmt on the
19th creativity and you can register for
the hackathorn at URL that's on screen
if you've got any questions please send
an email to tomorrow dresses they're
more that'd be my be my appt calm and
like i said in the next webinar what we
will do is is rather than develop apps
we will actually focus on providing
answers and tutorials for for specific
points that people have come up with an
ask us between them there thank you very
much I think that's everything from us
consumer let's see you soon bye babe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
