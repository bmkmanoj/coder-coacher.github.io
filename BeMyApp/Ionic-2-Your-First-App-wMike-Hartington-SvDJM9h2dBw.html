of webinars to be Miya my name is lou
and thank you for joining us today's
special edition webinar will feature
mike Hartington an ionic developer
advocate who will talk to us about
building your first app using ionic 2
please do write your comment on the
comment section provided and we'll be
starting in a minute but before we do if
you would like to receive news on our
upcoming webinars and hacker events have
a look at be my app calm also stay up if
you want to stay up to date to our
newsletters do register at community dot
B my app comm and that's all from my
side and now like to turn it over to
Mike Mike how are you very good how are
you good good good are you ready to
begin yep let me just go ahead and start
sharing my screen perfect awesome all
right it's all yours all right so thank
you for having me um you said my name is
Mike Harrington I'm a developer for the
ionic framework em hard inton basically
everywhere on the Internet
keep it simple nice and nice and short
handle and I'm gonna talk about building
apps with ionic where what's some of the
rationale behind ionic 2 and how to
actually get started and building out
applications and what are some of the
goals that we had in mind when creating
it so before we kind of jump into things
and go go dive right into ionic 2 6 step
back and actually talk about ionic 1
ionic 1 was a very popular option for
building mobile apps using web
technology that was based off of angular
1
you had angular 1 underneath there for
your coding structure you know
controllers typical MVC architecture
we had sass under there for for styling
our components and really enabling
developers to customize the look and
feel of their app to really fit their
brand something that we thought was very
important and unlike most most
frameworks that were out there that
tried to fit every single use case we
really focused on building just mobile
apps we weren't trying to recreate a new
bootstrap because these were things that
were had been around for a while and
really fit the use case there wasn't
really a bootstrap equivalent for mobile
web and with like that in mind we kind
of developed a goal a very very wide
reaching goal of being able to take web
developers give them the tools and code
that they need and empower them to make
to take part in app development give
them everything they need to get started
lower the lowering the barrier of entry
and allow them to take part in this
massive market of building apps and just
being able to learn more now from a more
technical standpoint we want to talk
about how this has looked in sparse
growth so if we think about it I on ik
one has become quite a popular project
as I've said already getting around a
little bit over twenty four hundred
twenty four thousand stars I'm give now
that that's any sign of success but it
does show that there is quite a lot of
traction on the github repo inside of
our community on our forums that there's
something going on there and it's not
stagnant project we have meetup groups
all around the world we have one of our
most popular meetup groups based in
London we have meetup groups in New York
San Francisco anywhere that you really
go there is bound to be an ionic user
group
and we even have apps that are topping
the App Store for both iOS and Google
Play one of the most popular apps out
there is an app called sworkit
it's had over 12 million downloads I
think the last number was and has been
featured in both the iOS App Store and
the Google Play app store so it's a real
very successful app it really goes to
show that with web technology and just
good development skills you can build an
app that is very successful and aside
from all all these small startups and 2
to 3 people who are making projects in
there in their spare time we're also
seeing a lot of adoption inside of the
enterprise now whether these are banking
companies insurance institutions these
are places where it makes sense for them
to have a single codebase that can be
used for both the web and on mobile apps
if these are internal applications are
actually customer-facing applications it
makes sense for them to be able to reuse
some of that code and not have a
completely different team for both web
iOS and then Android but what some
people kind of think when they hear
building mobile apps with web technology
they get this this idea it's like this
whole web thing again didn't we didn't
we already go over this where and you
know Facebook try to redo try to make
their app on web technology or then we
go of this when we try to do loads 2000
different contacts inside of a webview
and then to be able to scroll haven't we
been down this road before and you know
some cases who say yeah that was a few
years ago and the web's getting a lot
better and we've also seen a lot of
changes in the different options we have
out there
you know people weren't impressed so
they went out and they started building
these different frameworks we have
frameworks now that handle going from J
s to a native runtime and then some
people just completely ditched the web
and go to a full native application
while these are options I tend to stick
up for the web and think that the web
can't handle all this especially in
recent years we've seen so much
improvement in the web on the web
platform in recent years coming up with
everything from es6 finally being
ratified and actually starting to uShip
in browsers everywhere chrome is now a
hundred percent ESX compliant Safari is
the ESX compliant even Microsoft edge is
the s6 compliant we have better API is
available to us we have better
JavaScript engines as well we have
better languages to write on top of
JavaScript and have some kind of a
safety net so the whole web development
experience has gotten quite a bit better
in recent years and that's really what's
been pushing ionic to going forward
taking what we know as the future of web
and being able to build on top of that
and ship something that takes advantage
of all these new features that we have
today and features that we may have down
the road so we have a few goals out with
ionic queue and basically how do we take
all the concepts from ionic one that
everyone knew and rework them to make
them even simpler you know reduce the
number of concepts that you have to
learn reduce the amount of code that you
have to actually work with and get you
down to something that's a lot simpler
but still as effective and powerful we
want to revamp our navigation basically
being able to make any kind of
navigations situation
hundreds impossible our tooling now
being able to take all these new
language features these new api's being
able to ship you something with chip
with a set of tooling setups that work
for the people who just want to get
going and are accessible for the folks
who want to completely customize their
their building setup and the last kind
of hitting goal we want to make learning
angular 2 much easier a common thing
that we we heard was that angular 2 is
so much different from angular 1 and
while at first it may look like that
we've set up set out to to work around
with this and make it that way going
from angular 1 to angular 2 is much
easier than one would expect so for
simplicity I think it's easy to kind of
see where where we went with this when
we start to look at some of the mark-up
ionic one was at first point a CSS
framework and then shipped with
JavaScript bindings for different
frameworks and starting with that you
know we have the typical approach to
styling components so we have a bunch of
CSS classes being applied to this anchor
tag this is from ionic one the second
one is from bootstrap and the third one
is from foundation so all of these
different CSS frameworks take the same
approach we have an element we want to
style it we add a class to it you want
to style it even further you add another
class to it but this this isn't scalable
and you can end up getting a very
confusing markup by just adding a few
extra elements to this so this is taking
directly from some bootstrap
documentation and I'm I'm not even 100%
sure what's going on here
I have div with button group and then
some buttons that are also a type of
button by have a class of button and
then button default
and if it wasn't for the fact that they
actually describe what they're trying to
do in the actual markdown markup this
would be very difficult to understand
Early's visualize what this is going to
look like inside of the browser so it
gets that point CSS classes I can get
quite complex and clutter up your your
Dom you can spend all these all this
time trying to figure out what
everything is going to look like with
CSS classes or we can take it from a
different approach so what we did with
ionic 2 was when the developer is
working on their app and they want to
use a certain layout they just used raw
elements fully CSS driven and we have
this it's much more semantic looking
markup that it's much easier to
understand and figure out what's going
on so you know we can look at this
markup right here you notice that we
have an ion list so we can assume that
this is just going to be a list of items
we have our ion items right here all
listing different movies and then we
have this list header so we can start to
assume that this is going to be as
little separator between all of the
different groups and now we have a
better understanding of what this markup
is going to look like once it finally
gets rendered and if we want to extend
further if you want to buy into the
whole ayah element targeting of elements
for styling you can just specify the
name of the element and then start to
work with CSS as you've traditionally
would or if you are more comfortable
with using classes you can use classes
as well that way you can kind of have an
understanding of anytime I see a class I
know that this is going to be coming
from my styles and nowhere else
so our next part is probably the most
most impressive change that I've seen
with Ayane - it's one of the things I'm
most exciting about excited about and
that's our navigation and basically we
had a few topics that you know we
thought about when we were going in and
working on this so you know you want to
open up a modal and then have some kind
of sub navigation that is completely
isolated to that mobile modal or you
want to open up a side menu and then
have another parallel navigation stack
inside of that menu so these are some
things that aren't 100% possible with
ionic 1 and it all comes down to how we
did raring to begin with now in ionic
one we used ui-router where you can
attach a state which is a bit of markup
control controller logic and a URL and
you map to that using ui-router state
machine mechanism now while this is
great for web apps and traditional
desktop websites it doesn't give the
flexibility that mobile apps actually
need so anytime you try to go outside of
what you've already set up as your
state's in your URLs
it tends to fall short and it doesn't
allow you to recreate entire
applications state from nothing
dynamically add or remove states from
history things that you know developers
need if they want to create intuitive
apps so we we took a note from from
native in this case where they have this
paradigm of push and pop where if you
want to push a new view or page or
component onto this navigation stack
you've referenced it and then you just
push it onto the stack so in this case
if I want to go to a new page it just
pushes the new page onto the stack and
then I can pop that current page off the
stack and go back to the route component
and it's works with parameters as well
so if I want to pass along some data in
this case I'm passing along a bunch of
places but you can think of this as a
user object or some sort of to-do item
we can pass this along to our navigation
by passing an object so in this case as
we pass along we're passing a selections
object with the data of the items that
we've selected from our previous state
and
while those concepts are very simple or
at least seem simple they allow for so
much more features than ionic 1/2 so now
we can push pages onto stack pop them
off the stack but we can also push three
or four pages onto a stack and navigate
to the last ones that way we can
dynamically create history or if you
want to remove pages from the stack as
we on the fly or update at history it's
all possible now because we have a full
fully independent navigation stack that
is in charge of the apps history a great
situation for this if you think about
deep linking when you want to deep link
into an app
have to create some way of navigating
around well with this new navigation
stack concept we can deep link to the
particular component in our app and then
when we get there we can update the
entire application stack so that way as
they user hits the back button we have
the six we have the back experience that
they were where they that they would
expect coming from a new somewhere else
and while this doesn't touch the URL by
default it is easy to set up and have it
work with the URLs that way if you are
deploying to say a browser you can have
the URL update and keep the back and
stop breaking the back button
so tooling tooling is really the most
important part of any AB structure
because if you can't actually build with
all these new features what's the point
of making an app so it's no secret that
JavaScript really changed especially in
the past year year and a half a lot of
us surrounding es6 and all the new
features that come with that with the
language upgrade we have new languages
as well such as typescript which build
on top of es6 and chip with features
that are up for consideration into the
language and with all these changes we
have smarter I des and two editors that
can hook into all these new language
features and provide you with a better
experience of when you're developing
your app es6 has all these new concepts
of modules but we don't really have a
global object or we don't keep things on
the global object anymore we have proper
scoping for all of our functions that
way you know we can expect variables to
be defined when they proper when they
are we have promises built into the
language natively so that way we don't
need and you promise a poly filling
library and we have classes for defining
object-oriented apps for doing
object-oriented programming and
providing a much simpler structure than
the prototypes chain typescript takes us
even a step further with es6 this
concept of decorators and this kind
static typing so that way if you pass a
variable or if you have a function that
accepts expects two numbers and then you
pass it a number and a variable number
and a string at edit time now before you
even run it in the browser your editor
will let you know hey you pass it a
number and a string but it was expecting
two numbers something's not right here
you need an fixes so we have this we
have this much this much powerful very
powerful typing system which allows you
to have very strict coding standards on
in fact this is stuff that I on to uses
internally to build out the framework
angular q uses this as well so there's
obviously something there and one of the
big selling points that I think it has
is code completion that way as you are
typing out your app on your calling a
specific method Suzy hit that dot even
get all the completion for all the
different methods that are on that class
but how do you actually start if you go
out and just search how to build an app
with es6 or typescript
you're bound to get confused lost in
kind of frustrated as you see all the
different options all these different
tools systems all these different bill
setups it's not as straightforward as
one we think but you know you know don't
worry about it we have our setup that we
ship with and I ant to app that provides
you with all the standard build tests
build steps that you'll need and if you
want to expand upon this and have your
own custom bill set we allow you to hook
into the builds are internal build
system that way everything you want to
do is all possible now again
is that it just works you don't really
have to think about any of the
underlying setup you don't have to think
about it if you don't want and you can
just go ahead and build your app so how
would you actually get started building
an ionic 2 application
well first we want to install the beta
CLI that's the most important part so we
npm install make it global ionic at beta
this is gonna pull down to beta CLI
which is going to include all the
necessary features for a v2 application
from there we want to start an app so if
you've done any ionic 1 development
before this command is exactly the same
as it would be an I addict one but in
this case we want to pass a - V 2
application so let the CLI know we want
AV 2 app we CD into that directory and
then we can run ionic serve so from here
let me actually switch screens real
quick
and I'll open up a new tab and I'm going
to open up my editor and then I'm also
going to run ionic serve
you
you
so you can see we're going through the
typical tasks that we would need
cleaning out everything from before
we're setting up all of our build steps
for compiling SAS fact I'm actually
going to use - - lab to actually serve
everything but we can see again we're
going to compile balls scripts copy all
of our HTML over and minify it all the
things that you would expect from a
typical build process
and with this we have a live preview of
iOS Android and Windows phones so now if
we want to go ahead and search we have
all of our views animating that follow
these specific guidelines for their
platform you can go search for specific
track names artist name album names this
is all using the Spotify API we can
search back to we can search on a
specific track we can play that track
using Web Audio pause it play it and
continue all of our app development so
let's move our editor to this screen
let's take a look at some of this so we
have a typical app directory that you
would expect from a NIACC to app being a
dub dub dub folder some platform and
plug-in folders and also a hook
directory now what may look different is
this app directory that we have right
here so we're no longer building in this
dub dub dub directory we actually have a
full build steps that way we develop
outside of it and compile into the
proper directories so our entry point is
going to be this at PS we come in here
we have a couple import statements using
es6 imports where we can import a
specific method or class in this case
we're importing boots our bootstrap
process and platformed
class we have our root component which
is in this case just a main navigation
component and then we have our class and
then the main bootstrap process so we
think about this we have a main
navigation component this would be your
eye on nab you from ionic 1
and instead of defining that root
navigation component and then just
loading up state with URLs we can
actually do specify the root and using
dynamic property bindings set that root
page to the menu page from our class so
if we go to look at the actual menu page
it's going to be in our pages directory
we'll go to menu and below that as well
now the menu HTML is actually loading up
another root nav and then also using a
side menu layout if we go over here we
can see that we have a set up we have
the nice one to one gesture drag Android
has a nice overlay Windows Phone has an
overlay as well
we're also loading up a menu route so
instead of here
I then sidebar we can see that we'll
look for a menu root property and we're
just loading up a search page so so far
we have two pages where we're just
loading up its other components to
render into so that search page actually
has where has most of the logic for us
so if we look at the search key yes
quite a few things going on in here we
have this reference to a navigation
controller we have this angular
component import and then we have
another page called results page then we
have some form inputs hide those for now
and then we have our app component
annotation now I didn't talk now this is
angular 2 specific but basically we have
our a component annotation which allows
us to say that this class is going to be
tied to this bit of markup so we have
this nice tying of markup and our
classes that way we have this nice
component driven driven architecture so
from here instead of our search page
class we have a form where we're just
taking to where we can do some form
development where we have a term and
then a filter and then we can set some
default values for this so if I come
over and I change this to nothing save
and we come back over to the browser
when the browser refresh is we'll notice
that we actually don't have a search
term in place and on top of that we also
have this button kind of disabled that
way we know that we need a actual search
term but we're actually saying that we
have validators on these actual inputs
saying that everything's kind of
required
from here we have our constructed
constructor where we're just setting up
a nav controller and then our form
builder API which is being used up here
and then in our actual search method
when everything is valid inside of our
search form we're just going to push the
results page on to the navigation stack
pass along an object where we're going
to have the term search and its value is
actually going to be the value of the
search form so let's actually look at
that results page so the results page
has a little bit more going on
we're calling this Spotify download oh
what's the Spotify download look at it
Spotify service coming up from here
and that's in our providers Spotify
service and our Spotify service ID as
well but we'll jump out of the pages
real quick look at the provider and we
have our spa device service so we can
see this injectable annotation and
basically this is going to allow and
give to to know how to properly inject
this code into the build structure so we
have our class Spotify service where we
have our constructor where we're just
importing HTTP from the from angular 2
and then from there we have a couple
different results so if we don't have
any or if the filter is everything we're
actually going to go ahead and search
through the Spotify API coding the
search term and returning everything
back from the HTTP request as JSON if we
do have a search filter we want to add
that into our actual request and code it
and then actually send that back to JSON
so either way we have some kind of
handling of our form and we have a
response coming back when we go ahead
and we search for alka spell that right
we can surfer it and we know that we
have everything back but if we search
for track names
it'll only return the ones with
Metallica actually in the track name and
if we search for just the artists we're
only gonna get back in Teleca are not
gonna get back any other artists or any
other any other bands so we had that
request kind of all working and if we
actually open up the dev tools quick
we can actually see the network requests
going out so
there we go all right so this is Safari
and their dev tools have changed a
little bit and I'm on Mac beta so it may
be a little bit broken right now
but still results are we have our
requests going out we have the data
coming back and we have that data all
available to us now one thing to point
out is that this time over here it's
actually not coming back as a proper
date format when we look at the actual
console and see all of the data coming
back you notice that we have we actually
have a data in here that is telling us
to look at the markup real quick
we actually look at the markup we have a
track duration in milliseconds so over
here will hide the look at the object
and where is the track duration
you
you
duration here we go we're actually
getting back a an unformatted duration
of time but we have this this pipe over
here which is essentially saying take
you this value and then pipe it into
this other function it's the same thing
that we have in angular 1 and ionic 1
with filters just been renamed a little
bit 2 pipes to make a bit more sense so
if we go over to our pipes we have a
moment filter where we have a few things
going on so we have this main moment
class and then this pipe annotation so
our pipe annotation allows us to specify
the name of our pipe in this case
anytime I reference moment I'm
specifically mentioning this pipe right
here so we have a transform method which
is going to be the main return from all
our pipes we have our duration helper
over here and what this is going to do
is just take the value that we're
getting back from the pipe and just
format it a little bit into a proper
hour
minutes and seconds format so nothing
crazy going on here this is all just
prop this is all just JavaScript going
on there's nothing angular specific
about it but when we return the value
from this we have nice properly
formatted minute and second duration
close that for now in the same thing
this is being used over here as well and
also being used in this progress bar so
that way when we play the actual music
we can actually see that the progress is
getting a
as a song previews being played zoom in
on it a little bit a little bit smaller
I could probably make it bigger but we
can see that the styles are all being
bound to the progress of this value and
everything's working as we would expect
and stop it
reset the progress play it and when I go
back it'll actually stop the music reset
the time of the time frame and actually
reset stop playing the music and reset
the time frame and have everything at
work as we expect now for all of that
code if we look actually at the track
detail page we have just some some
standard mg ifs going on some progress
bars and we're all centering around this
audio tag now you know the audio tag
actually has a few different methods on
top of it so we have this ended event
and then this time update event so these
are actually native events bound to the
actual element itself
these aren't angular specific but we can
actually use angular's event binding
syntax these curly braces around the
event name to bind methods from our
class so anytime the song or the audio
ends we're gonna fire player ended and
any time the actual audio time has
updated we're gonna just call set
progress to bind this value to the
progress value well look at those code
that code real quick so this is probably
the most in-depth class that I have in
this app where we are just setting up
some parameter definitions whenever we
go from the search page the search
results page to this track detail page
we're passing along that single object
we have our view child annotation which
essentially allows us to go through our
Dom in a nice angular friendly manner to
search for elements and element
references and then we have our Spotify
service in our actual navigation
controllers are in params and our event
system so in here when we know that the
page is going to leave we're just gonna
call stop stop song so this is using
ionics own built-in hooks for handling
our navigation events we if we want to
toggle the song with our play and pause
button we can just do simple if this is
playing stop song if not play the song
play the song is actually using the
audio that we've gotten from this view
child and calling the native native
element method play on it and from stop
song we're actually just going to go
ahead set the current time for this
value it's a zero and then hit pause so
that way we can create this stop event
now this set progress over here
every time the song plays and its value
its progress actually changes we're just
going to take the current time of the
actual song over the duration and
multiply it by 100 so now we have this
nice update cycle of 100% to 0% or 0% to
100% inside of our app so we can get
that nice progress animation inside of
our progress element
we have this player ended every time
that the song is actually done calling
from our track detail page we set a
variable inside of our class saying that
if playing value is false and then we
just set the current time back to zero
that way we can start over from the
beginning
and we have this nice working app making
HTTP HTTP request formatting data using
pipes filtering all the items out based
on the request setting up this markup to
use avatar items titles all the proper
data binding that we're used to seeing
going forward to setting up a full card
detail where we have the album art as
the cover again our data bindings
playing with native audio setting the
actual value of this progress bar and
providing us with all this all these
things that we would expect if we were
to run this on the actual on an actual
device whenever we were to set this app
to run in the background there's a
native plug-in set up in this who
actually allow you to control the allow
the music to play even when the apps in
the background and actually control the
song and play pause funk from your
lockscreen something that just adds a
little bit extra touch to it to what I
think isn't already a good app example
for what you can do with and go through
of an ionic do
this app probably took me about 20 25
minutes that kind of rough out and then
another another another half hour to
kind of fine-tune all the styles and
details of it so all in all this app
probably an hour to build grant it I
have a little bit more experience with
ionic you and all the internals of it
but there wasn't a whole lot going on
inside of this application that required
a lot of detailed explanation a lot of
detailed setup I was able to actually
just go ahead with a URL and knowing the
Spotify Search API build something that
was a complete application within an
hour I think that's pretty impressive go
back to the presentation for now so it's
that I just want to kind of wrap up a
few final my ideas with ionic 2 we're
really pushing forward what we can do
with web technology the app I just kind
of showed was a very tame example but
we've already seen apps being built
where people are where people are really
pushing what we would expect the
framework to be able to do people who
look down on the web on web technology
and web in general the future for the
web is looking really great between
everything that all the browser vendors
are doing there's this is probably one
of the best times you actually be
involved in web technology and web
development and always bet on the web
it's never gotten worse it's always
improved so I think that's a very very
optimistic outlook on it I have the
sample app actually up on github right
now so if we actually under M Hartington
star crack ionic so give this a look
clone it NPM install and you should be
able to run this app on your own machine
and kind of go through all the details
and go through all the whole code and
figure out what's going on
we have a sample we have all of our
documentation you go to ionic the i/o /
- this will bring you to a nice little
landing page and lead you to our
documentation for the framework yeah i'm
harding ttan if you guys have any
questions feel free to leave them in the
comment section I can take some now as
well
hi Mike there is uh two questions on the
comment section
looks like we got one question already
he talked about talked about how the
progress of making addict to a platform
for building progressive web apps is
going specifically to playing sample the
same code best code base or mobile web
version and that package that's native
version is something we can expect with
that too with with ionic 2 we really are
pushing forward the concept of being
able to take advantage of progressive
web apps that way you can have web web
code without having a full native
wrapper this is something that we're
currently working on and probably going
to focus a lot more once we get the
final version of ionic 2 ready and out
there so I don't have any progress
updates on it right now but we can
expect to see this after 2.0 is finally
done and what are some good animation
frameworks that go with ionic ionic I
didn't show it off here but actually has
its own animation class that way if you
wanted to demo the if you want to
animate any elements inside of your app
you can just use our animation class and
it'll go ahead and do that as well I
know Angie anime is also is actually
going to be in the next release and
should be available to use as well
any other questions
you
alright I think that's all for the
questions thank you Mike for the talk um
everyone just feel free to note down
your question then Mike will we'll get
back to you is there anything else you'd
like to add
ionic who is currently in beta but we
are very close to getting to our RC
release so look forward for that soon
perfect thank you everyone I hope you
enjoyed the talk and just before we go
if you're interested in node J s join us
tomorrow on another webinar that's all
for today and until next time guys
cheers and enjoy your day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
