is Daniel Bowie I work on the immersive
computing team at HP and I look after
breath developers let me start by
thanking everyone for joining us today
today's webinar we're going to be
previewing a couple of cool developer
technologies that we've built for you
for sprout a couple of my teammates are
going to give you demos and great detail
of that before we do though I want to
provide a bit of of what sprout is for
those who may not have had a chance to
use sprout before once I do that then we
will take a look at a unity plugin that
we've built for you and techniques for
unlocking sprouts realsense camera and
I've got my teammates here who are going
to give you the deep dives for that I'd
ask everyone to hold QA till the end
please go ahead and type your questions
in as they occur but we will cover all
of them at the at the end of the
presentation again before we get into
the cool stuff let me give you kind of
an overview of sprout so if you haven't
had a chance to use a sprout before I
want everyone to kind of get a sense of
what kind of cool technology we're
talking about sprout out is the first in
HP's roadmap of immersive computing
machines on the surface it's a high spec
Windows 10 machine it comes with the 23
inch full HD touchscreen it's powered by
an intel i7 and it ships with 8
gigabytes standard and i believe it's a
one terabyte of storage and of course
it's got a fairly high spec video
processor as well similar to at least on
the surface most high spec HP all-in-one
but on to amend those capabilities we
sprout also includes these tubes for
groundbreaking new technologies one of
them is the projected second screen this
the sort of looks like a mouse pad on
steroids but really it's a
passive touch mat and it's 20 point
capacitive touch which means that you
can have four hands manipulating objects
on the screen at the same time it's
flexible removable has sort of a
magnetic buckle a clasp that ties it to
the rest of the all-in-one and again
it's a 20-inch 20-inch surface that
touch mat when combined with the
illuminator actually creates a second
projected horizontal screen the
illuminator includes a few different
sensors and cameras the first is a
high-definition 14.6 megapixel camera
the second is Intel's realsense 3d
camera or sensor which will be talking
about later today there is a desk lamp
there and there's also a HP's digital
light projector which projects up into
the mirror on the illuminator and back
down under the screen as we as we
discussed the whole combination of this
technology allows us to blend the
digital and physical worlds in a really
amazing way you almost have to sort of
see it to believe it but essentially
what sprout does is it allows you to
capture anything that is in the physical
world bring it into the digital world
and annotate it almost as you would
annotate a digital document you can
annotate a physical or physical object
or digital representation of that object
artists love it kids love it anyone
who's involved in any kind of a
graphical work loves it because it's in
me and immediately a new intuitive way
of working with physical objects another
really cool thing is the types of
application ideas that we've been seeing
when we exposed sprout who exposed
developers and idea people to sprout
we've had just a breath of ideas of all
types of new ways to use these sensors
it really does kind of change the usage
paradigm and makes computing more
immersive which is our goal as the
immersive computing team recently we
rolled out HP's 3d capture stage so
sprout has always had a 3d snap
chat capability and allows you to take
using the digital high-definition camera
and the realsense camera allows you to
sort of grab 3d objects like on this
slide but with the 3d capture stage
we've made it very very simple to take
not just over 3d snapshots but full 3d
captures and create a full 3d 360 degree
model the 3d capture stage is one of
those things again you kind of have to
see to believe and really understand but
we can put an object on the stage take
it through a capture cycle in a matter
of minutes and turn that into a fully
manipulable model we have software that
will do some of the print repair and
make that model ready for 3d printing so
we're really excited about the 3d
aspects of it and it's one of the core
features of our sprout plop speaking of
sprout platform let me tell you a bit
about how the platform works and what's
in the SDK before I turn you over to the
real experts we're going to give you the
deep info that you're really here for so
we've built sprout as again a high spec
windows machine which means that the
primary framework is C++ or C sharp net
development we've also recently
announced support for JavaScript and
because it's Windows machine it's easy
to develop using visual studio or cutie
and we've actually enabled use of the
free Community Edition so that you don't
have to make the full visual studio
investment when you download the SDK
you'll get access to our camera API is
that allow you for allow you to capture
objects we also have text extraction and
object tracking AP is and of course we
also have the ability to interact with
the flexible touch Matt remember that's
a 20 point capacitive touch screen and
so to allow you to capture 20 points of
20 in point 20 points of input
simultaneously
you can get more information about the
developer platform and everything that
you need to know about sprout at sprout
HP com whack developer you can find the
SDK there where you'll find all of our
platform runtimes and bindings and
what's really cool is when you download
the SDK you'll actually be downloading
the full sprout platform which you can
install on any machine and then develop
against it obviously you won't have
access to the actual hardware but we
have dummy support for dummy api's or
dummy data for the art or the hardware
we have a full set of documentation as
part of the SDK and sample apps for c++
c sharp and javascript and of course as
a developer on the developer forum
you'll find our Q&amp;amp;A forum our guidelines
or design guidelines sample apps all the
good stuff that you need to get started
with sprout development now the two
technologies that we're going to be
showing off today are previews they are
coming soon and they will soon be part
of the developer website we will be
messaging everyone who attends the
webinar when those when those two tools
are available on the website we're
thinking this is about a two week maybe
three week time frame and at that point
we'll have both a unity plug-in that
we're going to show you and the tools to
unlock the realsense camera available at
sprout HP com whack develop so with that
in mind let me introduce sohaib who is
going to walk you through the new plugin
that we've created that gives a that
gives support for using sprout from
within unity so hey
thanks den hi guys um my name is sahib
aaj mo and i'm a third party developer
support engineer for sprout and today
I'm going to be introducing unity plugin
for sprout and giving you a demo how to
create apps for sprout inside unity so
let's start so through the unity plugin
you would be able to create and apps for
sprout inside unity the basic
functionality that will be getting
through the unity plugin is the ability
to make use of the dual screen touch and
viewing capabilities for you sprout
inside unity and as well as the
customized capture functionality
specific for unity making it very
convenient to perform capture easily
inside unity and get the objects that
i'll be showing you in a while the
plug-in suppose C sharp for now and the
minimum requirements in order to develop
a sprout is the spar platform version
1.2 onwards and the unity 5 point l
onward the sub it also the plugins
support development of non spout systems
as you can add as Dan mentioned that you
could develop on on spout system as well
similarly for unity apps you could also
develop an ounce about systems so it's
the time for demo I'm going to switch to
unity and as you could see on the screen
so before that let me show you how the
structure of the screen the mains
maximize screen as the sprout main
screen where you see the game area which
and on the bottoms of that scum of my
screen you see two small screens they
are the same view of the mat area of the
sprout now you could see a hand and one
of the windows on the left side that is
the downward facing view through the
camera of the mat and on the right side
of it is just the screen of the mat that
you could see on the unit inside the
unity ID it's a rollerball tutorial
which is available from unities website
it's just half the way through just for
the
no purpose you could view the pow it's
built on the unities website I'm going
to run it without any modification and
then I will let you know how to Spotify
an app inside unity for spelt lets us
run it so as you can see there might be
able to see there's a ball that I'm
controlling through my keyboard arrow
input arrow buttons and the two
obstacles just on the screen I'm going
to go back and now I'm will let you I'll
introduce you how to use the unity
plug-in will import the unity plugin
package into our again this is a single
file that you could import it's
decompressing and it will take some time
to get all the files inside import it
inside the unity ID I click import and
it will take some time
thanks for your patience guys
it's done and but it's taking some time
I'll just give it a few seconds while we
are waiting on that I'll send out one
more poll as you could see under the
project folder there is a spout named
folder that's the all the content of the
plug-in and of this since the plug-in
has finished importing into the unity on
the menu items in the menu bar you could
see a spout menu and it show gives you
capture mad so mad PV window and sdk
version info show map would just give
you the preview of your mat window and
your the capture wouldn't let you get
through objects from the ID so what I'm
going to do is now expand the sprout we
have already made to p fabs one is the
cameras which gives access to the two
cameras main camera and the mat camera
both cameras are used to set your main
screen view and the mat music matte
screen view as well as a sprout manager
prefab which gives you access to spell
out functionalities inside your app I'm
going to go and delete the main camera
coming from the game now as if you could
see inside the game you that my game you
have been split into two screens the
main screen and the smaller matte screen
rectangle below that one I'm going to go
and set the main view camera and the net
camera to their views I would like to
set them to
so I've set my main camera to film front
view and i'm going to set my med Kemba
to top down view for that i would go and
set the projection changed it from
autograph back to perspective and now i
can see the top down but it's not
visible clearly so i'm going to change
that as well I can see the view in my
game view how it looks like now I can
see the whole game area from the top
down view on the mat now I'm going to
run this just to see how it looks so I'm
not able to get that so this i'm showing
my sprout both screens to the third
monitor so i would need to reset it
thanks for waiting guys let me try
running it again what I would like to
see is on the bottom two rectangles that
the material should display on there yep
again yep
maybe less room that's been doing can
you on
okay now as you can see it's wizard ball
on the mat as well let me just run it
once again to make sure
sorry guys um is this the third monitor
which is taking some time really
appreciate your patience and bearing
with me
goodness
so I'm just gonna reset all right
finally I'm sorry guys for such delay
now I'm you can you should be able to
see two screens two views of the same
game area one is the mat view which is
the top down visible to the top down
camera and the matte screen area and as
well as the front view and in the
maximized main screen I'm going to
proceed with the rest of the demo now so
what we need to do is what I'm going to
demo today is like first was the dual
screen which I just showed you the next
thing I'm going to show you is how to
capture some object and apply that as a
texture to some game object so capture a
real life object and then use its
texture on to the pair of my again so
for that I need a one button to perform
the capture I'm going to create a UI
button let's call that button capture
save that and reset it I want this
capture button to be displayed on my mat
so that why i would change the canvas
rendermode to camera and then i will
change my camera to my mat camera now
hiding behind the game areas i just need
to adjust it so that i could see it
clearly and i'm going to change a little
bit
so that it's big enough and run it to
see how it looks is I can see the
capture um it's not that beautiful
though but I can say it so next I'm
going to write a script that will
perform the capture and apply the
texture so for that i'm going to create
an empty game object and rename that to
cap your script holder have that script
I'll open that script it's going to take
some time to open that in real studio
as just loading google studio it's
taking some time
so let's finally open that so this is
the default script that comes when you
create a script so i have already a
skeleton of my script so this has a very
unity specific functions like i'm gonna
copy paste them over here like awake and
one to capture objects i'm going to use
for capturing and on enable on disabled
so weak will be called when the script
is loaded for that we called only at
that time on enable will be called when
my object is accessed and so then you
can see at the top it's using sprout but
this is available because I i used it
spout prefab in my game so I'm gonna
create spout manager variable sprout and
inside my wig function with the script
is finished loading I'm gonna initialize
my spout variable to game object dot
fine spout manager dot getcomponent
spelled manager and in case if there's
an error
and it fills to initialize that variable
give me a log message followed by a wake
I have captured object function this
method is going to perform the capture
this capture moment is coming from the
plugin it takes two inputs the first d0
both boolean variables the first one is
false and second one is set to to the
first input is like either I want to
capture the whole image of Holme at
whatever is on the mat and the second
input is whether I want to get the
children images the children segmented
separated objects present on the mat so
don't want the whole matt image i just
want the children images and for this
demo purpose i'm just going to use one
object which i will show you very soon
inside on a label when this object is
enabled and i could access it i would
like so how captive functionality one
row works as well
finish getting all the objects it will
generate an event on capture object
ready and at that event I will subscribe
it a method call and that method will be
called and whatever I want to do with my
captured objects i will do inside that
method it will get input variable of
type capture listing which i will show
you on capture the bunch of events on
among those are events i'm going to use
on captured objects ready on capture
complete will be triggered when that
captures complete and uncap sure object
ready which you are seeing on my skin
right now a little bit figured when
captured objects ready i will create
this function soon inside my own visible
function i'm going to create and
unsubscribe to this function call and
i'm going to create this function as
well word capture listing capitalistic
well an object of type capture listing
will provide me all the captured objects
for this demo as i said i'm going to be
using just one single object and so what
i want to do is the player as you saw in
my game area i will capture the object
and apply the texture of that object
onto my prayer area for that what i
would need to do is I would need to
create a game object there and inside my
function I will ok I think
get component for that their render time
material and put that material set mint
texture set it to the listing dot
texture since there will be just one
object that objects texture will be
applied to peer but before I could use
the skirt what I need to do is I have to
assign that their variable public
variable that I created here I have to
make it public so that I could see that
in my unity ID to the period of my game
so as you could see inside my unity ID
there's a player variable visible I'm
going to go to my game area and drag
this bill and assign my variable despair
now the final thing I need to do is
assign that start capture to my button
for that I go to the inspector under the
button and edit event to on click event
plus I need a cap your script holder X
and from capture script this is the
Kepler object function that I created
here as you could see and that will
perform the capture so I'm all set to
run this demo I'm going to play
I have this Apple that I'm going to put
on the mat and do the capture it
sometimes takes them okay is it let's
drink countdown you could see the
flashlight on the mat area I'm gonna the
ball is white it's going to soon have
the texture of my Apple
it takes some time
it just took some extra time so so this
is a problem in the editor let me just
relaunch it again
and i'm going to try once again there
was a problem at the sharing so
ok
this in technical issue with the machine
here I have unfortunately
guys they have been some issue
unfortunately with the machine so it's
rebooting so what I want to show you was
like capture the object and apply the
texture the outer skin of the Apple to
the ball so I'm gonna be because we're
running short on time I'm gonna pass on
to ruben who's going to give you demo
unreal sense
right guys okay alright guys so for the
unity would just be providing you with
more information and we're having
snitches when we're connecting this
product to a third screen that were
using to share the information with you
but we'll make sure that those issues
don't happen when you are actually
destiny and now what I will be talking
about is the real sense and for this uh
okay do you hear me ok Justin see that
is the sound correct
look I'm sorry what's that is the sound
all right yeah sounds good okay okay
sorry okay so for the riddle since the
sprout comes with a real sense camera
and so far we use we have used that
camera for using segment segmentation of
objects that means that when you're
scanning something it is able to
separate and if you put several objects
in the mat is able to separate them
because sebolt really take the edges
that's where we use the depth
information of the realsense camera the
problem that we have had is that that
camera can be only used for one
application at a time and we want it to
be to make sure that whatever
application was running can bring we can
bring back the sport experience that
work correctly and that's what we have
been locking the camera now with a new
release of the depth camera manager for
noon tell it will actually allow several
applications to run the real sense at
the same time you just orchestrate
between the applications and that's what
we're going to be talking about and I'll
be letting you know when you can
actually get a hold of the realsense
camera so the message that we have for
you is first for you to developers we
will be providing will be unlocking the
realsense camera in the next few weeks
beyond a SDK update so are we will make
a new version of the SDK that when you
run it you would unlock the camera now
for the consumers a couple weeks later
that after we released the sdk for you
we will make we will deliver a sprout
platform update that will unlock the
camera for all the consumers now let's
talk a little bit about the realsense
camera unsprung so the camera w will
find there is the f 200 is a front
facing camera design designed to be from
facing a
and it's just the same one that you
would be able to find in the Intel
Developer Kit you are it will give you
the stream of infrared and BTW 8 60
frames per second and RGB at 1080p as
well it is designed to work in a range
of 0.2 to 1.2 meter and it it has a big
ass series when you look at these
specifications because it depends a lot
on the configuration of the camera but
now this is not the only camera that is
on the sprout as you can see in the
picture we have the realsense camera
that is there with the with three
different components but we also have a
high resolution camera that is just a
little bit on top of it and I will show
you the differences between the
realsense camera the downward facing
camera when you could use one or you
know now I one thing to be mindful on
sprout is that this camera is looking
downward that means that there is some
usages that come with the realsense sdk
there are no optimal for it but there
are some other ones that in some cases
will work fine in other ones you need to
be careful for instance ah you can
definitely use the hand skeletal
tracking it would provide your
information and in 10 interns the hand
gestures some of them will work some of
them may not work in the in the way that
is design because this one is looking
down it does perform a 3d segmentation
so you can get the depth information of
the volumes of the elements that you put
on top of the mat like if you put your
hand you will be able to actually detect
that you have your hand as you can see
in the lower part of the camera but I'll
show you sample and I but if you are
going to use on from face sorry face
recognition api's well you were going to
need to put your face down there in a
very weird position so those are not
optimal to work with spre but they get
in the raw data works ok so this is how
the camera will look down so one thing
that you notice is kind of inverted and
it's a very wide angle is a 69 panoramic
view of the objects that are on the map
now the reasons for using the realsense
camera what you will need to do is well
after we roll out the new version of
this product is the key that that will
link to the new def camera manager you
want to go to the Intel website and
download the realsense sdk with that
that is a kit comes with api's and
documentation that you can use to run
your samples and you can some of the
languages will require you to run a
runtime like if you want to do some web
development you need to run this on
their web runtime and the cool thing is
that you can use the realsense sdk along
with this product is the key so you can
use the you can use the best of the two
technologies to make very interesting
applications and you can also use the
unity as you came along with the
realsense sdk da unity plugin are along
with the real sense is a game now what I
will do is I'll give you a demo of what
you will find on the realsense sdk once
the camera has been unlocked so when you
download it from the interweb site you
will see this folder and one of the
tools that is cool and interesting to
see is this capture viewer so with the
capture viewer what i will do is just
open the stream of the different cameras
you can see here the intel realsense
camera and the other cameras that the
the machine has in i can actually enable
the different strands data so i'm going
to open a biggie a stream of the color
this is from the RGB camera and infrared
as well and this is the dep stream as
well that is a computation and then I
can start them all at once with this
application so you see here oh just
organized this on the screen these are
the three cameras from from the
realsense camera one the first one is
the
you see the RGB and then the next one is
this all these infrared not studies are
kind of putting down and the third one
is actually the computation is the
volume information you can see how it is
able to segment my hands from the
background in this case separate them
and now are the difference with the
sprout camera that you can actually see
on the on the lower part well the first
thing that you see on this proud sprout
a RGB camera that is on the bottom right
is that this one is contained only on
the four corners of this product so that
called a keystone well the realsense
camera has a wider angle disabled to see
more space but these spaces but the
image is upside down there is ways to
invert and to mirror that
programmatically so get you get the flow
in the correct way another tool I'm
going to stop on these cameras well this
is not a tool another interesting thing
that you will find on the realsense sdk
is the sample so if you go to this
framework you will find samples in the
different programming languages and i'm
gonna run a couple of them that are on a
seizure so the first one is this a hands
viewer and it will open in visual studio
it's I haven't done anything with you
don't need I only open it and run it in
so when the solution is loaded I will
just run it and I'll take a little bit
there you go and then I'm going to start
it
talk and then if i click on start you
will see the flow of the camera running
just give it a second there you go so as
you can see there if I put my hands it
is able to detect actually the hands and
each finger has its own color and is
able to separate my hands from any other
thing that I have on the bugger so this
is the model they are the hands model
the real sense that you can use the
hands is something well very natural to
use with sprout and I can actually
detect some of the gestures for instance
this full pinch if i do this i mean just
get you see that it does this full pinch
issue now the funny thing is that it
says that is left hand i'm using my
right hand and if this is a result of
the configuration as a downward camera
you know you will see that there is
several things like that that kind of
work in a kind of weird way but you just
need to be mindful you could probably
use them but just need to be mindful of
all the way that they have been designed
for now i want to show you another
sample that uses the three dimensions of
the camera i'm going to run these touch
this controller viewer it's actually a
pretty cool sample because you can
manipulate the tree axis of it now on
this proud d axis are little bit
different because of the configuration
of the camera but they are all
accessible so each point that you detect
with the camera has the XYZ coordinates
just that you need to probably the
coordinates a so much three once if you
were using it as a front facing device
now i'm going to run it this one loaded
much faster
okay and what you will see on the screen
is when I put my hand here I'm gonna
make it full screen when I put my hand
my hand appears on the screen and if I
grip it's going to grip there so if I
move it to the sides like gripping you
will see in the bottom how these are
letters will move if I put it upside and
down you will see the numbers on your
left side that they go up and down and
if i push it up closer to you to the
camera you see how it zooms in and if i
bring it down it zooms out so it's a
pretty cool sample how you can actually
use all these space to do something to
do some pre pretty cool applications in
a well and and another thing that is
interesting in this tranquil is that you
can also run JavaScript apps directly on
the browser so it has this hands viewer
that runs here directly on the browser
and for this one you actually use these
web runtime is okay a web runtime sorry
and I'll show you in a second here it
detects the platform I can start it and
this is just running on the browser
which is pretty amazing and now I put my
hand and then you can see two hands with
all the joints okay some food for
thought here on some couple ideas of the
cooking's you could do in real sense you
could do a lot of very interesting
Hunter price deals or just a song funny
interesting videos you could do the
arbiter stronger we won at orchestra
director
bunch of interesting things in fact one
of these things that we play around we
created a theremin I don't know if you
have seen where the theremin is but it's
an instrument that uses the three
dimensions if you get your hand close
when antenna would produce different
sounds so here's the same it's just that
according to the my place on the screen
it will give a different frequency this
is a sci-fi instrument I'm going to stop
it and now I'm in the cool thing is that
i'm using the two screens of the sprout
one for manipulating the other one for
visualizing the waves and yeah that was
pretty much it on what we have for the
real sense and again we'll be making
these uh these tools available to you in
the upcoming weeks and what I will do
now is I will go to the questions that
you guys have for that let me just see
what questions are on the panel in okay
so i was reading this one it's the first
one from george ha justin anderson the
in general the team the question is that
if there is own if there is any way to
get to take an image for instance for an
x-ray on our civic series of MRIs and
scan it into the computer analyze the
structure injuries so the point is that
with the sprout cameras you can scan any
kind of object so if it is even if this
is a x-ray and then the rest of the
computation will need to be done by your
program right unless uh if you use the
real sense for instance you can actually
detect instead adjoins but if you want
to actually detect an injury there will
be some patterns that are very specific
to your image and then you will probably
need
you do that computation or if there is
any library that will be done you can
use that and for that we provide ways to
use C++ C sharp anything that is a lot
of technologies that you can use for
developing to spray on sprout in the me
see okay so this is that once you
download and get accustomed to the SDK
we can you aware of some hackathons so i
can try some of the questions I asked
about yeah and we were definitely okay
that'll be me Rubin I'll have everyone
here in our subscriber list so that as
we have sprouted events everyone will
get an email okay maybe and then there
is again a question from an Jessup we
were happy to discuss would you give you
some ideas of the things that can be
done for this I guess that most of it
will require some custom development
well we were working on the tools that
you can actually use in easily so maybe
you can definitely contact us I'll share
my email address with you guys as well
actually so I'll put it just here we had
another question by Jessica Joseph
asking with the camera is the image
reversed for left and right like it
would be on a TV camera it is for the
real sense but for the sprout camera the
RGB camera it is not so for that one is
actually as you will see it with your
with your own eyes that's the way that
is presented so when you are getting the
list of cameras from the device you can
select one sees unlock it to use the
real sense and probably the variants may
have several strains or the sprout
downward facing camera so you it depends
on which camera you select
that not that one facing camera it only
looks what is inside on the four corners
of the mat the real science is able to
see a wider view of the elements we we
have a another question by Christopher
Philip who was at the sea where did it
say in the San Francisco hackathon so
I'm gonna just open his mic up to you
Ruben okay but uh okay Josh cook can you
hear me ok my not having a mic in but he
wanted to get your opinion on the
difference of the SDK strength versus
capturing of user handmade 3d models for
you some animation can you can you say
that again just in oh but I wanted you
to briefly summarize the most
significant relative strengths of the
realsense camera SDK versus the sprout
SDK ok so the realsense sdk has a set of
libraries that take advantage of some of
the young of the depth information well
what we can do with sprout is actually
get a 3d model of an object that you put
in they might so actually the real
science has also our 3d scanning API I
happy playing with it I think that for
this type of real sense might not be the
UH the they have another camera is a a
longer range that will be able to give
you a better 3d scan and uh in in terms
of the straightest guy running with this
one you will find some api's maybe you
are able to do some something on it it's
it's a very different experience to
scanning something with straw now it's
can in a hand is a little bit different
because what we do with the 3d scan is
you put an object it start you start
rotating it and then it takes different
screenshots of it puts them all together
and then creates a 3d model and for that
you need the object to be very still and
always the same then your hand is a
little bit hard to keep it always in the
exact same position so for that maybe
you can actually use the real sin and
because that would not have that that
very specific limitation you know I hope
that that was let me just check if there
is any comment or I don't know if you
heard the question then you on the stand
give me just a second because I have one
of the our computer vision on Fox here
I'm just going to repeat the question to
him and see if he has any additional
comment I and Christopher who asked the
question did say thank you got it okay
so he said that is he got it okay okay
that's under ending the that's country
but the real census a bunch of other AP
ice as well that you get the DEP
information that we don't like a very
specific points on top of the screen XYZ
on real time we don't have such a PR but
through the real sense you can actually
do it
yes see if there is any it looks like
there was a question from Davy Baker I
can't tell if it's a question it says
two objects from two color object for
dual extrusion printer this will the
musical out for two objects from two
color object there we go okay let me see
and with David um it says will the new
zocalo for two objects from two colored
object to trainee files okay so um so
this is the thing so for if you want to
get a 3d file you can use this proud to
do 3d scanning that will give you one
profile of an object that is very still
you put it on top of the mat it takes up
take some time to do this canyon around
are around 15 minutes to do the scanning
while you move it around it's not a real
time scanning but it gives you a really
good ah 3d capture of that object and
that is for one object you want to
object you put it to you put it two
times now yeah it's 15 to 20 sorry just
ah tell me here to make sure you it the
process is 15 20 minutes it depends on
the object how big the object is and now
for the for the real sense is a little
bit different uh it you will probably
can you could probably use the 3d
scanning functionality it's something on
I don't in de risa library right not
allows you to make it very high level
you'll probably need to do a bit of work
on that if you're just taking the
rostrum and detect that there is two
objects real time that you can do with
the with the real sense just kind of
detection there is two separate objects
in in fact there is
one of the modes that the realsense have
is called a blob it's for detecting
objects so the hand model is for
detecting hat hence the blog models for
detecting objects itself and okay so
David Tate thank you I how the Dunstan
question I think those are all the
questions that we have so what we're
gonna do is that we are gonna will
require a webinar right just to make it
a viable 40 yep I will go ahead and send
the recording of the webinar to everyone
who registered and attended and I'll
also post it for access online yeah and
we will provide some documentation on
how to run the the unity as well we had
some technical issues but it it should
be in pretty good shape as just
connecting it to a third screen is where
we have some issues to switch but uh but
uh yeah we appreciate a lot for coming
to the webinar taking your time in the
evening in a in help you are find this
exciting and will we know know that
thank you thanks Dan hi guys my name is
Roy bokmÃ¥l and I'm a developer support
engineer for spout team at HP and I'm
today going to introduce a unity plugin
for sprout do you so let's start so
spout plugin for unity as a package that
you could import as a plug-in inside
unity ID it provides two specific
capabilities for sprout one is this
value utilization of sprouts dual screen
capabilities and the second is this
customized capture specific for unity ID
that i will show you in a demo in a
while the plug-in support see shop for
sprout development and the minimum
requirement for development is spelled
platform 1.2 onward and unity 5.0 onward
you can also develop a using non spout
system like your laptop and add another
screen with that as you would develop
for any other non spout system
so let's start the demo before we begin
let me just show you what you are seeing
on the screen right now the maximize
screen where you see the unity it's the
main screen of the sprout on the bottom
of this screen are two views of the same
screen that is the touch Matt of the
spout the on the left side as the top
down camera where you can see my hand
and on the right side is just the touch
matte screen itself so when I will make
it this app which I'm running right now
into for the spout you will see it's on
the spout Matt as well so what's using
and unity ID is a rollerball tutorial
from unity website which is the first
beginner tutorial from the website and
I'm going it's a half the way through
because this is just for the demo
purpose and I'm going to make it this as
small game in for this proud change it
Spotify it so let's begin so this is
just a ball that you could use your
fingers to control and roll around in
the game area now we are going to make
Spotify this game I will import the
plug-in file
it will take some time to load this
thanks for your patience guys so does
finished
importing the plug-in will wait for a
while until we see the sprout menu in
the menu items so we see the sprout the
capture metro map view window which
gives you the preview of the mat window
so now we can be no we can begin to make
this app for sprout let's delete the men
main camera the spell plugin comes with
two P febs one is the cameras prefab
which gives you access to the mean and
the mat camera I will drop down on my
scene and the sprout manager which gives
you access to this about functionality
you can go and you can set the main
camera to the main view what you would
like to see on the main screen and the
mat gamel to what you would like to see
on the map screen I would like to have a
front view for my game area so I'm gonna
set it accordingly go to the mat camera
and change the projection from
autographic to perspective and adjust
the view to have a top-down view on my
mat now I will run and see how it looks
I can see the split screen of you for
the two screens may mean and the mat but
I need to get the view on the mat so
there's a work on that I would do I'll
do change the layout to 2 by 3 and try
it again
now as you can see on the screens on the
mat I'm seeing the top down view of the
game and on the main screen I'm seeing
the front view of the game now what I'm
going to show you is the capture
functionality I'm going to capture an
object and apply that as a texture onto
the ball the capture is customized for
unity for that I would need a button
that will perform the capture i'll
change that text to capture the canvas
that holds my button i'm going to change
it to screen space camera and set the
camera to Matt Matt camera so that I
could do the button on the mat the reset
it I could see that it's now I'm hiding
behind my game area so i will adjust the
view i will also like to adjust the size
so it's
let's see how it looks it's still hiding
it almost looks good now next I would
need to create a script that will
perform the capture either create an
empty game object and rename it to
capture script holder add this crap now
but it's going to open it in a wheel
studio and with it will take some time
for patients guys again it's just
loading it and the wiggle studio and
taking some time sorry for the delay
guys it took some time but now this I
can see the script and the video studio
let me increase the font size so i have
this of the basic functions of the
square unity script already created so
that it will save us some time i will
copy paste them here and start building
this script on top of it as you see on
top of the script i have already
included the sprout which i'm getting
because accessing because of the sprout
manager that I dragged on to my scene
then we have a wake function that will
be become enabled when the script is
loaded and on enable will be called when
the object for the script is enabled end
on in the game and disabled will be
called when this object get disabled so
I'm going to create my script let's
create a variable of the type spout
manager that will give access to the
spout features such as the capture I
will initialize it a and awake
objectid fine of types proud manager
I'll copy paste getcomponent for that
game object and in case if it's not able
to find it give a message saying that
it's unable to find the spout manager
next I'm going to create a function that
will capture the object and set this
ever to the capture using a sprout
variable it takes to input the first as
every day I like to have the image of ol
Matt and the SEC which i'm going to set
false because I don't need image of my
old Matt and second i'm going to set to
true which is for like do i need two
children objects present on the mat each
object individually yes and but for this
time I'm going to use only one object on
then anon unable so what happens is when
I would perform the capture object it
will does the capture of my mat area and
once it's done capturing all the objects
it will trigger an a the event called on
capture object ready and at that point I
inside my own enable I would like to
subscribe a function to that event so
that when that event is triggered
on capture object ready I should call
objects captured function and subscribe
to this event and inside that function I
will show you in a well that I'm going
to apply the texture to my gay player of
the game i will copy paste this same
code here and unsubscribe to the same
function i'm going to create this
function this function gets the capture
listings all the objects kept it from
the mat and pass on inside this function
before i proceed i need to create a
clear variable that way i will assign to
my player that you i showed you in the
game and in order to access it from the
unity ID i need to make it public and
here i would apply the texture of my
captured object on to my player i get
the texture of my captured object
listing d'architecture and apply that to
my player game object which I've created
here and set it to public now go back to
ID and ctrl s so that I could see my
game variable we're here my script
variable
as you see that on the screen that there
has appeared here inter capture script I
will go to my game area and drag and
drop the pier on here so this player is
now assigned to the player that I
created inside the script the last thing
that I need to do is go inside the
button that I created an event on click
as I need to capture script folder
object and capture object function I
will assign that to so that when I will
click on to this button the capture
object will be called now let's run the
game before that let's check everything
is fine here and I'm getting no error
that looks good let's run the game so
now I'm going to place this Apple onto
the machine as you could see and the top
down view of my mat I place an apple and
i will do the capture
sometimes it takes more than one click
for the capture to start let me just go
and make my button a little bit bigger
in the size sometimes that out and set
my camera view let us move a little
under the left side and on it again so
it is doing the capture but with the
button wasn't off of this sufficient
size the flashes of the capture let's
take the scanning and it's taking some
time so unfortunately unity editor has
stopped so close the program and just
quickly run it again
let's once again cry the game the button
has gone out of the view I'm just
quickly going to adjust the size and set
the view again sorry about that guys um
it's um how is the unit is changing my
view
so I could see the capture button I'll
just move my game area a little bit
further from on the mat so it's again a
drink on the mat areas so I'm going to
change the layout two or three and run
it again once again I'm going to try to
capture
thanks for patients or patients guys as
you could see that Apple that I put on
my mat has been captured and applied as
a texture to the ball so they're using
the capture functionality of my sprout
to unity ID plugin I have captured and
applied that as a texture to the game so
that's all about the unity demo thank
you very much for your guys for your
time now I'm going to pass it on to
