since about 2,000 currently working at
quarter studios where we make games
Ainge primarily at kids with an
educational value so we're currently
have a couple of games out with literacy
background and we also have game that
aims to teach the rudiments of
JavaScript our studio develops
exclusively in unity3d we find it a
great environment to get our products
out there quickly by myself very much
enjoy rapid prototyping and heinous
Eastern you integrate so for that and
experience with real senses secondly
sort of added to that show that you can
go from an idea to some think you can
play really quickly which is a great
feeling as a developer I'm a big fan of
electronic and dance music which might
seem irrelevant bae will become obvious
for a sec mac and they also love musical
games and RK games sort of things that
you can pick up quickly learn the rules
of quickly and start to play almost
immediately so on the day at the lab in
the morning I believe we were talking
about that very powerful and quite large
SDK that's available and she comes in a
few different flavors so I was most
investigating the unity SD cake is
obviously that's where I lived these
days in the afternoon we were given some
time to put together our own projects
and so one of the things sort of from my
background in rapid prototyping of sort
of small ideas to turn into small usable
projects was I wanted to make certain
that we can actually finish something
and give everybody snot to see at the
end of the day so I decided that I would
do a short fully playable game and I
also wanted to keep it quite
light-hearted we have some wonderful
demonstrations from people showing you
the the kind of the more serious
possibilities with the the realsense sdk
but I want to do single lip sort of put
smiles on faces and maybe go people an
idea of how much fun it could be as well
so you begin with did what I guess most
people would do which is to check out
the demos which are very good there's a
good range
in the unity SDK that will show you what
sort of building block capabilities that
you've got you can open each them run
them pretty much immediately and start
to wave your hands and get some
something moving on the screen which is
again a great experience as a developer
to not have to wade through lots of sort
of problem problematic set up it was
pretty quick I had one brief problem
where the SDK didn't fire up and we
discovered we needed to copy the sign
drivers in so that's possible gotcha if
you if you need to if you see a lot of
red error messages and you don't know
why then possibly just need to check
about the sound drivers having spun
through the examples i settled on pretty
simple interaction in terms of the hand
tracking i use the send message example
demo which you should be able to hear
and second and there you go it's simple
its immediate you can see that we're
getting some geometry back from my hand
and it's working as expected no code
needed to do that obviously you just
open it up and run it and so I figured
that would be a good basis on which to
stop rates and Game five years the first
thing I did to start editing the example
was to locate the hand tracking object
and the scripts attached to it so these
were touch to cube I think and you
should be able to see these components
here it's all the example scripts have
nicely laid out you can tell what is
being done everywhere and so I got
straight into creating a second copy of
the objects and then using the drop
downs to change how the script works and
make sure that the left one identifies
its left right one identifies us right I
also added he physics object then that I
could surround and I realized what I was
doing that that as soon as I touch
things and I was trying or the objects
out of the universe so I had to add some
balls
and within about five minutes I had a
little example of something I could play
with with no lines of code written
whatsoever but that I could sit here and
just slam these things around and get an
idea for what was possible with with UNC
and with real sense and as you can see
this is this is Amelia and I didn't
write a single alone and road and
there's something I can visit played
with the actual content obviously is not
going to win any awards and it's not
going to change the world but what was
did make me pay attention was them while
I was getting this working the people
around me were starting to snigger a
little bit because it kind of looked
like I was dancing in my chair so that
was good because that kind of inspired
me to come with my game idea in the
afternoon which is rave rave revolution
or teaching the dying art of Raving
really it's actually a two-handed
whack-a-mole game with some musical
basis to it I you have to hit some
targets as they appear yet they hit them
with both hands it has slowly increasing
levels of difficulty and there's a
scoring mechanism that works on how
quickly you cheat the task and then
because I'm from the 90s it appears i
stick to rave music in the background as
well just to keep things like open up to
begin with I needed something to
actually interact with so I as
representing my hands with cuboids again
I actually tweets the keyboard so they
kind of looked a bit more like handsome
kids see which with a longer platter
service i created a bunch of steroids
and i assigned some scripts to them and
some colitis to them see if i can pick
these out here so these aren't complex
at all created a physics object and then
these had really small amount of set of
code added to them we're talking a
handful of lines and in fact the whole
game we came to think about three
hundred lines and total this really
shows how easy it is
to get something working and you not mad
we SAT there all day waiting to
thousands of lines necessarily to get
the concept working once I had the
colitis working in some scripts to set
them up then I did the more sort of
broad game logic so I gotta ask or
device a timing device and I want to
make sure that when you hit the things
that registered so I set that up with
again not a huge amount of code in here
the first thing I needed to do really is
to get one round playing where you have
to hit the balls the balls would appear
in a random place and you have to hit on
me both hands and then they would reset
to a neat place and so on so on that
gave me an opportunity to work out a few
things that are needed to improve before
I could really get into the game I one
of the things to be really aware of is
that you've got a volume in front of the
camera which is the useful tempting
volume if you're planning a game where
you under getting people to reach up
here or out here then it's really not
going to happen for you because I can I
can't see that so so the my initial
ideas I've going to add to bring it back
into you know where can the camera see
or what kind of interactions at work but
once I got that nailed it was time to
actually moved from a single leaving
level on to something more like an
actual playthrough games so I got the
time of working i tinkered with the
amount of step up from the speed in each
level to make it actually something of a
challenge and then add is a stool so the
more quickly you actually hit the
targets and then you get more school
writing on cumulatively and then as the
game progresses you get less and less
time and as each ranked runs out you're
eventually going to find a point when
you run ahead of time and that's game
over for youth so putting last bits in
the last sort of ten minutes over here
and it's been committing encouragement
to make it a bit more jokey i added a
game over condition which was when you
run out of time i drop some music into
the background and I grab some fractals
of google image search to make it look
slightly brighter so it was more great
and and then we have the we had pretty
much that playable game which this is a
static image of it which I shall show
you hopefully working you might get the
musically you might not I'm not sure so
there we go that's the that's one of the
plaque trees if the game a little bit
together and obviously you need a lot of
polish but the concepts actually quite
fun we do end up looking like you're
dancing in your chair which is kind of
entertaining and I've got a whole bunch
of next steps that would hopefully make
the game from these with playable demo
that it is now into something that might
be released quality there's the idea of
linking the target hitting to the music
to the app to hit things on time and
also so that you have to achieve that
Oscars with both I will synchronize to
make it more difficult we need to sort
of tweak the gameplay there so that you
can actually score more or less because
if we quantize the timing um did think
about having a sheikh throwing detection
so if you have people that keen on their
their club mike then in between rounds
you could get them to have to put the
hands in a certain position and then
possibly take a snapshot of them looking
fairly silly in their lounge one of the
other ideas that we had was rain face
detection so obviously another part of
the realsense sdk even though i focused
on the hand tracking
section of this is that there is a quite
powerful and well-rounded set of face
detection course so the idea was that
keeping in line with the sort of Club
context then you might get the the
plants I have to achieve a huge grin or
do a big fan or let me go Oh to the
music all of which should be doable with
the SDK but I haven't got quite to that
point yet there's more work for me to do
that as well as the depth camera
obviously the realsense camera has got a
normal 1080p webcam built into it so it
would definitely be quite a lot of fun
to choose i preside moments in the game
to take a snapshot this number of 90
consults do that these days when you
Isley leaping around by so pick your
time you've asked them to do something
particularly hilarious take a snapshot
and at the end you could get them to
share that with their friends possibly
on social media and also part of the SDK
that I need to explore that could add
another element to the game would be to
do a gesture detection so you can
actually do thumbs up you could do
quantum fingers and and again this is
functionality that the SDK has which it
will do a fair amount of the work for
you there's a lot there's a huge amount
of the SDK that I hadn't actually made a
use of yet but that's all there for me
to do in the future not revolving around
real sense another couple of tweaks I
definitely need to do the game sort of
placing and plate number of times to add
a high school table to possibly
definitely lots more music in there and
finally graphics that are made by a
programmer and yet at that point I think
I might have something that I can put
out to the world so that's pretty much
all i need to say about my experience
prisoner game to get ever sleep over us
yeah so that Michael asked if you would
be able to upload and you know
a cast of your your game for later
because what's getting a bit slow when
when you played your game so I think
some people weren't able to see how the
game works exactly um so that's good
okay great I can either show will send
it to everyone after after this session
and and also so if anyone has questions
a nice time to ask and if you don't we
will move on with the Diana and okay so
high hi Diana I'm let their presentation
okay okay Diana I just went your
proposal now you can start to share your
screen and your webcam look okay great
he's yeah okay can you see me in my
screen yes it's working hard okay okay
good um yeah I'm very hey ADA with what
Scott did in his presentation and I
found some similar things with the real
sense about how it was relatively easy
to plug in all of the drivers and get
the camera actually working in a unity
scene so I'm going to show what i did
and again also I the first time I used
real sense i used it with the WPF on
visual studio and this time i thought
i'd try it with unity because unity has
so many more capabilities now um and I
don't know can you see I have unity up
right now everybody there right I'm here
that it's working fine
okay okay good isn't just making sure so
when I hit play I'll just show you what
it does first and then explain my
process was per se okay so can you see
me in the realsense camera moving my
hand around no so what I wanted to
explore was the 3d movement of the
realsense hand and using that to grab
things in space and move them around
which well it's not it's kind of working
on that when I'm let me run another one
where it's working a little better I
hope but it's the idea of moving picking
things up in space and moving them
around and what you can do with that
okay and this one you pick petals off of
the flower so the interesting about the
cameras that it does move in 3d space
which which is unique for inputs as
opposed to using a touchscreen okay
because there are a lot of games I
played like for instance octodad if ever
played that it lets you move an object
it lets you move a character whose limbs
are made of kind of chain ik ik chains
you know as though they were fabric so
you're moving their tentacles around in
3d space but you have to simulate that
by using the mouse drag and holding a
key at the same time to move up and down
but with the real sense you can move in
3d so you know I thought I explored that
especially
alright anyway I'm not going to play
that whole thing but i'll show you how i
made it but let me show you a really
basic example of a unity seen that you
use is the real sense this one all it
does is move a cursor around and
highlight an object that is behind the
cursor so right now the cursor it
changes to cross hair and then if i'm
getting toward the edges of the
playfield it changes to like the slash
so it fades from one image to another
depending how close it is to the center
of the screen and then and the object
that it moves in front of changes color
and that was pretty simple to set up in
unity so what it uses is in the unity
seen the first thing you have to have is
an object that takes the realsense
camera data and initializes the
realsense manager and creates the
delegates and events for all the other
objects to subscribe to to receive data
from it and that's just an empty game
object with a script attached so this is
the script that's on that object all it
is is just an empty game object like I
said with the realsense script and I'm
going to run it in I use visual studio
let me just update everything so this is
the script for the camera I mean just
the realsense camera data and it has
some public the delegates like you know
I'm hand data because for this all I use
for that crosshair one is just the hand
data and also the
image and the depth image I only use to
get the dimensions of the frame in order
to place the hand within it and then
some events for instance the unhand data
event and I'm depth image delegate so
these are the events that other objects
can subscribe to that any time a piece
of a frame of data is coming into the
camera it'll send it to the rest of them
and I'm start you know you um initialize
the real sense manager and you know and
then give it I'm sorry yea enable it and
initial okay and make sure that it's
that there's no error and then put in a
disabled method also to dump out the to
dispose the manager and the manager is
what acquires the frame and the frame
comes in and basically I got most of
this code from the samples that come
with the SDK you know so then on the
update you could probably have something
here to reinitialize the real sense
manager if it turned off but here it has
to be on at the beginning so it's very
very simple just to get this whole thing
you know this is the whole thing for the
camera just a couple of methods so all
I'm calling for here is the hand you
know I'm just querying the hand position
but they're like Scott mentioned there's
so much else that you can access you
know the hand the face position the
position of each part of your face your
mouth your nose you know the depth and
the also color image and and also
microphone array so all of that you can
access through you know these scripts so
long as you have the drivers in the
correct plug-in menu and everything like
that you can get from the the samples
alright so you know you have the
realsense camera which I mentioned in
the scene and then you need an object to
get affected by it and here i have
several objects for instance these
images sorry i have two images that have
that receive those events from the real
sense and I so I called this script the
very simple hand engine because it moves
anything Wentworth the real sense stands
off hand data information this engine
will be moved by it so it's right on
that / image on the canvas and the cross
there has 12 the only difference is that
the crosshair fades in as you go closer
to this to another image which is
invisible and I could place it anywhere
to I call it the sweet spot so any where
I put it however close to get to it you
change if either fade in or you fade out
and then the only other thing that has
an object that subscribes to the
realsense camera is this cube which has
basically a hover script on it you know
it's a lot like a mouse helper and and
it'll change color when the hand is
right over it and for that I also need
to need to put a raycast a lot of ray
caster script on the the image that is
being moved around by the hand it's
going to have a ray caster script on it
so that it knows what objects are right
behind it and this is what will send
send a message to the script that's on
that cube to change color
so yeah so the cube basically it doesn't
really need to pay attention to the
events that come off the sensor because
it reacts to the array caster on the on
the crosshair so you know it's very very
basic and simple but that's just to to
show you how fast you can get something
that the review lence controls you know
and then after that on my scene I had
something to actually grab the objects
and then and move them around so then
you have to project the position on the
screen to the world's faced in unity and
that will move it around that's what i
have in this Daisy seen each resistant
yeah in the Daisy each of the petals can
receive an event from the real sense to
to know where well actually these know
these receive the raycast from the hand
that's how they move around that other
one where you're picking up pieces of
string and thread now this one it uses
the same basic mechanics with the cursor
being moved around and then hitting a
raycast on an object and in this case
was receiving the raycast our little
blocks and I'll show you the scene and
just see through wire frame so you can
see the thread is made of little
interlocking chains so
each one of these fit into another one
and then they're all using a hinge joint
so that it's really a physical chain and
it's using hard body physics to interact
with each other and together with the
hinge connection it it moves just like a
you know a physical chain and if you
have enough of them and they're small
enough it'll behave a lot like a soft
body thread which is what this is and
then each one of these links in the
chain get hit by that raycast and
grabbed and moved around by the you know
by hand and though the one thing that I
the glitch that's happening now is that
I really need to have a better way to
have the grab performance more reliable
because right now say I'm able to pick
it up now but and then drop it but it
needs to be far more reliable than it
has been because I think with with these
kinds of games the interaction and and
how well it interacts and how
predictably it interacts is very
important so
that that's supposed to be the end of
that game i was able to clean the lint
off of the filter whatever you want to
call that ok thank you going up and I
saw that we had I think against the
questions on the on the panel and I can
just pin it for you it's a does real
sense offer a mechanism to indicate to
the user about the 3d movement
especially about the z axis as the user
may find it difficult to the hand either
toward the camera or away from the
camera yeah yeah there should be more of
an indication of the Z but you can put
that in there yeah okay the
demonstration I had didn't show any
interactive indication for that but
there is a z-axis in the data so you can
put that in there to show either making
the cursor bigger and smaller or
changing its color also or something
like that okay great so right I'm was
also asking how far should the
displacement and how I shoulda let me
the displacement and the displacement
yes so for the how do you do your
measurements in general what do you owe
in the in the world I try to when I
model and when I create the world in
unity I use their natural measurements
and I try to keep things as one to one
to reality as possible although in the
thread example i lowered the gravity
considerably so it's but got about half
the gravity of the planet earth um and
those strings are pretty large in the
world you know they'd be about the size
of ropes but you know I don't I so I use
the real world size scale for unity
because
i'm using the physics that comes with
unity so you know that's why okay but
yet known as far as how far to move
things i put in a multiplier in the data
that comes from the hand and then just
kind of intuitively feel it in unity i
can i use public members so that i can
change the values that i'm multiplying
the movement by in the real world until
I get a scale that I think works well ok
ok ok and so much i scania quiescence
has a lag in the camera processing um
how did you a real sense um no I think
that depends on your computer on all of
the how fast your computer is because
the camera I found it pretty fast it is
it can it does have the jitter you know
to the hand placement there is a little
bit of a jitter there but the response
time is pretty fast I think yeah so it
depends on your laptop ok great and so
thank you very nice anyone hiking all
the questions you can email them to me
and I'm i will forward them to diana and
thank you diana and now Chris Chris is
gonna be your kind to make your
presentation if you were ready okay guys
can you I see my screen uh no we cannot
see a scream why not I guess right now
hurry up cool so hey guys i am a phil
bias with the outhouse games we're
located in our land of florida to go
ahead and give her the one question
everyone always asks us yes we go to
Disney World absolutely all the times
you have to its window um we see the
three people to help build this game
that were about to show you is a
Bethenny board and she did the audio I
did a little bit of our
and Chris Borden did the development and
he's actually a jump in the hot seat a
couple minutes that kind of help walk
you guys through how this all works but
real quick I wanted to kind of talk
about how we got introduced to the
camera of in november of last year we
were at the intel realsense dev lab and
basically during the entire day we got
about four hours of introduction to the
game arch via to the camera and we're
absolutely blown away by how easy it is
do like the hand tracking and the the
finger tracking and you guys should read
the emotions of the players through the
facial analysis this the speech
recognition and that able to do 3d
scanning it's an amazing system and
amazing about things you do with just
just a couple cameras um the thing that
blows way that most is how easy it was
for us to implement these things into
our own games let's see we're getting
about four hours at the end of the event
to kind of hack something together and
see we come up with and that's where we
came up with the idea of doing ginga
since it's a game that you really can't
play with additional keyboard and mouse
and gamepad you really have to kind of
play with your hands to try to get in
the 3d environment um so we sat down and
start playing with it we actually were
able to get done in about an hour and a
half crazy enough and then spend the
rest of the time is polishing it I mean
it shows how amazingly quick it is to
use this system um other thing yeah so i
think i'm going to go ahead and hand it
over to chris and let him jump in here
and give you a demo and show you how it
all works awesome how you doing guys um
my name is chris i did majority of the
development for this for this game
michael said only took us a few hours to
get the prototype up and running the
realsense API really helps out and we'll
get more into that after I show you guys
the demo so we wanted to get right to
that start playing this game show you
what we came up with
so as you can see you have an open 3d
environment we really wanted to push as
far as we could and in the time that we
had so we wanted to do something with
both hands so on the right hand here we
have our cursor on which we can use to
highlight items and destroy the tower
without doing anything which is totally
fun but then we also are using our left
hand to rotate the tower around so that
you can get different angles on it and
select different things from different
sides ever going to try to set something
on top it is really hard so just uh yeah
let me see what I can do and there you
are so you can see we got it stacked up
on top I almost destroyed the tower but
not quite let's see we can get one more
out real quick see what about this one
oh I ruined it so that's that's our demo
we didn't add a whole lot of
scorekeeping to it since the game itself
is aren't really difficult but that's
why we wanted to do it in the realsense
camera so let's go into unity and we can
show you guys what we've what we've got
built here um so like we said we wanted
to build this game as quickly as
possible and we wanted to put in as
little of our own code as we had to we
really wanted to work off of the
realsense API as much as we could so one
thing that the realsense API really does
well is it some actions um so over here
actions you can see we have a lot of
different hair real because then we have
a lot of different actions anywhere from
like deactivating objects disabling
objects a translate which helps you move
objects and scaling and rotating these
things are really easy to use you
literally just drop them onto the object
you want to apply the movement to from
the camera and you just set up a few
small settings basically what hand you
want what kind of gestures you want to
use and then you put it in your scripts
on on the other side of it that you want
to call with that and if you see here we
have a block movement script that we
have attached to our enable and disable
behaviors here so when it receives the
grab gesture it accesses our behavior
here which is our spear block move and
then actually parents the block to the
cursor and 0 and turns on gravity and
makes it kinetic and allows us to move
that object around the scene the other
ones we have are the rotations and again
that was really simple with the real
sense cameras I'll show you a little bit
of our code for our rotates so basically
it just calls this script once it's
activated once the script gets activated
by a gesture either thumbs up or thumbs
down with the left hand and then we're
able to rotate the game objects
transform we're actually rotating a
camera spinner and we attached our
lights and our tower light our main
camera and our cursor to it that way we
can move everything around without
actually having to the tower itself
others it might fall over so we have to
work around that little little problem
but once it gets enabled it'll rotate
and that's what you're seeing on the
rotation as far as block movements we
can wait until we either receive an on
trigger enter or a non trigger stay
because we don't know at the time the
cursor is activated whether or not
you're already going to be colliding
with the object or whether you're
already colliding with the object
we run them both just to check and then
after you do the open hand gesture that
disables it it on parents the the block
from the cursor and then reapplies
gravity and allows the block to fall
either to the floor or on top of the
tower which is essentially where you
want it to go but let's see I'm going to
do a little quick demonstrations like
hearing unity so you can kind of see it
working here in the here on the editor
if you look here on the right hand side
you have our this is our cursor and we
have our block movement script on it
along with our hand tracking action
which we use it to move the cursor
around the screen and then we have our
enable and disable behavior which grabs
or at least the blocks so as you bring
your hand in the scene which you
probably won't work horse not same time
no I think it might be because I'm in
the conference well I'm not sure why the
cursor won't work in unity but anyways
what happens is once the enable behavior
receives its call which is our closed
gesture or open gesture or a thumbs up
or thumbs down we actually have it
activating or turning on these scripts
that allow us to either rotate the
cameras or parent the the cursor to the
blocks which allows us to the move it so
yeah that's it um I don't think there's
anything else to show that's the the
game so if you guys have any questions
we will be making this entire bill
devale about um yeah we're going to make
the source code available online at a
github or something like that if you
guys follow us on twitter I'll let you
guys know where it's going to be okay
good so I see a person from a rabbit
who's asking if you create your own
dresser with a shop lets you adjust to a
happier in the unit activity two ducks
so you can use it easily I'm sorry
you're breaking my heart yeah and so you
can use if you create your own gesture
with seafood does your gesture appear in
the unity 3d box so you can use it
easily um we did not create our own
gestures I actually have not played
around with that part of it yet but it
does have quite a few gestures pretty
built thumbs up thumbs down open and
closed hands swiping oki sign up or a V
for victory um yeah so it already has
quite a few built-in gestures so we
didn't really end up building any of our
own plus with the time frame that we had
during the hackathon you didn't really
have the time to do that maybe something
with other okay and now we have marginal
question and allie is asking do we need
any additional libraries to install in
need
fog developing with the vm sense um you
will need to download the realsense api
and install it um and your your drivers
for the camera itself you want to make
sure all those are installed correctly
we we were running into problems
installing but once we figured out what
we were doing and what we were missing
it it all worked out perfect though it
was maybe 10 15 minutes we figured it
out but uh it was actually really easy
to install and and to start using it's
already got its own built-in scenes so
you can try different things out really
quickly and then like I said those
actions really make it easy to prototype
I mean rapid prototyping is like the
name of our game so it made it very easy
ok ok and some soup assessment is asking
if she can get the webinar a laptop so
yes this is planned so we are going to
send the webinar to everyone we will
upload it on YouTube tonight and then
and if you think of any question that
you haven't had time to us today now
that you would like to ask to any of the
present a soulless card Diana Prince
option and you can just email them to me
and we send you my email address and
then the owl will have everything you
need so if you have any questions miss
you have a couple of minutes otherwise i
would just like to let you know that we
will have another webinar in october so
it's going to be mid-october you already
have two speakers confirmed and still
and we are recruiting one of the guys
you like to present any project along
with real sense let me know it would be
great to have you and thank you everyone
and i have a nice evening thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
