waking up is pretty high in fact fifty
percent of the 1.1 billion people that
wake up with their smartphones shoes
constantly people seem to be very
passionate about this leap but that's
fine the real issue occurs when their
passion for sleep meets their passion
for being awake and it's a transition
that makes people very mad the waking up
process which is a very unpleasant
situation now the waking up industry is
a big one and then the companies have
tried to get into the industry and
tackle the problem many products have
been thrown on the market but in general
those problems will just make an old
song and you turn it off and every
single product out there will give you
the same problem you are still by
yourself in your room with a problem of
getting through the painful process of
waking up all by yourself now the
solution to this as a simple as every
person that used to be a child can
imagine the solution is having someone
waking you up in the morning just like
your mom did back in the old days after
having done that you can confirm the
time and the app will show you that you
have now activated your wake-up call at
whatever time you please to do so well
we have ever another feature which is
prowling through the community as you
can see when the next BAM wants to be
waking up for example we have Andrea
once wake up at seven I want to wake up
940 because I'm still soon and you will
also see preferences you will read about
my interest and this will help you to
have the conversation the morning
between 30 seconds and three minutes and
you I will also tell you why I want to
wake up for example I have a lecture and
let's let it be a marketing lecture so
because I'm a marketing professor I
might be of interest to wake the student
or because I'm interested in marketing
in general I can give you some ideas in
marketing now
the real beauty comes when the beacon
hits it can we have the beacon over here
awesome so basically the bed advanced at
user places the beacon next to the bed
and in the evening when it's time for
the bad user with a phone goes to the
bad weather app recognizes that you
enter the bedroom it will tell you hey
you're close to the bed you want to
schedule a wake-up call you say yes then
you go to bed in the morning you will
prove after you spoke to the value will
prove to the wake up immunity that you
woke up by removing the phone from the
bad area so kind of you need to prove to
the community that you woke up and walk
away while doing so there will be a sign
it popping up saying congratulations you
woke up now you get twenty percent
discount at your favorite coffee store
for coffee and that's where the revenue
quits in starbucks will pay us say
twenty percent discount at service it
will drive more people into this goal
which is very attractive for marketeers
my creatures believe that when you
capture the attention of a customer
first thing in the morning you will have
an attention throughout the whole day so
the market potential is massive now many
people have asked us earlier is going to
change the world
