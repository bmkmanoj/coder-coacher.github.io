and this part we're going to download
the latest firmware available on the
interweb site like in the other
tutorials download the firmware in the
zip format and into a website so here it
is the york to linux version 2.1 so we
have the zip you just have to extract it
and then you'll get all these files then
copy them on the edison board for my
part I have already copied them
then go on to the edison and run command
reboot OTA in the edison shell you can
see the edison is updating
you
now the set up the Edison with the
command configure dash Edison dash dash
set up here we need a password a name
and the setup the Wi-Fi now that is
connected to the internet you can add
the repository
it has downloaded everything so now
you're Addison is up today and you can
use it for this tutorial now we're going
to connect the webcam to the Intel
Edison for that we're going to use the
USB OTG cable then we connect to the
bottom one then you have to plug in the
Edison we are very careful with the
polarities
and voila the LED becomes green it means
that everything works you can now
connect to the edison via Wi-Fi or by
the second micro USB so now we're going
to check if the webcam is detected now
that the camera is connected we're going
to check if the Edison detected it the
command is lsusb we can see here that I
have a logitech c270 if you have an
error try to plug the webcam after the
Edison boots so now that we have
everything plugged and recognized let's
start running some tests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
