organizing this and thank you very much
of course to intercept where for making
this all possible and for choosing
Berlin to be my name is Michael Eavis
dated already the international game
speakers the second biggest gaming event
in Germany it happens every April
obviously in Berlin but we also
initiated women eyes this year together
with wood and other famous females and
our goal is to provide a platform for
the whole topic of gender diversity in
the digital media in the tech industry
and so forth more to come on this topic
during the panel we also host an event
series called game cinema which we will
also briefly discuss why it's relevant
and for this panel actually this event
format we have the challenge here to
talk about social interaction the secret
sauce and actually want to bring a lot
of different topics into this panel
discussion so we might jump through some
of the more interesting topics too
superficial than we would like to I want
to motivate everybody to put up their
hands raise their hands if they have any
questions during the discussion it's not
like I will have five minutes in the end
of moderated discussion it's rather just
shout and say hey boo boo this is boring
or could you please dig in deeper into
this topic it's all about the social
interaction in the end so I would ask
you guys a big favor before we start
could you please get out your mobile
smart intelligent and battery consuming
phones and then open twitter
and then do a famous selfie come on guys
it's about action it's not about sitting
there listening it's about being
motivated to do something so follow my
example you have smaller phones right
okay then ask your neighbor she has
twitter do a joint selfie what when I
open facebook or just do a save you you
can post it by a friend's account later
on so get out your mobile phone trip
everybody come on in not just 2% 5% it's
late in the afternoon I know but we need
to wake up there's a hashtag code
there's a hashtag gold be my app so you
take your selfie I have wrote in the
background hello would then you share it
on Twitter and you post hashtag be my
app and if you want to do women as a
favor and if you are for gender
diversity add the hashtag women eyes to
it thank you very much now we will have
hoods giving your first introduction on
the women as topic and then we will
start into the actual discussion
thank you very much Michael for waking
everybody up and so I just I just would
like to give a short introduction or a
short statement or on what we intended
with the implementation or feminize into
the schedule of the international games
week as Michael already pointed out we
we came together about a year ago and
oops that was okay okay okay and we we
had a lot of discussions because we
wanted to implement new or to order to
plan a new event and we we were debating
on the fact that the games industry
where we were both work working in a 44
years already indigo in the games
industry that the games industry
successfully addressed the female
customers at the latest by the by the
release of the V the female audience was
addressed and everybody was ready to to
to play but the problem being that there
the female or audience was addressed but
no further content was coming was coming
up with the with the introduction of
tablet gaming and mobile gaming even
more women were attracted to to to the
gaming market order to true the earth to
the gaming in general and the industry
came across that the further content
would be needed to to address this new
audience so we had the Viet the idea
that the industries to actions have to
adapt to this change within the market
that's why we
I had the idea of inventing an event
that was made through to address
companies from the gaming industry but
also to address young female 20 talents
not only from the gaming of from the
gaming industry but from the digital
media business in general and women eyes
is an action day we had the first
edition of women eyes in April this year
within the scope of the international
games week and is an action day filled
with activities of recruitment but also
it is providing a platform there's a
conference taking play there are
workshops taking place it is a vent that
offers coaching for young female talents
but also that offers workshop for
companies who want to make their their
business environment for a more
attractive towards women so as I said
this we offer this platform for exchange
recruitment information we also hope
that with this feminised event and
platform we we can address
problem the industry is facing skill
shortages is a huge problem for for the
gaming industry and not only they are
also funded for all digital industry
this is a problem that is growing and
new talent must be found so another fact
that made us develop this format was
that we we wet in reports and research
works that the young generation of
digital natives is not really ready to
work in the digital business because
they are they have the tendency to opt
for two additional jobs and the the the
the reason for that it is said that they
are not really aware of what attractive
job profiles are there within the gaming
industry within all the digital business
businesses and industries so we wanted
to also offer the possibility to have to
have young people see what kind of jobs
are there in the digital business so we
wanted to address not only the young
talent but also the companies and at the
end of the day the main idea of the
whole event and the the platform was to
to change the structures within the
industry and to make it more diverse
whoops the possible
sorry yes and now I'm just too so we had
this event in April and now we we are
building up a network under women nice
dotnet you find information events
contacts and research works the whole
format is scalable to what other
industries and transferable also to
other cities and countries and we are
launching at the earth women as TV
channel on the topic that's shared by
lena Panama's next women eyes event will
take place in Berlin on the
twenty-second of the twentieth of
November sorry that was a mistake the
twenties of November and this time we
have to focus on the music industry so
check it out and so we now have the
challenge to challenge to discuss this
topic in dirt in the panel in together
with the social interaction topic ok
great thank you maybe I should introduce
myself as well to the audience today
also don't know me I'm Jana Van heart
I'm game developer and artist i work at
Red King and Halle and the last game we
did was try where we get which we get
the Dutchman computers with the German
computer games of what this year for
which was cool yeah that's me yeah thank
you so as you might read between the
lines that's not about like complaining
there's the it's not working the
industry is male-dominated blah blah and
poor women we can't afford to get into
the industry it's more about being
proactive and providing forward-thinking
suggestions and our belief is that
social interaction is one of these
main topics to integrate in society in a
hole so the aim is to actually change
and disrupt society now Howie what you
mentioned an interesting in our pre
discussion that you have observed some
differences in the generations of the
gaming industry and could you share what
you will learn over your vast years of
experience in the gaming industry with
the audience yes I think that there is
only one on the one side you have this
very very active in D market and the
indie business that is small more where
they're the people are younger they are
more cheerful maybe it's more lively the
whole ambience there are a lot of new I
would say a new event that are more
social events like format like feminized
but also all kinds of eSports events and
all kinds of different events taking
place on different levels also after the
event on the negative gaming and the
game cinema event so they all have this
very strong effort on the on the social
social impact of off of the industry and
on the other hand you have the more like
i would i would like to call it the old
economy that is more like also business
driven people are wearing their suits
they are around in the business center
at the games come it's like a and IM
when we discussed the spinner
earlier my version is that is the kind
of a gap between those two vols i would
i would like to call it there is a young
very dynamic in the in the environment
in germany and also all over europe but
there is all of this it's hard to say in
a young industry as as it it is the
gaming industry but nevertheless i think
there is some kind of old economy within
this young industry and feels sometimes
hard to get into the otakon economy to
meet these people like you like you
mentioned they are wearing suits I think
dress code is a very big part of it that
you that you meet people like lahir you
meet them in their normal Street closes
you don't wear a suit or anything and i
think that's that's an important kind of
social effect of something new that is
that is brought in the new economy that
you don't dress like this and that you
just meet people and that it's not about
maybe it's also about your work but it's
not the reason to meet the reason to
meet us to play games I think that's
important and in all these new events
that you have is a sort of closeness to
this old economy versus an openness of
your economy I think so i think it's
maybe i don't know if they are aware of
it or if they enforce it I mean it's
always an enforcement of authority I
think when you wear a suit and you you
stand in your group and stuff like this
it's always you you want to look
professional you are together with your
professional friends I don't know it's
you want to look like this i think but
maybe they are not totally aware of it I
don't know but but here it's you
wouldn't appear in a suit you appear
with a cool shirt that's the dress code
so I think that's very much different in
the door do you have the impression that
within this indie
in the world or Empire environment that
there are also more women mmm I think
they're this kind of a vibrant
environment and forces more women and I
think also they they make a place like
this more more interesting like like the
dress code it's also a rascal thing
because we went there bring of more
color with them and maybe more they did
I did they died a higher and give it
great color and stuff like this and I
think that also you don't find this and
also economy in this gap I think that's
it's like when you go to cuates and
after that you go to amaze that's
exactly this gap and I wish it would
mingle more and you wouldn't see this so
obviously so and I think it enforces
more woman but I think there still needs
to like to set at the beginning there
still needs to be more work to do more
encouragement so cavada stress for
anybody who doesn't know it it's the
developer conference with an
international games week ended it is
followed by the Amaze balloon festival
where we just had torn on the stage in
the first panel but what is the social
interaction to do with all of this and
perhaps you can also and what's also the
supported format of a mentorship herb so
that's a good bridge into the topic
which you experience in your first years
in the industry i think when i sat in
the industry that was quite a while ago
and and i saw the development over the
years because now there are more women
working in the industry but on the other
hand i realized that they escaped with
boo or this not very big exchange
between the so-called old economy in the
gaming industry and the the indie in the
world
I saw a lot of good developments in the
in the past years and I think that there
are a lot more women nowadays working in
the in the industry but in the very
beginning I there were a lot of events
where women were not really there there
was just too over with into the 500
people attending a what so many there
were maybe three or four women there and
so this felt like livid and Kenny I'm to
put it in a positive way it would felt
strange and I think what what would be
helpful to to have more women in the
industry but also maybe to have this
tour to to have a bitch in between those
worlds is to do to have more mentorship
that whether this is men or women
offering mentorship to two younger young
talents who want to enter the industry
and I think such programs would be
really helpful within companies to to to
help women to or to help young talents
whether it's women or
man 2 to get up in true to foster their
career but also not only within the
companies but also caught the industry I
think something like that would be what
we go to a half you need a sort of
rambagh to open the doors and to push
your videos not just so many role models
people yeah but when I started in the
industry it was really hard because well
you'd ever know they were not that much
women so I and women need role models to
to foster their own career so there
weren't nobody I could address to but on
the other hand I had always people
pushing me and telling me well you you
can do this or taking me asking me to
accompany them to go to those events and
they were presenting me to other people
i think mentorship is a program that is
some something that is like given to you
that is not what what what I have in
mind it's only small gestures like
presenting one bun to another open the
network giving the possibility to to to
go to events and to help to get into in
touch with other people I think those
small steps could be helpful already
when the audience is under the age of 30
take somebody with you and help them and
open the use your network your power to
open the gates and open the book tours
by bringing them into this interactive
context of events and to introduce them
because it's also it's you need to
design diversity she so she just said
okay I go to Steve Jobs actually that
was deep trust mistress in a brainfuck
sorry
so she went to Steve Jobs and said hey
Steve York or we both live in San
Francisco please help me and he said oh
yeah okay used him to be interesting
let's do some stuff and then she was
really working with the apple company in
the early years and now I'm she managed
to do her own career depending on all
the experience she learned and like
asking questions being don't have be shy
and actually push yourself into it but
take one single guy or girl who is like
leading you were opening the doors into
the diverse field it's funny that you
mentioned the Twitter at the beginning
that you try to Twitter test at the
beginning because a lot of people don't
have twitter or they said they don't
have twitter which is interesting
because it's the socializing tool for me
also to find role models to find people
that are openly tweeting about what they
are doing how they get into the industry
what they're what they're working on and
I think it's pretty encouraging to get
in contact with them because Twitter is
very open if you just ask people there
it's not like you have to write an email
and introduce yourself you just use your
your name tag and write them and that's
so awesome to get in via find your role
models and people didn't encourage you
so discussion seems to be a general and
important topic to share a know how
experience but also to present yourself
in order to make Korea or whatever
become a better developer whatever and
you just briefly share your experiences
within the Avena I in the oh yeah and
but i forgot to mention at the beginning
is that I did found a forum together
with Martin Erica and three years ago
and it's interesting that back then or
two years ago back then people in
Germany developers in Germany everyone
worked for themselves they just had
their maybe not even their office they
worked at home that it did their games
they promote them on the internet but
they didn't get in contact with each
other and when tossin started this
amazed we all crowded together there and
talked that we really need to get
together and really need to
cast about this industry and and share
the problems we have and that was a
reason why we did found in the arena and
I think now it's a very important place
where you can go and I by the way you
can get and be a closed community
because we just want professional indie
developer there but you can just ask me
and then I get you send you an end send
you over an invite and I think it became
a very important space to to meet and I
think such thing is very necessary a
place where you can get to work and get
informations and and meet the right
people but according to the women theme
we have yer as well we don't have that
much female developers nonetheless
although I think it's a very safe space
so so some of the interaction doesn't
work in this open forum because you said
before they are actually not so many but
at least some women developing in the
indie scene and also we are very happy
to not be a gender dominated audience
here but why don't they communicate on
the open forum of India arena and what
are perhaps some tricks you can take
from MMOs for example to design and then
falls better the social interaction mmm
that's an interesting questions I asked
one after are a lot of female designers
of German indie indie developers before
the panel and ask them hey why don't you
appear in the forum but what's wrong
with you and now it's interesting
because I they they are super talented
and they they they really decided to see
from those companies it's from them but
they never appear in any conventions
they don't are at Gamescom they don't
give talks and it's interesting
sometimes the answer simply I don't have
time I want to work which is interesting
because the entered the social
interaction is often something that you
would say girls to a woman do they talk
they get into they socialize so but it's
interesting that in the game space they
often don't do it
and I think it's a waste of time and I
don't know how you can encourage them
except just always making them and say
come on come on you have to do it you're
great you're great you're great and then
it okay okay maybe I do it and when they
get a positive feeling from that then
they will do it again but you really
need to push them and yeah I think do
you see the similar phenomena within
companies is that something that you
like I wouldn't say it's more the game
scene it's a professional environment in
January so do you have it in companies
and how perhaps can we motivate
companies better I would yes I think it
is maybe a novel phenomenon but at the
end of the off of the day studies show
that the more diverse the team is the
better other results and the more
successful the company is so i think we
are we whether this is a phenomenon
that's only striking our industries or
they get the games industry i think it's
also problem in the digital business in
general but I think maybe also still in
society but at the but I think this is a
structure that we will have to change
because the more social interaction the
more diversity the society gets all the
companies get the more successful they
are because they are always fresh
impulses coming in and they are always
the they're the new themes no subject a
new subjects new ideas and I think this
is something that's really important the
more the younger the industry is so the
games industry i think is should be not
conservative in this in this
issue you want spoke of feeling
comfortable that this is pretty
important for women or maybe up for four
people that get fresh into the industry
that feeling comfortable is very very
important like like you said about women
eyes that you look for a launch that is
very wide and then everything looks like
you and that people totally get into it
and then love it and just feel fine
there and that it's may be important for
companies as well you said to booga
booga is a space like this we felt very
comfortable with me buddy from google
and the audience at law okay you should
go to the women toilet there it's really
worth it I've been there once a problem
but uh I I had to have an said to go
there for meeting and immediately I
thought well this is a place I would
like to work because it's it's so it's
so different from the place I'm coming
from and I'm working in so it's a it's a
it's just a word atmosphere you have you
have the wealth is small small little
things that that can can can make an
atmosphere to active towards women
whether it's flowers or whatever so but
I think it is well this Fernando
Fernando Fernando do you have a
microphone for the audience back there
please there was a question
okay yeah questions huh time you take a
photo and it's and it's funny good for a
toilet against catania bites the the
company that made risen and gothic and I
know that I loved those games as a girl
I I played them gothic one gothic to and
elbows always wanted to work at them and
then people came back from from talks
but I wait I wanted to reduce themselves
to work there and I said no don't go
there that they are very very crazy
every everybody smoking and it's not an
atmosphere that you would like and it it
was very interesting because you see
that at the games they're doing they're
working on and I think if you want to
make diverse games to fit a dad was peer
group then you should have also
encourage women to work at your space
this your space so two perps
contextualize the toilet whites
important because i clear it's not it's
a culture of welcoming keeper and we
believe strongly and that's our
experience in what we learned from
everybody we talked to is that an open
welcoming culture is the key factor to a
diverse team and team full of with the
broad diversity is actually more
productive diversity doesn't stop in
gender equality it includes people not
from your region speaking other
languages having different habits
whatever but mixing people together and
providing them with a welcoming culture
where you don't laugh about the toilet
and say okay why do you want whatever
toiletry stuff
you can just buy it yourself but we
actually provide as a company with the
toilet area women need but also provide
people with a different food they might
need or with this is important for
people from outside of burden to not
have currywurst or the tan perps I don't
eat pig or region or whatever and all of
this is on the same bottom line actually
if you are open to to everybody and if
you are inclusive in your company
culture and in your team structure and
you actually open up also two opinions
by everybody on the same level and not
only have the loudspeaker being heard in
a forum or the most I don't know with
the most time whatever to be heard but
to actually integrate pullian opinions
and pullin also different cultures and
that's why this we had this little
Sadler thank you it's also interesting
um just a guy I just met here as human
he told me a story about his girlfriend
um he worked at Assassin's Creed before
and then they wanted to start a small
game as a as a side project and they
started with a real 3d photo realistic
3d graphics and Panthers and stuff and
it took them so long and it didn't
really look individual not not really
creative and then he told me his
girlfriend started to draw some some
graphics and who look totally different
and then he tried this comic style of
hers and it made the game gave it its
own its own style I made it more more
interesting so I think that's important
that you have more people than just your
the stuff that you are doing and that
has been done in the industry since
years so to get fresh fresh ideas so
yeah no that's coming bit to some games
now why does social interaction than
working and I'm always inviting more
women play these games is there what's
the point be handed maybe because they
can organize themselves have friends
there and
I think it's also a safe space because
you can take another personality you are
you're not present with the person you
are here you don't have to justify
yourself and there you can take your own
personality be strong maybe be a guy I
don't know and I think this kind of
stuff helps to to be they are not judged
by who you are but just by what you do
in this game and I think that can
support you and is there like a design
trick you can share what because in the
end as I try to say it diversity you
need to push it you need to enforce it
and of course you can adapt experiences
from the virtual world to let
experiences design models from the
gutter over to the analog world there
some point perhaps can inspire people to
use I don't have an answer to that no I
mean I personally enjoy games that that
don't have totally stereotypical
characters more than then the typical
stereotypical characters that were
designed in games before and maybe in mm
ohms MMOs they know that they want women
to play that as well so from often often
those games are designed for both peer
groups and I think you see that in the
character design but I mean you can't
say it just MMOs there are those in
doors I mean Warcraft does it very well
they they give them every of character
you want but they are also Japanese ones
that are that are not very encouraging
and how they look I don't know it's hard
to answer em with games anyway we had
this experience games to namaz a format
where we go into the cinema we have a
two-hour framework and instead of like
going to the cinema to the big screen
and and drawing a movie you go there to
play games with your friends on the big
screen everybody's in the same audience
we put the controllers in the crowd and
have an informal tournament system and
our goal was to just see what happens
and actually
talking about the safe space and this
one come to this point now is they i
actually i had a lot of my friends in my
age which is above 30 from the female
gender saying hey wow cool i want to
play in the cinema i actually I never
play games but in the cinema this is
cool to go with my friends to be on the
instead of being on the couch and doing
whatever and in this most madly
environment go into the public space the
social interactive space of the cinema
whereas the happening of my free time
and then actually they women who never
played before we weren't good or who
normally would say no I don't want to
compare with these other pros here took
the controller part took in the took
part of the tournament system and
actually won even one it match but they
were happy anyway and this was a
environment of a freedom where you could
do whatever you wanted nobody was like
blaming you for playing bad because
everybody was not so good or it was at
least encouraging to to just play and
now the female audience is growing and
growing and you're very happy about that
and they are some again all this notion
of communicating of interacting between
the different friends and to applaud in
to cheer and to also motivate somebody
was not so good to to progress within
the game gave Vidya this year a special
job at the games week if you can tell
about this because I found it very
interesting to have her there that she
had a job of what was it called yeah we
thanks to Lorenzo who unfortunately
isn't here now but a very inspiring guy
Lauren superia who organizes the talk
and play series and games in berlin calm
he introduced the so-called safe space
policy into Berlin as the first time
anybody know what safe space policy is
one guy two guys three guys
for gas one woman says first policy
basically says except difference don't
challenge people because they are
different don't disturb people because
they are different and especially don't
be the boring drunk old guy grabbing the
ass of a young girl at a party and
that's why we introduced a safe space
policy and also safe space hero that was
Celia's job so her phone number was on
the website we had the policy stating
what we tolerate and watch behavior we
don't I actually just stating which
behavior we don't tolerate and then if
anybody in the attendance group failed
harassed they could call her and she
would come there and with the official
logo of a safe space hero and actually
kick out the guy or the girl who was
doing the shitty stuff and it was a
very positive experience because the
years before we actually had some
incidents and this year just I think it
was just because we communicated it that
we didn't sent out a press release and a
newsletter and this phone number
actually everybody behaved and we didn't
Syria wasn't called once and so that's
something where we again say if you want
to change stuff it's good to say
everybody needs to be self-motivated and
of it like you would expect that people
behave at events because you expect it
from yourself but sometimes you just
need to say okay no we don't tolerate
your we are strict here and we kick
you out of this conference if you don't
behave according to our safe space
policy and so you need to enforce change
every now and then alright as it won't
happen any questions do before the time
runs up nobody was brave enough except
for the vulgar toilet
information and to raise and yes please
hi Joseph shomoy did my name so when it
was I was I were a hit was about social
interaction the secret sauce and I saw
that we shall talk about games with
social interaction between the avatars
is especially interesting and attractive
for women so how to design games which
are especially attractive for women
because women are usually more socially
connected with each other than man so I
think this did so my expectations were
not fulfilled and I was thinking maybe
we have here some kind of best practices
or brainstorming or whatever you do you
work for special company no no no but I
think that instead of shooting for the
time or jumping to collect social
capital in form of connections would be
very interesting topics for games or
whatever it is right I mean today I I
met the two guys who designed the tower
what was the name totem tower and they
told a story that they actually made a
game 4441 because it's a social game
it's free to play and they then you did
it's a great market and it's fun that
they were all men I think the most
important ingredients to get a game for
girls is to employ a girl and not maybe
just as graphic artist but to just ask
them but what they are interested in and
maybe to find some new staff also try to
get over certain tropes that women also
only love pink and only love cute
animals I mean everybody loves cute
animals
you know just just try to ask the women
themselves to what I like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
