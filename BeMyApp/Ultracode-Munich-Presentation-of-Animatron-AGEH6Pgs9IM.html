among jetbrains it's a bit complicated
because they're like a separate company
but we working jetbrains office offices
and we have a developer's whole war in
two brains before from start times some
are not like mrs. I was like a newcomer
so what is what is the neutron it is the
html5 web animation tool like and it's
built on html5 so theorem is this is the
interface and for now but we plan to
release just next days were kind of in
Russia's coming also looking like in
Russians solid plan to release as soon
as possible this is actually the
animation tool what it does it is built
in Java and Greek we all civil dependent
jection here it helps you to animate
things sorry
okay so for example here mr. our main
guy he's actually already made it for
example and if i press a private key I
can see the animation actually it
happens with the help of JavaScript
player here which which is that mostly
by me but there are also guys so if you
have some animation you can draw two
different loops and they will animate
like this review
and the main feature is that we might
publish your project and it goes like
this it has its own link and it's
playable and you may get the embed code
and the bed embedded somewhere thanks if
you want and it's configurable like you
may not do how to start in may just ask
use up to to play so but this is the
project and this actually no not
completely what I've been talking today
about actually what I do is JavaScript
player you've seen it in this previous
staff and it is used on the publish page
so it's like the engine for for this web
image it also have has its own script
and techniques inside there were some
guys in
we have enough it's important so there
were in terms from both universities
they actually program developed a game
in games using our ancient but
unfortunately the API has changed with
time so these games are not right for
the moment but we of course plan to
resurrect them so for example here is
the set box it is dotted life my break
sometime but you can change by color of
a strong colorful feel
like this and I have human use easy you
need coffee action but i'm not sure if
the cord itself oh yeah it works okay
it's sexually yeah it looks like jquery
but actually player doesn't use jquery
at all but it was like the syntax is
inspired by chick webb for the scripting
actually there is a possibility to
script some actions in the tool so you
may put some object and say and unclick
I want to do that but is it just started
to be implemented so maybe it's not
perfectly using
for this moment but we're realism and it
is like maybe not the finished product
and global release every other weeks
with more features with more more stuff
so redundant player I have several
examples just in action it's like
changing the earth it's creepy it
demonstrates the new you can change
everything life just happens in every
frame you change the data in dec updates
okay well and you may also it's ready
call for it don't make it look more even
more creeper like these stars there is a
lot of fault here just because we have
no for the moment is a function to
create a star but it's just a function
like this and I will provide some this B
is like a door in jquery it's a builder
or filter it just makes you a lot else
to create everything so we also you may
change the number of comments for
example
schiffman some yummy use it three more
examples
that should change
so it isn't the time or 20 just
without me
yeah it sticks out to them like bagels
in some direction
so you may easily do some recursive
stuff or you may not and it's because of
zoom the cottage shifted so let's kind
of recursive things
wait what
when the color also cables keep that
stuff
there are so there's the element
actually have its own thang like its
lifetime so it burn points at some time
and it dies sometime and inside of this
time you can you may have eight weeks
like giving is easy and also you may
give some inductions as we call it like
these bounds for example so it bounces
back and if I don't loop it will just
look like this also we have some
intersections tests very basic part but
three seconds so this circle suggests
understand that they do intersect by the
way it's useful debug mode where you can
see the way the shape Rex you can
actually change the the path which is
treated like as an obsession so you may
pretend that that circle is like
triangle but it will be hidden for a
user that maybe there are conditions
test
same way that
it actually
to turn out the back mode it's
the suspense
and it happened so they're they're
protesting themselves for for collision
I have actually the slides which I'm
done for oh we meet in Boston recently
and the munic-- also while developing
this project so in June I've made some
presentation for the developers so I
measured the slides about the API of the
player
the interim here's oh I forgot yeah
about the main thing of the mouse and
showed that so there is a site for
player here there you have the
connotation and and the sandbox is also
line actually the code is open source
completely so you may participate in
free to pursue participate the note the
sandbox there were working games like
this awesomes interpretation and this is
how the player works in to know it has
just one main file with all the
internals it has this beautiful which
provides the useful API and simplifies
things just like creating shapes and
that stuff and it supports extending day
a guy like models and exports different
importers so you may provide your own
format of a seat and give it an importer
and it will be
and play this is just the examples of
code like in player everything takes a
lot of light diffusing builder it takes
much less models provide some cool
things like collisions collisions
section it is a model and importers
allow you to import different scenes
that how it works inside inside the
scene consists of different elements
like shapes text and different stuff
they're actually start structured and
they are structured in the in the way
where the element may be actually empty
but may have some children but it may
not be empty so attacks me all I
children also of different paths and
images and that stuff and it actually
raises some problems with grouping
so we even have support for sprites it's
like examples of the building code for
this moment it's again about children
and for example this down here is made
constructed something like this just by
adding child due to a sprite that it to
be weird but you made it so it actually
is about the elements may be emptying
actually but to have children and the
same star is here so you had as a child
to join a tail and it's okay every
government is exists author of its
transformations the state and a brush
which is visuals like text or image of
shameful or anything together
it's again together
and user a full user there are provided
some functions like we call them
modifiers the function which modify the
state of them like position angle and
then stop the functions of the time and
the painters the functions of contexts
so you may add a lot of your own
painters and draw anything you one and
it just goes through time for every
frame these modifiers which will defy
the state are implemented on every
flavor frame are called on every frame
and all of the vendors are also called
on ever free during the bank of vanilla
and it happens for every element
actually frames are not like strictly
take some seconds there is always a
delta between them it's like browser
scissors and with the
requestanimationframe and actually
modifiers are also actually all the
tweets and independence our function of
time so they are modifiers we call this
week
here is Blair means of some a bit old
version you may create it lotsa seen and
actually play asked to play from some
time you have a lot of functions like
different modes for player including the
back mode imaging zoom repeats in or not
change the ground I do we have custom
importers you may embed some project and
customize it with everything also I
don't know it's of things player
supports for the moment in some ways
collisions twins with into the eating's
mask sprites all that stuff it would be
a no show them one by one you may can
construct a name an element this
provided name provided his name using
some low-level element you may reuse
some element from cache a children and
remove some you may create shapes
different kind of kinds of
shapes you may change the position hello
of stuff their men's makeup bands and
the end actions like a bit more which
design is moves the balances or if it's
like space 3 season in time in the end
of a bank there are all other possible
twins I think they may be related maybe
not related in time you may compose some
twins you will have the ability to make
composite drinks like twins hi several
points of time wait this way you have
all these it you may think of you may
the point some function to to be cold at
some exact time you may call it in its
own bed like doing and also you may
change the time again everything you
want it's like and we paint in the last
line is like adding the page of custom
painter and the ED object may have all
of them play sports and then even
keyboard and mouse not touch for the
moment but it'll look different type
jumps in local time and also like
changing the the whole time like a
lifetime of the older player like in the
words why's it like changes the eating
of elements that this poor sprites
in different ways you can promote them
and then run animation or you can't just
blow them and run compositions and masks
and other cool stuff and this is
everything on the agent of modifiers and
painters so you may look at the dogs
they are a little dated but still actual
fits our sandbox which is like an
electronic on player sandbox I'll show
show live in version one is coming soon
very soon and that's it and their post
the salon that makes the slides and to
the player in the Twitter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
