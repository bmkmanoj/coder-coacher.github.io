quite a bit of project progress already
so we have a partially finished em cards
app so we are able to write our note
right and now I'll show you how the
Apple work go to the M cards app we're
able to go we're going to choose our
we're going to take up new picture and
we can take a picture of our text here
we took it we are going to decide to use
it okay great success and now the last
step is now we just got to send it to be
written and that's our final step and
the puzzle
most difficult issue was getting to this
level here where we could actually take
a picture have it ready to be sent and
it's ready to be converted and be
written so but we're there just one more
step of the sending portion so yes
excellent
challenging part for this evening now is
going to be executing we have a special
surprise in store and making that work
is going to be cool
I slept three hours six hours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
