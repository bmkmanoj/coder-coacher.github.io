the last email has just been in sent and
we started at five one minute no problem
ok cool swinging let's go ok
you
hello everyone my name is April from
bear my app and welcome to today's
webinar Luca metal era is a solutions
architect google developer expert on web
technologies and manager of london
javascript meetup today he is going to
talk us through how to build a better
front end please note if you have any
questions please write them in the
comments section and Luca will address
them at the end of his talk that's it
for me take it away Luca hi everyone and
thanks for joining me ok so let me first
screen so we can start this talk I hope
that you can see my presentation cool so
let's talk about next generation from
kind architectures so I think that you
already know who I am thanks for the
introduction by the way today we are
going to cover a few a few things so we
are going to talk about the current
status of the front-end architectures we
are going to talk about communicating
sequential sequential processes then we
are going to talk about transducers
reactive programming that is quite an
old topic right now and one of the
architecture that currently are
well-known in in the reactive movement
that is mvi and we will see later on
what it stands for so let's start with
some some discussion around what we
watch is the current status of the
architectures so I prepared is light and
usually I think it raises quite few
success in the past few talks that I did
because I would like to show you what
how we evolved their texture of
front-end not only from conductor text
with my internal architectures from the
eighties to nowadays I think that
everyone knows what NBC is so model
control is when famous was created in
the 80s is it implemented i would say in
the vast majority of the application
that we have seen until now and still is
quite the popular architecture
so if not for in production also for
prototypes what the view control is
basing its basically based on a model
where we are stirring stirring all the
data we have a view where we are
visualizing the data for to the user and
the controller that basically does what
he says so basically is controlling the
application so is is the glue between
the model interview this let's say
pattern II was implemented in several
ways some languages are implemented in a
way where the model in the view doesn't
know each other and some other languages
are implementing these architectural in
a way that the model and the view knows
each other so every time that there is a
change inside the data and about that
the view is reflecting these these
changes without passing through the
controller in order to to update itself
and then later on in the 90s so after
more or less than years there was a new
architecture that come up at the Disco
MVP so multi-view presentation model
what the main difference is in this case
the presentation model basically is a
tight one 11 12 with the view so every
time there is a view there is always a
presentation model and the interesting
part is the presentation model is
fetching all the data I wouldn't data
from the model that needs to populate
that you and and the other interesting
part is that the presentation mode has
quite a good knowledge of whatever the
view should do and the view is just a
passive you how is called so the passive
you basically is just a view that is
rendering some data and giving some
interaction from the user to the system
but again is thus something that is used
to interact with application the view is
in this case is done and it's very
interesting because this button allows
you in particular if you work in
application where you have to target
different devices and want to mean
different devices I mean like not only
smart phone or tablet but also smart TV
or other devices where I don't know your
JavaScript code or your front
code is running what you can have at
compile time and you can swap the view
in particular if you're using tools like
Bible or I don't know hex or other land
programming languages that allows you to
swap classes and you have conditional
computation as main feature in this case
the model is a model that is keeping the
state for the whole application and
again the precision model is that want
one with the view it's interesting when
you won't work in application that runs
through multiple targets and you have to
have a quite good control on the views
and then in 2005 Microsoft change a
little bit the the way how MVP was
raised up creating a mvvm that stands
for model view viewmodel in this case
again model and view remains exactly the
same but we have something different we
don't have a presentation mode anymore
we don't have the controller but we are
the view model every model basically is
a sort of controller that inner it's all
the benefit of the presentation model
plus the benefit of the controller in
fact the the view model basically is in
the middle between the view and the
model the interesting part is the view
model can control multiple views and
also it has a unique way to update the
data inside that the view where instead
of calling line representation model and
method public method exposing side of
you is used to use a binding so
basically there is a and cotton address
am I variable that is injected between
the view and and your model and is
updated accordingly every time that
which something is changing safety it's
a good motto sorry this is very famous
in particular if you used to work with
angular 1 or if you used to work with
knockout yes and then it shouldn't I the
creator of MVC came out with a different
architecture is not very famous like MVC
but it's worth to mention it's called
the CI data context in context
interaction and in this case
the main difference is that is
approaching the architecture in a
completely different way from the
previous architectures in fact a CI is
called the lean architecture and it's
interesting because for the first time
here we are thinking more about how the
business will structure the application
more than how technical team should
structured application in fact basically
we have data context and interactions we
have some actors that are interacting
with data inside some context and
usually the context is the glue where
the data and the actors that are
completely agnostic each other are
interacting with themselves I would
suggest to check the website of DCI
because you can find really a lot of
good insight in particular if you are a
big fan of domain driven design I think
these architektur would suit perfectly
you need after that in more recent time
I Facebook came out with an interesting
design pattern called flux flux as you
know is a yes is a framework that was
created pink to give some structure or
when you won't work with with react it
was immediately interesting because was
leveraging a very important contest and
a very important concept that is
basically the concept of in the
direction of flow in fact with flux what
you're doing is you know exactly where
the problem could be inside inside your
code base mainly because you know that
the flow is always the same so you know
that if a user is interacting with the
button the interview is in dispatching
an action action was brought by the
dispatcher and then there is an update
on the store and the store update the
view and he's always in the same way so
that there can't be any other way to
that the flow of the application is
going so it's super easy in particular
if you have a large team to jump in
decided code and step and stand straight
away where to put your hands in order to
fix a bug or implement a new feature and
then in 2015 um
there is a very important person in the
reactor active movement that is
undressed at that start to speak about
mvi both of you intent and we will take
a look more deeply to these
architectural material in this in this
dog okay so um which is the main
challenge that we face every time that
we work with with this architecture
event-driven architecture are very
interesting because are giving you a lot
of flexibility when you work together
but sometimes you know it's tough to
follow all the the communication across
these dis different object because
obviously is based on the debts and
because it's very the couple of this
system it's hard to follow sometimes the
whole the old flow of your event so um
you know recently like a new year ago
more less I started to study more deeply
how if there are any alternative way to
work with this with this event driven
architecture and i discovered the tree
there was this a distinct CSP it's not
really a new concept csb stands for
communicating sequential processes it
was created in 1978 so it's quite old
more or less the same time when MPC was
created drizzly just important for
javascript that there are several of
them but i think the most effective one
is just peachy yes this is supporting
from closure and a particular is taking
in sticking inspiration from the
chorusing library and from go I
particular for the karate it flavors the
composition of Americans that is
definitely a good concept for if you are
interesting OB and this lens that this
needs to create easy easy is super easy
to test any any system that is based on
CSP is blue scalpeled and well
encapsulated so it basically
it has all the benefits of working with
a good Oh II structure it's very
interesting a different approach from
from what we are praying as usual so
just to give you a brief idea how you
could work with ESP just paste are
leveraging the idea of channel and it
slightly misleading sometimes the name
because it's communicating sequential
processes but you can communicate also
parallel processes so you can let's say
broadcast a specific notification at the
same time so in order to multiple
channels so it's misleading a little bit
but it gives you a lot of flexibility of
what you can do the interesting part of
of this is potentially usually when you
communicate with the controller or a
station model or I don't know a direct
click with the model or whatever you use
to communicate with view for instance
and you usually I don't know all
injective you inside the controller
prediction model or you use event in
order to the capital you use mediator so
there are several ways that you can
interact between objects another
interesting way it could be the channel
just be CSP is leveraging this concept
of channels where basically you can
interact between true entity to object
through the channel so the day in this
case raises the controller and the view
they don't know each other at all and
they communicate only through a channel
and the interesting thing is the channel
is not just let's say a place where I in
where I put some data and get some air
retrieve some data but it's also a place
where i can create some logic inside and
we will see in in a bit so in order to
explain a little bit further this
concept i prefer this small example let
me go to my code base let's see let's
start the example first so i can show
you how it works here okay cool so what
i have created basically it's a bigger
system so i pinco system is a
basically the game of bingo where you
have something gets the user has some
tickets entries an energy that is
calling some number in each ticket there
are 15 numbers and I'm basically the
engine is Colleen if you remember well
something like 40 50 numbers per game
every time the tree is a coal basically
what we are doing is checking if the
number is present in inside the inside a
ticket and if it is we are dubbing so we
are just saying yes there is this this
number so for instance we have both
called 50 that is the engine that is
calling this number and the ticket t1
that is the first one has the number 50
so and so on so as you can see every now
then we am sure the engine is calling a
number and I'm checking if inside the my
ticket this this number is present at
the end in order to win the game
obviously I need to have a specific
pattern inside the the ticket or a
certain amount of numbers that were
caused by the engine so let's see how I
have implemented that greets ESP so as
you can see here basically my my
application is doing this so i
initialize my application creating doing
three things creating the channels that
will be injected inside at the different
the view and the and the other object in
order to communicate I create I
obviously wire the channel together and
I create the the bingo system so when I
create a channel basically what I'm
doing is thus creating free channels and
then what I'm doing here that is very
important I do exactly what explained
before swine I basically say there is a
channel of this free that is the channel
that will be injected inside the main
engine of the game that is basically
broadcasting the notification to through
different channels and in order to do
this I use the library that I explained
before GS pjs that is doing basically CA
speed operation of month I said which is
that the channel that they want
that is the base channel broadcast and
then I say okay basically I want to
broadcast from this channel to another
channel so basically I'm creating a
system that are is creating a context of
the game and they are wiring my channel
together in order to be broadcast so as
you can see here then when I create a
real bingo system i created the ticket
another ticket and then i create the
debacle the Boko system the Boko system
is basically our engine let's see what
we can what we are doing so the proko
system inside the Boko system we are
injecting the channel so basically i'm
using the dance injection in this case
in order to work with this I'm doing the
total of four tickles inside my game I
generate randomly some 40 numbers 40
unique numbers from 0 to 99 and then at
every free second basically I'm calling
this this map and in this method what
I'm doing is just putting inside the
channel so inserting said the challenge
one information that is the pole that
was cold and obviously i increment a
counter that is checking when the game
is finished so this is basically how the
games works and what I'm doing basically
every time that I put this information
is at the ticket as you can see there
isn't any reference inside the engine of
tickets I'm just talking about channel
inside here that is the ticket object
I'm basically generating 50 numbers in
this case unique 50 numbers and then
what i'm doing here is using a goatee
there with the quality inn in javascript
is a new feature that is providing a
classics I would suggest take a look is
interesting because inside the protein
you can stop the function and then
resume when you need it so in this case
I'm doing exactly so until the day the
channel is not closed I'm basically
checking every time that there is a call
inside the channel I retrieve the value
and and basically what I'm doing is
retrieving the value our retreat this
value for inside the channel just saying
yell channel and they retrieve this this
information
and and and when I do that I check if
the value is corresponding to an
existing one that I have inside my way
through through this if statement and
then I can say okay if there is to got a
number so i trace inside the console
that I found a number that is existing
as you can see the keys to object ikut
and volcko system they don't know each
other at all the only thing that they
are communicating are communicating
through two other different objects that
are two different channels that are
expressed inside here the application so
there is basically when when we wire the
channel there is a communication between
the boreholes channel and the ticket and
and that's it so the object are
completely separated is sooo brave do to
test them and also is it's very easy to
if you want to change your mind or
increase the functionality of the
application you can do that very easily
because you don't have any coupled
between the system the only couple that
you have is just the communication one
that is defying and in these three lines
of code okay so let's jump to add with
with our presentation and okay so what
you can do with the CSP library so you
can set it off for inside the channel so
you can say for instance I want to store
inside my channel always free for
elements you can retrieve data from the
channel you can insert the data inside
the channel you can close a channel or
enclose a child after a certain amount
of time you can you can insert an array
of data instead of just a primitive
primitive value a primitive variable you
can I don't know split merge or pipe the
channel so that's the interesting
because you can for instance a okay now
i need the 22 i have one unique channel
i want to split it up because I'm
created to object I can do that or I can
merge back the true channels in one
unique one I can create a pub sub system
that is something that is very
interesting because that means when you
need to communicate across
the entire application and you don't you
don't want to insert a specific channel
that are used to communicate across the
whole application you can use a pub sub
system on top of the channel
communication where the channel are
handling the communication between two
objects that are very close and the pub
sub system are updating the state from
the whole application you can broadcast
value simultaneously to multiple channel
and then there is the interesting part
the transducer part so you can much feel
to remove data insert channel you can
avoid duplicate data and you can
decorate data I let's see importer
transducer is that is very important in
this concept so um transducer stands for
transform and reducer enter storm is a
basically producing some value from from
first one to the nation one and the
reducer instead is combining value of
the of a data structure to produce a new
one so as you can see inside the channel
you can use these this being so the
transducer in order to apply some
transformation of the data inside a set
directly inside the channel if you think
what could be a good use case i would
suggest this one so for instance let's
assume that we are creating a stock
option dashboard where basically we want
to achieve a late the user the user
showing the value in is own currency so
let's assume that the older data that we
retrieved from the server are in dollars
and the user is based in a I don't know
in England and we want to show this data
in dollars but also automatically the
translation in impound in order to do
that you should apply a logic that
should rely on the view or on the
controller but to be honest video is not
correctly there because you can also
apply this logic on the model but you
really need to store these informations
on the model I don't think so honestly
so one place that could be very
interesting place instead is that is
it's a transducer so it's an inside the
channel you can say that every time that
the controller is a
pushing any value inside that channel
the channel itself is transforming does
this information in keeping i do not the
dollar and also the dollar symbol and
also adding that transformation in
impound and that leads to have a very
interesting way to handle data because
then you can reuse the channel in
different part of the application
without rewriting code instead if you
use views or controllers to store this
information it will become a lot of
duplication around your application in
particular if it is it's a large one and
if you decide to store this data inside
the bottle you know it's not completely
correct so I think the channel in this
case could could be could be a good it
could be used case with transducer so
again it's applied at the channel level
so you can keep raw data and inside the
model orbit station model and decide in
the view is just rendering so it's doing
exactly what you should do after that
after the CSB I started to study i spend
more time on reactive programming
basically to speak and i can say that is
the Assessor of a raptor programming but
mastering CSP allows you to enter inside
the reactive programming bored very
easily so reactive programming what is
this this parting as you know there are
several different party in a in
programming world so we have not just
this free but we have several others we
have imperative programming where
basically we are describing step-by-step
what our application is doing what on
what logic is doing that we are
functional programming where the
interesting part of functional
programming is basically when you have a
function that accept an argument when
you pass and are evaluated as argument
of this function the function will
return exactly the same same result
every time and you know for sure that
that function is is based on pure
functions it's a concept where exactly
do what I have just explained
and then we have read the programming
ragley programming is something slightly
different from this this tree here
wreckling programming basically is
saying instead of having a passive
interaction where for instance the
object a is calling the method of the
object B because b maybe is injective
treatments injection is saying something
completely different in this case we
want that the object p is reacting to
some data that are injected inside cell
but how this data are passed from A to B
usually it passed through an observer an
observable sorry a favorable think about
observable like an object like channel
that you share across this district and
and allows you to communicate and again
manipulate the data potentially when
arriving side inside the object B and
we'll be seeing a moment how it works so
why reactive programming is is
interesting record let me use really by
quite a few libraries at the moment so
the other top right you can find and
logo with a snake and that one is
basically our xjs is basically the one
of the most famous currently library or
reactive programming then we have
another one just on the bottom of Rex JS
global it is the cycle one sec of GS is
basically probably the second most
famous library on JavaScript for
reactive programming is basically
leveraging a lot of interesting concept
if you if you at the end of the
presentation we share my get up account
and you will see if you if you have time
me you can go there and I prepared a few
example secretaries then there is bacon
GS that is another library that is using
reactor cramming and you are true and
virtue currently is using observables in
order to communicate between components
and then we have fused that is a startup
based in Norway and California that in
created Allah say yes
a new frame worked in order to create
native application and the whole
framework is working with reactive
programming so there are quite a few
things and these are just some five
samples about reactive remember you can
find a lot of lot more inside on the web
letty programming is basically based on
two patterns when you leverage these two
patterns you are able to understand
better reactive Graham so wreckling
running is based on the observer pattern
where basically we have an object that
is called subject that is containing all
the list of object are interested to a
specific notification and every time
that there is a change of state the
subject is notified automatically all
all the objects are subscribed to to
itself and this case is super easy to
avoid hierarchy understand and maybe
shared is a shared identification across
the whole system because basically a big
object that is interesting to a specific
notification can can subscribe and also
if the object is not interested to a
specific notification but one other one
can subscribe itself as well and the
interesting part is if we react only
when there will be a notification that
it takes care the other things that is
important to understand when we talk
about retro Graham is a director a
toccata in this case is a way to
traverse a container and it's very easy
to understand because basically what we
have an iterator we are checking every
time that we receive a data or we have a
data and we traverse the container
through next method and we check if the
reason you basically and if there is a
new value available through s next
method that returns obviously a boolean
value when you have understood this
these two buttons it's kind of easy to
understand how reactive programming
works so let's say let's let's do a
small exercise so basically what I
I'll prepare exactly the same example
that they did here in with CSP but this
time we acted well this is made with our
extra gas and akma 6 there are several
other things that they can show you
because there are more or less is in a
near that I'm working with reactive
programming and it's something pretty
well they're the problem of a syncros
data so what I'm showing basically is
exactly the same thing so let me go up
in a example here so this one is the
example sorry yeah another example that
they created see if it works we are so
this one is a another example that they
created this is made with a pure
reactive programming so again I same
game bingo as you can see he in this
direction i added also are the different
number that are called inside each
ticket just to diversify the things so i
called the number 72 in ticket one they
call the number 73 Pikachu and so on as
you can see it's working in exactly the
same way it nothing is changing so the
the result is exactly the same so we
have two tickets to erase and that we
are trapped we are basically the reason
engine that is calling different numbers
and we are basically inspecting these
tickets if there are these numbers or
not till the end of the game let's see
how it may in this case so in this case
will be asked this so we have the
Volkoff system that we create here the a
new instance we have to get one tick and
true and we basically are we are
injecting so that he cannot anymore a
number we are top we are injecting and
observable that is this box three it's a
stream of data and inside the stream of
data we are basically checking whatever
it is so if you if we go to Boko system
we can go here and we express let me
show you because it's very interesting
sport we express is exactly see if I can
or taco is easily a coke we are
expressing the same concept but not
anymore in imperative programming but in
practice this part here so if you
remember we have started system and
would then we call every free second is
this method send it in this case we are
expressing exactly same thing what we're
doing is creating a stream that through
directs observable API that every free
second is returning a number to go and
we say we want only 40 numbers so every
time basically this introduced code is
thick react to a second what we're doing
is shuttle returning and value that is
root 3 by is array here and NSA and this
value is basically stream inside this
district
so inside the string and and that's
really hate what we are doing is at the
ticket basically because we pass the
observable is saying observable
subscribe so if you're interesting on on
something specific subscribe so in this
case every time that I received any for
a data I just check if there is this
very inside my ray if there is I added
to the Tottenham's cold and I I show
this inside the cost and that's really
nothing else nothing more as you can see
it's way more simple to understand the
whole flow inside these interactive
running example more than the other one
all this example are already in my
github account so you can check if you
are interesting on it let's move back to
my slides okay so when we talk about
reactive programming we have to talk
about mvi mvi stands for Model View
intent as I said before is an
architecture that was made mainly
forties 440 spotty the interesting part
as you can see is leveraging the concept
of a unidirectional flow like flux and
also is using something that is very
familiar for us the model the view
something that is not very familiar that
is staying tent how it works basically
so in this case what we have based the
view that is basically it is using if
you if you try this if you want to try
this architecture just use psycho Jas
cycle jess is created in order to use
also this way to get to construct an
application in this case the view
basically is containing the virtual dome
and is fastening the filter Dom so what
if they should be render inside the
browser through to the rendered library
that usually is made with a third party
library that could be react it could be
hyper script it could be several others
that are leveraging the cosmospheres
older and basically instead of you we
are just keeping the logic of what
should be render so then
intent is basically fetching from the
from the real object to the concrete
object are present currently inside the
browser we are is fetching the events
that are triggered by the user so if
every time the user is I don't know
clicking a button or inserting some data
inside text input whatever these all do
the listener are inside the intent and
this intent is preparing the data for
the model in order to say prepare the
new state and every time that there is
an interaction from the user the intent
is passing this data through an
observable again to the model and the
model is manipulated obviously
retrieving the data from HTTP if needed
and and manipulating the data and is
passing this information manipulated so
it's basically keeping the state of the
entire application to the view through
again and observable so the only way to
communicate between these four object is
always through observables so we are not
talking in any other way and the only
way to communicate so there will not be
any less a communication through a.m.
and public a public method is always
working through observables from streams
so damn here I was a model shouldn't
control any other module so like the
controller that is controlling nephew
see some implementation from you see the
model and view the only part that is
shared across this body this object art
observables and the intent is the
compound it is a component that has only
one responsibility so you should
understand what is the intention from
the user and update the model
accordingly in order to prepare a new
state of the application the probes
league is a better separation of concern
if we are leveraging constable Moloch
direction of flow that is quite
important because when your scale is is
very very interesting also if you check
in particular cycle to yes it's
leveraging also another concept of
fractal where basically you can
reuse a component on top of another
component and you can basically create
an acid component each other maintaining
an MDI architecture each single
component that means it's very easy to
swap the one components are using
another project because you are always
using this unidirectional flow across
this this for object the application
became very easy to test and also that
you know for sure that the state of your
application is living inside the model
and it's the only place where you got to
to search if there is something that is
wrong the view is again state agnostic
so in that case it means that you can
swap view as long as it's injecting a
new observable so as you can see there
are a lot of pro based on these on this
architecture if you want to know more
about mvi this is the link of fun
article that i wrote for the new stock
that I oh we're basically I'm explaining
a little bit more further house mvi
works um the main the last thing that I
would like to true to talk about is when
you should use CSP and reactive room so
I see in the java community quite often
the thing off ok react is the new topic
or angular 2 is the new our topic let's
use everywhere this is something that I
discourage honestly because it's not the
right approach room for an engineer from
an engineering point of view where
basically you should use the right tool
for the right job what I suggest is if
you have for our let's say an
application that needs to handle or be
driven by by back-end and your
application should be just the let's say
a dump container that has say some logic
but not that much this is this is a
perfect or departing that you should use
so for instance I think Netflix's from
here for everyone here so you think
about the interface of Netflix all did a
catalog all the data are handled by the
server so in that case for instance that
fixes using Iraq yes so is using
reactive programming in order to compose
the
in your face of the main application and
that is an interesting thing because it
allows you to understand better that
everything that is driven by some data
like a game like a short leg bingo from
server and this case was simulated by by
my ing it could be a suitable
application for reactive programming
that's everything for today also because
I think that I'm running out of time
