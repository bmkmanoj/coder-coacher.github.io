thank you very much concern has yes
that's about it we have always have
passes joining us and when we presented
to you shortly we have crafted and
because L therapist and artificial
intelligence startups baby by incubation
giving advices also
the promotion matt is a community around
smart mobility and salad four zeros in
the department summer fun is a
crowdfunding partner fmf will be too
technical partner for mobility and over
value and instead of presents and
presenting a boo-boo I'll just ask him
to join me on stage tonight because
easily and he's going to do a workshop
welcome back and see some children so
thank you for being here I just wanted
to give you some words about you but my
partners and what we do whatever type
does so and just a few words as a
background me and my partner our formal
price for the house coupe resolution
expert and so do many years we had the
opportunity to perform and edit
variation walks for furniture repair
impacts M&amp;amp;A we will not be nexium from
morning to evening and advising see you
and CSF private and twenty companies and
these are this rich experience we
created five years ago our value so
where is a very / values an online
valuation and cap table analysis
platform which enable users to very
eight companies at any stage from I
wanted to pass a pillow with the results
revenue as well as to evaluate a queen
security of private company including
professors convertible notes warrants
decryption especially what you found in
start-up everywhere and so as you can
see the values for different purposes
and services and clients with design
chooses first uses for compliance when
for instance started with two grants the
corruption in Israel in the US and they
need to perform tax variations as they
arise in the US of all masses NASA
Israel it's called a nest on the phone
and a in the u.s. ONGC's need to mark to
market the path relative values a
financial reporting the second easy
especially for startups and investors is
to n summation as next on financing
grant of the captioner exit and to
understand the impact as a return sheet
or resolution and PF you have to
understand and that's what we so many
times our price and what we see today
with users everywhere
that first 99% of started Sanders this
about the valuation the demo crew and
signal think the same time sheets that
they don't understand most of the time
regarding the financial impact and at
the end you can see many articles about
Sanders who get we got much less and
what is it so that's why it's very time
to simulate and to understand and let's
see is when we did to valuate a company
for any reason which can be capitalizing
and an irritation ipf Angela parent arts
whatever you can think about and so if
you take a look at the website you can
see that we have different type of users
today the platform is used by accounting
and valuation films CFO of startups and
founders and private companies were
films and venture capital firms and
other type of investors and we have
users in the US Israel and in Europe and
so everyone is a platform also
compliance as a simulation for capital
raising as a base depends on it so
that's i will say about a good value and
i would just like to say that today when
you start to raise capital because
that's something that you're going to do
many times during your life as a
start-up at the beginning it was easy it
just got to see your family you can see
to go to you go to see my friends full
of money and you give common shares but
when you start to is higher amount of
money you're going to see more
sophisticated investors and these
investors won't like to get common
shares you like to ask for convertible
notes or simple agreement for future
equity or researchers and all these
things are highly complex to murder in
terms of mathematics and at the end
you're going to rely on your captive
ever going to situation and percentage
which do not reflect the truth only what
will happen if the compiler reached a
certain value adds exit and that's where
most of the people are floating all the
time thank you very much for your time
and I look forward to see all the
presentation thank you then before you

really
thank you oh
that fabric guide the shopper in the
buying decision by giving them more
information on products and hence the
experience you're going to ask me how
that fabric a business owner and
retailer ahead of edge by presenting
personal aide experience to mobile web
innovative apps location-based marketing
and message to the clients to better
satisfy them you're going to ask me how
we provide the solution for small and
medium enterprise by the play oit
product with complete NFC and fi
dissolution
the business model type fabric business
model is to sell a unique platform
collecting data has considerable value
to the customer and the marketer tax
fabric is the solution direct platform
around I've developers like many here
not me to write develop and market their
own application we did the tag fabric
ecosystem our client benefit real-time J
organization and data analysis of the
customer spending movie dirty habits
product placement and promotional
offering
how do you do it we did with NFC tokens
here you have example of the clients we
work with we have developed different
tokens for different shoes i'm going to
give you an example just right after the
NFC talking is powered by NFC powered
mobiles for now we know ok let's go
through to the example we have already
installed in France in Paris in many of
coffee of you guys have been many
stickers that give you function to have
reservation digital menu order tips and
priming process and the last thing if
may allow quatama question question if
you have you are the jury might ask the
question turn unit is too small yeah do
you have questions every question
question question about tax fabric that
phone oh dear question where's the team
offenders what about the team blue team
me my CEO is here yeah but when is the
background what's the background of what
of the team there is one technisch the
developer only one developer and there
is a
all the team is basically marketing
people and sells process another
question
you working with my you know what
exactly do you do with mine I you I use
distributed all around with my you know
shop read what are you all around France
with or in all my you know shops no no
we did demo don't move them okay yeah
which we need we have advertisement with
the Heineken and the lavazza okay and
it's working already there yeah no no
more in demo and yeah it's working okay
yeah is there any sensible change in the
cells the information you mean that pays
pass through the NFC the technology is
used only if the information is you give
the information we ask you a question if
you want to answer the target you can
allow but the NFC technology is taking
only the IP address will have been
tagged taking the language of the phone
and the browser
do you have an estimation of the market
size yeah what is an estimation in
France because we have started only in
France okay the market size for this
only product now the difficulty for me
is to explain the potential of NFC we
have done up only one product and we
have many product to develop so the
market size for this product is it's
it's about all the coffee's and the
restaurant around the the France and a
term of money it depends only of the
revenue that we can have on the
advertisement it's not the market size
depends on the how many advertising we
can have not on our many placement we
can have so it's a it's it's important
to know it's a free with ads but pay
without ads so it can it can be all the
cafes and friends other question yes
please what about composition
composition competitors competitors
there's many competitors
in this in this world but most important
is the market is so huge with so many
product that every competitor is
developing a solution for different
needs some for events some for product
we have a vision of experience in in
coffee in sharp so its user experience
that's the the specialty of tag fabric
we develop apps to and we think what can
be useful for the other people when they
go to shop when they go to coffee when
they go in the city and they want to
know information so we use the tags to
to give them useful information this is
what is about you have to understand
that people need to take their mobile
and by themselves take the phone and go
through a token and and it's not people
are not just doing that for for nothing
there is an engagement and you have to
have a special product for special needs
and people have needs so we finish this
needs its ever yes thank you thank
the J kept them crates and if it's good
for everyone just give me a little Sun
and I asked me back to join me and we'll
start then after that we'll make thank
you once they're ready careful don't bug
living here is oh it's all right that's
the scary she's my heater for there for
there for the crowd I give you a bowl
ads and say oh crap and stuff like that
you can move it up lift it up is the
jury okay for the next team mover every
good food1 are you ready i'll let you
kick
thank you really shahar se Reba so but i
will very nervous hope it's a okay hey
it can be very very boring yes your
doorbell can very very boring the same
ring every day how long so we have the
solution the smart solution in fact you
are holding the solution in your hands
you can choose your favorite song from
your smartphone and you send it turn to
your new smart bear well you can start
he notes and get written every time the
doorbell rings
yes you get it right we have the first
smart doorbell yes it is LT technology
yes it killed part of your smart home
technology yes even hard of hearing can
hear see and feel it you can put it on
need and still see the LED and fill the
smart phone vibrate and you can see the
double message on your Smart TV while
watching your favorite TV program same
every time
yeah sure because even click American is
to have 30 seconds maybe they can pass
them through and show me that okay as
you can see all of us have a old
doorbell and the market start Apple a
smart powerful smart contain entire
control system especially for the
security okay so that I let the church
ask a question there and maybe you can
develop this disguise emigration hi
everyone
is it an approach operational sample the
working is it working my noggin make the
demonstration lap after that okay this
is it working with Wi-Fi yeah there you
can upload the sounds or webcam we are
smart oh it's connecting or connected on
Wi-Fi yeah but it means if I'm not at
home I can have somebody I can know that
somebody's ringing on my phone on my
door as well and the special will be
bright if you choose it can I say
something from the phone I'm not hear
something do you have it in use yes I
can make it make it
after that another question how do you
make money from them sorry how do you
make money now we don't make money and I
understand but in the future maybe one
day I don't understand this fashion what
is your business model and almost every
home won't use something like that so
everyone want to buy it how you hire
green how do you plan to to be scalable
how will depend to a bunch of these
people with your with your team sorry I
don't understand the question
hey
sorry yeah yes social so but language
it's not so good so basically my our
business model is to we can develop for
two different parts first of all by
selling the product to the client now
after selling the product to the client
it's kind of it's a little bit like
printer you buy the print at one time
then you abide the job the the tuna okay
basically whatever model our business
models saying that we can share with the
the artist let's say a singer okay
basically like like we're doing when you
download a ringtone in the in your phone
you divided to the mobile company to the
singer and to the the company so the
same in in the in the in in our miba
product okay let's say for example i
want to put Seinfeld sentence like Alok
you can come inside we'll we'll have
money to from downloading that okay
we'll get money the right for sample
will get money and set around center etc
another thing about this product is
basically we got a few features to have
a safe feature ok let's say someone is
ringing on your door and you're
kids or your or your child sorry our are
in alone in the house and we are with
with our smartphone in I don't know
outside okay we can see who is ringing
okay we got a feature future feature
with the video we can see who's the
outside are the guy that ring okay and
we can say we can call back to our
children and say don't open the door it
can be our children can be our parents
our older parents okay so basically we
can its social features it's safe
features and basically it's a product
that really really a future product to
the to the smart houses we will okay oh
god I'm a clicker back it's it's gonna
be a first for me my clicker thank you
then I have next in dust come up and
join me on the stage tell me the clicker
and you fought me to pass oh I need a
clicker on the right to us alright are
you ready can I see the presentation no
you passed despite you get here ok great
are you ready yeah sure so hi everyone
how many of us here are not happy with
their saving accounts for the French
people for unbeliever leave they are
aware um I guess most of us are not
happy with saving account and let me
show you some number so I'll explain to
you why sorry that's not the right
okay try enough if you are back to the
distributing saving accounts plus 2 plus
2 45 groups if you are the customer over
the last five years studying accounts
are returned for you just over one and a
half percent now if you put the same
amount of money into an active and
diversified portfolio as the bank you
can generate between one to two percent
margin if you have the customer over the
last five years on average diversified
portfolio have written over eight
percent my name is Ben Malcolm the seal
up next invest and I would explain to
you how will help banks to redirect
unproductive funds into a more
profitable solution before the bank and
the customer so we are a digital wealth
management white label front end what
does this mean we integrate our solution
into the existing digital offering of a
bank so that on one hand we let the
customer transact in an environment they
already know and trust and on the other
hand we offer them like we offer them an
Amazon like experience for saving and
investment so our technology covers
gamified risk profiling user intuitive
portfolio construction and simulation
and a stress-free unwilling process you
don't need to go to the bank too humble
to that solution you can do that from
your mobile app or from the bank website
what is not unique about the solution is
that we combine all those features with
a unique and one hundred percent
algorithmic portfolio rebalancing engine
meaning that we rely on robot to manage
your portfolio more than human being
that can you introduce human bias into
the decision-making process
okay so why should thank you our
solution number one to increase in
monetized customer satisfaction second
to attract on which customers number 32
increased our productivity and last
become natively compliant so all the
benefits of digitization in a one in a
single offering we are targeting
continental Europe first and then Asia
at a later stage but we replaced our
proposition in France where seven large
banking working and seven six hundred
asset managers are competing for the
seven hundred billion dollars of asset
trapped into saving accounts the
business model is based on revenue share
based from activation of a hundred of
thousands of existing banking customers
rather than expensive customer
acquisition costs about the team and to
conclude I'll take that for a question I
guess consume
you can finish under consideration so
the team we we combined 40 years of
experience again at major financial
institutions with matching expertise in
technology sales and business
development and a deep understanding of
retail banking distribution models we've
been a participant to the citibank
accelerator and been short listed as a
finalist to the BNP paribas challenge at
vivitek last last june with next invest
we want to enable banks to be a few
clicks away from converting one hundred
of thousands of existing customers into
a more profitable solution both for the
bank and the customer I'm happy to take
question now okay a question any
question over here have a question no
question well okay what where is the
competition today except that so very
good question the competition today in
Europe and say in France which is a
first as market you have a number of b2c
players which are emerging and it's a
very good and healthy competition
competition for us because they go and
start to educate the market now we don't
believe in the into the b2c airport
because customer acquisition class is
way too high given the margin at those
those advisor can make on managing
accounts and we see the competition
coming from more established players
into the software software space people
with existing connection into banks can
be a threat if they decide to turn into
a white level a rabble-rouser model but
emerging players into that space in
France and Europe at launch
cases you and there's a question based
on my experience I was at large being so
large enterprises take a lot of time to
adopt the resolution so how are you
going to find yourself until you will
start to generate revenue so we know the
cell cycle within banks is very long we
all are the founding team is all coming
from the banking industry so we know
it's taking a lot of time what we will
do in pile of in term of approaching we
will approach bank for sure now France
is a very very concentrated market at
the same time we are putting effort to
into detail in markets which is much
more fragmented so you have over one and
a half thousand banks some of them have
like two three thousand customers if
they have the right fit in term of
Technology set up we can we could really
bring value from from early on for
photos players in parallel we want to
approach as well independent financial
advisor for the for the French public
decision p which is a very dense network
of advisor that need as well tools to
convert and attract the mass affluent
segment people typically with less than
100,000 euro in financial assets those
people are not equipped we have the two
that will provide them basically a user
experience that the customer is waiting
for whether it's the mass affluent
customer or the millennial that doesn't
show up to a bank or doesn't want to
have physical interaction with an
advisor or less less interaction thank
you
any more questions well then thank you
colleges for the next time I ask who
came to join me on the same / bike you
ready with the video you don't simulate
but i'm already in Reggie okay right all
right wait for it everyone good evening
starting my name is shy and I'm from
Peggy and our goal is clear we want
Millennials to continue to use the banks
for the pure pure payment transactions
we will develop a technology that
enables payments within any existing
social network the problem is clear
users trust their banks but outside of
banking they gauge with social networks
conversations about money are already
happening within social messengers
people chat about splitting bar tabs
dinner bills and sharing the cost of an
uber it is only natural to make the
payment in the same place the
conversation started without having to
switch to another app and banking apps
are losing the p2p transaction market to
the social messengers and this is not
surprising here we can see an example of
the largest banks in the States as we
can see the payment experience is not
intuitive the payment is not in the
context the context of the conversation
and worst of all this is Stafford many
Millennials are looking for the word if
banks were able to leverage is social
graph of the biggest messengers wouldn't
that be amazing Facebook whatsapp
Twitter i'm going to show you the video
of a payment transaction within what's
up
as you know what's up is the closest
network they don't have any APR or an
SDK they want to leverage the social
graph only to themselves but because you
are a keyboard you are able to do it a
keyboard has a unique quality that we
sit on top of the social messengers and
because of that we are able to do so now
let's wait for the video to begin I'm
going to talk to you later okay so here
I'm going with Ian what's up I want to
play alone I'm pressing the payment
button entering the amount stronger
authentication and that's it the payment
has been submitted we consider a seat
right away and this mechanism works
within any platform there is here I'm
within Facebook I'm talking to my friend
Alex I need to pay him back fifteen
dollars for a movie ticket I should be
selected for my contacts enter the
amount touch of the authentication and
that's it simple and fast and you can
see the receipt rather than the context
of the conversation this is all payments
should be really done today we integrate
our technology into the bank's mobile
application this way we serve as an
extension of the bank inside the social
networks now Peck is well value
proposition is unique we allow users to
enjoy both of the words the first having
making payments from the banks with the
security compliance and Trust all within
the social networks now this is our
partners we come there working with
several subtalar banks in the world
we're going to be live with millions of
users by the end of this year we won
several awards have an amazing team and
this is the most important slide we are
ready to launch today fake integration
takes less than 30 days and we're ready
to go live with any back from tomorrow
thank you
sometime emphasis okay could you give
more information about your team yes so
currently we have 14 people on our team
nine of which are from the technical
part our CEO has an MBA in law it has a
background coming from the block chain
space and the second co-founder is over
our CTO has over 20 years in an
experience in the startups is been to
three different setups I'm very
surprised by the name of your company is
it a protective name or do you just
invented you should know he is stands
for payment keyboard okay but do you
have the right to use it as a as a
project and salt yes of course why not
is it protected is it what protected
yesterday we filed for a patent in the
states and also globally that's pending
right now I'm not talking about the
patent i'm talking about the branding
the brand name about the name yes no
there's not there's no pattern for the
name I know but I'm just asking you do
you have the right to use this name is
it already a protected name it was not
used by other companies no there's
another company that's also pay key but
it's that the key is double I you're
familiar with this well it's it's adam a
familiar with the block chain okay
may I ask you another question sure this
project is for you very important or not
very important of korra why we see Peggy
not just as another company we really
want to change the way people are making
payments today so you don't have a very
simple and a platform agnostic way to
make payments to your friends this way
you can make payments through any
platform facebook wats up twitter
telegram viber and doing that from you
trusted back you don't need to build a
trust from another stand-alone
application you said that you got some
prices and you got some compliments
could you could you tell us a little
more about yes we participated a lot of
different competitions barclays
hackathons and and airspeed slam i
recently went to brazil we want the baby
sorry the c ab fab Robin we took a third
place where actually there are only
Israeli company only on Brazilian
company I was there we also won POV a
contest and we're going to Madrid and so
Mexico for BB va's immersion week in the
next few months and the few other prizes
that were on the on the slide show and
did you check the compliance with the
local laws regarding the payments so
regarding the different regulations
basically we don't create any new
payment rails we leverage already
existing payment trails of the bank so
whatever the back is already doing we
bring it inside the social messengers
not
no we were not a bank we're not taking
care of the payments we're simply
communicating between the users telling
the bank where to take the money to how
much and where to send it so what is the
return on it based the return on
invested to what you get from from this
application so basically we started we
thought about taking a transaction fee
but we found out it was really
complicated because the banks had to
open the books and they really don't
like it so our business tomorrow is
annual usage licensing the bank
basically pays for every user using that
keyboard per year biennial or try annual
contract okay I solving the storms your
company right before we generate revenue
as of today right if we're pretty new
you don't do it Jimmy well Trevor I love
to the right so we're already generate
revenue actually when the end is by the
end of this year resume to have revenues
of million dollars and there's another
slide I wasn't here because we have a
short time but we estimate to have eight
point six million dollars of revenue by
the end of 2018 this is by licensing
this technology to different banks
around the world and how many Roma fancy
