noticed that manipulating dates and time
in JavaScript can be quite challenging
sometimes in this video we're gonna talk
about an awesome javascript library
called moment Jes I know one of the most
tedious things to do is displaying dates
to users for example humanization let's
see what moment ideas can do for us with
momento GS we have access to loads of
different formatting options we can also
make a display in a more natural reading
format how long ago a date was out of
the box
momento Jas comes with a lot of
available locales that should cover all
your needs I suggest you check them out
and choose one that best fits your need
now we're in English and now are in
Chinese we even have an Esperanto
support but that's just one of the many
things that moment RGS can do momen has
full support for almost anything you can
think about when it comes to date and
duration parsing manipulating curring
etc it's an extensive and easy to use
library so let's get started now let's
create a simple moment in formatting
let's write our code we're gonna write
for this I'm gonna put the fire date
then we're gonna put our actual date now
we're gonna put var format like and now
we're gonna put the resulting over
moment and we're in after that let's
display our results let's check it out
voila so you see as you have Friday
April 3rd 2015
Congrats let's try to parse that date
and format it I'll let you guys try it
out and I'll see you in the next episode
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
