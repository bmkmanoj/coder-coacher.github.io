first of all here's where you find my
twitter handle it also applies to
Instagram and a kind of a Facebook page
if you have any questions feel free to
tweet me or email me or just follow my
blog I'm a game development evangelist
for Microsoft now who of you has a rough
idea of what a game a valid or of what
an evangelist does two three four one of
you have four and a half one of you I've
told earlier it's essentially like a
real religious evangelist except for
that we do that for technology so we
talk about how awesome it is to use our
technology and obviously we use it
ourselves as well so yeah we believe in
the ways of such an Adela so what I want
to talk about today is windows obviously
then a couple of ways of gaining reach
and monetization and then some game
specifics things and yeah platform
updates essentially yeah I can read the
agenda I'm so awesome at my job who of
you is already using Windows 10 that is
actually surprisingly more than Windows
8 at the same time frame I wonder and
who of you has a rough idea of how the
windows 10 core thing works already very
good to kind of maybe one a half by and
a half so we have one operating system
across all devices we have one developer
platform across all devices called you
it used to be called universal app
platform I think now it's universal
Windows platform we have one store
across all the devices and delivering
innovation on your terms mm-hmm right
and it's still windows hidden by the
update request
so the way it started was the xbox 360
and windows 4.5 7.5 has anyone used
Windows Phone 7 oh by the way I was the
person in the audience with the windows
phone it was cool it was the reason why
I or it was one of the reasons why i
went to Microsoft I had one because you
could collect achievements okay for all
of you German speakers when I was coming
into the old company with that phone I
was from then on only known as the hand
open believes the steam telephone visit
certain that's quite a mouthful anyway
but you see those are very too far apart
and I guess it's quite obvious that the
xbox 360 and the windows phone 7 didn't
have much in common until maybe the 360
started to get the to get rid of this
was the slides then where's Rakhal i
think it was slides and went to the
tiled screen and then moved on to
windows 8 windows phone 8 and Xbox one
the thing is when I was hired at
Microsoft one of my first Jobs was to
create an app for windows 8 and windows
phone 8 and it was said that everything
is so easy you just need to yeah you can
access the same libraries to do this
same stuff and super easy so in reality
that wasn't exactly the case but i guess
it was much easier than it would have
been before it's just that the same
thing what would have been called
completely differently across the
different kernels but the xbox one
especially with 8.1 started to ship with
two Colonels one system is the fully
fledged game system and the other part
is for the apps which is basically
windows 8 colonel so that was the next
step as you can see here called
converged app model maybe you've heard
of the
universal apps the last part but even
that thing was actually two different
apps in the same solution plus a
different a third project called shared
so you can manage your code in a way
that you had the entire back-end code in
the shared folder so you really only had
to write at once and that actually
worked because approximately ninety
percent of the api's were the same for
both systems and you could do the UI
design separately for the two systems
and then you just needed to export to
two different binaries for Windows and
phone and then when I was 10 started and
also got a new edition called windows on
devices there's any one of you playing
around with maker stuff like raspberry
pi or okay so that's essentially it you
can run Windows 10 IOT core for via on a
raspberry pi for example and it's got
the same core it's up on which
everything is built it's got the same
app platform which actually means you
create one binary and you can install it
on all the other systems and that's for
example what I did on Saturday I created
a tiny little game and it worked on the
phone it worked on the my laptop that I
worked on as well as both and the pie
although I learned that a Unity game on
a Raspberry Pi has a performance of a
frame rate of about one or two seconds
per frame but on a minnow board it was
quite awesome and currently Windows 10
is free for everyone 17 and 8.1 so these
are the device families that we have and
that we support that you can use as you
can see I OT is quite hot the mobile
devices with tablets so we've got the pc
and the console and the same binary you
works across all the devices which still
makes you consider design aspects as a
UI pick
as it's like with web pages if you open
a desktop optimized web page on the
phone it's quite horrible especially
when they have this hover things and you
just can't get to that part of the menu
that they really need and then there's
quite a lot of flexibility in terms of
how you can interact with the devices do
you want to use speech like for example
Cortana do you want to have natural user
inputs in terms of just touch or pen or
gestures you have quite a bunch of
options for user interface design does
anyone know what continuum is that is
okay three people have seen the build
presentation continuum is a really cool
feature where you can run excel on your
phone for example and then transmit that
image to TV screen and instead of just
seeing a copy of your phone screen on
the TV it will actually run in desktop
mode so you will see the big desktop
software version well kind of on the TV
rather than just a tiny little screen
where a symbolic image of your phone
astern so about engagement obviously the
cool thing because of the free upgrade
and everything and maybe you've read
about how many installed versions there
are and how many installations per
seconds there i think there's about
don't pin me to that but i think there
was something like thirty installations
or 72 installations per second 30 it was
242 markets so quite a lot of global
reach as well we have mobile billing
operators that is you can have people
pay for your games and in-app purchases
via t-mobile for example which is pretty
cool for those who don't have a credit
card and as for discoverability there is
something called personalized app
recommendations so if I for example open
the store
and then you see optics that are
personalized for me as a person so it
won't be the same for you it won't be
the same for you there are my personal
recommendations that comes through
clever algorithm and also if I search
for paint and I decide that I don't want
to use old ms paint then I can see
suggestions or for apps that i can use
for the store without actually opening
the store so even if i close this so the
store is closed let's search for a
calculator then you see two more app
suggestions and those pop up really
quickly so that's pretty cool also for a
developer when it comes to submitting
your app then try to design the store
information in a way that people can
find yourself and also that it works
with the algorithms yep then of course
because we've got the same kernel we
also have the same store that was one
request that we kept getting over it
over and over again like yeah when can
you just like make the store one for all
platforms that has happened now with a
design and user experience that is
familiar and consistent across all the
devices and the idea is that for example
if you buy your game on the phone that
you can use it on the laptop again and
the universal Windows platform and just
having one binary for the submission
helps a lot with that so yeah a couple
of things that we have in-app
subscriptions that is only subscriptions
are actually knew but what is also new
is a video interstitial ads so you can
add those as well like I said mo
operator billing that is super helpful
especially in emerging markets like for
example in d
yeah and also Thailand has a very strong
windows phone market share as well and
we finally managed to create digital
download codes to help for promotion
everything and you can also share your
achievements and i don't mean the
classic xbox achievements not
necessarily even those but you can also
share your game achievements with others
by simply recording it that works with
any single game it doesn't have to be
from the store it's called game DVR I
could even use it with PowerPoint
because essentially what you do is you
hit the windows G button then it asks
you if you want to open the game bar and
if you say yes my dear powerpoint is a
game it kind of is then you can decide
if you want to take screenshots or do
little video clips and share that even
if it's not a steam game or a game that
you got from a knee from from the zero
so and then you can share on your xbox
calm profile which is pretty cool then
you've got the Action Center yeah cool
but you can also make it more personal
and more engaging and this part is I see
quite interesting because when you get a
text message for example then you can in
the on the phone even in the toast
notification but also in the Action
Center respond to that text without
actually opening the app so right upon
getting the notification you can react
to that that also works with buttons so
you could imagine you have a game that
is pvp and someone says yeah someone is
about to attack you and you offer the
option to raise your defense or to
counter-attack or so from the button
with a premium subscription or whatever
so that's one way to make use of that in
your game and to actually increase the
retention imagine you have that pvt pvp
game
and that person only gets attacked
because he or she hasn't played it in a
while then getting this notification and
this interaction ability then you could
get them back into the game hopefully
this is spotlight this is where you can
get app suggestions I don't have them
right now but essentially it's similar
when you just open the Start screen at
Oak it just suggests a new app for you
to try from the store and this with
Cortana I've already shown you that when
you search for something you can see
some alternate app suggestions that you
might not have installed just yet the
story I've shown you now let's move over
to the gaming part so who of you has an
xbox come on I feel like I feel like an
outsider here this is the new Xbox app
for Windows 10 and yes you get your game
profile and your activity and your
friends and everything but what is
really cool about that is not the DVR
well that too but that does do you guys
know what this might symbolize yes
exactly and that works really smoothly
so you imagine you live with their like
one or two people that were younger than
20 imagine you live with someone else
and you just have one shared TV where
the xbox is attached to an imagined you
want to play a game and someone else
wants to watch TV that is a huge problem
so instead of fighting over the screen
time you could just take out your laptop
boot up the xbox and kinect and then
just play the xbox game on your pc via
the xbox so it doesn't run direct like
you don't install the game on your pc
but it's transmitted and that's pretty
cool
it works very smoothly I tried it with
destiny but yeah of course I have to
test what we are developing for a better
or for worse and now it does work very
smoothly and you can play in your
bedroom while someone else watches TV or
so platform updates yeah like I said you
have the single game and multiple advice
family gigantic is currently doing it
the game they're deploying for Windows
10 and for xbox and they're currently in
beta and you can essentially play on
both and it's cross-platform and
everything so there's that and this is
how the code model looks so you've got
the core this is what i meant earlier
this runs on all all devices and on top
of those devices you see a couple of
yeah bits and bobs and modules that are
on the individual devices and you just
check if this module is present and if
its present then you react to that if
it's not then you just simply leave it
out or you display a message yeah you
need a key words to play this game or so
or you need a camera to the play this
game or an LED light or so and we play
how we support a couple of what's called
programming languages so any C++
developers come on html5 t-shirt okay io
objective-c no one is developing
objective-c wow I see the light the
issue is i just see white light but ok
and any android developers I can see 12
ok so on top of the three native
languages we've released a couple
something called bridges
where you can port your natively coded
abs with the help of these bridges and
one or two more steps to Windows apps so
you don't like you don't need to depend
rewrite everything but instead you just
take the source code run them through
the bridges and do one or two
adjustments that are very well explained
and then you've got your store app boom
then we've got that for old win32
programs we've got that for web apps
android and iOS so there's that and this
is something that I tried out this is
nothing official actually so last
weekend there was a hackathon and my
main job was to support but every once
in a while I got a couple of three
minutes so I did not just work on a tiny
little minigame but also we deployed it
on to a mineral board Max and upon
reaching a certain score we lit up and
led and that worked by adding the
Windows IOT core library by the ways of
creating a plug-in for unity but that
was quite simple once I figured it out
and just applying the game straight to
the middle board and like I said I had
to support the hackathon is a bad it
took us the afternoon and the evening to
get everything done and the way we were
set up was I did the game I get that the
entire unity thing and the unity plug-in
part and a colleague of mine helped me
with the I UT specific function methods
so there's that and it just goes to show
how simple it can be to do it because my
experience with that kind of stuff
before that 0 so yeah just a weekend
just a Saturday actually then it was
mentioned earlier on we've got Direct X
12 which manages the cpu and GPU a lot
better and allows you to create to make
your games more performant better
forming and you can run games even on
less powerful machines but still showing
beautifully so it basically uses the
system a lot better and helps also with
battery life and with frame rates and
everything and if you work with DirectX
12 for the PC then obviously you're
going ahead for Xbox gaming development
already in terms of knowledge I
mentioned this this is the code support
that we support then we've got aside
from Visual Studio the big one for
Windows we've also now released the
Visual Studio code that also runs on
linux and mac also with unity and thanks
to some third-party plugin now also with
debugging support which is also quite
cold and the submission has become a lot
easier compared to prove your hand also
I don't know if you have submitted
something for the Windows Store in
Windows Phone store but the two
experiences the two stores were very
different in terms of yeah design and
flow of interaction and now it's
actually quite straightforward and clear
and we're supported by a cup whole bunch
of middleware things now sends unity 5.2
finally native support for unity as well
and also other things like beginner
friendly things like game maker but also
marmalade which is very C++ heavy so you
can essentially take your pick and work
with unity or JavaScript frameworks or
whatever have you as anyone who is
applied for ID at Xbox ID okay idea xbox
is a service for indie developers to
publish their games on xbox one without
actually going through a publisher so
you don't have to go to electronic arts
or
microsoft studios or yourself to get
your game on to the xbox one there are a
couple of very successful examples like
hashtag i doubt for example who are
already on there but aside from allowing
you to get your game on to the console I
did xbox allows you to make use of the
Xbox Live services on mobile platforms
like tablets mobile phones etc like for
example achievements avatar services and
identity services so you can use the
Microsoft account or the xbox account to
associate with the user and that is
Windows 10 specific as well because
there is a specific SDK that has been
released to make it easier for the
developer to implement these services
yeah and in summary bigger reach rather
than just having the I think now it's
ten percent or so market share of
Windows Phone you also have with the
same app the reach to desktop PCs
laptops tablets running Windows 10 2 &amp;amp; 1
devices Windows 10 IOT devices depending
on what you want to do with them or
hollow lens I don't have one so don't
don't even ask I would like to have one
too and then we can talk about cherry
yeah add this way Xbox Live services and
this way we make it a lot easier for you
guys to port your games or to bring the
existing games or develop new games for
quite a wide range of platforms as well
as people so much for that if you've got
any questions or and want to know about
any specific scenarios or things then
please do reach out to me I can quickly
show the contact slide again and it's
actually quite cool that the restart
thing didn't pop up again anymore
do reach out I'm happy to help and to
point you in the right directions in
terms of how to get Windows 10 features
in their game that's my job after all
