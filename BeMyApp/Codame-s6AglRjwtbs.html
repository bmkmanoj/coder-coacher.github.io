May and we are building CO to my app for
iOS and Android that solves two use
cases for us number one it's streamlines
artists discovery feel a lifelong and
second it enables interactive art over
bluetooth low energy standards it's
doing all of that with design
constraints in mind around like ambien
computing and things like that so all of
these things are possible without people
over taking their phones out of their
pockets and getting torn out of the
experience of being at an art gallery or
event like that I guess it's a good time
for the deaf one else since here's a
piece of art that was made by Micah AKA
scanline one of our code of a featured
artists and when i was the beacon in my
pocket running the app walk over to the
art it can detect i come on Ekans um
that I was around and it changes what
was being displayed now this is just a
proven concept very basic something
changed but once we get this in the
hands of people that are more creative
the sky's the limit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
