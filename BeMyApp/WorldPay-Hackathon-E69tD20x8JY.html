location we have a great partnership
with Indaba here who provide development
skills forests across our platforms and
so Bucharest is is an exciting city and
we know there's some great skills here
we've met some great people this weekend
and I think that on the pins why we
brought the hackathon here from London
where we were previously the well paid
within SDK enables smart devices to make
and receive payments it's so essentially
you can embed a payment agent into a
smart device that allows it to make
payments and devices to receive pain the
reason we wanted to do a hackathon was
because we often have happy thoughts
throughout the year and we just wanted
to try and make a big impact in
Bucharest and it's also a good way of
bringing new talent into wealth a MOBA
car is hoping for a to develop water
within SDK so we're here at the
hackathon as mentors to support the
participants during their work
we assemble the team we didn't knew each
other beforehand we met here and now
we're discussing the architecture of the
application and how we can best use on
one side the IOT devices such as
Raspberry Pi and on the other side the
SDK to provide from wealthy I think the
biggest hurdle is a couple of things
there's gonna be technical hurdles with
the SDK just understanding how it works
and the SDK is very opinionated about
how the RT devices should interface with
each other so how to marry that out with
their idea is going to be challenging I
think once they're over that first
hurdle is they're making sure they
customized it perfectly the second
biggest hurdle I think is going to be
how they get those smart sensors and
they smart buy servos Motors 3d printed
stuff and they're all working together
in a way that's coherent and that you
can actually demonstrate really well and
then the third hurdle is not necessarily
SDK but it's presented these things are
really challenging to condense your demo
and a really cool pitch in for three
minutes I'm really excited about the
marketplace and low pitches but that's
also gonna be a big hurdle I have been
working in the past with my colleagues
but we really hope to get to get product
out because really believe in our idea
and we really believe that this kind of
idea can be used
congratulations to us all
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
