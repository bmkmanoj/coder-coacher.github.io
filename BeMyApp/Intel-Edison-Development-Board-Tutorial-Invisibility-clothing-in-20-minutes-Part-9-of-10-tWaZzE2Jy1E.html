show you how to integrate all the
electronics onto the sweater first we
need to prepare the mattress by placing
the adhesive velcro on their back
then let's move on the so
the velcro on the sweater we take the
second velcro
we take a thread in the needle
crow on to the sweater
we take the mattress for the side
you
now that we sort are six velcros onto
the sweater
we'll need to peer small holes in the
fabric to hide the wires let's look at
where the wires are going to go through
ticket board to protect the sweater and
start cutting delicately
now we need a hole through pass to the
wires
we don't see any wires anymore from this
side you do the same on every single
side
so now we have pierced holes for each of
the matrix
as well as the front pocket surpass the
wires through
now we have to take the LED strips and
we start with the top you pass the wires
through the hole
and we put in the velcro straps we do
the same
with the two other LED strips
we now have three strips that are well
placed
now we're going to turn the sweater over
to reach the inside of the sweater
now we are going to link the wires to
each other
now that the wires are linked to each
other we're going to have to plug them
you
you plug this wire
and we passed it to the pocket
now we're going to turn the sweater over
again
now that the sweaters is right side up
we can see the wires here
we are going to connect everything to
the Arduino and to the battery so let's
start with the power supply the red wire
on the plus
let's screw it
the other on the negative
we connect the last two wires to the
Arduino we put them one on the gnd and
the other on the six you put everything
in the pocket and think of putting the
battery in the bag anti explosion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
