episode of one of our webinars in my app
I'm Fernanda and once again it's a
pleasure having you all here we are
accompanied by Anthony Chava Nia from
sick parks will be introducing us to the
l pwan and i'll tea and with that I
didn't want to let you guys know again
if you guys are new to here and you guys
want to have more information about our
future webinars and other type of
hackathons or whether it's webinars and
events you can just check it out at our
community
matcom there you can register to know
about next webinar next hackathon and
with that I want to present you guys too
as I mentioned Anthony Charboneau he's
from safebox
he has to show us about wireless
communication so Anthony it's all yours
yeah so thanks thanks everybody so I'm
gonna show my screen right now we're
gonna see my amazing laptop
yeah so that's better
so can you can you see me well can you
see old everything well correct okay so
hi everybody so I meant Tony from sick
 Ananda said my job at sick fox is
to handle all the start appellations so
from the program we've caught up so
basically we helped them to go to
prototype to go to market from
incubators partnership because we
partners is the best incubator in IOT in
Europe to actually help them to build a
sick fox products to basically you know
ending also a startup program online
where we you know welcome startup and we
give them a lot of information to build
sick fox etc so that's my job at cig Fox
and one of them is actually also to to
do to is kind of talks so this is a very
first for me usually I'm actually used
to have somebody in front of me so this
is a first one so nobody will actually
laugh at my crack a joke in front of me
that's actually that's actually better
so so we'll stop by the the basics of
sick fox because people hear about sick
fox a lot but we realized that actually
nobody knows what it is in your life so
what
is sick Fox it's a we actually created
some a market called the LP one market
and what it means is that it's a
low-power wide area network pocket and
you know it's so basically ultra-low
power and column range it's written in
its name and let's know what what we do
we do our own network we deploy it with
partners etc but we actually do in our
own dedicated IOT network and we are a
network provider that's really important
to understand as I said we are a network
provider we don't sell chips we don't we
don't build solutions we don't do that
we invented a radio protocol and we need
to deploy our own network something
important to understand as well is that
we deploy a global network so it means
that everywhere in the world where you
have SiC Fox coverage your device not
gonna work the same and you're gonna get
the same coverage and it's important to
know because when you know for example
roaming doesn't exist anymore the sick
Fox Network as you know has to be global
so if I want you to remember four things
tonight it will be these four first that
sick Fox is global reach I think as I
said again it's one network it will work
quite the same everywhere we'll talk
about the differences in the Indian with
frequency etc but regarding the network
and how it works
what's the same everywhere it was built
for energy efficiency and this is really
important because if you want to empower
real IOT as it needs to to go yeah you
need to have devices which can be
autonomous up for years like we are
devices on our network which can go up
to ten years of battery life completely
autonomously and in order to do that we
needed to invent something completely
new because we couldn't rely on existing
technology like Bluetooth or GSM
whatever it consumes way too much and
this is why we had to invent our own you
know technology to make it happen so for
third really important point with sick
foxes but it's really cost-effective and
there is different reasons for that the
first one is that as it's really really
long run
we don't need a lot of base stations to
cover a country so for example France we
only have 1500 base stations to cover
the whole country and it can actually
appear to be a lot but when you think
about it it's actually really few and
that's why it actually costs not so much
money to cover a country the second part
of cost is actually hardware
you know because doing sick fox hardware
is actually cheap we are using
transceivers which are on the market six
years and we are making we are making
them compatible with Fox Network but you
don't need a cig Fox chip in the chip
which is compatible with us but we are
existing chip on the market would
actually do that and we'll talk about
that later
and the fourth point which is really
important for cig Fox is simplicity
because we've six locks
each turn out of the box experience
there is no peering there is no
Bluetooth setup there is no Wi-Fi said
that there is nothing you just put the
battery on you make it - and it just
works so this is the magic part of it
and when we do our workshop with the
Arduino board etc this is the magic
trick and this is really really
important to know so of course as I said
if you want to have billions of devices
you needed to you know create a new
technology for it and as we did it will
create new used case that was not
invented before here are some of them
you know as when you can read as much as
I can so we're talking about
fire-starting you know sensors we are
talking about you know predictive
maintenance with Z as a washing machine
for example whereas the washing machine
will know when it's behaving badly and
will transmit some data to actually warn
your maker say eh I'm actually going bad
please change this piece so that's very
important you know wealth connected
trashes for example which seem
completely stupid but when you think
about it I mean knowing if the trashes
are is full or not will help you to
optimize all your travels to pick them
up
and will actually optimize to actually
know what you need to go where or not so
it's very very important one use case
which is also key which sig Fox's asset
management and GPS use case
it's because with Zig Fox you can have
GPS trackers which can go up to yours in
battery life you put a chip a tracker on
a really expensive assets that you have
it can be a vehicle it can be you know
like a pallet it can be whatever you
always know where it is and it provides
a lot of value to it
enormous amount of people so how to
communicate with sick fox it's actually
very simple and it's dead simple the
first is the most important is to detect
something interesting to send and this
is all spot
what sensor do you want to use what GPS
position do you want to know so
basically what do you want to send with
the sick fox network this is where you
put your value the second part is to
power up the communication module so it
can be considered a module it can be a
system-on-chip whatever all the way is
compatible in sig fox network the third
is that you send it with this module the
next step is that it's picked up by our
antennas which are in the countries and
the last step is that when it's picked
by these antennas we actually will give
it back to your to your home server will
push it to you when important pot to
note here is that it's it's not our data
when you send that I will check for
network it's yours we never know what's
going on in your payload and we don't
want to know it's your data you're the
owner and we don't use it we never do so
how hard it is to be completely honest
that's that simple you just send an
eighty command so in a tension frame
it's really normal it's one line of code
in my example I'll do later it's gonna
be a couple but it's very very simple
and once it's done you have to go on our
server on our back-end to set up a call
back an HTTP request which will talk to
your own server to actually get these
data back because this is nice to
actually to do some data with your
device but you want to be able to pick
them up to use them and then so that's
what you do with the HTTP request on our
own server so the core concept behind it
very very important well here are some
figures so as I said it was really
designed for energy efficiency and we
is the most important part of sig Fox if
you want to understand sick folks you
have to understand the concept of a
device which is 99% of the time
completely asleep so sick foxes is
actually done for device which are only
waking up one you know 10 seconds every
10 minutes to send a message and then it
go back to sleep and this is how you can
save battery and make a device go to a
10 years of battery life if the device
is also well always listening for a
message or something it will not go up
you know that last and then the value is
done so this is what we did and here are
the figures of how much it consumes when
it's actually sending data so it's 20 to
35 milli amperes during the transmission
so it's a couple of seconds and it's 25
milli watts and 14 DB folder when you
guys amongst us and as I said the key is
another conception because as I said the
only way is going to be asleep for most
of the time so this is where you need to
get in bed fly one yeah the key concept
to chick foxes out of the box as I said
it's very very easy it has to be easy
for the user so there is no
configuration no tearing no
signalization nothing so the device just
worked out of the box here the network
is here to serve the device so basically
your device has to send data the data is
going to be picked by our antennas and
then we'll end up at but your device
only has to send data and don't and it
doesn't have to do something else you
just need to send data which is very
important for consuming really really
low power one thing important is also is
that it's actually picked up by several
base stations so we don't communicate
with only one base station it could be
accurately could create a problem when
you're out of range or something so with
sig Fox when you send a message it's
gonna be picked up by all the bases
which are around and this is up to us to
deduplicate that message to sends a good
version to you so very long range as I
said one key is actually yes it's really
really long range and I'm estimating it
when I'm talking about it so basically
you know these radio waves can go really
and sometimes it's a bit magical for me
to be completely honest and it's really
really dependent topography but invest
based case scenario I got yesterday I'm
morning a text message from one of my
startup telling me that is a station was
picked up 200 kilometres from there with
an antenna so you know you can you know
of course you can't expect that in in
all the use case it cetera but we have
some really various case where these
kind of radio waves can go to this kind
of distance this is ideal case when it's
line-of-sight and it's really like an
oval area etc in reality what we can see
more is that in cities for example you
can have few kilometers of range which
is fair so for example we are in Paris
you can expect few kilometers of French
and in the countryside you can express
you can expect tens of kilometers like
50 or 60 kilometers as I said it I lead
depends on topography because it's radio
waves so it's balancing on buildings etc
so it's really depending on topography
in your your neighborhood one important
thing is to understand that it actually
works in though sig Fox works really
well in door and I'm gonna showcase that
you demo in the end so yeah it will
endure but it's not magic you can
actually guess from your phone for
example that you get a lower reception
when you're inside when you're outside
outside this is the same for sig Fox
it's it's it's radio wave so it's not
magic and so we are applying the same
physicals what we can do on outside to
make it work even better is to be sure
that you have full coverage and that
your device is working really great etc
but yeah you have to understand it works
really well in door but it's not magical
so we listen even if you look at
internet we'll see a really lot of crap
7c Cox because we don't know what they
talk about but our protocol is be
directional so it's it means that the
device can send a message to the cloud
but the cloud can also send a message to
the device so it's really be directional
we use uplink and downlink messages but
with a particular issue of sig foxes
that
both of these communication have to be
initiated by the device itself so even
if you want to talk to the device it's
the device itself has to ask for an
update
instead of pinging him directly so
basically if you want to if you would
like to update your device you would
have to wait at your devices you know
pick up the network before to be able to
talk to her
due to the device and it's it's a bit
it's a it can be limitation sometimes
but for most of the use case it's
actually better because we you save a
lot of energy not to listening to the
you know to the environment so much so
many times yeah so I've said a lot of
really good things since the beginning
it's it's actually looks like magic but
it's not - in order to do all these
things we have some limitations and to
be honest it's actually it's kind of
great because for what we do with IOT
use case this is actually enough so you
could actually send 12 bytes with a cig
Fox Network a message so 12 bytes is for
example it's - GPS coordinates so let's
do it plus magnitude so it's a lot of
different case it's so you can fit a lot
of message in 12 points you can send
seven message per hour so of all it's
the same but in other terms you can send
140 message today I wanted to put the
limit of seven message an hour because
we explain to people normally you can
send one message every 10 minutes with
zigge fox but if you want to send five
message in a row in five minutes you can
but you have to shut your device down
for 55 minutes so the community of how
much you send data is per hour and if
you if you understand quite well that
the technology actually can can go way
more than seven minutes per hour this is
not technology limited it's because we
have to comply with the local rules of
radio you know frequency and so that's
why we can only go for seven minutes at
an hour the technology itself can go 200
bits per second so if you you know if we
would be continuously sending message we
can
way more than 12 bytes and when more
than seven minutes an hour so yeah so
this is what I was mentioning so I know
payload example GPS coordinate is these
bytes temperature can be to bite a state
is only one a whole bit ordered
Christian update request can be zero
because the message itself is a message
so you don't mean any more bite so
that's that's very important and one
message that we really want you to send
to to developers is that you know the
shortest your message will be the more
battery you will have so we are
challenging application developer and
device makers to make very sick folks
messages as small as we can because we
don't feel up the message with zero so
if for example your message is one byte
of course there is a reason you have
your payload and very something you know
around it to make it understandable by
using Fox Network but we won't fill it
with zeros it means that when you send
it's going to take less time and then
you're going to consume less battery so
we challenge every time as we can
- device makers to make it as small as
possible and this is an example of
payload that you know was explaining a
bit before and this is the attention
frame that you can see at the bottom so
about the low cost pots so first why is
it low-cost first for subscription fees
as I said it's a network which cost
using so much money to deploy and to to
maintain so that's how we can actually
make few you know really low secretion
fees you also have a very short software
development cycle as I said it takes a
couple of lines Suzanne cig Fox it's
very easy of course there is some
mastering to do etcetera and it's not as
you know straightforward sometimes it
should but it's very easy to understand
it's very easy to do usually when we do
our workshops in a couple of minutes
people already sent the first message
and I understand how it works it cetera
one important part again is the you know
outward components parts because when
you do millions of devices we have to be
very cheap
and this is where sick fox is really
good because we actually are we have an
open hardware approach where everybody
can do a sick fox chip we actually
provide the sick fox tag for free and
everybody we do transceivers SOC or
whatever they can integrate this tackle
free so for example right now we have
t.i we have at me answer me we have a
lot of different transceiver maker in
SOC maker using doing sig fox and when
you can actually play the competition to
get lower price for millions of devices
and this is really important when you do
one you want to do millions of devices
you need competition to provide
different type of chips so a big point
is security and I'm gonna introduce this
slide by saying that Security's always
in everyone going efforts we will never
say that security is checked that's
completely wrong so that's that's
important to say but on the other side
sig Fox is actually pretty secure for a
lot of stuff we saw but by default the
payload is not encrypted in the in the
end you run the radio part so we don't
encrypt data when it's going on the fly
but it's all it's up to the customer to
do it depending on how kritis how
critics is he and you know see in the
use case so we actually you know if the
use case is very very very security we
really say to them to secure security
and to to to encrypt it's depending on
what I want to do vary of course message
can be encrypted or scrambled so if you
don't need a really really high level of
security we can scramble your message
because if you can if somebody can look
at it in not understand what it means
let's release something so a good part
about six of six fox of course is there
is no pisac channel network there is
nothing no end shank etc so you come
listen to keys on the network this is
very important to understand and we also
are very strong against message
repetition man-in-the-middle attack all
of this kind of you know attacks are
very very well very covered with thick
fox
so radio properties this is really
important and I'm saying that at every
slide but because everything is
important but yeah this is something
which we are really happy about is that
we are really really really high
tolerance wind surfers and what it means
it means that you can't really jam a
stick Fox network with with normal means
so for a of course if you wanted to do
Jam sick Fox you could with millions of
euros of equipment but for today for
example you could buy a free G jabber on
the market you can go on Alibaba buy a
Fuji jammer and jam a whole network for
a whole you know but building or
something like that which sig Fox is not
possible and not what you actually the
means of everybody and this is actually
creating a lot of useless for us because
we are very security very tolerant
twenty purpose and again you know
interception of messages how actually we
und because we we are sending message of
different frequency and we are using a
technology called ultra-high band so
this is actually made for it and this is
why we are very very hot to intercept so
this is one use case in security so I
was mentioning what we are really really
help to jab so this is a very really
famous company in security they are
doing housing security basically they
are the you know alarms in their houses
working on 3G and 4G and so they what
they realize that people will we're
going into the houses with 3G and
Phrygia and forty jammers and jamming
completely the network so we are ready
with the alarm systems where sometimes
not you know not going through and it
was a problem because when a robbed
while the implemented which sick is
that every time they actually can see we
can understand there is a jammer next to
him so where we can see there is no
digital network anymore then we are
sending a sick first message to send
alerts and the sick fox massage we
actually will go through the jammer
not a problem so the sick Fox here is
used as a backup solution if they think
there is a jammer in the into the house
an interesting fact with this case is
that with the open world out we're
approach here we were able to use
existing out where to maintain made it
the sig Fox compatible so because we had
chips which are compatible with our
frequency we have the at the antennas
etc so we just upgraded over here we are
all the oddware and they made it sig Fox
compatible
thanks to these open other approach that
we have so here I'm not going to stay
that long because I'm not a really
really good in radio but the first one
you can see is UNB is what we use and as
you can see yet you know the signal of
UNB goes through the interfere and
that's still why you can see the message
even with interference when you can see
that the spate spectrum technology then
you actually will miss a part of the
major message and then you will actually
have more problems to to actually solve
it so then you'll turn 11 parts which is
what we are basing our technology on I'm
not going to spend a long time here but
I wanted to showcase to you what is
radio and what it looks like so
currently we are listening to a 200
kilohertz part of the spectrum we are
not listening to the whole band that
which could be good because it's for us
for now is useless we already have way
more capacity than we actually can but
we are producing so it's actually way
more than enough and every sick fox
message is one with hertz wide so what
does it mean it means that so this is
what the spectrum looks like on our own
base stations so you can see from the
left you know numbers 860 8.34 to the
numbers on the right 868 26 this is 200
kilohertz that you are listening to and
this is how a shared like the show
spectrum looks like you know you can see
it's not perfect you can see other
people are using it the spectrum is a
bit dirty and so our UNB technology can
allow us to to actually recognize this
message in this mess even when it's
really really heavily used by others so
what what the sig Fox message looks like
and you can see on these slides
three little dots in the you know the
back you know you can see free
repetition because basically every sick
fox message when we send a message it's
repeated three times you can't see it
yourself but this is how the protocol
works so yeah you can see there's a few
repetition here so make it a bit bigger
for you without the three lines but you
can see you in with the wrong thing
around and this is what the sick
message looks like so about the
frequencies so we are using and that's
why we could actually below all Network
we are using free and unlicensed
frequency there's a good thing about
that is that they are free there's a bad
thing about that is that they are shared
you have to share with everybody using
it so might be radiometers might be over
computer competitive technology etc so
you have to be able to pick your message
amongst this mess this is very important
to do and of course when you are using
this free band you have to respect some
rules because you don't want to
overflowed the free band and so you have
to be compliant with the ad se rule in
Europe so it's it's linked to the 868
meters frequency and in the USA it's a
different frequency
so it's 9:02 and this is why I said
earlier that the network works exactly
the same everywhere but your device if
it's in the US or if it's in Europe yes
to it you know it has to to be able it a
bit differently it has to know what it's
on a different frequency so it can be
exactly the same hardware but it has to
send on a different frequency which is
completely doable and we already have
some devices which can do both so other
solutions again we are using this open
agua approach we are working with you
know established partners like Admiral
Texas Instruments ty labs XM a team
telecom design and a lot of them you
know so they do different things for
example at me I'll do a system on chip
which compatible sick foxy I does a
transceiver compatible cig Fox telecom
design those really famous modules for
cig Fox at see me as the
also do modules tell it also axiom does
the soccer system and chip as well so as
you can see there was a lot of people
doing different stuff and it's really
really good for the device makers
because we can choose between different
kind of technology they want to use it
might be a module because it's really
really fast to start it can be an SOC
because it's way way cheaper so it's
very depending on how much device you
want to produce and how much you want it
span on it I mean it's very depending on
you and the good thing about having
multiple providers that you can do
whatever you want you can truly within
them which can be interesting to you is
how to prototype and the good news here
is that we have a lots of prototyping
roads we have Arduino balls we have rasp
eyeshield we have AB no kids I mean we
have a lot of different ways to talk
with sick folks they are very easy to
start with but please don't go
introduction without don't go in
production with an Arduino board
I just don't it's really good to prove
type but it's not made for it it
consumes way too much power etc and when
you lose the whole value of having sick
folks so please if you want to do your
production don't go we want we know one
important part to sick folks is the
antenna because it's radio Saroyan's
it's very the reason for it so you know
it varies it really a lot of different
forms with actually antenna so you can
remember 15 years ago but your phones
that are really really thick antennas on
the top and then it moved to you know
antenna injury in the phone itself etc
when it's exactly the same form
connected objects so you know you can
see objects which needs to power a lot
which need to be really deep in the
ground and they're under the ground etc
this one need really high antenna like
really big antennas but for really small
device that actually are outside etc or
even indoor for example you can have
watches you know you can have antennas
which fits in watches for example so
it's really help to you and depend what
you want to do if you don't know how to
do an antenna please ask somebody don't
screw a project because you've said Oh
antenna is easy and I'm going to do it
self no never works always fails so
please if you don't know go ask somebody
and antenna is always a balance between
the design and the performance as I said
if you want the best performance john
tena is gonna do it's gonna look bad
it's gonna be a big big big antenna and
because you are very deep in the ground
if you want to you know an antenna which
fits in a watch of course you need to
bit smaller and then you have a little
bit less performance so it's really a me
you know it's a it's a choice between
close coverage because everything is
really good but where does it work so
our coverage is actually alive it's on
it's online its online we are so
officially and we are maintaining it so
you can see that we are fully deployed
in a lot of countries like Spain
Portugal France Belgium Netherlands so
Ireland is coming really fast Italia
Italia is being very fast as well just
public is going very fast as well UK we
are deploying it right now Germany we
are deploying it right now we're going
to announce stuff in the coming months
Denmark is deploying right now we are
also deploying it in the US which is a
very small country so it's not gonna
take a while
now it's gonna take a bit more time to
cover us but it's all plan to do so so
we'll do this week we announced as well
as really small country called Australia
and another one called New Zealand so
basically this one up gonna be covered
with you know there are starting this
year and we are going to finish next
year we also announced Oman which is a
country in the Middle East so and very
the good thing with deployment is that
we learn during the process how to
deploy faster and faster so for example
in Portugal we are already proud of
saying that they deployed the whole
country by in two months so it's very
very impressive to see and in Ireland
the coverage that you can see was made
in four months or something like that so
if you know how to deploy in an economic
going wave sick is gonna go very
fast so yeah this week update was
Australia New Zealand so I really hope I
can do event here
and to finish some of the use case we
have right now in production so just to
let you know one important part about
the six fox news case is that you know
it's IOT right now when you look at the
press etcetera it's all about the sexy
stuff the watch is the gadgets etc but
actually the biggest part of the money
which will be made in the future in IOT
is the stuff which is completely
invisible to you it's the stuff which is
not sexy at all but which makes a lot of
value from what it makes so I couldn't
find I couldn't find less sexy than what
a metering it's basically a water meter
that you put on your water consumption
and it will tell to your to your
provider how much you consume per day as
stupid as well but when you remove the
need to have some value go to your place
to do it by hand and to actually annoy
you every time etc so really small
device domed but which make creates a
lot of value well a lot of use case in
the silver economy as well so single
economy is economy with like you know
elderly people here you can see a box
with it's a completely autonomous box
and all right so it's completely
autonomous box and and we will actually
help people going it the last one is
smart parking of course so this is
really really important a lot of smart
parking use case right now and so yeah
so this one actually has a lot of
success every time we showcase it
it's connected beer and what does it do
is that its plaintiff maintenance
basically it will tell you if the beer
is always cold and more importantly it
will analyze how it behaves and if there
is any sign of the built up going down
it's going to send a message to the
viata provider and say hey I need some I
need a piece and the change of some some
peace in me please comment and change
that and then you know it's a built up
maker it doesn't sell you built up
anymore he sells you a service or vengan
having a built up which is always
running
you're never going to lose a night
anymore and this is important to
understand the kind of services that you
want to build on top of this kind of
dumb
message in your devices
we also have connected pallets as I said
as management is a really really big
part of sea-cocks
tracking where are you goods are et
cetera we have connected beehives so a
lot of few scales around bees don't ask
me why actually there is a huge market
for its it's a basically a scale which
weights how many how oh maybe it isn't
cetera and this this message through sig
Fox network we also working in lot in
agriculture services we nuts start up
doing a ikq sensor captures this one is
French as well very famous because we do
outdoor GPS trackers so for outdoor
extreme activity like you know hot files
and and outdoor skiing free do freestyle
skiing etc where sometimes you know you
need a device to work for a few days and
still working with GPS that's very
important so it basically tells your
family where you are every time and it
makes you safe when you go alone in you
know trailing etc so this one is as well
with the French the French post office
so it's basically a button in your
mailbox where you push when you want to
send something so you go to your own
mailbox if you want to send a package
you put that button and the post guy
will pick the box up in your whole milk
box and ship it for you connected trash
as I said very important because you can
optimize a lot of stuff in the in series
with where and yeah last one it's about
the Sig Fox foundation in the use case
we've made about it and so we wanted so
when we learnt the foundation couple of
months ago the idea behind it was to
showcase to people but IOT was not only
about gadgets it can actually save lives
and this is what we did with the
foundation so they actually put two base
stations on the Belgium
station in Antarctica so in a way where
you have researchers so two base station
on the Ithaca and they gave 14
GPS trackers to all researchers on the
on the base and now they've actually
loved it
because now every time they go outside
of the station they know where
everybody is if they have a problem they
just have to press a button and
somebody's going to pick them up etc and
he's provided my security that they
couldn't get before and we we are will
showcase the results of this later this
month
but the feedback from the researchers is
amazing and it actually allowed them to
go to do way more but they could before
and for us it was just you know GPS
trackers like which are 50 euros each so
it's not a big big investment but for
them it's a huge huge advancement
loyalty is way more than just get it and
so this was the first mission with a
foundation the second one will be about
saving animals in Africa so we probably
will work with rhinos in Africa and one
of the our next we'll be saving
fishermen with connected lifejackets so
I think what's gonna be it's because I'm
not gonna be in more details the cloud
part will be completely useless for you
as you haven't started what I can do is
showcase you a demo so Fernando while
you sit here and oh yeah okay so and I'm
gonna showcase Arduino now okay so I
wanted to showcase you how easy it is to
do a cig Fox so you can see my Arduino
you know ID easier and what I'm going to
do so you can't see it but I ever not
win about Whitney with me so maybe I can
actually I know I can't so anyway so
this is my Arduino code I'm gonna upload
it to my to my Arduino board we've sick
with sick Fox on it so it's imploding
yep
where is sorry I need to know okay I
lost my I lost something so I need to
open the sick Fox back-end can you still
see my my desktop correct right now we
see the browser okay perfect
so the device I'm actually using
is this one it's the one D 7f E and so
you can see that I just you know
uploaded the sketch and it's already
it's actually already communicated on it
so just to show you something so I mean
I'm at home so I'm indoor in Paris and
you can see that this is all the base
station which picked up my message so
it's around 20 of them or something like
that so if I want you have to showcase
something to you so where all the base
station which picked up to mine my
message I can do it with really neat
tool with it so we saw all the base
station which actually picked me up from
my from my place in Paris so you can see
that it goes really really fun actually
and just to showcase you to show you
that I'm not lying I'm going to show you
actually change some stuff in the crowd
of Arduino and just to show you that I'm
not actually the liar and I'm doing that
live so I just changed the message that
you said I played it uploaded the new
you know code on my Arduino board so now
it should say the new message I'm going
to wait
yeah yeah and here it is so now I have
one two three four cafe which is data
that is sent and modified and as you can
see it took less than one second to
actually show K is here and I was picked
by let's try again how many base
stations picked my message this time 16
so yeah if anything we've radio voice is
that you can see that there is a base
stations in your cell G Pontoise which
picked my message when I actually did
even the cameras at south south of Paris
so you can see that when you way
sometimes are kind of funky so so yeah I
mean from my side I think that would be
it maybe we can go to two questions now
we see that it works and there and yeah
red by the way I'm indoor so for people
who don't believe that sick fox works in
though I have 16 base stations with
prove you the opposites so so yeah so
maybe we can go on the YouTube page to
see the comments definitely okay so
let's start off with the first question
is um what are the advantages of
drawback
what are the advantages and drawbacks of
say Fox technology compared to Lola okay
so so if I want it to be nasty I would
say that we are the network still they
don't know I mean we all really have to
understand that it's very very different
loja is technology made for private
networks and it's really good if you
want to deploy your own network with
your own antennas etc it's it's it's
made for that when sig Fox is really
made for public use case when you want
to use how you know when you don't want
to care as infrastructure by yourself we
provide a service not a technology we
provide the service of you know you send
a message on our network and we are
going to provide it back to you on your
web on your web server on know how you
have to handle everything by yourself
and build everything by yourself
and build your own private network so
it's a very very diff
and thing and we serve a service they
sell a technology so it's very different
if you want to compare sick folks
against Laura on the technology side you
can see that disc 91 comm did a very
very good analysis on how it how easy it
is to do devices etc even the guy is
using sick fox and law since a long time
so if you want just to look about the
technology side please go on on this 91
that come watch blog where he has a very
good analysis about it okay our second
question is what about security
if messages from the device are being
broadcast and everybody can spy on
devices sorry this question is what
about security if the messages from the
devices are being broadcast then
everybody can spy on devices can't they
no actually so so it's a very stooped to
unscrew this to get first you have to
understand that indeed these are the
paid out of the message is all not
encrypted by default if the use case has
to be secure we actually say to the
people and you encrypted so to today
most of the use case which shall require
security are all encrypted on sick fox
it's very easy to do etc so you know
most of the use case are encrypted now
of course it's radio like everybody like
every other technology you could listen
to the air but then you have to
understand a lot of stuff that you can't
understand right you know you have to
understand who is talking which device
is talking you know what is it saying
because usually message are scrambled
you have you you so there is a lot of
different stuff that you have to
understand to actually understand what
the message means so even if you are
able to listen the 0 and the ones on the
air which you could do then it's another
matter to actually understand what they
mean to actually use it when there is
another thing is that as I said we have
really really quite protected against
man-in-the-middle attacks so if you
wanted to be able to repeats in your
message so listen to a message and do
not even understand what it means but
youuuu with you you tree ah sorry you
listen to it and you want to be twins
again then you can't do that because all
survey will actually look at the message
and said it's completely for it's
completely wrong because we have some
ashmac security issues as also ashmac
security systems which will tell you
that's not a good message so there is a
and there is a lot of answer to that I
content fear about security in one
minutes it's security is way too wide
and here we are only talking about the
radio protocol security when actually
security is from the radio device itself
to the overall cloud platform etc so
it's there is no easier answer to that
and I'm not going to be able to read in
two minutes but if you want to talk
about that please come to me I'm
completely open on Twitter etc please
come to me okay our next question is um
it would be awesome to get some coverage
in Berlin but people just are trying it
out Berlin so I don't it yeah I come
yeah I don't talk so much but we have
some coverage in Munich since a long
time actually Germany is one target for
for this year we announced that we got
coverage in Berlin very very soon
we did a PR I think it was in February
about Germany we have some guy we have
some people already there
so you can expect having coverage in
Berlin quite soon
I don't even yeah I concentrate more
than that but if you want to know when
exactly please come to me I have some
news for you okay our next question is
where can we test the connected beer
service haha you have to come to Mum wc2
for that
sorry yet so we added on the boost at
MWC and I don't know why but it's what
it was a demo who had the most success
ever reason only why yeah
our next question is can I use sick
parts for OTA over-the-air updates for
firmware update yeah of course you can
if your firmware is less than 8 bytes so
no you can't the obvious answer is no
you can't update your message with cfox
it's not made for that what
what usually my customers do is that
they implement different modes in the
device itself and they use a downlink to
change this mode so for example if you
realize that you're sending way too much
data or that you need to send different
data etc they use the Domenic mode to to
change the mode of the device this is
how it's used basically some of the some
others are using for example USB cables
to do updates or Bluetooth very light on
just once to do an update and they shut
it off after that so so yeah there is
different ways to do that it's not
perfect but for now what we have is
works quite well ok next question is who
establishes the transmission limit the
stake for transceiver or the apt module
so the ATP modules so but basically who
establish the connection is the device
itself the device itself is broadcasting
a message to everybody and the antenna
are listening to it that's important to
understand you know this is not the
antenna will say to the device I put you
on this channel etc now the device wakes
up send his message and go back to sleep
so the device only does what it needs to
do and then we weave all Network ensure
that you get care for you your message
gets acquired I don't know if I answer
the question but I hope I did okay and
currently our last question is is the 6
volt is the sick box communication
hundred percent 100% safe other ACK is
after each transmitted frame or how does
it work so ok so you mean if if every
message is is acknowledged so no but you
can do it by yourself so for example we
have a use case where the device I have
to know if the message was received or
not and so what they do is that they
send a message with a dominic request
and so basically they use a downlink as
an acknowledgement of the networks ok
because is the network pick up the
message
and sent a response it means that it was
picked up so this is a way to do it but
know every tick box message is not
acknowledged very simple reason for that
first because you know we don't want it
it's gonna be it could be an infinite
loop
you know the server could send an
acknowledgment the device could send a
backpack it would be a bit of a mess and
actually I have with sick fox we we have
essays so quality service you know okay
so we insure you but we are your the
message it's gonna all gonna be picked
up by Hydra 99% of the time or something
like that so you're gonna trust the
network to be picked and this is
important so there is one last trick
that people use as well is that each
message as you as a special number so if
you actually will realize that you
missed one one frame then you you you
will see it on your back end and you
will receive an alert and say a the one
from was one message was not received
and maybe in this way you could ask the
device to send it back so this is a lot
what this is what GPS track some of the
GPS trackers are doing okay and we have
one more question do device providers
have to implement specific sake parks
capability on their connected objects
and how to recognize them so yes if they
do if I want to do a device with sick
fox they have to take care about it
there is a way there is really different
metals to do it either and you can take
a module which are very easy to
implement and buoyed by telecom design
or tele toss up like that you you you
talk of it with 80 commands so it's very
easy to do it's really couple of lines
of code but when it's a bit more
expensive so that's the thing and
afterwards if you want to go cheaper and
smaller you can go to system on chips or
transceiver
but then you have to integrate it
yourself and it's a bit more complex but
we have already some some French start
up doing sick fox enabled devices you
can look at you know capture CAA urs
captures comm
you can look at Co assist which is now
crowdfunding it's the first watch
collectivistic Fox in GPS for elderly
people
be able to track them when you know if
they are lost or something so we already
have some really good consumer device
using chick fox in which implemented
it's quite not easily but we implemented
it in a short timeframe ok the next
question is what about price how much
does it cost
a device subscription so first I didn't
say it but consumers won't be allowed
and one being able to buy 6 lakhs so
it's really the device manufacturer
would provide the connection with the
device so it's not subscription
subscription model well you you as a
consumer you would be able to buy it so
it's comes out as device and for now
what we say is that it's the most
expensive part of the price grid is if
you take for example you know couple of
devices and you want them to send a lot
of messages so the maximum messages per
day is gonna cost you one euro per month
Padilla's but then there is at the
extreme opposites of the price grid if
you want to send one or two message
today and what you want and you want to
buy millions of devices with two sick
fox
if the gonna cost it's going to cost you
less than 1 euro per year per device so
of course there is some you know some
inside you know some some other thoughts
on to this price plate and I'm on
purpose not giving it completely exactly
because it's under NDA but yeah this is
a price but you can expect some sick fox
if you want to do millions of devices
few messages less than 1 euro per year
per device ok and or that question is
you feel confident about six parts
feature it's six parts against the rest
of the lower Alliance and why so you
know I was working for five years at
Intel before I had an amazing job and I
still went to sick fox
so that's I think the best you know true
that's the best piece of trust I can
actually put that is that I trusted so
much that I left my dream job to go to
sick fox to do it to do an even better
one so yes I believe sick fox is going
really well
the momentum we're seeing is amazing we
are deploying networks faster and faster
we are I mean
so I end all the started doing sick Fox
and I can tell you we have a lot and a
lot of requests to do it now it goes
faster also to develop product it goes
cheaper with Atmel system-on-chip
i mean yeah it goes really really well
and again I mean Aloha Alliance it's not
a big problem I mean they deployed
private networks and we depart to big
ones
that's that's not a big problem from
what I understand they still are rolling
I mean that's not not a big problem for
us all right like a boss let me just
check the questions okay sounds good
sounds good and by the way if you have
any questions please I'm available on
Twitter so where is my Twitter account
it's here so it's a underscore a and th0
underscore so this is me with my crappy
picture and this is my my twitter handle
so if you need anything let me know I'm
gonna answer to that my email address is
on tony toponi at 6:40 a.m. if you need
anything let me know as well we'll be
really glad to help you with everything
we are working a lot with makers as well
with developers doing a lot of Arduino
showcase etc once again yesterday in
Portugal to do some workshop with
Arduino to engineer the dresser if you
want to know more about how to do cool
stuff if sig Fox please let me know
alright so just wanna say again
Thank You Anthony take it to the entire
sayfox basically program for letting us
do this webinar everyone else if you
have any other questions or if you want
to find out more information as I
mentioned you can always just register
on our community so that's community in
my app calm and with that I say if it's
evening for you have a good evening
and have a good day everybody so Cheers
and I've a good day everybody and
enjoyed it see ya bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
