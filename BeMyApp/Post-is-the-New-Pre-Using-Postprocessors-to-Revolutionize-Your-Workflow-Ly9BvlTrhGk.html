app webinar will be starting in a bit so
once again learning in a bit so just
make sure everybody's right
hi ladies and gentlemen and welcome to
another be my webinar I'm Fernando and
it's awesome having you guys here again
um and today's webinar we're actually
gonna have Aaron lad age which is a he's
a UI developer and he's gonna be showing
us on how to basically better up front
end and he's gonna be going with us the
post processors and about further ado
I'm gonna let the man speak for himself
and before I could be switch I just want
to remind everyone if you were to have
any questions please do ask them in the
comments section below at the end you
always do check them out and without
further or delay Aaron you have the
screen all right thank you for Nanda and
thank you everyone for coming I will let
you guys see my face here robic my name
is Aaron ledecky my all things a little
unpronounceable and i am a UI engineer
for a company called deg out of Kansas
City Missouri here's my contact info if
anyone would like to look me up as i
mentioned i'm with deg out of Kansas
City and I need to take just a moment to
thank them and recognize them for giving
me the opportunity to speak here DG is
located in Overland Park Kansas just on
the south side of Kansas City we are
basically a full-service consultancy and
agency and we cover everything from web
development to social media to email
marketing to data management pretty much
anything you can think of we can we can
handle we got a quite a bit of notoriety
a few years ago recognized as one of the
25 companies changing the world and that
was based largely on their model of
intrapreneurship this idea of kind of
getting ahead or finding something that
that you can succeed with and running
with it and that's part of the reason
that I'm here today so what I want to
thank them as a Kansas City and I am
contractually obligated to mention our
fantastic barbecue and of course our
beloved Royals they may not be doing
quite as well this year but still got to
give a good shot up for how they did
last year
and I think about 800,000 of my closest
friends would agree with me on that one
ah well I am part of a team you I team
that is a very lucky in the fact that we
get to i always like to say hi /
specialized are you i work is separated
a bit from CMS engineering and we're
able to really sort of hyper specialize
in and get really good at front end
things that make front end-front end
HTML CSS and JavaScript and I'm part of
this lovely team right here I was like
to joke that I'm still working my way up
to a color headshot but hopefully I get
that promotion one of these days and
we're not unlike any other UI team we
all kind of started out here which is
that we all fell in love with front-end
development at some point hopefully for
those of you out there listening can can
relate to that but I think what happens
if you spent any amount of time in front
end is you start to maybe not like it
quite so much anymore and I've been
doing this for a little over 10 years
now I've been a developer for a little
over a decade and I still remember the
first time that I wrote my first line of
CSS and it was something I'm sure very
similar to this which was you know
identify an element on the page by a
class or an ID and then do something as
simple as color red you know something
as simple as applying a color and I just
remember the first time I reloaded the
browser its wow that's that's really
amazing it worked you know just a simple
little text declaration had such a
simple if you know simplistic a powerful
effect on the front end but it didn't
take very long to realize that maybe it
wasn't as simple as it looked on paper
or as I thought it was going to be and
for those of you who have been in this
industry for a little while you might
recognize some of these I wouldn't
recommend them in practice today but if
you had just support any older versions
of browsers you're probably familiar
with things like the star and underscore
hack to get certain things to work in
older versions of browsers and it gets a
little more complex from there as we
start looking at things like vendor
prefixing and things like filters where
it that simple little line of code
turned into something much more monsters
pretty quickly
and then of course there's JavaScript
and this is one of the the oldest known
i guess you could call it bugs in
javascript this will actually evaluate
to true and anybody who's been around
javascript for a while this probably has
probably seen this and they've actually
acknowledged that it is sort of a short
coming in the language but they can't
fix it because it would break webpages
far and wide if they were ever to
attempt it or even something as simple
as you know when you're interacting with
the Dom in JavaScript getting the scroll
position of an element and getting that
to work in a cross cross browser
situation is a lot of times not as
simple as it really should be and so I
think with these languages we think
we're going to get these these great
things I'm CSS and JavaScript and then
what we actually end up getting may not
quite have the appeal that we thought it
did guys look at least one Pokemon go
reference in their right and I think
historically that's that's kind of a led
to this this view of front-end
development is not a real sector of web
development and if you've been routed
while you've probably heard these CSS is
not an actual programming language or
you know javascript is a toy language
and you hear this a lot particularly
from people who have experience with
more traditional programming languages
or back in programming language just a
lot of times and the thing about that
assertion is that they weren't really
wrong there really were a lot of
shortcomings and are a lot of
shortcomings in CSS and JavaScript but I
would like to make the contention that
they're getting a lesson let's write
about that every single day so I think
in order to understand where those
criticisms are coming from we have to
look at what's actually wrong with the
languages so let's take a look at CSS
first so what's what's wrong with that
what's actually wrong with CSS and the
obvious one is cross-browser
compatibility issues for a language that
is specifically designed to make web
pages look pretty it's maddening how
frustrating it is to get things to work
reliably and consistently across Firefox
Chrome Internet Explorer and Safari and
let's go to the other end of that
spectrum and that's the idea of vendor
prefixes and these in a way are a great
thing it's a way for the browser
manufacturers to get out ahead of the
w3c's CSS specs
start implementing things that are maybe
ahead of spec but the problem is as a
developer it creates sort of this
hodgepodge this mesh of vendor prefixes
and rules that we need to apply to our
CSS in order to get them to work on
these sort of future facing features I
always bring this one up because if you
think about it think of another
programming language if you're going to
call CSS a programming language that
doesn't have the concept of a variable
there are very many out there and the
idea of inline importing in general just
CSS out of the box you really need to
write things in one large file if you
are hoping they have any sort of
performance on the front end and of
course you're probably listening and
thinking well there's the import
statement which is been around in CSS
forever and that's correct that is a
form of importing however if you're
using at import at the top of a CSS file
in production you're you're basically
lazy loading in another style sheet in
other words you're causing an extra HTTP
request and hurting the performance of
your website what CSS actually needs is
some way of importing partials into one
file before it is served out to your
production environment and then some
little things like nested selectors and
one thing about CSS is out of the box
it's very very verbose you're going to
spend a lot of time repeating selectors
and parents and those sorts of things to
kind of go with variables the idea of a
function CSS is one of the few languages
that doesn't have any sort of function
built into it no on the fly color
manipulation now obviously you can you
can set colors and now of course you can
use our GPA to do things like opacity
but there's not a great out-of-the-box
solution for manipulating color on the
fly which again for a language that's
specifically designed for design in the
browser it's sort of shocking and this
one has been improved with the calc
solar account property but you can't
even really do basic arithmetic and
again if you're attempting to do fairly
complex layout with CSS not having that
ability is is a challenge so let's talk
for a minute about javascript where is
javascript had these claims of not being
the greatest language for for working in
the web I'm going to split this actually
in two different directions on the one
hand you have how JavaScript behaves in
the browser and how it interacts with
the dumb but then JavaScript of course
is its own standalone language that
doesn't have to interact with the Dom in
any way so I'm going to try to identify
issues across the board here so problems
with javascript in the browser
historically we've seen a lot of this
it's got a very messy ugly syntax that a
lot of people have trouble grasping we
have just like on CSS we have
cross-browser compatibility issues and
this was particularly true in older
versions of Internet Explorer and in
addition to just compatibility issues
not being able to use certain methods or
functions in JavaScript sometimes it's a
performance issue too javascript has
typically been very slow or buggy in
those in those browsers difficulty with
Dom traversal and for again a language
that's designed to interact with the Dom
it's it's sort of shocking how difficult
it is to to go up and down here your
markup hierarchy I'll come back to this
in a bit as sort of a non-issue in
modern times but it is a bit difficult
and has historically been difficult to
do things like effects and animation in
JavaScript there wasn't a great easy
solution and tell affair Lee recently so
then let's talk about the language
itself the big one that I see is
modularity and it kind of goes hand in
hand with the idea of inline importing
and CSS there's not a great way to write
your javascript in small modular single
purpose blocks of code and then have
those either concatenated or bundle
together or at least properly loaded in
a module format without some sort of
third party tool to pull it off and then
I want to get into what I would say is a
lot of syntactic sugar but I don't want
to dismiss syntactic sugar because even
though some of it is just for the
prettiness of your code a lot of us is
very very useful and and has
historically been very lacking in
JavaScript a big one is interpolation or
template strings
the ability to write markup or write
content that you're going to spit out
for example into the Dom without
concatenated together strings with with
your actual JavaScript this is loud in
the browser to using a lot of
third-party libraries like mustache in
order to you know write our markup as
markup but actually work with it in
JavaScript and then again quite a bit of
syntactic sugar here but things like fat
arrow functions streamlining how we're
writing our JavaScript default function
arguments having to inside our functions
right some some basically checks on our
function parameters to see what the
defaults are setting defaults their
class face inheritance I bring up I'll
talk about this with es6 JavaScript but
has historically not had a class-based
inheritance system I would argue that
JavaScript doesn't even necessarily need
this I'm not a class-based expert any by
any means but it historically has like
this things like constants and I would
argue that variable scope is a little
tricky for beginners to understand and
destructuring so we've had these
limitations we've had these shortcomings
in the languages themselves but
developers are a pretty crafty group and
when they find a short coming they
usually find a way around it and they've
been filling in these gaps on CSS and
JavaScript for as long as CSS and
JavaScript have been languages on the
web and in general the solution to this
became preprocessors and preprocessors
have actually been a pretty good
solution to this problem if you were
working on the CSS idea probably
familiar with preprocessors like SAS or
less or to some extent stylist and on
the JavaScript side and I always joke
that this is probably my slide that's
gonna going to piss the most people off
you have preprocessors like coffee
script and then I certainly do not mean
to conflate a coffee script in jquery I
know some coffee scriptures who probably
would not appreciate that being compared
to a jQuery developer but jQuery of
course is not a preprocessor but it is a
runtime library that gives us some of
the benefits of
preprocessor preprocessor in terms of
writing simpler cleaner code and that's
really the only comparison of making
there so what does a typical
preprocessor workflow look like I think
it's important to understand that so
you're usually starting out writing your
code in whatever that preprocessors
proprietary sin taxes I think that's
important to note if you're working in
SAS you are writing SAS code and some of
it may resemble CSS but that syntax
especially when you get into things like
mix-ins and variables is very much
syntax related to sass it is not CSS
you're going to have some sort of task
running process in the middle my team
uses grunt but whether you're on grunt
or golf or broccoli or anything of that
sort for your build process you're
generally listening for changes to your
staffs code and then that code is
compiled at the for runtime so at
development time and standards-based CSS
is what's spit out on the other end and
that's the code that's actually spent
fed to the browser so your SAS code that
you're writing in the beginning is never
going to be exposed to the browser and I
would like to think that is probably
never going to be natively readable by
the browser so in code let's say we have
a row here for example I've got a little
bit and I've got two properties one is
the app include display flex property
and then I'm setting a background color
of dollar sign color blue and that first
property and for anybody who's worked in
SAS is actually a compass mix in that
lets us use flex box and all we have to
do is remember to use that app include
display flex again that's proprietary
syntax that is not the w3c's spec for
writing flexbox but that's how you do in
SAS our or in compensation side and then
background color color blue the dollar
sign in SAS is a variable so we're said
we're assigning a blue color to color
blue and then we can reuse that variable
through our code so about just the basic
concept of variables there so what's
actually output then once our pre our
task runner is listening to this and
compiles that code into CSS is you'll
see those first four line
our vendor prefix so the ad include
actually processes out into the properly
vendor prefixed display flex property so
you'll see the three prefix is there and
then the official spec furs last which
is the proper way to write that and then
background color is converted to the hex
value that my variable is set to and I'm
going to pop into a couple of code
penned examples here for anyone who's
not familiar code Penn dot IO is the
site and I will share my slides
afterwards here so if anybody has any
would like to take a look at it in this
feel free these are going to be pretty
simplistic examples but i just want to
show you some of the things you can do
in code pen and how you would write
these in using sass and compass so
exactly what i said before we're
importing compass first of all we need
to include that library code pen does it
like that you can actually set it up
here so that your preprocessor is SCSS
and i have added in compass i can add it
now because you can see it's already
there but you'll see then i'm able to
use sass and compass within code pin so
i've assigned a color white variable a
color blue variable and then i'm using
those right here and then I do have my
to add include statements here 14
display five flex and 14 justify content
this is a completely unnecessary use of
flex packs but just want to show some
examples of how you can do that so we'll
get into a few more sort of light coding
examples here in a bit on the
CoffeeScript side on JavaScript I was
never a CoffeeScript developer so I
should say that up front but it does
give you some nice conveniences you'll
see that the for instant syntax there
for iterating through an array and
there's a spread operator there and you
also notice syntactically you're able to
do a lot of things that you can't do in
raja the script for example there's
there's way fewer brackets indentation
matters and you'll also notice there
were console logging within the
quotation mark we actually are passing
in that
pound sign and then no I'm inside the
curly brackets and so that's my my
example there of interpreted
interpolation or attempt using template
strings in your JavaScript and so in
CoffeeScript we were able to do this but
what this is going to compile out to in
our build process is something like this
which is basically a pretty standard for
loop and you'll notice the spread
operators go on our brackets are in
place and then if you look at those
console.log statements we're actually
concatenating together strings with
variables using the plus signs and
quotation marks in quotation marks so on
the CoffeeScript side much danger syntax
there I want to talk just briefly about
jQuery again it's not a preprocessor of
course but it does give us a lot of
conveniences and it has a lot of
historical need in JavaScript it was
definitely something that is
particularly in older browsers that
lacked a great JavaScript support it got
us away from doing things like this
which is a document.getelementbyid and
you'll see i'm not using document dot
query selector or query selector all
because a lot of those properties were
not supported and early versions of
browsers than one of the things that was
missing from older versions of ie and
other browsers so we had to do things
like document.getelementbyid a lot more
limiting and it led us in the direction
of jQuery jQuery gave us this very CSS
like syntax much cleaner syntax and a
lot of people really fell in love with
the flexibility that it gave them and
the cleaner code that it gave them not
to mention a better browser support so
everything was a lot better
cross-browser tested and supported but I
think preprocessors really perpetuate a
problem and yes I have practiced saying
that out loud several times that's a
tongue twister we're putting more and
more layers of abstraction between the
code that we're writing as developers
and the code that the browser can
actually read and I want to give some
examples of why I think this is an issue
so preprocessors are their own
programming languages again they have
that proprietary syntax that you have to
write in a lot of times the
preprocessors themselves are written in
non web
languages and for anybody who's
listening and say well Ruby is a web
language technically yet yes of course
it is uh what I what I'm really saying
is it's not a front-end language so it's
a it's a processing tool for people who
know JavaScript typically but it's
written in a language that they don't
necessarily know where understand it
tends to take a very all-or-nothing
approach yes there are ads like compass
and bourbon but in general SAS tends to
give you everything out of the box
whether you actually need to use it or
not not as easily extensible again this
comes back to the non web language thing
it's not as easy for somebody to just
dive in and write a plug-in for SAS as
it is with something i'm going to show
here in a little bit and it must be
compiled today and forever and again
you're writing in this proprietary
syntax so it's highly unlikely but the
browsers are ever going to support SAS
or less out of the box the browsers are
not ever just going to be able to read
that and the browsers are hitching up I
think this is an important thing to keep
in mind preprocessors have been around
for a long time they've solved a lot of
historical problems but I do think it's
important to ask whether those problems
are still as big of issues as they used
to be and we're going to be compiling
our pre-processed could forever so it's
important to think about compile times
and if anybody's worked on a fairly
sizable SAS project particularly the
ruby version SAS not the newer lib SAS
version which has some report
performance enhancements compiled times
can get really really slow there's a
tweet from a gentleman named ben frame
that i really found interesting he said
i'm estimating i'm losing about 16
minutes of productivity a day to my sass
compiles that might seem crazy until you
start thinking okay every time i get
saved on a file that takes approximately
five seconds i might hit save on a file
and go check it in a browser on estimate
two hundred times a day so you know five
seconds x 200 divided by 60 is 16
minutes a day so he's saying obviously
sask lose productivity but compile time
can suck so i won't completely republic
very here but i do want to just mention
it real quickly jquery is a tool for
developers
not users and I've made the statement
when I given this presentation before
and I usually ask people if they can if
I can tell me or identify what benefit
jquery gives to their end users in other
words tell me something that jquery's
but is giving a benefit to the people
visiting your site and I haven't had a
lot of grading answers on that and
that's I think because it definitely
gives us a lot of enhancements as
developers it does help us with
cross-browser compatibility and making
sure that those things are working well
but a lot of that stuff can be solved
without a jquery and so we're putting
this additional burden of loading this
library and framework onto our end users
really for our convenience as developers
Dom traversal something I think
complained about what javascript in the
beginning it really isn't that hard
anymore with vanilla j/s and if you
check out my slides I'll take you out to
a site called you might not need jQuery
com some of you may have seen this
before but this is an excellent resource
for making the jump from jQuery to
vanilla JavaScript if if you're so
inclined you can actually set which
version of ie you still need to support
on your project you'll see some codes
changing down below there and then it
will actually give you on the left
column the jQuery code and then the
vanilla JavaScript equivalent on the
right and I think the thing you'll
notice on some of these in a bit
obviously what's longer because we're
getting new things like effects but if
we're doing you know fairly some simple
things of short things here the code is
fairly equivalent length in terms of how
to work with vanilla JavaScript so
that's a great resource if you have a
chance to check that out the browsers
are getting better and if we're talking
about I you 10 plus and edge obviously
I'm not going to sit in perfect on the
JavaScript side that's very very much
true but they have eliminated a lot of
the cross-browser compatibility issues
that we were using jQuery for in the
first place I mentioned transitions and
animations in the beginning we obviously
have things like canvas WebGL now at our
disposal if we need to do things with
more advanced JavaScript and animations
but really css3 is better suited it is
hardware accelerated and performs a lot
better than JavaScript if you're going
to be doing a lot of heavy duty transit
and animations anyway dependencies suck
it's not much fun to make sure you get
jquery properly loaded and wrote it
loading in the right order particularly
if you're working maybe in a CMS that's
pre-loading maybe a version of jQuery
that you're not comfortable with there's
a lot of different situations where you
know if you've ever seen the dollar sign
is not defined error in your console
you're familiar with the problem with
jQuery is in dependency performance
matters especially in the age of
responsive design and if if you're
loading in additional libraries that you
don't necessarily need to force on to
your users that is guaranteed to her
performance to a certain extent and of
course you get to impress your friends
with your library this street cred you
get to be hipster dev which is always
arguably fun and I also think it raises
an important question which is this
concept of libraries versus languages
and I'd like you just to thank for those
of you that have been around a lot or
have any sort of mentoring role with
junior developers or defs coming to your
company what are we learning and I would
wonder what are we learning attack say
what are we teaching that what our new
developers learning are we teaching them
the fundamental languages that they need
to know or are we just teaching them a
bunch of library student do they know
sass and jQuery or did they know in a
CSS and JavaScript I think that's an
important question so we've talked about
some of the issues of preprocessors
there's got to be a better thing out
there and I just want to give a shout
out to these um as seen on TV actors I
think that there has special special
kind of actor that that we don't see
every day Aaron I must say you're on a
roll with these memes I loaded them up
it's it's it's kind of ruin the morning
here so I had to slip in as many as many
things to keep things interesting as
possible and keep on going and so I I
hopefully made the argument that
preprocessors have their issues so let's
talk about post processors why we're all
here today hopefully and any time I have
this discussion inevitably somebody who
say well isn't it pretty proud isn't
post processor still really just a
preprocessor
and the answer to that is yeah you're
right it absolutely is but it's also
sort of missing the point and I've tried
to sum this up as it's not about when
you're processing your code it's about
what your code is that you're actually
processing and if you're talking about
this on the JavaScript side of things
really transpiler is the more accurate
term and I sort of wish wish that that
would be adopted on the CSS side a
little more too they tend to still say
post-processor but really transpiler I
think is the more accurate term if
you're working in post-processing on the
CSS side of things you probably started
to hear about plugins and tools like Poe
CSS that seems to be the big name out
there and if you're working in the
JavaScript side you are probably
familiar with a tool called Babel used
to be called 625 but they changed their
name because they're trying to look out
beyond just es6 JavaScript and the
product on the right despite the icon is
not an Adobe product it's a tool called
tracer and I believe that is actually
created by google on the JavaScript side
I think you tend to see more people
using Babel but tracer is out there so
just to reiterate our old preprocessor
process again we wrote in our
proprietary sass language we transpile
dit absolutely preprocess it with our
task runner and it spits out CSS like
this so what does a post processor
process look like well the thing you'll
notice is it's not drastically different
except for this first step and that is
we're doing away with this proprietary
syntax of sass we're writing our code in
CSS and so we're following the w3c spec
and we might even be following future
spec and i'll hit more on that in just a
second our task runner which we may
still keep grunt or go up in the mix as
well as post CSS or babel whenever our
tool happens to be your talking CSS or
JavaScript notices or code change and it
still outputs that CSS and JavaScript
that the browser can actually read the
difference again is step one which is
that we're no longer writing into syntax
we're just writing display flex and
we're writing background color and then
we're saying VAR dash dash color blue
and i will talk about my hatred for that
syntax in just a moment here but that is
proposed w3c spec four variables and the
coded outputs is the same thing we got
out of our shower preprocessors but the
big difference is here that we're
writing much simpler cleaner
standards-based code or at least
proposed standards based so some
advantage of post CSS you write CSS and
CSS it shouldn't be something I even
have to say out loud but it's true you
can use CSS 3 with reckless abandon you
don't have to worry as much about vendor
prefixing if you want to use CSS for
which is not an actual thing that link
that will actually take you out to a
post CSS plugin called post CSS
forgotten the name of this CSS next
sorry and this is a plug-in that's
entirely dedicated to using next-gen
proposed CSS standards it works with
your existing task runners you don't
have to remove grunt or go up or
whatever you're using out of your
process it is built on node so we're
talking about a framework that is
entirely built in JavaScript that means
no more bundle files no are no more
bundle no more gin files no more Ruby
dependencies if you don't wanna I think
that makes this easier to debug because
you're working in NPM and JavaScript and
node and you can write your own plugins
and there are tons of them out there
using nothing but javascript arguably
it's much faster in terms of compile
types I say allegedly here because a lot
of these stats are actually coming from
the greater Co CSS while I don't want to
say he's not accurate taken with a
little grain of salt there he says that
post CSS compiles 40 times faster than
Ruby and four times faster than lives
mask I can't back up those stats but I
would say it is noticeably faster than
my Ruby sass experience in the past and
there's countless plugins and I want to
talk about just a minute unlike sasco
CSS is written very modular Lee I like
to think of sass as the all-you-can-eat
Chinese buffet whereas post CSS and i
made this slide before chipotle ran into
a lot of their health scare problems but
i think post ESS is a lot more modular
lets you kind of make your own choices
in it and just choose the options at a
right
you and yeah you can probably still get
everything in chipotle but i would
recommend that so let's say you you're
intrigued by this how do you get started
and then the fact of the matter is you
maybe already have my team actually
start of sort of started down this path
using a plug-in called auto prefix or an
auto prefix ER is interesting because it
can actually function as a standalone
tool or it can actually be used as a
post ESS plug-in we were using SAS for
our mix ins and are under our vendor
prefixing and then we notice this to a
Colorado prefix ER so it is a popular
replacement for compass it automatically
adds the css3 vendor proper vendor
prefixes for you which i showed you
define your browser support yourself so
it's not based on whatever version of
compass or sash are using its defined in
a config file and then that also cross
references can I use com database to
determine what vendor prefixes are
actually needed for the browsers that
you can say no more memorizing special
function names there's no add include
you just write display flex for example
and flexbox magically starts working i
am going to this is my old example here
and i want to show you in code pin how
you can swap this out pretty simply code
pin does have post CSS processing built
into it you because it's module you do
need to add in stuff that you want to
use i'm going to add in oops don't worry
is that i'm going to add in nested and
actually i just realize they don't have
the one plug in here that I need to show
so I'm a PI make shorten this demo just
a little bit if you can pretend with me
in real JavaScript I'm sorry in real
post ESS you would not have to use these
at use but this is how code ven does it
clean this up here just a little bit I
can't do it quite and I think I'm
actually going to skip my code demo here
but i'll i'll change the display
properties real quick display flex would
look like this and instead of saying add
in creep if my confident i would just
say
justify content center so in those
examples I'm just writing native flexbox
and it would just start working although
it's not working for me at the moment
I'm gonna head I'm gonna skip my my very
simple code code example there so again
post at auto prefix ER as part of a much
larger PO CSS ecosystem there are as you
saw in the code pin lista there's they
only have a fraction of what's out there
if you come out to post CSS top parts
there's actually a complete list of all
of the post CSS plugins that are out
there and there are many many many of
them in lots of different categories
that you can see here I want to talk
through just a couple that my team uses
if you are familiar with the concept of
partials are globbing again being able
to write any simple little files you can
do that with post CSS and we use a
plenary called Pro CSS import or
partials the concept of globbing in
other words just sort of watching
instead of directories and having your
files concatenate together there's
plugin called grunts ass clapping that
where you're using back in our last days
and we're still using it today and works
just fine with po CSS nesting this is a
little controversial particularly a tend
to write these concatenation rules that
actually add list wrap on to primary now
in this example here but writing these
nested selectors so you don't have to
write primary naf over and over and over
again it's completely possible with a
plugin called cosiest as nested there's
another one called Croesus as nesting
that follows a w3c proposal we have not
made that jump yet but it is out there
there is that proposed standard is still
an editor's draft that's one reason we
haven't made switch way yet is because
the standard is just not quite there yet
again just like SAS just because you can
do something doesn't mean you
necessarily should do that so keep that
in mind if you're doing a lot of nesting
I'm going to go through these plugins
kind of quickly here some a little
running a little behind on time
variables again the Sifl little idea of
setting something once and then being
able
reuse it over and over again there's a
plug-in out there called post CSS custom
properties and it's a really good
opportunity to start using what I think
is one of the ugliest sin taxes I've
ever seen but it is the w3c's way of
doing things the way you do this as you
declare for right now you can only do
this on route but you declare a route
variable in this case I set color blue
with that dash dash and then when I want
to use it on a Nolan I just say
background color and I say far and then
dash dash variable II so it's a little
ugly the good news is that this is going
to be the standard and at some point
it's going to let us do something really
powerful which is not scoping to route
but actually scoping to individual
components and that's going to give us a
lot of additional power in CSS the
flexibility so that day is coming soon
but it's not quite supported yet custom
properties are already supported
natively in Firefox Chrome and Safari so
this is a good example of a post CSS
tool that might someday be able to be
eliminated from our workflow which is
just work if you're in a SAS environment
and you just are loaded up with a ton of
dollar sign variables you don't want to
go through and rewrite your code there's
a plugin i notice it was actually out on
the code pin called post CSS simple bars
that let you keep the dollar sign style
variable so that options still there
color again we haven't been able to do a
lot on the fly with color with CSS
before but those days are coming and
there is a color module spec that
actually has shifted a little bit pretty
recently but I'm still going to make the
recommendation that we do kind of what
I'm showing here although the spec mate
might slip shift just lately the
proposed come respect is going to let us
work in all kinds of new sin taxes and
you can do this with a post CSS plug in
the one I would recommend is called post
ESS color and here's the things you can
do with it so we can say element color
and then there's our hex value and then
we could take this color function you'll
see it right here and we pass a hex
value into it and then we use tint if
you're familiar with lightning and
darken in sassed tint and shade are
going to be your equivalents so you'll
see this is a 40-percent tinting of
this route hex value again shade will
darken that up forty percent and then we
can start combining these things so we
can take our variables and so we can
assign them to color blue and we can
start making pallets so we can take
color blue as a variable and then we can
pass that in as a new variable into a
new variable called color blue light or
color blue dark and actually set up
entire palettes and of course then we
can start mapping variables to variables
where we're saying things like color
text or color text light and that's map
to color blue and color that color text
lightest color text tinted and color
text darkened and where this starts to
get really cool is your boss come
students as used to love the blue color
scheme but now I want orange I'm
oversimplifying obviously here but
that's as simple as changing one
variable so suddenly we just change it
to color orange and our site and our
styles and our color palette can can
cascade down and change on the fly again
this is all pre-processed or post
processed at the moment but once the
spec is actually establish this is the
kind of thing that can be changed on the
fly mixings i'll be honest i consent
does this a little bit better we do use
a plug-in called PO CSS mix-ins and
there's another one called postseasons
calc little do some simple rhythmic to
arithmetic for you if that's why you
need but i would make the argument that
if you're using a lot of mix-ins you
might want to take a look at whether
your report flow is actually more
complicated than it needs to be and if
you've ever walked into somebody else's
project where they've used an extensive
amount of mix-ins you probably know what
i'm talking about there and it's this
idea that someday we might actually be
able to turn off our transpires and our
next gen code could just work variables
is really good example of that let's not
kid ourselves though I think there's
always going to be a need for a
processor I'm not in any way trying to
argue that processors or transpiler will
ever be completely cut out because I
think there's always going to be a spec
that we're hoping will be available in
all the browsers and it's always going
to be something that we want to do
that's just not quite there yet so
there's always going to be a need for
transpires but what I like about these
modular approaches is you can kind of
pick and choose what you need
what you need now and then change that
up pretty easily so i'm going to talk
real quickly about javascript and I am
pushing a little bit on time here so I'm
gonna have to rush this just a little
bit to have time for Q&amp;amp;A anybody that's
conscious but I want talk JavaScript
real quick if you haven't heard es6 has
been approved at echamos script
international or echo sorry Ahmed
international the organization that sets
the standard for JavaScript has ratified
es 6 the latest version of java script
but of course it's not fully implemented
in all browsers yet and we of course
always have to support older browsers
but I wanted to bring up this list a lot
of this again being syntactic sugar but
we do have these things that we always
wanted a JavaScript es6 fixes a lot of
that and we can already write it today
using these tools like babel we can use
our we can write our code like this so
that top line is a model basically es6
module format so we can just say import
this module from this location and then
we can do things like constants you know
variables that don't change state there
you know basically immutable we can use
left with just a new block level scoping
of variables and we can do this
particular one which I really like this
template string down here you'll see I'm
just have these back ticks and I'm
saying this is amazing it's a multi-line
string I'm just hitting enter there I
don't have to do any concatenation and
our default text is and then I'm pulling
in this constant and you'll see I'm
doing that with this dollar sign curly
brackets which is similar to the
CoffeeScript pound sign but I'm able to
pull it in like that and then maybe i
need this module to be available to
other modules so i can actually export
it with the es6 module format for
exporting so that's export default and
then I'm just exporting my function name
there and babbles going to transpile
this doesn't quite fit in my screen to
this and a few things i'm not going to
date entirely through this but one thing
what you see is find it here it's
formatted this using a require like
syntax so you could use something like
required is for loading this in
my my constant is now a far since vars
can be read natively in current browsers
and template string is an interesting
bit of code there you'll see that it's
actually done the concatenation for me
so this is amazing it's a multi-line
string our default text is and there
you'll see it is doing the concatenation
so I was able to write it in this format
but the code I'm getting out is this
this is five code that will actually run
in modern browsers I'm gonna
unfortunately have to skip my my current
example there so real quickly I want to
highlight just where we're going with
JavaScript the great thing is modules
are now in reality the problem is module
loading is not es6 does outline what a
module format should look like but it
doesn't yet give us a built-in browser
native way of loading postals that's the
unfortunate thing of es6 I think we have
been using javascript loaders for years
in the forms of things like requirejs or
a lot of homegrown solutions I think
you're seeing a big move right now in
the industry towards webpack as a
JavaScript loader and it can play very
nicely with es6 format browserify is
also quite popular and you'll see these
these modules formatted in coming out of
battle in a variety of different module
formats my team action took the approach
of going with system j s which is i want
to talk about just real briefly system
is actually built on top of an es6
module loader polyfill it's very small
15k where 10 i ate works on the note
side it actually loads es6 module but
also load any of those other JavaScript
module formats that we've been using for
years and it works flawlessly with
another project thats related which is
JSP mjf am stands for javascript package
manager and it's a built-in package
manager for system you can use it with
any registry so it can be an p.m. or
github they can be basically just any
registry that's any module that's posted
out somewhere on the web and what where
it has a bit of an advantage over just
using NPM directly is that it takes care
of dependency management for you
if you have a module that's depending on
a certain version of another module
it'll automatically make sure it pulls
down the version that you need of that
dependency and it also automatically
configures the loader for you so
everything is automatically configure
you don't have to think about it at all
during development it trans piles in the
browser of runtime so it uses a runtime
version of Babel so you're not waiting
for compile times and then in a
production environment you can actually
output the transpile bundles
automatically so it does that ahead of
time very easy to use JVM you just do a
JSP a minute to start a project and then
you just say Jace p.m. install from
where you want to go get a sub github
and then the account of the repo and
James peace JPM excels actually keeps a
huge huge ilyas I think there's over 800
items on this website of format model
format and code that you can use with
the simple JSP em command line to
install it and my company actually
created our just to show you how
flexible JSP m and system is we have
actually created our own github account
called de gjs which is a small
collection of sort of small JavaScript
modules that we can pull in for our
projects and this is publicly accessible
but we can pull into our own projects
with just a JSP and install from this
account so just to recap real quickly
preprocessors we're great in the time
they were around they saved us from a
lot of limitations of our two languages
that we used to to know and love and
from the brokenness of using into the
browser the good news is those days are
just about behind behind us I think CSS
and JavaScript are advancing at a pretty
lightning pace right now because
processing is still important these
modular process post processors like
post CSS let us really write this real
code again which is just amazing and
it's a great feeling to get back to
writing to CSS and it's bleeding edge
CSS without feeling like we're
compromising our browser support and
then on the JavaScript side these
transpiler is like Babel and these
module loader systems they really let us
write this really succinct single
purpose small clean reusable
code and have it worked great in the
browser so if I can summarize it all
here would just be to say that I think
it's time to fall in love with front-end
code all over again that's all I got so
thank you guys for this thing i'll leave
the slide up for a minute for anybody
who wants to pull down the slides but i
am ready for questions if anyone has any
ah perfect thank you very much Aaron um
we said spot on with the memes
destination very interesting and your
perspective of Midland using processors
as for portions i think you know I
actually think nobody has asking
questions so this is perfect I usually
means everything got played out very
well um to everyone else to people that
are watching this later on this day if
you do have any questions please do feel
free to email me yeah I will be happy to
email some of them to Aaron if he ever
has I can actually answer them via
himself for myself and yeah it's there
any questions perfect you guys know
exploiter or you guys can email me which
I will fast forward to them as always we
always update our YouTube so we always
check for people who ask these questions
after and without further say I just
want to see it again big thank you to
Aaron and his group for letting us
actually and that's pretty early for
them so thank you for taking the time
out and to everyone else thank you for
coming and yeah Matt oven awesome days
