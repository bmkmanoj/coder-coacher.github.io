leave it as we do so we can start okay
thank you I have money my name is
Michael I beg resins and as such I wrote
with interactive systems and some we're
excited to show you very interactive
system today the system is be my party
that's baby socializing sounds you get
those people shaking it turns your cue
enabled home into an interactive body's
own it's like a week for your party and
so is that parties I mean may not bet
Beverly the problem is that party
nobody's dancing so what can we do the
solution obviously include skills that's
one day in today so take mobile here's
one tech TV set-top box light Q&amp;amp;A old
stereo and be my body up that's the most
important part and with that to get
crowded and doors more fun at your party
and I'm sure how that works here I have
an android device running to you and I
mind funnier when I start the other you
see here and my host we
metal box that the mobile connects to my
screen and here until I you can choose
color and on Jill and now here the
motion sensor is connected to the party
system and controls the light we also
have room lights which are connected
here in Jean years of the light in the
room will change according to them
people setting a boy so now we have
second-guessed is also having the new
ammonia going dead King guess is my
brother thread and now you're dancing
and you can see here that the lights
armies so away commenting it's yellow is
only one dance again thread gotta
dancing it speeds right pedal no it's
I'm music oh its nest right so DC just
what is your moment we are little
fantastic and what you see then do we
get over some level unbox third light
effects so if you're higher you see that
the phone starts flashing in the rhythm
of your dancing so there's a little
detection in the phone if don't give me
more iron will turn to put in taxi light
show and and it's like the it's like a
lighter at party at the event so yes I
up and buy the song by the way this long
as and so what we do we save our
pop it's hot we can read a party music
swimming cross-strait on the next song
so you can influence the party
people downloading the party in support
yeah cosplay as well tell me about seven
nothing you can do is you can upload
party XD certain zones like today but so
like music market to market starting to
say oh it's soft here goes up even a
number ten
you can upload the 20s to get a light
hair imagine that there are some
possibilities who have different effects
integrated I can train later and we're
working to the composer to get some
music effects like during the dancing
which I integrated based on the rhythm
in which people are dancing so all that
is worth technology as you've seen that
there's fewer in theater but to settle
box let's connect to TV we have the
discipline zones running the gas em
where lies under the stereo connect so
let's take multi set up business most
important a target markets we have to
target markets both share the same yes
that and that's nice because you get a
network effect from one or the other
market people may already have the gas F
on the phone and they can usually most
nervous guess that is good at all you
don't know virtualdj like jf the whose
burned into your set-top box its premium
model or upper 50s or whatever marketing
will decide and by women in purchases we
can affect additional levels so
important a comp or devices that you buy
a better that form so let's also
marketing channel and you have the same
profession entertainment area where it
borrows to create school whatever they
can't afford DJ
so I was really because I saw it through
hang out Congrats I can you leave it
alone I programmed it alone yeah we had
we have four people and the team maybe
was connected back to that psycho tech
premiership first about my heart I
didn't I mean that we have to stop the
business rationale behind it we had time
on whos the composer which will both for
the music effects and
Tom play stuff and with Manila Luzon
engineer who did some lessons testing
user tests iJustine of the things are
are stable lady software to go for
everything up yeah the party's we bet
nobody's dancing you can upload your
changes giving you think I do not know
if you can change the music and of
course I think nobody wants to dance
can't force them but if there is a
certain amount of people say who is
already active and you see that is you
get it is lighter which is better than
sorry only two so you have to visit the
night it is it let us help you that
everybody is in the same Wi-Fi network
oh yeah is two strings upon dissolution
signature
principal will be possible to do not in
the same network but problem menace
latency is so the question is if you
want to add something super nice music
that's by the way I filled with the
detection on it so it's not so let me
then transmitted with beats per minute
and the end the end timing and then some
legacy of that problem because you just
translate on the on the homepage slider
translate as long as per minute back to
the 22 to the dancing so legacy is going
to networks so for that then we'll be on
the same but we have a deer's how to do
that started implementing it do you
foresee how to make their physical
devices that we never done so nice thing
is you don't need 20 I mean you need to
divide it but you don't need any special
devices so that that's an HTML which
could run on your web so that's
completely as your arms me out here we
have native Android which runs on any
Android for bed and then connects to
your life Soviet intelligence is small
inner life so we will work with every
light which supports a certain interface
or a light standard so the nice thing is
that you don't
so that beginning I mean very long as
cutting at that last event so I'm tender
words with my contacts so biggest thing
was to get these on fire that was a bit
tricky but once it was running it was
really easy so at the end brightly in
features like all the song
synchronization that you see the written
detection that followed it last night so
once you you you are you stirred it's
really easy so it give the meander each
other as you know processing it's a job
framework and I brought myself using
some some libraries so Jeff at cross
fading or because it's something that
knows
yeah it depends I mean what what kind of
show you want to just give something to
a CD player which has enabled like you
on web internet you can use that one but
if you want special effects like hating
that we did here of course you need
players to support that and that could
be some proper credit or whatever and
they're going to picture something like
that such as the functionality and you
can use it otherwise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
